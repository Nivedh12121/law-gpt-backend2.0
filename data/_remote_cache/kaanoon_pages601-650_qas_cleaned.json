Further, the district of land has been changed, and you wish to know which district to include as the address in the Special Power of Attorney. Herein, when a district changes, due to certain administrative reasons, it is important that the land records related to the district are also updated. Therefore, usually, the address must reflect the present district name, where the property is located, i.e., the changed name. With respect to drafting of such document, this new address would be relevant for the relevant authority to oversee any legal procedures related to the property. With respect to the registration process, if your Special Power of Attorney is intended to be registered for property transactions, it may need to be registered at the local sub-registrar's office, for which the new district's name is necessary.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Gift deed revocation",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, your mother received a property through a gift deed from her father in 2006. Thereafter, the property was used by your mother as collateral for mortgages. However, subsequently, in 2016, after your grandfather became mentally unstable, his son revoked the gift deed without your consent. This revocation happened unilaterally, and you were not informed by the registration office about the same. Further, in the government records, your family’s name is seemed to be considered as the rightful owners of the property. However, you contend that, your grandfather's son has created a will, and used your grandfather’s thumbprint to claim for possession of the property. Herein, under the Indian law, a gift deed usually, when registered, would be irrevocable except under certain exceptional circumstances. Hence, a revocation unilaterally, would be invalid. Further, the will alleged to be created, would be invalid under the Indian Succession Act. Additionally, police may not be able to interfere in your right to property, unless there is a court order for the same. Hence, it is suggested that, you may challenge the validity of the will, file a suit for contesting the revocation of the gift deed, seek any interim reliefs from the court, file a criminal complaint for fraud and forgery, and approach the relevant authorities, including the court, for the same.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Gift deed revocation",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, your mother received a property through a gift deed from her father in 2006. Thereafter, the property was used by your mother as collateral for mortgages. However, subsequently, in 2016, after your grandfather became mentally unstable, his son revoked the gift deed without your consent. This revocation happened unilaterally, and you were not informed by the registration office about the same. Further, in the government records, your family’s name is seemed to be considered as the rightful owners of the property. However, you contend that, your grandfather's son has created a will, and used your grandfather’s thumbprint to claim for possession of the property. Herein, under the Indian law, a gift deed usually, when registered, would be irrevocable except under certain exceptional circumstances. Hence, a revocation unilaterally, would be invalid. Further, the will alleged to be created, would be invalid under the Indian Succession Act. Additionally, police may not be able to interfere in your right to property, unless there is a court order for the same. Hence, it is suggested that, you may challenge the validity of the will, file a suit for contesting the revocation of the gift deed, seek any interim reliefs from the court, file a criminal complaint for fraud and forgery, and approach the relevant authorities, including the court, for the same.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you are 60 years old, and was married in 1980, in Karnataka. Your father had 2 plots of agricultural land, ancestral in nature. In 1994, your father gifted Plot-1 to your brother, and Plot-2 to you, by changing the owner's name in the RTC Document. However, there is no will or partition deed for the same. Your brother sold Plot-1 after death of your father. Now, your brother claims that, he has a right in Plot-2 as well, citing the reason that Plot-2 is not registered on your name. Herein, firstly, your brother's claim may not be valid, because, your father had gifted Plot-2 to you, and had changed the owner's name, thus making a strong claim for you. Further, the absence of a will or partition deed means that the property would be divided according to the Hindu Succession laws. However, since it was gifted to you, it would be your separate property. With respect to counter claiming of rights, since Plot 1 was gifted to your brother, he is the owner of the same. However, if he assets an ownership over Plot-2, you may also claim over Plot-1. The marital status of a person and the year of marriage does not generally play a role or have a direct impact on your rights of ancestral property.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Gift deed revocation",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, your mother received a property through a gift deed from her father in 2006. Thereafter, the property was used by your mother as collateral for mortgages. However, subsequently, in 2016, after your grandfather became mentally unstable, his son revoked the gift deed without your consent. This revocation happened unilaterally, and you were not informed by the registration office about the same. Further, in the government records, your family’s name is seemed to be considered as the rightful owners of the property. However, you contend that, your grandfather's son has created a will, and used your grandfather’s thumbprint to claim for possession of the property. Herein, under the Indian law, a gift deed usually, when registered, would be irrevocable except under certain exceptional circumstances. Hence, a revocation unilaterally, would be invalid. Further, the will alleged to be created, would be invalid under the Indian Succession Act. Additionally, police may not be able to interfere in your right to property, unless there is a court order for the same. Hence, it is suggested that, you may challenge the validity of the will, file a suit for contesting the revocation of the gift deed, seek any interim reliefs from the court, file a criminal complaint for fraud and forgery, and approach the relevant authorities, including the court, for the same.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you are 60 years old, and was married in 1980, in Karnataka. Your father had 2 plots of agricultural land, ancestral in nature. In 1994, your father gifted Plot-1 to your brother, and Plot-2 to you, by changing the owner's name in the RTC Document. However, there is no will or partition deed for the same. Your brother sold Plot-1 after death of your father. Now, your brother claims that, he has a right in Plot-2 as well, citing the reason that Plot-2 is not registered on your name. Herein, firstly, your brother's claim may not be valid, because, your father had gifted Plot-2 to you, and had changed the owner's name, thus making a strong claim for you. Further, the absence of a will or partition deed means that the property would be divided according to the Hindu Succession laws. However, since it was gifted to you, it would be your separate property. With respect to counter claiming of rights, since Plot 1 was gifted to your brother, he is the owner of the same. However, if he assets an ownership over Plot-2, you may also claim over Plot-1.

Your brother’s sale of Plot-1 before the 2005 HSA amendment may limit your counterclaim, as the law then didn’t grant daughters equal rights. However, your documented ownership and tax payments reinforce your position over Plot-2. Consult a lawyer for a possible legal notice to affirm your claim."

    "answer": "Sale Deed: If your brother is selling his share to you, a sale deed is the most straightforward approach. However, since this is inherited property, it's important to confirm if your brother’s wife has any claim, as some states require the spouse's consent even for inherited property. This depends on local property laws, so consult a local property lawyer to confirm if her signature is necessary.Gift Deed: If your brother is willing to transfer his share as a gift, this is another option, and it could bypass any potential claims by his wife if she has no legal interest in the property. However, the gift deed should be registered and notarized properly to prevent future disputes.Relinquishment Deed: This is often used among family members to transfer rights in joint property. Your brother can relinquish his share in your favor, but check if this will require his wife’s consent based on state-specific laws regarding inherited property.To Minimize Future Challenges:Confirm with a lawyer whether your brother’s wife has any claim under your state’s inheritance laws.Ensure the deed, whichever you choose, is registered officially to establish legal ownership clearly.If required, include your brother's wife's signature to prevent any future claims.Sale Deed: If your brother is selling his share to you, a sale deed is the most straightforward approach.

    "question": "Purchasing inherited joint property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you and your brother are joint owners of an inherited agricultural farm land of 4 acres in total. Your brother had agreed to sell his share to you as well. However, your brother's wife is neither living with him, nor divorced. Herein, firstly, with respect to her signature for registration of the property, usually, when the property is inherited and if your brother's spouse is still legally married to him, his spouse may have a claim for the same, and hence, her signature may be necessary so that she may not be able to challenge the same at a future date. Secondly, usually sale deed is considered as the common way of transferring property and involves a transaction wherein your brother receives a compensation for his share of property. Relinquishment deed is another method, which is used when one of the co-owners gives up their share without a consideration. Gift deed is another method, wherein, your brother may gift his share of property to you, without involving any monetary consideration. However, if your brother is willing to relinquish his rights to you, without involving any payment, relinquishment deed may be suggested, but if a compensation is involved, a sale deed with his wife's signature would be suggested.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Gift deed revocation",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, your mother received a property through a gift deed from her father in 2006. Thereafter, the property was used by your mother as collateral for mortgages. However, subsequently, in 2016, after your grandfather became mentally unstable, his son revoked the gift deed without your consent. This revocation happened unilaterally, and you were not informed by the registration office about the same. Further, in the government records, your family’s name is seemed to be considered as the rightful owners of the property. However, you contend that, your grandfather's son has created a will, and used your grandfather’s thumbprint to claim for possession of the property. Herein, under the Indian law, a gift deed usually, when registered, would be irrevocable except under certain exceptional circumstances. Hence, a revocation unilaterally, would be invalid. Further, the will alleged to be created, would be invalid under the Indian Succession Act. Additionally, police may not be able to interfere in your right to property, unless there is a court order for the same. Hence, it is suggested that, you may challenge the validity of the will, file a suit for contesting the revocation of the gift deed, seek any interim reliefs from the court, file a criminal complaint for fraud and forgery, and approach the relevant authorities, including the court, for the same.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you are 60 years old, and was married in 1980, in Karnataka. Your father had 2 plots of agricultural land, ancestral in nature. In 1994, your father gifted Plot-1 to your brother, and Plot-2 to you, by changing the owner's name in the RTC Document. However, there is no will or partition deed for the same. Your brother sold Plot-1 after death of your father. Now, your brother claims that, he has a right in Plot-2 as well, citing the reason that Plot-2 is not registered on your name. Herein, firstly, your brother's claim may not be valid, because, your father had gifted Plot-2 to you, and had changed the owner's name, thus making a strong claim for you. Further, the absence of a will or partition deed means that the property would be divided according to the Hindu Succession laws. However, since it was gifted to you, it would be your separate property. With respect to counter claiming of rights, since Plot 1 was gifted to your brother, he is the owner of the same. However, if he assets an ownership over Plot-2, you may also claim over Plot-1. The marital status of a person and the year of marriage does not generally play a role or have a direct impact on your rights of ancestral property.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Since the RTC lists you as the owner of Plot-2 and you have consistently paid taxes on it since 1994, this strongly supports your claim. Your brother’s sale of Plot-1 before the 2005 HSA amendment may limit your counterclaim, as the law then didn’t grant daughters equal rights. However, your documented ownership and tax payments reinforce your position over Plot-2. Consult a lawyer for a possible legal notice to affirm your claim."

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, your mother received a property through a gift deed from her father in 2006. Thereafter, the property was used by your mother as collateral for mortgages. However, subsequently, in 2016, after your grandfather became mentally unstable, his son revoked the gift deed without your consent. This revocation happened unilaterally, and you were not informed by the registration office about the same. Further, in the government records, your family’s name is seemed to be considered as the rightful owners of the property. However, you contend that, your grandfather's son has created a will, and used your grandfather’s thumbprint to claim for possession of the property. Herein, under the Indian law, a gift deed usually, when registered, would be irrevocable except under certain exceptional circumstances. Hence, a revocation unilaterally, would be invalid. Further, the will alleged to be created, would be invalid under the Indian Succession Act. Additionally, police may not be able to interfere in your right to property, unless there is a court order for the same. Hence, it is suggested that, you may challenge the validity of the will, file a suit for contesting the revocation of the gift deed, seek any interim reliefs from the court, file a criminal complaint for fraud and forgery, and approach the relevant authorities, including the court, for the same.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Since the document certifies a long-term disability, it should suffice for pension claims. However, if there's any resistance, you may consult a lawyer and, if needed, approach the court to allow using the old certificate.Need for Annual Certification: Usually, a one-time disability certificate is sufficient, especially if it indicates a permanent condition like schizophrenia. It is rare to need yearly documentation unless specifically requested by the pension office.To proceed, make sure the 1990 certificate and any other required documents are submitted to the relevant pension office."

    "question": "Sale of property in the name of deceased father",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, your father purchased a flat in Chennai, in 1996. Upon his demise, in 2001, you, your mother, your sister, and your paternal grandmother, had become the legal heirs and further, you have a legal heir certificate issued for the same. Your grandmother passed away few years later, and her death certificate is also available. The flat continues to be in her father's name till today, and all property taxes are being paid by you. You now wish to sell the property, and share the proceeds between your mother, sister and yourself. Herein, as the surviving legal heirs, you may sell the property directly to a buyer without transferring the title to any one of you. However, it is significant that, you ensure all the legal heirs are in agreement for the same. For this, you would require a NOC, and a legal heir certificate as well. With respect to structuring the sale, you may go for a direct sale, but would incur capital gains tax on the sale proceeds you earn. Further, if you choose to make the sale as a gift from your mother and your sister, you may incur tax if the proceeds are more than Rs. 50,000.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Secondly, usually sale deed is considered as the common way of transferring property and involves a transaction wherein your brother receives a compensation for his share of property. Relinquishment deed is another method, which is used when one of the co-owners gives up their share without a consideration. Gift deed is another method, wherein, your brother may gift his share of property to you, without involving any monetary consideration.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, your father purchased a flat in Chennai, in 1996. Upon his demise, in 2001, you, your mother, your sister, and your paternal grandmother, had become the legal heirs and further, you have a legal heir certificate issued for the same. Your grandmother passed away few years later, and her death certificate is also available. The flat continues to be in her father's name till today, and all property taxes are being paid by you. You now wish to sell the property, and share the proceeds between your mother, sister and yourself. Herein, as the surviving legal heirs, you may sell the property directly to a buyer without transferring the title to any one of you. However, it is significant that, you ensure all the legal heirs are in agreement for the same. For this, you would require a NOC, and a legal heir certificate as well. With respect to structuring the sale, you may go for a direct sale, but would incur capital gains tax on the sale proceeds you earn. Further, if you choose to make the sale as a gift from your mother and your sister, you may incur tax if the proceeds are more than Rs. 50,000.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Sale Deed: If your brother is selling his share to you, a sale deed is the most straightforward approach. However, since this is inherited property, it's important to confirm if your brother’s wife has any claim, as some states require the spouse's consent even for inherited property. This depends on local property laws, so consult a local property lawyer to confirm if her signature is necessary.Gift Deed: If your brother is willing to transfer his share as a gift, this is another option, and it could bypass any potential claims by his wife if she has no legal interest in the property. However, the gift deed should be registered and notarized properly to prevent future disputes.Relinquishment Deed: This is often used among family members to transfer rights in joint property. Your brother can relinquish his share in your favor, but check if this will require his wife’s consent based on state-specific laws regarding inherited property.To Minimize Future Challenges:Confirm with a lawyer whether your brother’s wife has any claim under your state’s inheritance laws.Ensure the deed, whichever you choose, is registered officially to establish legal ownership clearly.If required, include your brother's wife's signature to prevent any future claims.Sale Deed: If your brother is selling his share to you, a sale deed is the most straightforward approach.

This depends on local property laws, so consult a local property lawyer to confirm if her signature is necessary.Gift Deed: If your brother is willing to transfer his share as a gift, this is another option, and it could bypass any potential claims by his wife if she has no legal interest in the property. However, the gift deed should be registered and notarized properly to prevent future disputes.Relinquishment Deed: This is often used among family members to transfer rights in joint property. Your brother can relinquish his share in your favor, but check if this will require his wife’s consent based on state-specific laws regarding inherited property.To Minimize Future Challenges:Confirm with a lawyer whether your brother’s wife has any claim under your state’s inheritance laws.Ensure the deed, whichever you choose, is registered officially to establish legal ownership clearly.If required, include your brother's wife's signature to prevent any future claims.Shubham GoyalAdvocate, Delhi1186 Answers7 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shubham Goyal"

    "question": "Purchasing inherited joint property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you and your brother are joint owners of an inherited agricultural farm land of 4 acres in total. Your brother had agreed to sell his share to you as well. However, your brother's wife is neither living with him, nor divorced. Herein, firstly, with respect to her signature for registration of the property, usually, when the property is inherited and if your brother's spouse is still legally married to him, his spouse may have a claim for the same, and hence, her signature may be necessary so that she may not be able to challenge the same at a future date. Secondly, usually sale deed is considered as the common way of transferring property and involves a transaction wherein your brother receives a compensation for his share of property. Relinquishment deed is another method, which is used when one of the co-owners gives up their share without a consideration. Gift deed is another method, wherein, your brother may gift his share of property to you, without involving any monetary consideration. However, if your brother is willing to relinquish his rights to you, without involving any payment, relinquishment deed may be suggested, but if a compensation is involved, a sale deed with his wife's signature would be suggested.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Taking into consideration the provisions of BNS and BNSS, firstly, you may file a bail application wherein, the court may grant bail unless the other party shows that there is a risk or serious charges which necessitates keeping your husband in custody. However, the health reasons of your husband may be a valid stance to argue upon. Additionally, if you are able to prove that your husband was unaware of the transaction being fraudulent, and him acting upon good faith, this may be a good stance to argue. Therefore, it is suggested that, all the necessary documentation is collected, and you may file for an anticipatory bail, if you fear arrest as well.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Purchasing inherited joint property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you and your brother are joint owners of an inherited agricultural farm land of 4 acres in total. Your brother had agreed to sell his share to you as well. However, your brother's wife is neither living with him, nor divorced. Herein, firstly, with respect to her signature for registration of the property, usually, when the property is inherited and if your brother's spouse is still legally married to him, his spouse may have a claim for the same, and hence, her signature may be necessary so that she may not be able to challenge the same at a future date. Secondly, usually sale deed is considered as the common way of transferring property and involves a transaction wherein your brother receives a compensation for his share of property. Relinquishment deed is another method, which is used when one of the co-owners gives up their share without a consideration. Gift deed is another method, wherein, your brother may gift his share of property to you, without involving any monetary consideration. However, if your brother is willing to relinquish his rights to you, without involving any payment, relinquishment deed may be suggested, but if a compensation is involved, a sale deed with his wife's signature would be suggested.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This decree was with respect to a mutual property exchange, between you and your father, involving two properties. You were minor at that time, and your father was not able to register the decree within the stipulated time. After 23 years, now, the decree has still remained unregistered, and your father has passed away, on Jan. 9, 2023. The sub-registrar's office has informed you, that you need a current dated court decree for proceeding with the registration. Herein, with respect to applying for a current dated court decree, you will have to file a petition with the same Subordinate Judge Court at Erode, who had issued the original decree. Since the decree remained unregistered, through the filing of petition, you may seek for restoration of the court decree. Secondly, with respect to applying, you must apply to the Subordinate Judge Court in Erode, and may not be necessary to approach the Madras High Court, unless high court's intervention may be required. Thirdly, since your father has passed away, the legal heirs of your father would be involved in the process. Such heirs' consent would be necessary for a new decree or proceeding with the registration. Fourthly, if the other legal heirs fail to cooperate, you may file a suit for partition, or even apply for a certificate of succession, that would aid you in establishing the stance of your entitlement to the property.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Right to park in own society after giving flat on rent",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. The Maharashtra state cooperative appellate court has recently observed that a tenant or a leave and license holder have the right to park their car in the space allotted to a member on the society premises. Furthermore in 2010-11, builders attempted to sell parking spaces as separate units, but the Bombay High Court ruled that parking space is a component of common facilities. The Supreme Court upheld this decision, making it part of parking regulations in India’s residential areas. Following the 2010-11 Nahalchand Laloochand Pvt Ltd vs Panchali Cooperative Housing Society case, it is illegal for a builder to sell parking units to non-society buyers or residents as separate real-estate units. Allotment of parking space is an administrative function, and the Managing Committee and General Body are authorized to allot parking space to registered members, including family and associate members.In the present case, you have already issued a written representation through lawyer and other side haven’t responded yet nor have acceded to your warning. Therefore, you have to now file formal legal proceedings in Court for appropriate relief(s) including temporary/permanent injunction along with prayer to take action against the office bearers. Thus, an injunction is a specific legal order of the court issued to prevent a wrongful act or the commencement of a wrongful act until the disposal of the case. It can be issued at any stage of the case upon an application to grant an injunction order against the other party.Detailed discussion is required in such cases.

This rental society (B), however, does not allow any parking for the tenants. Hence, you continued parking in your own society (A). Subsequently, after 3 months, when you rented your owned flat, your own society (A) passed a resolution in AGM stating that, owners who rent out their flats would not be permitted to park their vehicles. Despite this, you do not have a place to park and it is for health reasons that you moved to (B). But, the committee (A) is not ready to accept your request and is threatening to tow your vehicle. Herein, firstly, if you feel the resolution posed by (A) unfairly discriminates you, or is unreasonable, you may argue on grounds of violation of your rights as you own the house, and it may be your right to let any part of the house for rent. Secondly, though many societies have their own rules on parking, you may argue for an exception due to health reasons. However, to prevent any threatening, you may file for an injunction depicting that, there is an irreparable harm for you, and on the basis of equity, your request is justified.

    "question": "Girls family has filed section 85/115 clause 2 and 315 clause 2 BNS how do i get the bail as FIR as been filed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the present situation, you were married on December 7, 2023, and subsequently, your wife left to her home in Rajasthan on July 19, 2024, and kept travelling back and forth. Her father filed a case against you under the mentioned provisions of BNS, and asked for Rs. 50 Lakhs in the out of court settlement. Though you stated that you will not be able to pay the same, they sent police summons to sort the issue. They also told that they would file an FIR, for which you will have to be present after such filing. Therefore you want to get bail for the same as the cases have been filed, and you have an issue in travelling to Rajasthan as you are unemployed and your mother is not well in terms of health. Firstly, if you anticipate that an FIR would be filed against you, as the cases have already been filed, you may opt for applying for an anticipatory bail under Section 482 of BNSS to avoid such arrest. If you are arrested, you can even then apply for a regular bail under 480 of the BNSS, being a non-bailable offence. With respect to maintenance being claimed, it is important that you respond to the summons being sent, however, you can contest the claim by bringing forward your financial position of being unemployed. You may also file for transferring the case to your local jurisdiction, citing the relevant reasons under Section 448 of BNSS.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, in the last 12 years, you did not build anything there except a basic boundary wall around your plots. Recently, a few weeks back, the neighbouring land owner, who was not part of the layout, but claims that he owns agricultural land, has broken the few compound walls of yours. You have presently filed a NC Complaint with the nearby police station, and seeking to protect your property. Herein, firstly, since you have purchased the plots, you have lawful ownership clearly over the plot as long as the documents are maintained well. With respect to the legal protections or recourse, you have a right to protect your property from unlawful encroachment, and may also sue to the person for criminal or normal civil trespass. However, it is suggested that the relevant documents are collected and kept safely, along with photographs of the damaged compound walls. You are right in filing a police complaint, but if unresolved, you may file an FIR and go to the court to sue them.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Encroachment of NA property",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. My team has dealt with various disputes of such nature. Police can neither register the FIR nor can investigate or effect arrest without the express permission or directions from the Court are known as Non-cognizable offences. These mostly include minor offences such as abusing each other, minor scuffles without injuries, intimidation etc.Please note that Section 329 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 defines that whoever enters into property in the possession of another with the intent to commit an offence or to intimidate, insult or annoy any person in possession of such property, or having lawfully entered into such property, but remains there with intent thereby to intimidate, insult or any such person, or with an intent to commit an offence, is said to commit ‘criminal trespass’. Further, Section 331 defines the punishment for house-trepass or house breaking and specifies punishment with imprisonment which may extend to two years and fine. In addition, Section 333 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 mentions House-trespass after preparation of hurt, assault, or wrongful restraint. It holds significance within the realm of criminal law as it addresses the offense of house trespass after preparation for hurt, assault, or wrongful restraint. This provision is designed to safeguard the sanctity of personal spaces and ensure the security and well-being of individuals within their own premises and specifies imprisonment which may extend to 7 years and fine. Further, all these offences are cognizable and non-bailable admittedly the other side have committed the aforesaid punishable offences. Therefore, police ought to have registered a serious cognizable FIR to address your grievance.You can issue a legal notice through lawyer in this regard. Notice is, therefore, a formal communication to a person or an entity, informing the other party of your intention to undertake legal proceedings against them. This notice, when sent, conveys your intention before the legal proceedings and thus, makes the party aware of your grievance. Many times, a legal notice served will bring the other party to heel, and the problem is often resolved out of court, well before it goes to trial, with fruitful discussions on both sides. However, if the other party is still unheeding the grievance, one can always start the court proceedings. The bottom line is that it can serve as a point of reference to embark upon negotiations between two parties and save both the time, effort, and money that is usually spent in court cases.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with relevant documents.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, your husband has been accused of being involved in a fraudulent transaction, involving a cheque for an amount reported as fraudulent. Further, your husband is a cancer patient and you also have certain health issues, that may be considered for providing bail.

However, the health reasons of your husband may be a valid stance to argue upon. Additionally, if you are able to prove that your husband was unaware of the transaction being fraudulent, and him acting upon good faith, this may be a good stance to argue.

    "question": "NoC from society",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you have a house in a co-operative housing society in New Delhi. You want to sell the house but the management committee is refusing to give NOC for sale, though you do not have any outstanding dues as well. You feel that a society may only refuse to give NOC when there are some pending dues or there is a legal dispute on the ownership of the property. Herein, firstly, under the Delhi Cooperative Societies Act, a society cannot refuse a NOC to a member who wishes to sell the property. It may refuse only if there are outstanding dues, there is any legal dispute happening, or there has been a violation of the society rules. However if none of them applies to your situation, they may not refuse the NOC. Therefore, it is suggested that a formal written request is made to the society, and the same is documented for evidence purposes, requesting a reason to be mentioned for the refusal. On failure to do the same, you may send a legal notice to the society, and even file a complaint in the Consumer court.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Mr. Chirag,These cases are very common in various Courts of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. My team has dealt with various disputes of such nature. As you know that many a times, obtaining a NOC is essential to ensure a seamless and legally compliant sale procedure. This certificate serves as the society’s official declaration that the property seller has complied with all requirements, including following all laws and guidelines and paying any unpaid fees.You can issue a legal notice through lawyer in this regard. Notice is, therefore, a formal communication to a person or an entity, informing the other party of your intention to undertake legal proceedings against them. This notice, when sent, conveys your intention before the legal proceedings and thus, makes the party aware of your grievance. Many times, a legal notice served will bring the other party to heel, and the problem is often resolved out of court, well before it goes to trial, with fruitful discussions on both sides. However, if the other party is still unheeding the grievance, one can always start the court proceedings. The bottom line is that it can serve as a point of reference to embark upon negotiations between two parties and save both the time, effort, and money that is usually spent in court cases.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with relevant documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Shri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

This rule came into effect from 1 July, 2022.

    "question": "Right to park in own society after giving flat on rent",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. The Maharashtra state cooperative appellate court has recently observed that a tenant or a leave and license holder have the right to park their car in the space allotted to a member on the society premises. Furthermore in 2010-11, builders attempted to sell parking spaces as separate units, but the Bombay High Court ruled that parking space is a component of common facilities. The Supreme Court upheld this decision, making it part of parking regulations in India’s residential areas. Following the 2010-11 Nahalchand Laloochand Pvt Ltd vs Panchali Cooperative Housing Society case, it is illegal for a builder to sell parking units to non-society buyers or residents as separate real-estate units. Allotment of parking space is an administrative function, and the Managing Committee and General Body are authorized to allot parking space to registered members, including family and associate members.In the present case, you have already issued a written representation through lawyer and other side haven’t responded yet nor have acceded to your warning. Therefore, you have to now file formal legal proceedings in Court for appropriate relief(s) including temporary/permanent injunction along with prayer to take action against the office bearers. Thus, an injunction is a specific legal order of the court issued to prevent a wrongful act or the commencement of a wrongful act until the disposal of the case. It can be issued at any stage of the case upon an application to grant an injunction order against the other party.Detailed discussion is required in such cases.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, your family had moved to an adjacent building (B) as tenants because, your old mother had problems with climbing the 4th floor, in your owned flat in your own society (A). This rental society (B), however, does not allow any parking for the tenants. Hence, you continued parking in your own society (A). Subsequently, after 3 months, when you rented your owned flat, your own society (A) passed a resolution in AGM stating that, owners who rent out their flats would not be permitted to park their vehicles. Despite this, you do not have a place to park and it is for health reasons that you moved to (B). But, the committee (A) is not ready to accept your request and is threatening to tow your vehicle. Herein, firstly, if you feel the resolution posed by (A) unfairly discriminates you, or is unreasonable, you may argue on grounds of violation of your rights as you own the house, and it may be your right to let any part of the house for rent. Secondly, though many societies have their own rules on parking, you may argue for an exception due to health reasons. However, to prevent any threatening, you may file for an injunction depicting that, there is an irreparable harm for you, and on the basis of equity, your request is justified. But, before that, it is suggested that, you may go ahead for a negotiation or mediation with the society (A).Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Girls family has filed section 85/115 clause 2 and 315 clause 2 BNS how do i get the bail as FIR as been filed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the present situation, you were married on December 7, 2023, and subsequently, your wife left to her home in Rajasthan on July 19, 2024, and kept travelling back and forth. Her father filed a case against you under the mentioned provisions of BNS, and asked for Rs. 50 Lakhs in the out of court settlement. Though you stated that you will not be able to pay the same, they sent police summons to sort the issue. They also told that they would file an FIR, for which you will have to be present after such filing. Therefore you want to get bail for the same as the cases have been filed, and you have an issue in travelling to Rajasthan as you are unemployed and your mother is not well in terms of health. Firstly, if you anticipate that an FIR would be filed against you, as the cases have already been filed, you may opt for applying for an anticipatory bail under Section 482 of BNSS to avoid such arrest. If you are arrested, you can even then apply for a regular bail under 480 of the BNSS, being a non-bailable offence. With respect to maintenance being claimed, it is important that you respond to the summons being sent, however, you can contest the claim by bringing forward your financial position of being unemployed. You may also file for transferring the case to your local jurisdiction, citing the relevant reasons under Section 448 of BNSS.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you seek guidance in relation to a court decree that was issued by the Subordinate Judge Court in Erode in 2001. This decree was with respect to a mutual property exchange, between you and your father, involving two properties. You were minor at that time, and your father was not able to register the decree within the stipulated time. After 23 years, now, the decree has still remained unregistered, and your father has passed away, on Jan. 9, 2023. The sub-registrar's office has informed you, that you need a current dated court decree for proceeding with the registration. Herein, with respect to applying for a current dated court decree, you will have to file a petition with the same Subordinate Judge Court at Erode, who had issued the original decree. Since the decree remained unregistered, through the filing of petition, you may seek for restoration of the court decree. Secondly, with respect to applying, you must apply to the Subordinate Judge Court in Erode, and may not be necessary to approach the Madras High Court, unless high court's intervention may be required. Thirdly, since your father has passed away, the legal heirs of your father would be involved in the process. Such heirs' consent would be necessary for a new decree or proceeding with the registration. Fourthly, if the other legal heirs fail to cooperate, you may file a suit for partition, or even apply for a certificate of succession, that would aid you in establishing the stance of your entitlement to the property.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Dual employment",
    "answer": "Playing on Dream11 or similar platforms does not fall under dual employment, as dual employment generally refers to holding two jobs with two different employers simultaneously. Dual employment would involve receiving salaries or wages from multiple employers, which is not the case here.Here's a breakdown to clarify:Section 194BA: This section relates totax deducted at source (TDS)on winnings from online games like Dream11. The ₹3 deduction you see is TDS on the winnings, not employment income. It’s automatically deducted when your winnings cross a certain threshold, so it won’t affect your employment status.Form 26AS: Form 26AS is a consolidated statement of tax deducted, tax collected, and advance tax paid. TDS from online gaming platforms will appear here, but it’s listed under “Other Sources,” not “Salary.” This ensures it is clear it’s not employment income.Tax Implications: Income from Dream11 falls underincome from other sourceswhen you file your tax return, and it is not considered salary income or part of dual employment.In summary, this TDS deduction from Dream11 is unrelated to dual employment and simply reflects tax on your gaming winnings. You should report it as income from other sources when you file your tax return.Shubham GoyalAdvocate, Delhi1186 Answers7 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shubham Goyal"

Herein, firstly, with respect to the nature of income, the income from such games may be classified as 'Income from other sources' under the Income Tax Act, and hence tax may be deducted for the same. With respect to dual employment, playing Dream11 may not constitute another employment apart from working in MNC, as it is a form of investment or a game, and not an employment as such.

    "answer": "There is no concept of current decree or old decree when the case has already been decided and there is no appeal pending.The sub registrar might have informed you that since you have not filed an execution petition within 12 years from the date of decree, he may say that the same would be barred by limitation.However, if the sub registrar was not impleaded as a party then the decree is not binding on them,  but you can file an application before court to get the mutually agreed partition decree registered through court.If the court is also under the opinion that the same is barred by limitation then you can file a suit for declaration to declare your title based on the decree passed in favor of your father and in that you can implead the sub registrar as a necessary party and seek direction to the sub registrar to register the property title to your name as per procedures of law.You can contact your own lawyer for following it up or can engage the services of a new lawyer alsoT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

Request a certified copy from the original Subordinate Judge Court in Erode.Execution Petition: File an execution petition in the same court to enforce the decree, citing your father’s legal heirs as parties.Legal Heirs’ Cooperation: Legal heirs must be notified, but their consent isn’t required for execution.If Execution is Barred: If the court considers the petition time-barred, file a suit for declaration of title based on the original decree, adding the sub-registrar as a party and requesting an order to complete the registration.Consult a local lawyer to assist with these steps.Shubham GoyalAdvocate, Delhi1186 Answers7 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shubham Goyal"

    "question": "Guidance in Obtaining a Current Dated Court Decree",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you seek guidance in relation to a court decree that was issued by the Subordinate Judge Court in Erode in 2001. This decree was with respect to a mutual property exchange, between you and your father, involving two properties. You were minor at that time, and your father was not able to register the decree within the stipulated time. After 23 years, now, the decree has still remained unregistered, and your father has passed away, on Jan. 9, 2023. The sub-registrar's office has informed you, that you need a current dated court decree for proceeding with the registration. Herein, with respect to applying for a current dated court decree, you will have to file a petition with the same Subordinate Judge Court at Erode, who had issued the original decree. Since the decree remained unregistered, through the filing of petition, you may seek for restoration of the court decree. Secondly, with respect to applying, you must apply to the Subordinate Judge Court in Erode, and may not be necessary to approach the Madras High Court, unless high court's intervention may be required. Thirdly, since your father has passed away, the legal heirs of your father would be involved in the process. Such heirs' consent would be necessary for a new decree or proceeding with the registration. Fourthly, if the other legal heirs fail to cooperate, you may file a suit for partition, or even apply for a certificate of succession, that would aid you in establishing the stance of your entitlement to the property.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The injunction can be sought immediately and the resolution can be challenged as such. It is pertinent to mention that it's your own purchased flat and you have paid for the parking spot. If the tenants who have been let out your flat, do not own a vehicle or don't park in your parking spot, you are entitled to park it over there, as long as you are not parking in anyone else's spot.Good luck!Puneet SrivastavaAdvocate, New Delhi68 AnswersTalk to Advocate Puneet Srivastava"

    "question": "Right to park in own society after giving flat on rent",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. The Maharashtra state cooperative appellate court has recently observed that a tenant or a leave and license holder have the right to park their car in the space allotted to a member on the society premises. Furthermore in 2010-11, builders attempted to sell parking spaces as separate units, but the Bombay High Court ruled that parking space is a component of common facilities. The Supreme Court upheld this decision, making it part of parking regulations in India’s residential areas. Following the 2010-11 Nahalchand Laloochand Pvt Ltd vs Panchali Cooperative Housing Society case, it is illegal for a builder to sell parking units to non-society buyers or residents as separate real-estate units. Allotment of parking space is an administrative function, and the Managing Committee and General Body are authorized to allot parking space to registered members, including family and associate members.In the present case, you have already issued a written representation through lawyer and other side haven’t responded yet nor have acceded to your warning. Therefore, you have to now file formal legal proceedings in Court for appropriate relief(s) including temporary/permanent injunction along with prayer to take action against the office bearers. Thus, an injunction is a specific legal order of the court issued to prevent a wrongful act or the commencement of a wrongful act until the disposal of the case. It can be issued at any stage of the case upon an application to grant an injunction order against the other party.Detailed discussion is required in such cases.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, your family had moved to an adjacent building (B) as tenants because, your old mother had problems with climbing the 4th floor, in your owned flat in your own society (A). This rental society (B), however, does not allow any parking for the tenants. Hence, you continued parking in your own society (A). Subsequently, after 3 months, when you rented your owned flat, your own society (A) passed a resolution in AGM stating that, owners who rent out their flats would not be permitted to park their vehicles. Despite this, you do not have a place to park and it is for health reasons that you moved to (B). But, the committee (A) is not ready to accept your request and is threatening to tow your vehicle. Herein, firstly, if you feel the resolution posed by (A) unfairly discriminates you, or is unreasonable, you may argue on grounds of violation of your rights as you own the house, and it may be your right to let any part of the house for rent. Secondly, though many societies have their own rules on parking, you may argue for an exception due to health reasons. However, to prevent any threatening, you may file for an injunction depicting that, there is an irreparable harm for you, and on the basis of equity, your request is justified. But, before that, it is suggested that, you may go ahead for a negotiation or mediation with the society (A).Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the present situation, you were married on December 7, 2023, and subsequently, your wife left to her home in Rajasthan on July 19, 2024, and kept travelling back and forth. Her father filed a case against you under the mentioned provisions of BNS, and asked for Rs. 50 Lakhs in the out of court settlement. Though you stated that you will not be able to pay the same, they sent police summons to sort the issue. They also told that they would file an FIR, for which you will have to be present after such filing. Therefore you want to get bail for the same as the cases have been filed, and you have an issue in travelling to Rajasthan as you are unemployed and your mother is not well in terms of health. Firstly, if you anticipate that an FIR would be filed against you, as the cases have already been filed, you may opt for applying for an anticipatory bail under Section 482 of BNSS to avoid such arrest. If you are arrested, you can even then apply for a regular bail under 480 of the BNSS, being a non-bailable offence. With respect to maintenance being claimed, it is important that you respond to the summons being sent, however, you can contest the claim by bringing forward your financial position of being unemployed. You may also file for transferring the case to your local jurisdiction, citing the relevant reasons under Section 448 of BNSS.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you had purchased a few plots in a Collector approved NA project in Maharashtra in 2012, which was approved by banks as well. However, in the last 12 years, you did not build anything there except a basic boundary wall around your plots. Recently, a few weeks back, the neighbouring land owner, who was not part of the layout, but claims that he owns agricultural land, has broken the few compound walls of yours. You have presently filed a NC Complaint with the nearby police station, and seeking to protect your property. Herein, firstly, since you have purchased the plots, you have lawful ownership clearly over the plot as long as the documents are maintained well. With respect to the legal protections or recourse, you have a right to protect your property from unlawful encroachment, and may also sue to the person for criminal or normal civil trespass. However, it is suggested that the relevant documents are collected and kept safely, along with photographs of the damaged compound walls. You are right in filing a police complaint, but if unresolved, you may file an FIR and go to the court to sue them.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. My team has dealt with various disputes of such nature. Police can neither register the FIR nor can investigate or effect arrest without the express permission or directions from the Court are known as Non-cognizable offences. These mostly include minor offences such as abusing each other, minor scuffles without injuries, intimidation etc.Please note that Section 329 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 defines that whoever enters into property in the possession of another with the intent to commit an offence or to intimidate, insult or annoy any person in possession of such property, or having lawfully entered into such property, but remains there with intent thereby to intimidate, insult or any such person, or with an intent to commit an offence, is said to commit ‘criminal trespass’. Further, Section 331 defines the punishment for house-trepass or house breaking and specifies punishment with imprisonment which may extend to two years and fine. In addition, Section 333 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 mentions House-trespass after preparation of hurt, assault, or wrongful restraint. It holds significance within the realm of criminal law as it addresses the offense of house trespass after preparation for hurt, assault, or wrongful restraint. This provision is designed to safeguard the sanctity of personal spaces and ensure the security and well-being of individuals within their own premises and specifies imprisonment which may extend to 7 years and fine. Further, all these offences are cognizable and non-bailable admittedly the other side have committed the aforesaid punishable offences. Therefore, police ought to have registered a serious cognizable FIR to address your grievance.You can issue a legal notice through lawyer in this regard. Notice is, therefore, a formal communication to a person or an entity, informing the other party of your intention to undertake legal proceedings against them. This notice, when sent, conveys your intention before the legal proceedings and thus, makes the party aware of your grievance. Many times, a legal notice served will bring the other party to heel, and the problem is often resolved out of court, well before it goes to trial, with fruitful discussions on both sides. However, if the other party is still unheeding the grievance, one can always start the court proceedings. The bottom line is that it can serve as a point of reference to embark upon negotiations between two parties and save both the time, effort, and money that is usually spent in court cases.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with relevant documents.

    "question": "How to file a domestic violence case",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. My team has dealt with various disputes of such nature.This is yet another unfortunate matrimonial dispute which has shattered the 18 years old matrimonial bond between the parties. They say marriages are made in heaven. But so is thunder and lightning. At times, despite our best efforts, life takes a turn for the worst. We may have wanted different things from life, but life’s got its own plan as well. A bad marriage is something which nobody hopes for, but at times, that’s exactly what we are given and forced to face head on. Marriage does not guarantee that you will be together forever, it’s only paper. It takes love, respect, trust, faith, understanding and friendship in your relationship to make it last forever.You stated that she is married since l8 years and therefore there maybe some children from the wedlock. The petition can be filed either at Delhi or Gurgoan.TheHindu Marriage Act, 1955 provides for 2 ways to obtain divorce from your spouse:Mutual Consent Divorceunder Section 13-B of the ActContested Divorce under Section 13 of the ActOf course, the easiest way to obtain a Divorce is by Mutual Consent of both husband and wife. The one time alimony and child custody can be decided mutually. However, at times, the circumstances are not that easy, the situations are not that easy, and the other spouse itself may not be easy to handle as well. In that case, the only option left is to apply for a Contested Divorce under theHindu Marriage Act.Once the Petition has been finalized with the help a lawyer, the person would be required to sign the Petition, supporting Affidavits, Vakalatnama, etc. in the presence of an authorized Oath Commissioner/Notary. After the completion of all the formalities, the Divorce Petition would be filed before the appropriate Court by the Lawyer, as per the applicable territorial jurisdiction.Normally, a Contested Divorce Petition is listed for hearing within 7-10 days from the date of filing, however, it may take few or more days to get listed subject to the workload of the Court which is to hear the Divorce case.Now, before the actual Divorce proceedings can begin, the Divorce Petition itself needs to be admitted by the Court. On the first date of hearing, the Judge would carefully study the Petition and hear opening arguments from the Lawyer regarding the allegations made in the Petition and the grounds on which the Contested Divorce is being sought.Once the Court is satisfied that, on a preliminary level, the case seems to be carrying some weight and needs to be properly adjudicated, the Court would issue a formal notice of the case to be served upon the opposite side. Subsequently, a copy of the notice along with the Petition would be sent to the opposite side.On the next date of hearing, the opposite side is supposed to appear in person along with its Lawyer and also file its reply to the Divorce Petition. The other side is also required to a file a reply to any Application (usually for maintenance or custody of child) which may have be filed along with the Divorce Petition.At the initial stage of the case, the Court will try to resolve the dispute between the parties, and will also direct both the parties to appear before a Mediator for an amicable solution to their marital issues.In case the mediation sessions are not fruitful and the issue between the parties are not resolved, the Court would continue further with the Divorce proceedings.If an Application for maintenance is filed (usually) by the wife, the Court would first decide the Application so as to ensure financial security of the wife during the pendency of the Divorce Petition.Subsequently, the Court would proceed towards framing of issues and recording of evidence. Examination-in-Chief and Cross-Examination of the Petitioner and its supporting witnesses would be recorded first, followed by Examination-in-Chief and Cross-Examination of the Respondent and its supporting witnesses. This is the most crucial stage of the entire case. It has the potential to make or break a case. Therefore, the stage of recording of evidence usually takes a lot of time and a lot of hearings to conclude.After the evidence of both the parties has been recorded, the Lawyers for both the parties would be required to address their final closing arguments before the Court. Subsequent to which, the Court would fix a date on which it shall pronounce its decision.In case, the decision passed by the Court is not acceptable to either of the parties, that party can file an Appeal against that Order within a period of 3 months from the date of the order.Divorce can be sought on the ground of cruelty. Cruelty can be physical or mental. Cruelty which is a ground for dissolution of marriage may be defined as wilful and unjustifiable conduct of such character as to cause danger to life, limb or health, bodily or mental, or as to give rise to a reasonable apprehension of such a danger. The question of mental cruelty has to be considered in the light of the norms of marital ties of the particular society to which the parties belong, their social values, status, environment in which they live.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with relevant documents.

Herein, taking into consideration theHindu Marriage Act, it is to the discretion of the court to grant alimony to either party. However, the amount of alimony would be determined on the basis of financial status of both of you, the duration of the marriage and the needs of your wife. If you can however, prove that the mental illness information was not disclosed to you at the time of marriage, you may be granted a divorce. Though your wife is an engineering graduate, her employment status would be taken as a primary factor to determine the alimony amount.

It takes love, respect, trust, faith, understanding and friendship in your relationship to make it last forever.At the outset, it is crucial here to mention that you should have filed for annulment of marriage on the ground that she is mentally ill.Section 12 of theHindu Marriage Actstates that:-(1) Any marriage solemnised, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, shall be voidable and may be annulled by a decree of nullity on any of the following grounds, namely:(a) that the marriage has not been consummated owing to the impotence of the respondent; or(b)that the marriage is in contravention of the condition specified in clause (ii) of section 5; or(c)that the consent of the petitioner, or where the consent of the guardian in marriage of the petitioner was required under section 5 as it stood immediately before the commencement of the Child Marriage Restraint (Amendment) Act, 1978 (2 of 1978), the consent of such guardian was obtained by force or by fraud as to the nature of the ceremony or as to any material fact or circumstance concerning the respondent;or(d)that the respondent was at the time of the marriage pregnant by some person other than the petitioner.(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), no petition for annulling a marriage—(a) on the ground specified in clause (c) of sub-section (1) shall be entertained if—(i) the petition is presented more than one year after the force had ceased to operate or, as the case may be, the fraud had been discovered;or (ii) the petitioner has, with his or her full consent, lived with the other party to the marriage as husband or wife after the force had ceased to operate or, as the case may be, the fraud had been discovered;Please note that Section 12 (1) (c) is applicable in your case as your consent was obtained by fraud and the material fact i.e. she is mentally ill was suppressed from you and as per sub section (2) the petition has to be filed within one year of discovery of fraud.Supreme Court in case of Kollam Chandra Sekhar v, Kollam Padma Latha, (2014) 1 SCC 225, by relying on the testimony of a doctor that Schizophrenia “is a treatable, manageable disease, which can be put on a par with hypertension and diabetes.”In another case, Sharda v. Dharampal, (2003) 4 SCC 493, the Court observed that “but it is another thing to say that a party may be asked to submit himself to a psychiatrist or a psychoanalyst so as to enable the Court to arrive at a just conclusion. Whether the party to the marriage requires a treatment or not can be found out only in the event, he is examined by a properly qualified Psychiatrist.”Therefore, your wife would be asked to submit the proof of mental illness. As stated above that since the fraud is committed by her, therefore, she is not eligible for any alimony amount, however, detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete documents.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you have a house in a co-operative housing society in New Delhi. You want to sell the house but the management committee is refusing to give NOC for sale, though you do not have any outstanding dues as well. You feel that a society may only refuse to give NOC when there are some pending dues or there is a legal dispute on the ownership of the property. Herein, firstly, under the Delhi Cooperative Societies Act, a society cannot refuse a NOC to a member who wishes to sell the property. It may refuse only if there are outstanding dues, there is any legal dispute happening, or there has been a violation of the society rules. However if none of them applies to your situation, they may not refuse the NOC. Therefore, it is suggested that a formal written request is made to the society, and the same is documented for evidence purposes, requesting a reason to be mentioned for the refusal. On failure to do the same, you may send a legal notice to the society, and even file a complaint in the Consumer court.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Mr. Chirag,These cases are very common in various Courts of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. My team has dealt with various disputes of such nature. As you know that many a times, obtaining a NOC is essential to ensure a seamless and legally compliant sale procedure. This certificate serves as the society’s official declaration that the property seller has complied with all requirements, including following all laws and guidelines and paying any unpaid fees.You can issue a legal notice through lawyer in this regard. Notice is, therefore, a formal communication to a person or an entity, informing the other party of your intention to undertake legal proceedings against them. This notice, when sent, conveys your intention before the legal proceedings and thus, makes the party aware of your grievance. Many times, a legal notice served will bring the other party to heel, and the problem is often resolved out of court, well before it goes to trial, with fruitful discussions on both sides. However, if the other party is still unheeding the grievance, one can always start the court proceedings. The bottom line is that it can serve as a point of reference to embark upon negotiations between two parties and save both the time, effort, and money that is usually spent in court cases.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with relevant documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Shri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

However, the same was never utilized by him, and further, he also did not pay any maintenance amount. After 12 years, you remarried, and wished to relocate with your child abroad. But, your ex-husband had refused to consent for the same, and subsequently you filed an interim application for relocation, Though the trial was completed, and an order date was set, it was delayed due to a new custody case filed by your ex-husband, by citing the change due to your remarriage, and applicability of Muslim Personal Law. Your ex-husband's brother is also a lawyer, and he has been sending money orders for the child, which was not done previously, and hence, you wish to enquire about the legal remedies available for the dismissal of the new proceedings, and consider the order of the previous case. Herein, since there exists an order from the previous case on custody, this can act as a basis to dismiss the new custody case under the Civil Procedure Code. You may also request for an interim relief seeking to permit for relocation while the case is being adjudicated. For the same, you may also present evidences such as non-utilization of visiting rights, non-payment of maintenance amount for your child, etc., claiming inactive involvement or interest by your ex-husband on your child.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "To my mind a corporation or LLC can provide certain tax benefits. For example, the money you earn from collecting rent payments could put you in a higher income tax bracket, leading to you paying more on your personal tax return. You can help mitigate this by having a business collect the rent and pay you a salary.Most of the expenses associated with operating a rental property are tax-deductible. This may include anything from purchasing a new refrigerator for a unit in your building to making repairs to the front door. Operating as a corporation or LLC can make it easier to claim these expenses as tax deductions.Sole proprietors and general partners have personal liability for business debts, meaning that business creditors may be able to come after the business owners’ personal assets. In addition to lenders, people who get hurt on the property and file personal injury claims may seek damages that come from the business owners’ personal assets. You could find yourself in serious debt, or even bankrupt, which makes liability protection one of the most important benefits of registering an LLC or corporation. The business structure shields your personal income and assets from business creditors and other claimants. The corporation or LLC would be liable for the debts and other claims and not you.Rest, you may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification with complete documents.Shri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

This decree was with respect to a mutual property exchange, between you and your father, involving two properties. You were minor at that time, and your father was not able to register the decree within the stipulated time. After 23 years, now, the decree has still remained unregistered, and your father has passed away, on Jan. 9, 2023. The sub-registrar's office has informed you, that you need a current dated court decree for proceeding with the registration. Herein, with respect to applying for a current dated court decree, you will have to file a petition with the same Subordinate Judge Court at Erode, who had issued the original decree. Since the decree remained unregistered, through the filing of petition, you may seek for restoration of the court decree. Secondly, with respect to applying, you must apply to the Subordinate Judge Court in Erode, and may not be necessary to approach the Madras High Court, unless high court's intervention may be required. Thirdly, since your father has passed away, the legal heirs of your father would be involved in the process. Such heirs' consent would be necessary for a new decree or proceeding with the registration. Fourthly, if the other legal heirs fail to cooperate, you may file a suit for partition, or even apply for a certificate of succession, that would aid you in establishing the stance of your entitlement to the property.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The injunction can be sought immediately and the resolution can be challenged as such. It is pertinent to mention that it's your own purchased flat and you have paid for the parking spot. If the tenants who have been let out your flat, do not own a vehicle or don't park in your parking spot, you are entitled to park it over there, as long as you are not parking in anyone else's spot.Good luck!Puneet SrivastavaAdvocate, New Delhi68 AnswersTalk to Advocate Puneet Srivastava"

    "answer": "Unfortunately, the police would not be much of a use in this sort of matter as no cognisable offence is made out here. The only remedy lies with the civil court of your concerned jurisdiction. An injunction needs to be sought without any further delay, which if your counsel represents well, would succeed for sure. You can also make prayer in your suit for the abolition of the committee so formed who are not even adhering to the general practice of conducting the AGMs as per rules and stipulated law of the land.I wish you all the best though!Puneet SrivastavaAdvocate, New Delhi68 AnswersTalk to Advocate Puneet Srivastava"

    "question": "Right to park in own society after giving flat on rent",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. The Maharashtra state cooperative appellate court has recently observed that a tenant or a leave and license holder have the right to park their car in the space allotted to a member on the society premises. Furthermore in 2010-11, builders attempted to sell parking spaces as separate units, but the Bombay High Court ruled that parking space is a component of common facilities. The Supreme Court upheld this decision, making it part of parking regulations in India’s residential areas. Following the 2010-11 Nahalchand Laloochand Pvt Ltd vs Panchali Cooperative Housing Society case, it is illegal for a builder to sell parking units to non-society buyers or residents as separate real-estate units. Allotment of parking space is an administrative function, and the Managing Committee and General Body are authorized to allot parking space to registered members, including family and associate members.In the present case, you have already issued a written representation through lawyer and other side haven’t responded yet nor have acceded to your warning. Therefore, you have to now file formal legal proceedings in Court for appropriate relief(s) including temporary/permanent injunction along with prayer to take action against the office bearers. Thus, an injunction is a specific legal order of the court issued to prevent a wrongful act or the commencement of a wrongful act until the disposal of the case. It can be issued at any stage of the case upon an application to grant an injunction order against the other party.Detailed discussion is required in such cases.

    "question": "Right to park in own society after giving flat on rent",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, your family had moved to an adjacent building (B) as tenants because, your old mother had problems with climbing the 4th floor, in your owned flat in your own society (A). This rental society (B), however, does not allow any parking for the tenants. Hence, you continued parking in your own society (A). Subsequently, after 3 months, when you rented your owned flat, your own society (A) passed a resolution in AGM stating that, owners who rent out their flats would not be permitted to park their vehicles. Despite this, you do not have a place to park and it is for health reasons that you moved to (B). But, the committee (A) is not ready to accept your request and is threatening to tow your vehicle. Herein, firstly, if you feel the resolution posed by (A) unfairly discriminates you, or is unreasonable, you may argue on grounds of violation of your rights as you own the house, and it may be your right to let any part of the house for rent. Secondly, though many societies have their own rules on parking, you may argue for an exception due to health reasons. However, to prevent any threatening, you may file for an injunction depicting that, there is an irreparable harm for you, and on the basis of equity, your request is justified. But, before that, it is suggested that, you may go ahead for a negotiation or mediation with the society (A).Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. My team has dealt with various disputes of such nature. Police can neither register the FIR nor can investigate or effect arrest without the express permission or directions from the Court are known as Non-cognizable offences. These mostly include minor offences such as abusing each other, minor scuffles without injuries, intimidation etc.Please note that Section 329 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 defines that whoever enters into property in the possession of another with the intent to commit an offence or to intimidate, insult or annoy any person in possession of such property, or having lawfully entered into such property, but remains there with intent thereby to intimidate, insult or any such person, or with an intent to commit an offence, is said to commit ‘criminal trespass’. Further, Section 331 defines the punishment for house-trepass or house breaking and specifies punishment with imprisonment which may extend to two years and fine. In addition, Section 333 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 mentions House-trespass after preparation of hurt, assault, or wrongful restraint. It holds significance within the realm of criminal law as it addresses the offense of house trespass after preparation for hurt, assault, or wrongful restraint. This provision is designed to safeguard the sanctity of personal spaces and ensure the security and well-being of individuals within their own premises and specifies imprisonment which may extend to 7 years and fine. Further, all these offences are cognizable and non-bailable admittedly the other side have committed the aforesaid punishable offences. Therefore, police ought to have registered a serious cognizable FIR to address your grievance.You can issue a legal notice through lawyer in this regard. Notice is, therefore, a formal communication to a person or an entity, informing the other party of your intention to undertake legal proceedings against them. This notice, when sent, conveys your intention before the legal proceedings and thus, makes the party aware of your grievance. Many times, a legal notice served will bring the other party to heel, and the problem is often resolved out of court, well before it goes to trial, with fruitful discussions on both sides. However, if the other party is still unheeding the grievance, one can always start the court proceedings. The bottom line is that it can serve as a point of reference to embark upon negotiations between two parties and save both the time, effort, and money that is usually spent in court cases.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with relevant documents.

    "answer": "Mr. Chirag,These cases are very common in various Courts of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. My team has dealt with various disputes of such nature. As you know that many a times, obtaining a NOC is essential to ensure a seamless and legally compliant sale procedure. This certificate serves as the society’s official declaration that the property seller has complied with all requirements, including following all laws and guidelines and paying any unpaid fees.You can issue a legal notice through lawyer in this regard. Notice is, therefore, a formal communication to a person or an entity, informing the other party of your intention to undertake legal proceedings against them. This notice, when sent, conveys your intention before the legal proceedings and thus, makes the party aware of your grievance. Many times, a legal notice served will bring the other party to heel, and the problem is often resolved out of court, well before it goes to trial, with fruitful discussions on both sides. However, if the other party is still unheeding the grievance, one can always start the court proceedings. The bottom line is that it can serve as a point of reference to embark upon negotiations between two parties and save both the time, effort, and money that is usually spent in court cases.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with relevant documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Shri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "question": "Dual employment",
    "answer": "Playing on Dream11 or similar platforms does not fall under dual employment, as dual employment generally refers to holding two jobs with two different employers simultaneously. Dual employment would involve receiving salaries or wages from multiple employers, which is not the case here.Here's a breakdown to clarify:Section 194BA: This section relates totax deducted at source (TDS)on winnings from online games like Dream11. The ₹3 deduction you see is TDS on the winnings, not employment income. It’s automatically deducted when your winnings cross a certain threshold, so it won’t affect your employment status.Form 26AS: Form 26AS is a consolidated statement of tax deducted, tax collected, and advance tax paid. TDS from online gaming platforms will appear here, but it’s listed under “Other Sources,” not “Salary.” This ensures it is clear it’s not employment income.Tax Implications: Income from Dream11 falls underincome from other sourceswhen you file your tax return, and it is not considered salary income or part of dual employment.In summary, this TDS deduction from Dream11 is unrelated to dual employment and simply reflects tax on your gaming winnings. You should report it as income from other sources when you file your tax return.Shubham GoyalAdvocate, Delhi1186 Answers7 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shubham Goyal"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you are working in an MNC and also play fantasy games such as Dream 11. Whether the same would be considered as dual employment is your query. Herein, firstly, with respect to the nature of income, the income from such games may be classified as 'Income from other sources' under the Income Tax Act, and hence tax may be deducted for the same. With respect to dual employment, playing Dream11 may not constitute another employment apart from working in MNC, as it is a form of investment or a game, and not an employment as such. Additionally, since the TDS has been deducted, the amount would be reflected in your Form 26 AS. However, you must declare your income from the game as well, to avoid any further issues with the tax authorities.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, after he passed away in 1995, your father along with his two brothers continued to do the business. The three brothers were made partners in the business before your grandfather passed away. In 2017, your two brothers relinquished their rights and your father along with your mother became the partners. In all the years, the rent receipt was given in the name of the shop and not on individual. Recently, the landlord sent a notice stating that your father is an unlawful tenant as there was no intimation of inheritance. Though you have submitted all the relevant documents, there was no acknowledgement from the other side, and hence, you want to know if the landlord has any right to evict you. Herein, taking into consideration the Rent Control Act, Property Laws, and the Succession Laws, firstly, there is a dilemma on whether there has been a proper communication with respect to the inheritance. However, if you have submitted proper documentation, the lack of acknowledgement would be irrelevant.

    "question": "Please Suggest on Property Dispute as per Issue below??",

Accordingly, the 2022 gift deed may be revoked by you in three eventualities.

However,if both the parties decide mutually that the gift shall revoked upon the happening of an event, it shall be deemed as a valid revocation.Moreover, the law on voidable contracts, is also applicable to gift deeds. If any gift deed is obtained by any of the vitiating factors such coercion, fraud or misrepresentation then it will be voidable at the instance of the Donor."

    "question": "Please Suggest on Property Dispute as per Issue below??",
    "answer": "Your case presents a complex property dispute, primarily revolving around revocation of a gift deed, the rights of a senior citizen, and questions of necessary party involvement. Here's a general guide for each issue based on similar cases in property law, particularly focusing on gift deeds and senior citizen protection laws:1. Legal Procedure to Cancel a Gift Deed Given to the Daughter by the MotherA gift deed is generally irrevocable, but it can be canceled if it was executed under undue influence, fraud, or misrepresentation. Since your grandmother claims she wasn’t aware of the gift deed registration, you may need to:File a civil suit challenging the gift deed’s validity in the appropriate civil court.Provide evidence of your grandmother’s lack of awareness or possible coercion during the registration process.Given her age, you could file a petition under theMaintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, to argue undue influence and secure her rights to the property.2. Civil Court or RDO Court Due to Senior Citizen StatusTheMaintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, allows senior citizens to revoke gift deeds if they were executed under coercion or if the recipient fails to care for the elderly grantor. This process is usually managed by the RDO (Revenue Divisional Officer) court.Initiate proceedings under Section 23 of the Act at the RDO court, citing her senior status and lack of consent. This process may offer faster relief than the civil court.3. Non-joinder of Necessary PartiesThe daughter’s suit without including your grandmother as a party may be seen as a case of non-joinder of a necessary party, especially since your grandmother has an interest in the land.Your lawyer can file a motion to dismiss or challenge the suit based on non-joinder, arguing that your grandmother is an essential party whose interests are directly affected by the property.4. Validity of the Gift Deed Revoked Solely by Your GrandmotherA gift deed revocation is typically effective only if done by a court or RDO order. Therefore, the sole revocation by your grandmother may not hold unless it follows legal procedures.You’ll need to validate the revocation by initiating a court process, especially if the daughter challenges it. Supporting evidence of your grandmother’s lack of awareness at the time of the gift deed may help the court see grounds for revocation.5. Applicability of Section 23 of the Senior Citizens Act, 2007Section 23 provides grounds for revocation if a property transfer to children is conditional upon their care, and they fail in this duty. Based on this, the RDO court can indeed revoke the gift deed if the daughter neglected or failed to support your grandmother.Since this falls within the Act, you could proceed through the RDO court under this provision, especially as it can offer a more streamlined process than civil court.6. Injunction Between Siblings in Family Property DisputesInjunctions can be requested in family property disputes if there’s evidence of trespass or other improper interference. However, if your grandmother is the true owner, her interests should supersede those of her children in the injunction proceedings.Your lawyer might challenge the interim injunction in court by arguing your grandmother’s ownership or by presenting the revocation and her current intentions regarding the property.7. Adding Your Grandmother as a Witness or Filing for RevocationYour grandmother can be added as a necessary party or a witness in the daughter’s case, especially as her legal and beneficial interests are directly impacted.Additionally, filing an independent revocation action, possibly combined with her case under the Senior Citizens Act, may strengthen her position and highlight the undue influence in court.8. Use of Web History and MRO Office Records for CounterThe MRO office records and web history may be useful in showing that your grandmother had no intent to transfer the property. If these records indicate inconsistencies in the transfer or reveal that she was unaware, they could strengthen your counterclaim.9. Absence of Passbook or Documents by the DaughterThe daughter’s failure to submit official documents for the agricultural land may weaken her claim. The absence of the passbook could raise questions about her legal claim and intent.Bring this up with the court as part of your grandmother's counter, as this documentation is often crucial in establishing legal ownership.In summary, it seems appropriate to proceed by challenging the gift deed in the RDO court due to her senior status and invoking Section 23 of the Senior Citizens Act. Also, consider approaching civil court to tackle the injunction and non-joinder issues while presenting strong evidence for your grandmother's claims.Shubham GoyalAdvocate, Delhi1186 Answers7 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shubham Goyal"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you had purchased a few plots in a Collector approved NA project in Maharashtra in 2012, which was approved by banks as well. However, in the last 12 years, you did not build anything there except a basic boundary wall around your plots. Recently, a few weeks back, the neighbouring land owner, who was not part of the layout, but claims that he owns agricultural land, has broken the few compound walls of yours. You have presently filed a NC Complaint with the nearby police station, and seeking to protect your property. Herein, firstly, since you have purchased the plots, you have lawful ownership clearly over the plot as long as the documents are maintained well. With respect to the legal protections or recourse, you have a right to protect your property from unlawful encroachment, and may also sue to the person for criminal or normal civil trespass. However, it is suggested that the relevant documents are collected and kept safely, along with photographs of the damaged compound walls. You are right in filing a police complaint, but if unresolved, you may file an FIR and go to the court to sue them.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Encroachment of NA property",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. My team has dealt with various disputes of such nature. Police can neither register the FIR nor can investigate or effect arrest without the express permission or directions from the Court are known as Non-cognizable offences. These mostly include minor offences such as abusing each other, minor scuffles without injuries, intimidation etc.Please note that Section 329 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 defines that whoever enters into property in the possession of another with the intent to commit an offence or to intimidate, insult or annoy any person in possession of such property, or having lawfully entered into such property, but remains there with intent thereby to intimidate, insult or any such person, or with an intent to commit an offence, is said to commit ‘criminal trespass’. Further, Section 331 defines the punishment for house-trepass or house breaking and specifies punishment with imprisonment which may extend to two years and fine. In addition, Section 333 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 mentions House-trespass after preparation of hurt, assault, or wrongful restraint. It holds significance within the realm of criminal law as it addresses the offense of house trespass after preparation for hurt, assault, or wrongful restraint. This provision is designed to safeguard the sanctity of personal spaces and ensure the security and well-being of individuals within their own premises and specifies imprisonment which may extend to 7 years and fine. Further, all these offences are cognizable and non-bailable admittedly the other side have committed the aforesaid punishable offences. Therefore, police ought to have registered a serious cognizable FIR to address your grievance.You can issue a legal notice through lawyer in this regard. Notice is, therefore, a formal communication to a person or an entity, informing the other party of your intention to undertake legal proceedings against them. This notice, when sent, conveys your intention before the legal proceedings and thus, makes the party aware of your grievance. Many times, a legal notice served will bring the other party to heel, and the problem is often resolved out of court, well before it goes to trial, with fruitful discussions on both sides. However, if the other party is still unheeding the grievance, one can always start the court proceedings. The bottom line is that it can serve as a point of reference to embark upon negotiations between two parties and save both the time, effort, and money that is usually spent in court cases.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with relevant documents.

As per guidelines of Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the validity period of cheque from the date of issue is 3 months.Acheque bounce, also known as a dishonored cheque, occurs when a cheque issued by someone (drawer) cannot be cleared due to insufficient funds or any other reason in their account. In India, the Negotiable Instruments Act (NI Act) governscheque bouncecases andCheque BounceCase Procedure pursuing legal action.After the cheque gets dishonoured, a legal notice should be sent by way of R.P.A.D. to the drawer of the cheque through an advocate within 30 days from the date of the cheque return memo.

The Court examines the original documents and checks for validity and limitation of the complaint filed. The complaint can also be filed by the power of attorney of the complainant. After satisfaction, the court issues a summons against the accused, and the case is tried as a summary criminal proceeding.When the accused presents himself before the court, the court asks the accused to furnish surety and to submit bail bonds, in order to make certain that the accused will remain present on every date of the proceedings.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you have a house in a co-operative housing society in New Delhi. You want to sell the house but the management committee is refusing to give NOC for sale, though you do not have any outstanding dues as well. You feel that a society may only refuse to give NOC when there are some pending dues or there is a legal dispute on the ownership of the property. Herein, firstly, under the Delhi Cooperative Societies Act, a society cannot refuse a NOC to a member who wishes to sell the property. It may refuse only if there are outstanding dues, there is any legal dispute happening, or there has been a violation of the society rules. However if none of them applies to your situation, they may not refuse the NOC. Therefore, it is suggested that a formal written request is made to the society, and the same is documented for evidence purposes, requesting a reason to be mentioned for the refusal. On failure to do the same, you may send a legal notice to the society, and even file a complaint in the Consumer court.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Dual employment",
    "answer": "Playing on Dream11 or similar platforms does not fall under dual employment, as dual employment generally refers to holding two jobs with two different employers simultaneously. Dual employment would involve receiving salaries or wages from multiple employers, which is not the case here.Here's a breakdown to clarify:Section 194BA: This section relates totax deducted at source (TDS)on winnings from online games like Dream11. The ₹3 deduction you see is TDS on the winnings, not employment income. It’s automatically deducted when your winnings cross a certain threshold, so it won’t affect your employment status.Form 26AS: Form 26AS is a consolidated statement of tax deducted, tax collected, and advance tax paid. TDS from online gaming platforms will appear here, but it’s listed under “Other Sources,” not “Salary.” This ensures it is clear it’s not employment income.Tax Implications: Income from Dream11 falls underincome from other sourceswhen you file your tax return, and it is not considered salary income or part of dual employment.In summary, this TDS deduction from Dream11 is unrelated to dual employment and simply reflects tax on your gaming winnings. You should report it as income from other sources when you file your tax return.Shubham GoyalAdvocate, Delhi1186 Answers7 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shubham Goyal"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you are working in an MNC and also play fantasy games such as Dream 11. Whether the same would be considered as dual employment is your query. Herein, firstly, with respect to the nature of income, the income from such games may be classified as 'Income from other sources' under the Income Tax Act, and hence tax may be deducted for the same. With respect to dual employment, playing Dream11 may not constitute another employment apart from working in MNC, as it is a form of investment or a game, and not an employment as such. Additionally, since the TDS has been deducted, the amount would be reflected in your Form 26 AS.

Police can neither register the FIR nor can investigate or effect arrest without the express permission or directions from the Court are known as Non-cognizable offences. These mostly include minor offences such as abusing each other, minor scuffles without injuries, intimidation etc.Please note that Section 329 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 defines that whoever enters into property in the possession of another with the intent to commit an offence or to intimidate, insult or annoy any person in possession of such property, or having lawfully entered into such property, but remains there with intent thereby to intimidate, insult or any such person, or with an intent to commit an offence, is said to commit ‘criminal trespass’. Further, Section 331 defines the punishment for house-trepass or house breaking and specifies punishment with imprisonment which may extend to two years and fine. In addition, Section 333 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 mentions House-trespass after preparation of hurt, assault, or wrongful restraint. It holds significance within the realm of criminal law as it addresses the offense of house trespass after preparation for hurt, assault, or wrongful restraint. This provision is designed to safeguard the sanctity of personal spaces and ensure the security and well-being of individuals within their own premises and specifies imprisonment which may extend to 7 years and fine. Further, all these offences are cognizable and non-bailable admittedly the other side have committed the aforesaid punishable offences. Therefore, police ought to have registered a serious cognizable FIR to address your grievance.You can issue a legal notice through lawyer in this regard. Notice is, therefore, a formal communication to a person or an entity, informing the other party of your intention to undertake legal proceedings against them. This notice, when sent, conveys your intention before the legal proceedings and thus, makes the party aware of your grievance. Many times, a legal notice served will bring the other party to heel, and the problem is often resolved out of court, well before it goes to trial, with fruitful discussions on both sides. However, if the other party is still unheeding the grievance, one can always start the court proceedings. The bottom line is that it can serve as a point of reference to embark upon negotiations between two parties and save both the time, effort, and money that is usually spent in court cases.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with relevant documents.

    "question": "Dual employment",
    "answer": "Playing on Dream11 or similar platforms does not fall under dual employment, as dual employment generally refers to holding two jobs with two different employers simultaneously. Dual employment would involve receiving salaries or wages from multiple employers, which is not the case here.Here's a breakdown to clarify:Section 194BA: This section relates totax deducted at source (TDS)on winnings from online games like Dream11. The ₹3 deduction you see is TDS on the winnings, not employment income. It’s automatically deducted when your winnings cross a certain threshold, so it won’t affect your employment status.Form 26AS: Form 26AS is a consolidated statement of tax deducted, tax collected, and advance tax paid. TDS from online gaming platforms will appear here, but it’s listed under “Other Sources,” not “Salary.” This ensures it is clear it’s not employment income.Tax Implications: Income from Dream11 falls underincome from other sourceswhen you file your tax return, and it is not considered salary income or part of dual employment.In summary, this TDS deduction from Dream11 is unrelated to dual employment and simply reflects tax on your gaming winnings. You should report it as income from other sources when you file your tax return.Shubham GoyalAdvocate, Delhi1186 Answers7 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shubham Goyal"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you are working in an MNC and also play fantasy games such as Dream 11. Whether the same would be considered as dual employment is your query. Herein, firstly, with respect to the nature of income, the income from such games may be classified as 'Income from other sources' under the Income Tax Act, and hence tax may be deducted for the same. With respect to dual employment, playing Dream11 may not constitute another employment apart from working in MNC, as it is a form of investment or a game, and not an employment as such. Additionally, since the TDS has been deducted, the amount would be reflected in your Form 26 AS. However, you must declare your income from the game as well, to avoid any further issues with the tax authorities.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, after he passed away in 1995, your father along with his two brothers continued to do the business. The three brothers were made partners in the business before your grandfather passed away. In 2017, your two brothers relinquished their rights and your father along with your mother became the partners. In all the years, the rent receipt was given in the name of the shop and not on individual. Recently, the landlord sent a notice stating that your father is an unlawful tenant as there was no intimation of inheritance. Though you have submitted all the relevant documents, there was no acknowledgement from the other side, and hence, you want to know if the landlord has any right to evict you. Herein, taking into consideration the Rent Control Act, Property Laws, and the Succession Laws, firstly, there is a dilemma on whether there has been a proper communication with respect to the inheritance. However, if you have submitted proper documentation, the lack of acknowledgement would be irrelevant. Further, if the landlord had accepted the rent without any challenge to the same, there can usually be no claim be made against you for an unlawful tenant.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Please Suggest on Property Dispute as per Issue below??",
    "answer": "A registered gift deed can be canceled under certain circumstances:Donor's right to cancel:The donor, or person who gifted the property, can cancel a gift deed if they have a valid reason. Valid reasons include fraud, coercion, or the donee failing to fulfill their obligations.Time limit;The donor must cancel the gift deed within three years of becoming aware of the reason for cancellation.Cancellation process:The donor must file a petition in the relevant court, provide evidence, and obtain a court order.Unilateral cancellation of the registered gift deed by your grandmother is not legally valid, your grandmother's daughter can file a suit for declaring the unilateral  cancellation  of the gift deed. as null and void.A senior citizen cannot unilaterally revoke a registered gift deed. However, there are specific circumstances in which a gift deed can be revoked, including:Fraud, coercion, or undue influence:A gift deed can be revoked if it can be proven in court that it was made under these circumstance.A gift of property cannot be revoked or cancelled unilaterallybut it can be revoked in specific circumstances. Accordingly, the 2022 gift deed may be revoked by you in three eventualities. First, if you can prove before a court that the gift deed was made by you in circumstances of fraud, coercion, or undue influence.As per Indian laws, transfer of property by way of gifts are irrevocable or unchangeable and after the execution is complete, the same cannot be cancelled.The Donor cannot rescind such transfer of property once it has been accepted by the Donee. However,if both the parties decide mutually that the gift shall revoked upon the happening of an event, it shall be deemed as a valid revocation.Moreover, the law on voidable contracts, is also applicable to gift deeds. If any gift deed is obtained by any of the vitiating factors such coercion, fraud or misrepresentation then it will be voidable at the instance of the Donor."

    "question": "Please Suggest on Property Dispute as per Issue below??",
    "answer": "Your case presents a complex property dispute, primarily revolving around revocation of a gift deed, the rights of a senior citizen, and questions of necessary party involvement. Here's a general guide for each issue based on similar cases in property law, particularly focusing on gift deeds and senior citizen protection laws:1. Legal Procedure to Cancel a Gift Deed Given to the Daughter by the MotherA gift deed is generally irrevocable, but it can be canceled if it was executed under undue influence, fraud, or misrepresentation. Since your grandmother claims she wasn’t aware of the gift deed registration, you may need to:File a civil suit challenging the gift deed’s validity in the appropriate civil court.Provide evidence of your grandmother’s lack of awareness or possible coercion during the registration process.Given her age, you could file a petition under theMaintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, to argue undue influence and secure her rights to the property.2. Civil Court or RDO Court Due to Senior Citizen StatusTheMaintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, allows senior citizens to revoke gift deeds if they were executed under coercion or if the recipient fails to care for the elderly grantor. This process is usually managed by the RDO (Revenue Divisional Officer) court.Initiate proceedings under Section 23 of the Act at the RDO court, citing her senior status and lack of consent. This process may offer faster relief than the civil court.3. Non-joinder of Necessary PartiesThe daughter’s suit without including your grandmother as a party may be seen as a case of non-joinder of a necessary party, especially since your grandmother has an interest in the land.Your lawyer can file a motion to dismiss or challenge the suit based on non-joinder, arguing that your grandmother is an essential party whose interests are directly affected by the property.4. Validity of the Gift Deed Revoked Solely by Your GrandmotherA gift deed revocation is typically effective only if done by a court or RDO order. Therefore, the sole revocation by your grandmother may not hold unless it follows legal procedures.You’ll need to validate the revocation by initiating a court process, especially if the daughter challenges it. Supporting evidence of your grandmother’s lack of awareness at the time of the gift deed may help the court see grounds for revocation.5. Applicability of Section 23 of the Senior Citizens Act, 2007Section 23 provides grounds for revocation if a property transfer to children is conditional upon their care, and they fail in this duty. Based on this, the RDO court can indeed revoke the gift deed if the daughter neglected or failed to support your grandmother.Since this falls within the Act, you could proceed through the RDO court under this provision, especially as it can offer a more streamlined process than civil court.6. Injunction Between Siblings in Family Property DisputesInjunctions can be requested in family property disputes if there’s evidence of trespass or other improper interference. However, if your grandmother is the true owner, her interests should supersede those of her children in the injunction proceedings.Your lawyer might challenge the interim injunction in court by arguing your grandmother’s ownership or by presenting the revocation and her current intentions regarding the property.7. Adding Your Grandmother as a Witness or Filing for RevocationYour grandmother can be added as a necessary party or a witness in the daughter’s case, especially as her legal and beneficial interests are directly impacted.Additionally, filing an independent revocation action, possibly combined with her case under the Senior Citizens Act, may strengthen her position and highlight the undue influence in court.8. Use of Web History and MRO Office Records for CounterThe MRO office records and web history may be useful in showing that your grandmother had no intent to transfer the property. If these records indicate inconsistencies in the transfer or reveal that she was unaware, they could strengthen your counterclaim.9. Absence of Passbook or Documents by the DaughterThe daughter’s failure to submit official documents for the agricultural land may weaken her claim. The absence of the passbook could raise questions about her legal claim and intent.Bring this up with the court as part of your grandmother's counter, as this documentation is often crucial in establishing legal ownership.In summary, it seems appropriate to proceed by challenging the gift deed in the RDO court due to her senior status and invoking Section 23 of the Senior Citizens Act. Also, consider approaching civil court to tackle the injunction and non-joinder issues while presenting strong evidence for your grandmother's claims.Shubham GoyalAdvocate, Delhi1186 Answers7 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shubham Goyal"

Further, there is a ground floor with two rooms for a shop and watchman stay, two floors above, and one more floor with a pent house with two rooms for rent. Further, property may not be divided vertically due to construction. Also, your brother wants the ground floor and 1st floor. You had told him to take the second floor and pent house. But the resale value of the ground floor is higher than the pent house. Herein, firstly, you may allocate the specific floors to each brother based on a mutual agreement between you, wherein, your brother may take the ground and first floor, and you may take the second floor and the pent house. Secondly, you may make a division on the basis of resale value. Thirdly, you may draft a sale agreement as to how the profit sharing would take place, based on the floor each occupies.

    "question": "Cheque details before deposit, new cheque related laws",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. My team has dealt with various disputes of such nature. You can go ahead and deposit the cheque in bank and by only presenting the cheque in bank, it can add pressure on him. Pro Note is valid evidence to prove your case in Cour of law. No one is above the law. Let me be clear - no one is above the law. Not a politician, not a priest, not a criminal and not even a police officer. We are all accountable for our actions. As per guidelines of Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the validity period of cheque from the date of issue is 3 months.Acheque bounce, also known as a dishonored cheque, occurs when a cheque issued by someone (drawer) cannot be cleared due to insufficient funds or any other reason in their account. In India, the Negotiable Instruments Act (NI Act) governscheque bouncecases andCheque BounceCase Procedure pursuing legal action.After the cheque gets dishonoured, a legal notice should be sent by way of R.P.A.D. to the drawer of the cheque through an advocate within 30 days from the date of the cheque return memo. Demanding the amount of the cheque within 15 days from the date of receipt of the notice.When the drawer fails to repay the amount within 15 days from the service of the notice, the receiver can file a criminal complaint against the drawer u/s 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The complaint must be filed before the Magistrate within 30 days after the expiration of 15 days from the service of notice.The affidavit is filed and attached to the complaint. The Court examines the original documents and checks for validity and limitation of the complaint filed. The complaint can also be filed by the power of attorney of the complainant. After satisfaction, the court issues a summons against the accused, and the case is tried as a summary criminal proceeding.When the accused presents himself before the court, the court asks the accused to furnish surety and to submit bail bonds, in order to make certain that the accused will remain present on every date of the proceedings. The plea of the accused is recorded, and particulars are framed.At the stage of evidence, the complainant files all the original documents before the court, followed by an examination in chief and cross examination of the complainant. The complainant can give further witnesses if he wants to; otherwise, the evidence of the complainant is closed.Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, provides presumptions in favour of a complaint. Accused can rebut the presumption by taking a probable defence. After competition of complainant’s evidence, statement u/s 313 ofCode of Criminal Procedure, of accused is recorded. Accused can give his witnesses if he wants to.After closing of evidence of both sides, arguments are heard by both parties and conducted by their respective counsels. Then the court pronounces judgement in open court. Furthermore, a criminal complaint can also be filed for early action and to build pressure on him.After the amendment of 2002, the term of imprisonment was extended to 2 years, or the fine, which may extend to double the amount of the cheque or both.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification with documents.Shri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "question": "Pagdi commercial property inheritance right",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, your grandfather had started a business more than 50 years back in a commercial pagdi property. However, after he passed away in 1995, your father along with his two brothers continued to do the business. The three brothers were made partners in the business before your grandfather passed away. In 2017, your two brothers relinquished their rights and your father along with your mother became the partners. In all the years, the rent receipt was given in the name of the shop and not on individual. Recently, the landlord sent a notice stating that your father is an unlawful tenant as there was no intimation of inheritance. Though you have submitted all the relevant documents, there was no acknowledgement from the other side, and hence, you want to know if the landlord has any right to evict you. Herein, taking into consideration the Rent Control Act, Property Laws, and the Succession Laws, firstly, there is a dilemma on whether there has been a proper communication with respect to the inheritance. However, if you have submitted proper documentation, the lack of acknowledgement would be irrelevant. Further, if the landlord had accepted the rent without any challenge to the same, there can usually be no claim be made against you for an unlawful tenant.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Please Suggest on Property Dispute as per Issue below??",
    "answer": "A registered gift deed can be canceled under certain circumstances:Donor's right to cancel:The donor, or person who gifted the property, can cancel a gift deed if they have a valid reason. Valid reasons include fraud, coercion, or the donee failing to fulfill their obligations.Time limit;The donor must cancel the gift deed within three years of becoming aware of the reason for cancellation.Cancellation process:The donor must file a petition in the relevant court, provide evidence, and obtain a court order.Unilateral cancellation of the registered gift deed by your grandmother is not legally valid, your grandmother's daughter can file a suit for declaring the unilateral  cancellation  of the gift deed. as null and void.A senior citizen cannot unilaterally revoke a registered gift deed. However, there are specific circumstances in which a gift deed can be revoked, including:Fraud, coercion, or undue influence:A gift deed can be revoked if it can be proven in court that it was made under these circumstance.A gift of property cannot be revoked or cancelled unilaterallybut it can be revoked in specific circumstances. Accordingly, the 2022 gift deed may be revoked by you in three eventualities. First, if you can prove before a court that the gift deed was made by you in circumstances of fraud, coercion, or undue influence.As per Indian laws, transfer of property by way of gifts are irrevocable or unchangeable and after the execution is complete, the same cannot be cancelled.The Donor cannot rescind such transfer of property once it has been accepted by the Donee. However,if both the parties decide mutually that the gift shall revoked upon the happening of an event, it shall be deemed as a valid revocation.Moreover, the law on voidable contracts, is also applicable to gift deeds. If any gift deed is obtained by any of the vitiating factors such coercion, fraud or misrepresentation then it will be voidable at the instance of the Donor."

    "question": "Please Suggest on Property Dispute as per Issue below??",
    "answer": "Your case presents a complex property dispute, primarily revolving around revocation of a gift deed, the rights of a senior citizen, and questions of necessary party involvement. Here's a general guide for each issue based on similar cases in property law, particularly focusing on gift deeds and senior citizen protection laws:1. Legal Procedure to Cancel a Gift Deed Given to the Daughter by the MotherA gift deed is generally irrevocable, but it can be canceled if it was executed under undue influence, fraud, or misrepresentation. Since your grandmother claims she wasn’t aware of the gift deed registration, you may need to:File a civil suit challenging the gift deed’s validity in the appropriate civil court.Provide evidence of your grandmother’s lack of awareness or possible coercion during the registration process.Given her age, you could file a petition under theMaintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, to argue undue influence and secure her rights to the property.2. Civil Court or RDO Court Due to Senior Citizen StatusTheMaintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, allows senior citizens to revoke gift deeds if they were executed under coercion or if the recipient fails to care for the elderly grantor. This process is usually managed by the RDO (Revenue Divisional Officer) court.Initiate proceedings under Section 23 of the Act at the RDO court, citing her senior status and lack of consent. This process may offer faster relief than the civil court.3. Non-joinder of Necessary PartiesThe daughter’s suit without including your grandmother as a party may be seen as a case of non-joinder of a necessary party, especially since your grandmother has an interest in the land.Your lawyer can file a motion to dismiss or challenge the suit based on non-joinder, arguing that your grandmother is an essential party whose interests are directly affected by the property.4. Validity of the Gift Deed Revoked Solely by Your GrandmotherA gift deed revocation is typically effective only if done by a court or RDO order. Therefore, the sole revocation by your grandmother may not hold unless it follows legal procedures.You’ll need to validate the revocation by initiating a court process, especially if the daughter challenges it. Supporting evidence of your grandmother’s lack of awareness at the time of the gift deed may help the court see grounds for revocation.5. Applicability of Section 23 of the Senior Citizens Act, 2007Section 23 provides grounds for revocation if a property transfer to children is conditional upon their care, and they fail in this duty. Based on this, the RDO court can indeed revoke the gift deed if the daughter neglected or failed to support your grandmother.Since this falls within the Act, you could proceed through the RDO court under this provision, especially as it can offer a more streamlined process than civil court.6. Injunction Between Siblings in Family Property DisputesInjunctions can be requested in family property disputes if there’s evidence of trespass or other improper interference. However, if your grandmother is the true owner, her interests should supersede those of her children in the injunction proceedings.Your lawyer might challenge the interim injunction in court by arguing your grandmother’s ownership or by presenting the revocation and her current intentions regarding the property.7. Adding Your Grandmother as a Witness or Filing for RevocationYour grandmother can be added as a necessary party or a witness in the daughter’s case, especially as her legal and beneficial interests are directly impacted.Additionally, filing an independent revocation action, possibly combined with her case under the Senior Citizens Act, may strengthen her position and highlight the undue influence in court.8. Use of Web History and MRO Office Records for CounterThe MRO office records and web history may be useful in showing that your grandmother had no intent to transfer the property. If these records indicate inconsistencies in the transfer or reveal that she was unaware, they could strengthen your counterclaim.9. Absence of Passbook or Documents by the DaughterThe daughter’s failure to submit official documents for the agricultural land may weaken her claim. The absence of the passbook could raise questions about her legal claim and intent.Bring this up with the court as part of your grandmother's counter, as this documentation is often crucial in establishing legal ownership.In summary, it seems appropriate to proceed by challenging the gift deed in the RDO court due to her senior status and invoking Section 23 of the Senior Citizens Act. Also, consider approaching civil court to tackle the injunction and non-joinder issues while presenting strong evidence for your grandmother's claims.Shubham GoyalAdvocate, Delhi1186 Answers7 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shubham Goyal"

    "question": "How to file a domestic violence case",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. My team has dealt with various disputes of such nature.This is yet another unfortunate matrimonial dispute which has shattered the 18 years old matrimonial bond between the parties. They say marriages are made in heaven. But so is thunder and lightning. At times, despite our best efforts, life takes a turn for the worst. We may have wanted different things from life, but life’s got its own plan as well. A bad marriage is something which nobody hopes for, but at times, that’s exactly what we are given and forced to face head on. Marriage does not guarantee that you will be together forever, it’s only paper. It takes love, respect, trust, faith, understanding and friendship in your relationship to make it last forever.You stated that she is married since l8 years and therefore there maybe some children from the wedlock. The petition can be filed either at Delhi or Gurgoan.TheHindu Marriage Act, 1955 provides for 2 ways to obtain divorce from your spouse:Mutual Consent Divorceunder Section 13-B of the ActContested Divorce under Section 13 of the ActOf course, the easiest way to obtain a Divorce is by Mutual Consent of both husband and wife. The one time alimony and child custody can be decided mutually. However, at times, the circumstances are not that easy, the situations are not that easy, and the other spouse itself may not be easy to handle as well. In that case, the only option left is to apply for a Contested Divorce under theHindu Marriage Act.Once the Petition has been finalized with the help a lawyer, the person would be required to sign the Petition, supporting Affidavits, Vakalatnama, etc. in the presence of an authorized Oath Commissioner/Notary. After the completion of all the formalities, the Divorce Petition would be filed before the appropriate Court by the Lawyer, as per the applicable territorial jurisdiction.Normally, a Contested Divorce Petition is listed for hearing within 7-10 days from the date of filing, however, it may take few or more days to get listed subject to the workload of the Court which is to hear the Divorce case.Now, before the actual Divorce proceedings can begin, the Divorce Petition itself needs to be admitted by the Court. On the first date of hearing, the Judge would carefully study the Petition and hear opening arguments from the Lawyer regarding the allegations made in the Petition and the grounds on which the Contested Divorce is being sought.Once the Court is satisfied that, on a preliminary level, the case seems to be carrying some weight and needs to be properly adjudicated, the Court would issue a formal notice of the case to be served upon the opposite side. Subsequently, a copy of the notice along with the Petition would be sent to the opposite side.On the next date of hearing, the opposite side is supposed to appear in person along with its Lawyer and also file its reply to the Divorce Petition. The other side is also required to a file a reply to any Application (usually for maintenance or custody of child) which may have be filed along with the Divorce Petition.At the initial stage of the case, the Court will try to resolve the dispute between the parties, and will also direct both the parties to appear before a Mediator for an amicable solution to their marital issues.In case the mediation sessions are not fruitful and the issue between the parties are not resolved, the Court would continue further with the Divorce proceedings.If an Application for maintenance is filed (usually) by the wife, the Court would first decide the Application so as to ensure financial security of the wife during the pendency of the Divorce Petition.Subsequently, the Court would proceed towards framing of issues and recording of evidence. Examination-in-Chief and Cross-Examination of the Petitioner and its supporting witnesses would be recorded first, followed by Examination-in-Chief and Cross-Examination of the Respondent and its supporting witnesses. This is the most crucial stage of the entire case. It has the potential to make or break a case. Therefore, the stage of recording of evidence usually takes a lot of time and a lot of hearings to conclude.After the evidence of both the parties has been recorded, the Lawyers for both the parties would be required to address their final closing arguments before the Court. Subsequent to which, the Court would fix a date on which it shall pronounce its decision.In case, the decision passed by the Court is not acceptable to either of the parties, that party can file an Appeal against that Order within a period of 3 months from the date of the order.Divorce can be sought on the ground of cruelty. Cruelty can be physical or mental. Cruelty which is a ground for dissolution of marriage may be defined as wilful and unjustifiable conduct of such character as to cause danger to life, limb or health, bodily or mental, or as to give rise to a reasonable apprehension of such a danger. The question of mental cruelty has to be considered in the light of the norms of marital ties of the particular society to which the parties belong, their social values, status, environment in which they live.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with relevant documents.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, your neighbour is constructing a house with 4 floors by violating the norms of obstructing natural light and air. Further, he did not oblige to any peaceful requests to leave the mandatory setbacks. He is a land developer and civil contractor with political backing. Further, he is also a habitual offender with more than 20 civil and criminal cases pending against him. You have filed a complaint in Bangalore City Corporation one year back. However, on multiple requests, they have issued demolition order. The Neighbour had also approached the civil court with corporation and obtained a stay order against the city corporations 6 months back. You suspect if the corporation authorities would pursue the case genuinely as the hearings are frequently postponed without any reason. Your parents are senior citizens with frequent health issues and natural air and light is necessary for them. Herein, firstly, you may file a petition against your neighbour for violating your right to natural light and air. Secondly, you may file an application in the civil court, for a stay order on the construction. However, it is suggested that proper documentation is maintained regarding the issue.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Alimony for less than 1 year marriage",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. My team has dealt with various disputes of such nature. They say marriages are made in heaven. But so is thunder and lightning. At times, despite our best efforts, life takes a turn for the worst. We may have wanted different things from life, but life’s got its own plan as well. A bad marriage is something which nobody hopes for, but at times, that’s exactly what we are given and forced to face head on. Marriage does not guarantee that you will be together forever, it’s only paper. It takes love, respect, trust, faith, understanding and friendship in your relationship to make it last forever.At the outset, it is crucial here to mention that you should have filed for annulment of marriage on the ground that she is mentally ill.Section 12 of theHindu Marriage Actstates that:-(1) Any marriage solemnised, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, shall be voidable and may be annulled by a decree of nullity on any of the following grounds, namely:(a) that the marriage has not been consummated owing to the impotence of the respondent; or(b)that the marriage is in contravention of the condition specified in clause (ii) of section 5; or(c)that the consent of the petitioner, or where the consent of the guardian in marriage of the petitioner was required under section 5 as it stood immediately before the commencement of the Child Marriage Restraint (Amendment) Act, 1978 (2 of 1978), the consent of such guardian was obtained by force or by fraud as to the nature of the ceremony or as to any material fact or circumstance concerning the respondent;or(d)that the respondent was at the time of the marriage pregnant by some person other than the petitioner.(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), no petition for annulling a marriage—(a) on the ground specified in clause (c) of sub-section (1) shall be entertained if—(i) the petition is presented more than one year after the force had ceased to operate or, as the case may be, the fraud had been discovered;or (ii) the petitioner has, with his or her full consent, lived with the other party to the marriage as husband or wife after the force had ceased to operate or, as the case may be, the fraud had been discovered;Please note that Section 12 (1) (c) is applicable in your case as your consent was obtained by fraud and the material fact i.e. she is mentally ill was suppressed from you and as per sub section (2) the petition has to be filed within one year of discovery of fraud.Supreme Court in case of Kollam Chandra Sekhar v, Kollam Padma Latha, (2014) 1 SCC 225, by relying on the testimony of a doctor that Schizophrenia “is a treatable, manageable disease, which can be put on a par with hypertension and diabetes.”In another case, Sharda v. Dharampal, (2003) 4 SCC 493, the Court observed that “but it is another thing to say that a party may be asked to submit himself to a psychiatrist or a psychoanalyst so as to enable the Court to arrive at a just conclusion. Whether the party to the marriage requires a treatment or not can be found out only in the event, he is examined by a properly qualified Psychiatrist.”Therefore, your wife would be asked to submit the proof of mental illness. As stated above that since the fraud is committed by her, therefore, she is not eligible for any alimony amount, however, detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete documents.

    "question": "How to file a domestic violence case",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. My team has dealt with various disputes of such nature.This is yet another unfortunate matrimonial dispute which has shattered the 18 years old matrimonial bond between the parties. They say marriages are made in heaven. But so is thunder and lightning. At times, despite our best efforts, life takes a turn for the worst. We may have wanted different things from life, but life’s got its own plan as well. A bad marriage is something which nobody hopes for, but at times, that’s exactly what we are given and forced to face head on. Marriage does not guarantee that you will be together forever, it’s only paper. It takes love, respect, trust, faith, understanding and friendship in your relationship to make it last forever.You stated that she is married since l8 years and therefore there maybe some children from the wedlock. The petition can be filed either at Delhi or Gurgoan.TheHindu Marriage Act, 1955 provides for 2 ways to obtain divorce from your spouse:Mutual Consent Divorceunder Section 13-B of the ActContested Divorce under Section 13 of the ActOf course, the easiest way to obtain a Divorce is by Mutual Consent of both husband and wife. The one time alimony and child custody can be decided mutually. However, at times, the circumstances are not that easy, the situations are not that easy, and the other spouse itself may not be easy to handle as well. In that case, the only option left is to apply for a Contested Divorce under theHindu Marriage Act.Once the Petition has been finalized with the help a lawyer, the person would be required to sign the Petition, supporting Affidavits, Vakalatnama, etc. in the presence of an authorized Oath Commissioner/Notary. After the completion of all the formalities, the Divorce Petition would be filed before the appropriate Court by the Lawyer, as per the applicable territorial jurisdiction.Normally, a Contested Divorce Petition is listed for hearing within 7-10 days from the date of filing, however, it may take few or more days to get listed subject to the workload of the Court which is to hear the Divorce case.Now, before the actual Divorce proceedings can begin, the Divorce Petition itself needs to be admitted by the Court. On the first date of hearing, the Judge would carefully study the Petition and hear opening arguments from the Lawyer regarding the allegations made in the Petition and the grounds on which the Contested Divorce is being sought.Once the Court is satisfied that, on a preliminary level, the case seems to be carrying some weight and needs to be properly adjudicated, the Court would issue a formal notice of the case to be served upon the opposite side. Subsequently, a copy of the notice along with the Petition would be sent to the opposite side.On the next date of hearing, the opposite side is supposed to appear in person along with its Lawyer and also file its reply to the Divorce Petition. The other side is also required to a file a reply to any Application (usually for maintenance or custody of child) which may have be filed along with the Divorce Petition.At the initial stage of the case, the Court will try to resolve the dispute between the parties, and will also direct both the parties to appear before a Mediator for an amicable solution to their marital issues.In case the mediation sessions are not fruitful and the issue between the parties are not resolved, the Court would continue further with the Divorce proceedings.If an Application for maintenance is filed (usually) by the wife, the Court would first decide the Application so as to ensure financial security of the wife during the pendency of the Divorce Petition.Subsequently, the Court would proceed towards framing of issues and recording of evidence. Examination-in-Chief and Cross-Examination of the Petitioner and its supporting witnesses would be recorded first, followed by Examination-in-Chief and Cross-Examination of the Respondent and its supporting witnesses. This is the most crucial stage of the entire case. It has the potential to make or break a case. Therefore, the stage of recording of evidence usually takes a lot of time and a lot of hearings to conclude.After the evidence of both the parties has been recorded, the Lawyers for both the parties would be required to address their final closing arguments before the Court. Subsequent to which, the Court would fix a date on which it shall pronounce its decision.In case, the decision passed by the Court is not acceptable to either of the parties, that party can file an Appeal against that Order within a period of 3 months from the date of the order.Divorce can be sought on the ground of cruelty. Cruelty can be physical or mental. Cruelty which is a ground for dissolution of marriage may be defined as wilful and unjustifiable conduct of such character as to cause danger to life, limb or health, bodily or mental, or as to give rise to a reasonable apprehension of such a danger. The question of mental cruelty has to be considered in the light of the norms of marital ties of the particular society to which the parties belong, their social values, status, environment in which they live.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with relevant documents.

    "question": "Please Suggest on Property Dispute as per Issue below??",
    "answer": "A registered gift deed can be canceled under certain circumstances:Donor's right to cancel:The donor, or person who gifted the property, can cancel a gift deed if they have a valid reason. Valid reasons include fraud, coercion, or the donee failing to fulfill their obligations.Time limit;The donor must cancel the gift deed within three years of becoming aware of the reason for cancellation.Cancellation process:The donor must file a petition in the relevant court, provide evidence, and obtain a court order.Unilateral cancellation of the registered gift deed by your grandmother is not legally valid, your grandmother's daughter can file a suit for declaring the unilateral  cancellation  of the gift deed. as null and void.A senior citizen cannot unilaterally revoke a registered gift deed. However, there are specific circumstances in which a gift deed can be revoked, including:Fraud, coercion, or undue influence:A gift deed can be revoked if it can be proven in court that it was made under these circumstance.A gift of property cannot be revoked or cancelled unilaterallybut it can be revoked in specific circumstances. Accordingly, the 2022 gift deed may be revoked by you in three eventualities. First, if you can prove before a court that the gift deed was made by you in circumstances of fraud, coercion, or undue influence.As per Indian laws, transfer of property by way of gifts are irrevocable or unchangeable and after the execution is complete, the same cannot be cancelled.The Donor cannot rescind such transfer of property once it has been accepted by the Donee. However,if both the parties decide mutually that the gift shall revoked upon the happening of an event, it shall be deemed as a valid revocation.Moreover, the law on voidable contracts, is also applicable to gift deeds. If any gift deed is obtained by any of the vitiating factors such coercion, fraud or misrepresentation then it will be voidable at the instance of the Donor."

    "answer": "1. Sir, gift deeds are generally irrevocable, however, given the conditions mentioned in your query, you can go ahead with the revocation.2. I would suggest you to approach the civil court rather than going for RDO, as the matter is already sub judice and filing a case other than the civil court will be barred by the principal of res-sub judice.3. This can be a valid ground (inter-alia), for showcasing your bona fide to seek the revocation of the gift deed.4. Yes, of course.5. Already answered in point no. 3.6. It is premature for me to comment on that without seeing the actual injunction order, but generally the injunction is imposed on the property and is applicable to all, irrespective of whether he/she is a party to the suit or not.7.

    "question": "Please Suggest on Property Dispute as per Issue below??",
    "answer": "Your case presents a complex property dispute, primarily revolving around revocation of a gift deed, the rights of a senior citizen, and questions of necessary party involvement. Here's a general guide for each issue based on similar cases in property law, particularly focusing on gift deeds and senior citizen protection laws:1. Legal Procedure to Cancel a Gift Deed Given to the Daughter by the MotherA gift deed is generally irrevocable, but it can be canceled if it was executed under undue influence, fraud, or misrepresentation. Since your grandmother claims she wasn’t aware of the gift deed registration, you may need to:File a civil suit challenging the gift deed’s validity in the appropriate civil court.Provide evidence of your grandmother’s lack of awareness or possible coercion during the registration process.Given her age, you could file a petition under theMaintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, to argue undue influence and secure her rights to the property.2. Civil Court or RDO Court Due to Senior Citizen StatusTheMaintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, allows senior citizens to revoke gift deeds if they were executed under coercion or if the recipient fails to care for the elderly grantor. This process is usually managed by the RDO (Revenue Divisional Officer) court.Initiate proceedings under Section 23 of the Act at the RDO court, citing her senior status and lack of consent. This process may offer faster relief than the civil court.3. Non-joinder of Necessary PartiesThe daughter’s suit without including your grandmother as a party may be seen as a case of non-joinder of a necessary party, especially since your grandmother has an interest in the land.Your lawyer can file a motion to dismiss or challenge the suit based on non-joinder, arguing that your grandmother is an essential party whose interests are directly affected by the property.4. Validity of the Gift Deed Revoked Solely by Your GrandmotherA gift deed revocation is typically effective only if done by a court or RDO order. Therefore, the sole revocation by your grandmother may not hold unless it follows legal procedures.You’ll need to validate the revocation by initiating a court process, especially if the daughter challenges it. Supporting evidence of your grandmother’s lack of awareness at the time of the gift deed may help the court see grounds for revocation.5. Applicability of Section 23 of the Senior Citizens Act, 2007Section 23 provides grounds for revocation if a property transfer to children is conditional upon their care, and they fail in this duty. Based on this, the RDO court can indeed revoke the gift deed if the daughter neglected or failed to support your grandmother.Since this falls within the Act, you could proceed through the RDO court under this provision, especially as it can offer a more streamlined process than civil court.6. Injunction Between Siblings in Family Property DisputesInjunctions can be requested in family property disputes if there’s evidence of trespass or other improper interference. However, if your grandmother is the true owner, her interests should supersede those of her children in the injunction proceedings.Your lawyer might challenge the interim injunction in court by arguing your grandmother’s ownership or by presenting the revocation and her current intentions regarding the property.7. Adding Your Grandmother as a Witness or Filing for RevocationYour grandmother can be added as a necessary party or a witness in the daughter’s case, especially as her legal and beneficial interests are directly impacted.Additionally, filing an independent revocation action, possibly combined with her case under the Senior Citizens Act, may strengthen her position and highlight the undue influence in court.8. Use of Web History and MRO Office Records for CounterThe MRO office records and web history may be useful in showing that your grandmother had no intent to transfer the property. If these records indicate inconsistencies in the transfer or reveal that she was unaware, they could strengthen your counterclaim.9. Absence of Passbook or Documents by the DaughterThe daughter’s failure to submit official documents for the agricultural land may weaken her claim. The absence of the passbook could raise questions about her legal claim and intent.Bring this up with the court as part of your grandmother's counter, as this documentation is often crucial in establishing legal ownership.In summary, it seems appropriate to proceed by challenging the gift deed in the RDO court due to her senior status and invoking Section 23 of the Senior Citizens Act. Also, consider approaching civil court to tackle the injunction and non-joinder issues while presenting strong evidence for your grandmother's claims.Shubham GoyalAdvocate, Delhi1186 Answers7 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shubham Goyal"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you got married in April 2022, and after about 9 months, you came to know that your wife is mentally ill, that was not disclosed at the time of marriage. And hence, you decided to file for divorce. However, your wife is an engineering graduate, but not sure if working or not, and now is asking alimony for divorce. Herein, taking into consideration theHindu Marriage Act, it is to the discretion of the court to grant alimony to either party. However, the amount of alimony would be determined on the basis of financial status of both of you, the duration of the marriage and the needs of your wife. If you can however, prove that the mental illness information was not disclosed to you at the time of marriage, you may be granted a divorce. Though your wife is an engineering graduate, her employment status would be taken as a primary factor to determine the alimony amount. But, the non-disclosure of such information, would not automatically dis-entitle her from receiving alimony.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Alimony for less than 1 year marriage",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. My team has dealt with various disputes of such nature. They say marriages are made in heaven. But so is thunder and lightning. At times, despite our best efforts, life takes a turn for the worst. We may have wanted different things from life, but life’s got its own plan as well. A bad marriage is something which nobody hopes for, but at times, that’s exactly what we are given and forced to face head on. Marriage does not guarantee that you will be together forever, it’s only paper. It takes love, respect, trust, faith, understanding and friendship in your relationship to make it last forever.At the outset, it is crucial here to mention that you should have filed for annulment of marriage on the ground that she is mentally ill.Section 12 of theHindu Marriage Actstates that:-(1) Any marriage solemnised, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, shall be voidable and may be annulled by a decree of nullity on any of the following grounds, namely:(a) that the marriage has not been consummated owing to the impotence of the respondent; or(b)that the marriage is in contravention of the condition specified in clause (ii) of section 5; or(c)that the consent of the petitioner, or where the consent of the guardian in marriage of the petitioner was required under section 5 as it stood immediately before the commencement of the Child Marriage Restraint (Amendment) Act, 1978 (2 of 1978), the consent of such guardian was obtained by force or by fraud as to the nature of the ceremony or as to any material fact or circumstance concerning the respondent;or(d)that the respondent was at the time of the marriage pregnant by some person other than the petitioner.(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), no petition for annulling a marriage—(a) on the ground specified in clause (c) of sub-section (1) shall be entertained if—(i) the petition is presented more than one year after the force had ceased to operate or, as the case may be, the fraud had been discovered;or (ii) the petitioner has, with his or her full consent, lived with the other party to the marriage as husband or wife after the force had ceased to operate or, as the case may be, the fraud had been discovered;Please note that Section 12 (1) (c) is applicable in your case as your consent was obtained by fraud and the material fact i.e. she is mentally ill was suppressed from you and as per sub section (2) the petition has to be filed within one year of discovery of fraud.Supreme Court in case of Kollam Chandra Sekhar v, Kollam Padma Latha, (2014) 1 SCC 225, by relying on the testimony of a doctor that Schizophrenia “is a treatable, manageable disease, which can be put on a par with hypertension and diabetes.”In another case, Sharda v. Dharampal, (2003) 4 SCC 493, the Court observed that “but it is another thing to say that a party may be asked to submit himself to a psychiatrist or a psychoanalyst so as to enable the Court to arrive at a just conclusion. Whether the party to the marriage requires a treatment or not can be found out only in the event, he is examined by a properly qualified Psychiatrist.”Therefore, your wife would be asked to submit the proof of mental illness. As stated above that since the fraud is committed by her, therefore, she is not eligible for any alimony amount, however, detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete documents.

Your brother is still processing a divorce as they have an issue. Your question here is that, whether she is allowed to stay in the property or does she have a right on the property owned by you and your father. Herein, since the property has been owned by you and your father, your brother's wife usually would not have a legal right unless there are any specific agreements to that effect. With respect to divorce, while your brother's wife may not have rights in the property per se, the court may consider her situation to provide maintenance or any such arrangements to that effect. However, if you wish that she leaves, you may provide a formal notice as well for her eviction.

    "question": "Alimony for less than 1 year marriage",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you got married in April 2022, and after about 9 months, you came to know that your wife is mentally ill, that was not disclosed at the time of marriage. And hence, you decided to file for divorce. However, your wife is an engineering graduate, but not sure if working or not, and now is asking alimony for divorce. Herein, taking into consideration theHindu Marriage Act, it is to the discretion of the court to grant alimony to either party. However, the amount of alimony would be determined on the basis of financial status of both of you, the duration of the marriage and the needs of your wife. If you can however, prove that the mental illness information was not disclosed to you at the time of marriage, you may be granted a divorce. Though your wife is an engineering graduate, her employment status would be taken as a primary factor to determine the alimony amount. But, the non-disclosure of such information, would not automatically dis-entitle her from receiving alimony.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Alimony for less than 1 year marriage",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. My team has dealt with various disputes of such nature. They say marriages are made in heaven. But so is thunder and lightning. At times, despite our best efforts, life takes a turn for the worst. We may have wanted different things from life, but life’s got its own plan as well. A bad marriage is something which nobody hopes for, but at times, that’s exactly what we are given and forced to face head on. Marriage does not guarantee that you will be together forever, it’s only paper. It takes love, respect, trust, faith, understanding and friendship in your relationship to make it last forever.At the outset, it is crucial here to mention that you should have filed for annulment of marriage on the ground that she is mentally ill.Section 12 of theHindu Marriage Actstates that:-(1) Any marriage solemnised, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, shall be voidable and may be annulled by a decree of nullity on any of the following grounds, namely:(a) that the marriage has not been consummated owing to the impotence of the respondent; or(b)that the marriage is in contravention of the condition specified in clause (ii) of section 5; or(c)that the consent of the petitioner, or where the consent of the guardian in marriage of the petitioner was required under section 5 as it stood immediately before the commencement of the Child Marriage Restraint (Amendment) Act, 1978 (2 of 1978), the consent of such guardian was obtained by force or by fraud as to the nature of the ceremony or as to any material fact or circumstance concerning the respondent;or(d)that the respondent was at the time of the marriage pregnant by some person other than the petitioner.(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), no petition for annulling a marriage—(a) on the ground specified in clause (c) of sub-section (1) shall be entertained if—(i) the petition is presented more than one year after the force had ceased to operate or, as the case may be, the fraud had been discovered;or (ii) the petitioner has, with his or her full consent, lived with the other party to the marriage as husband or wife after the force had ceased to operate or, as the case may be, the fraud had been discovered;Please note that Section 12 (1) (c) is applicable in your case as your consent was obtained by fraud and the material fact i.e. she is mentally ill was suppressed from you and as per sub section (2) the petition has to be filed within one year of discovery of fraud.Supreme Court in case of Kollam Chandra Sekhar v, Kollam Padma Latha, (2014) 1 SCC 225, by relying on the testimony of a doctor that Schizophrenia “is a treatable, manageable disease, which can be put on a par with hypertension and diabetes.”In another case, Sharda v. Dharampal, (2003) 4 SCC 493, the Court observed that “but it is another thing to say that a party may be asked to submit himself to a psychiatrist or a psychoanalyst so as to enable the Court to arrive at a just conclusion. Whether the party to the marriage requires a treatment or not can be found out only in the event, he is examined by a properly qualified Psychiatrist.”Therefore, your wife would be asked to submit the proof of mental illness. As stated above that since the fraud is committed by her, therefore, she is not eligible for any alimony amount, however, detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete documents.

Further, he did not oblige to any peaceful requests to leave the mandatory setbacks. He is a land developer and civil contractor with political backing. Further, he is also a habitual offender with more than 20 civil and criminal cases pending against him. You have filed a complaint in Bangalore City Corporation one year back. However, on multiple requests, they have issued demolition order. The Neighbour had also approached the civil court with corporation and obtained a stay order against the city corporations 6 months back. You suspect if the corporation authorities would pursue the case genuinely as the hearings are frequently postponed without any reason. Your parents are senior citizens with frequent health issues and natural air and light is necessary for them. Herein, firstly, you may file a petition against your neighbour for violating your right to natural light and air. Secondly, you may file an application in the civil court, for a stay order on the construction. However, it is suggested that proper documentation is maintained regarding the issue.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Further, he did not oblige to any peaceful requests to leave the mandatory setbacks. He is a land developer and civil contractor with political backing. Further, he is also a habitual offender with more than 20 civil and criminal cases pending against him. You have filed a complaint in Bangalore City Corporation one year back. However, on multiple requests, they have issued demolition order. The Neighbour had also approached the civil court with corporation and obtained a stay order against the city corporations 6 months back. You suspect if the corporation authorities would pursue the case genuinely as the hearings are frequently postponed without any reason. Your parents are senior citizens with frequent health issues and natural air and light is necessary for them. Herein, firstly, you may file a petition against your neighbour for violating your right to natural light and air. Secondly, you may file an application in the civil court, for a stay order on the construction. However, it is suggested that proper documentation is maintained regarding the issue.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, there are two self-acquired properties of your father that have been divided in partition between you, your brother and your father, in 2003. Your father passed away in 2013 and your mother in 2022, and presently your sisters are asking for an equal share in the properties. Under theHindu Succession Act, when a Hindu male dies, his property usually goes on to his legal heirs. However, it does not automatically pass on to your mother unless the same has been mentioned in his will. With respect to rights of daughters, according to the amendment made in 2005, married daughters are given a right in the father's property, in the same way as that of unmarried daughters. But, usually the property would be divided equally among all the legal heirs, including your mother, sons, and daughters. Arunachala Gounder (Dead) By Lrs v.

    "answer": "Daughter’s Right in PropertyBackground on Property Rights in IndiaSince medieval times till early 1900, Property Rights in India were governed by laws that differed from religion to religion,These property rights differed from region to region.Property Rights of Hindus before 1956, were governed by customary laws & Shashtric laws, these laws varied in some regions of India on caste basis. Mitakshara School of Thought largely governed the Hindu Property Rights.Property rights of Hindus, Sikh, Jain & Buddhist after 1956, were governed by TheHindu Succession Act, 1956.Property rights of Muslims, were largely governed by the imams , imams relied upon the sources of law which the prophet himself directed, some of which are The Qur'an, Sunna or Ahadis, Ijma & Qiyas. Muslim Law is still largely uncodified, & for the said reason courts rely upon the primary sources of Shia Law & the sources above mentioned. Property Rights of Muslim married under TheSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 are not governed by Muslim Law for the purpose of inheritance, instead it is governed by Indian Succession Act, 1925.Property Rights of Persons of other religions were also customary in past but after 1925, Property Rights are governed by Indian Succession Act, 1925.Daughter’s Right in Property underHindu Succession Act, 1956TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, divided property under to subsets, which were self acquired property & ancestral property. Before The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, ancestral property was inherited as the Survivor-ship rule.As per the survivor-ship rule, coparceners were the persons having right over the ancestral property. As per TheHindu Succession Act, 1956 at that time, coparcners were those who were lenial descendants of the same ancestor, till 3 generations next to holder. The flaw in this provision was that it only allowed the male descendants of an ancestor to become coparceners, and in turn the right in inheriting the property were only given to males. This restricted right to inherit property of any female from Hindu, Sikh, Jain & Buddhist communities.In 2005, to curb this discrimination, The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 amended the provisions of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, including Section 6 of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956.The said amendment deleted the Survivor-ship rule. The said amendment bought Intestate Rule for Ancestral Property or when the person dies without will & Testamentary Rule for Self Acquired Property. According to this, a person can give his or her self acquired property by the way of will(testament) to any person. In the case of ancestral property or when a person dies without will, intestate rules govern the inheritance given to the coparceners. Intestate rule create 4 classes of persons as coparceners, which are to be given equal amount of share in property among the classes. These classes include both male & female members of the family, with daughters included in the Class 1 Persons. This rule made daughters coparceners from birth & gave them equal liability.Confusions in the Implementation of The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, came into force from 9 September, 2005. Soon after the enforcement date, while implementation of the provisions of the said amendment, judicial minds started to ponder over the question, as to whether on 9 September, 2005, it is necessary for the father to be alive for daughter to claim its right in ancestral property?In 2016, the above question was answered for the first time by a Supreme Court Bench in the case of Prakash & Ors. V. Phulavati & Ors. The two judge bench headed by Honourable Justice Anil Dave & Honourable Justice A.K. Goyal, held that for a daughter to claim its right in property, father needs to be alive on 9 September, 2005. As per this judgement, both coparcener and his daughter needs to be alive on 9 September, 2005 for the daughters right in property. This judgement restricted the daughters right in property, where the coparcener has expired before September 9, 2005.In 2018, the above question was again put before a Supreme Court Bench in the case of Danamma& Ors. V. Amar & Ors.. The two judge bench headed by Honourable Justice A.K. Sikri & Honourable Justice Ashok Bhushan, held that for a daughter to claim its right in property, father need not be alive as on September 9, 2005. As per this judgement, even though the coparcener have expired before September 9, 2005 in 2001(in this case), prior to the amendment in TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, the daughter can claim its right in her property. This judgement gave every daughter right to claim its right in the property.The judgments, given in Prakash & Ors. V. Phulavati & Ors & Danamma& Ors. V. Amar & Ors., were giving conflicting opinions and no judgement was able to supersede the other judgement by authority, as both judgments were given by two judge Supreme Court Bench.The confusion created by these two judgments continued till 2020. In 2020, the question as to whether on 9 September, 2005, it is necessary for the father to be alive for daughter to claim its right in ancestral property, was again put before The Supreme Court in the case of Vineeta Sharma V. Rakesh Sharma & Ors. but this time the question was answered by a three judge bench, comprising of Honourable Justice Arun Mishra, Honourable Justice S. Abdul Nazeer & Honourable Justice M.R. Shah. The court held that Daughter’s Right in Coparcenary Property given under Section 6 of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, for daughters born before September 9, 2005 has same rights as for daughters born on or after September 9,2005. The court further said that, the necessity of the father to be alive on September 9, 2005 is irrelevant and not required, as the daughter is alive on the September 9, 2005, she becomes coparcener from the date of amendment,I.e. September 9, 2005. The said amendment to Section 6 of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, give status of coparcener to daughters born before or on or after September 9, 2005 in the same way it grant the status of coparcener to sons. As coparcener status under Section 6 of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, is granted by birth it is not necessary for father of daughters to be alive on the  said date of amendment, I.e. September 9, 2005. This judgement ended the confusion and finally gave daughters their right in property.The above judgement of Vineeta Sharma V. Rakesh Sharma & Ors., were relating to coparcenary/ ancestral property & not the self acquired property of father. Thus, the battle for rights were still not over.In 2022, the question of daughters right in self acquired property was properly answered by the Supreme Court in the case of Arunachala Gounder (Dead) by Lrs V.Ponnusamy & Ors.. The two judge bench headed by Honourable Justice S. Abdul Nazeer & Honourable Justice Krishna Murari, held that  self acquired property of male dying intestate would be inherited by testament, and not secession & daughters will have right to inherit the said property or property obtained in partition in case of male expiring without testament or invalid testament. When female is expired instate without any children, then ancestral property inherited from father, the said property will be inherited by fathers heir in accordance with intestate rules. When a female is expired instate without any children, the ancestral property inherited from husband’s side, the said property will be inherited by husband’s heir in accordance with intestate rules. Thus, with this judgement daughters got their right in property.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, Bangalore6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, your relative is facing a criminal case in relation tocheque bounce, as he is a guarantor to a loan taken by his friend in a Cooperative Society Bank, wherein the amount came up to Rs. 3,50,000. Presently, the bank has agreed to take back the case if he pays back Rs. 1,50,000, and hence you wish to enquire on the legal course of actions to be taken so that the back does not ask you to pay the remaining amount, and if there is an option to recover the amount paid by you to the bank. Herein, firstly, it is suggested that your relative has a negotiation with a bank for a formal settlement and agreement of only up to Rs. 1,50,000 from your relative, and not ask the remaining Rs. 2,00,000 for thecheque bounce. With respect to the recovery of amount from his friend, your relative may file a suit under the Specific Relief Act or the Indian Contract Act, claiming that your relative is the guarantor and hence, entitled to recover the amount paid for his friend. To prevent from any future course of action, it is recommended that the statement, of bank to release your relative from recovering for further claims, is clearly documented.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Doubts related to 3 months notice period and relieving letter",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you are working in an IT-Start-up Company, which has specified a notice period of 3 months. But you can serve only for 2 months due to certain constraints. However, the HR and the CEO of the current company are not ready to grant the same, and are also not ready for a buyout option. While you are ready for the Buyout option and pay for the same, they have declined it and told you to serve for a full notice period. But, however, you cannot serve for more than 2 months. With respect to your first query, as to whether they have the right to force you to serve the full notice period of 3 months, as the employment contract stipulates that there is a notice period of 3 months, the company generally has the right to enforce the same upon you. Unless there is an explicit clause stating for the early termination or buyout, the employer may force you to serve the full notice period. With regard to the second query, as to whether, if you serve only 2 months, then will they have the right to stop your reliving letter, although having one and a half years of experience in your current company, yes, there exists a possibility of the same as you have not served the complete notice period. For the third query, according to the Indian Contract Act, 1872, if you fail to fulfil the notice period as stipulated, the employer may have the right to seek damages from you. Henceforth, it is suggested that negotiation sessions may be entered into between you and your employer, to solve the issues and discuss other options.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Doubts related to 3 months notice period and relieving letter",
    "answer": "Resignation/ notice period depends from company to company. As per standing order/ service rule it is generally between 30-90 days and it has to be from both sides. There is no hard a fast rule under any law.A 30 to 90-day notice periodapplies in order to terminate 'workmen' (as defined in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947)There are two types ofnotice period: statutory and contractual. Statutorynoticeis theminimumlegalnoticethat can be given. Employers should give the employee:Is notice period (3 months) legal in India?It can be easily understood that the ambit and scope ofsection 23of the Indian contract act 1872, is vast and therefore the applicability of its provisions is subject to scrutiny by the court of the consideration and object of an agreement and the agreement itself.Therefore, in order to bring a case within the purview of section 23, it is necessary to show that the object of the agreement or consideration of the agreement or the agreement itself is unlawful.I'll keep it short and simple:Either party - employer or employee can terminate the contract by giving sufficient notice or compensating accordingly. In such a case, employer is bound to release the employee without any fuss, assuming that either of the above two conditions are met.So, if your organization doesn't allow you to buyout the notice period, please feel free to knock on the doors of the Indian judiciary.The following key issues should be highlighted:A 30 to 90-day notice period applies in order to terminate ‘workmen’ (as defined in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947) – that is, employees whose role is not primarily supervisory, administrative or managerial) for convenience, with 15 days’ pay due for every year worked. In the case of manufacturing units, plantations and mines with 100 or more workmen, termination for convenience requires prior government approval; in other sectors, it requires only government notification.Termination for cause does not include non-performance – it includes only behaviour which qualifies as misconduct.The ‘last in, first out’ principle requires that the employer first terminate for convenience the last people to join the organisation in the same role. However, this requirement can be contracted out of. When hiring for the same role, workmen who were terminated for convenience should be given the opportunity to re-join the company.State laws generally provide for about 15 days of earned/regular leave a year. Employees also benefit from up to 10 days of sick leave and a possible 10 additional days of ‘casual leave’. This is generally more than what most organisations would ideally like to provide.Most state laws provide for ‘casual leave’ – the employee can opt not to come to work that day without applying for leave in advance. Many organisations find this disruptive.Most state laws restrict women from working at night; if women are to work at night, specific approval must be obtained. This exemption is granted only to limited business sectors (eg, IT sector). Further, the employer must offer door-to-door transport and meet some security-related requirements.Most state laws prescribe overtime for any hours worked beyond 48 hours in a week. However, this is seldom observed.Indian law regulates and in some cases prohibits the use of contract workers. To engage contract workers, the contractor must hold a licence and the employer must be registered as a ‘principal employer’.Non-compete agreements are not enforceable under Indian law, while non-solicitation clauses can be enforced only in limited ways.While the ‘work for hire’ principle applies under the Indian copyright regime, it does not apply under the Indian patent regime; employees must thus provide formal assignments.Indian laws require employers to maintain a plethora of registers and notices. Compliance with such requirements is difficult and full compliance is rare.What do you consider unique to those doing business in your country?Some of the points mentioned above are unique to India. In addition, while Indian employment law is mainly federal in nature, most states have a Shops and Establishments Act. These statutes are similar, but not identical. Further, some states have been permitted to make amendments to central laws, with which are thus applicable in a different manner in such states.Is there any general advice you would give in the employment area?India is heavily regulated in the employment arena. Legal assistance should be obtained with regard to employment contracts and employment terms of service. Practical advice should be sought on best practices and common practices, so that policies are HR friendly and legally compliant. Advice should also be obtained on areas where compliance is difficult, so that employers can adopt positions that balance convenience against risk.Emerging issues/hot topics/proposals for reformAre there any noteworthy proposals for reform in your jurisdiction?As part of the objective to make it easier to do business in India, the government has proposed that the federal labour laws be revised and possibly amalgamated into two or three labour codes. If this is accomplished, the filing requirements will be streamlined. Amendments have also been proposed to some federal laws relating to factories and the use of apprentices. There has been no progress taking these initiatives forward and it appears unlikely that the government will do so.Key amendments to law in recent months include a substantial change to the Maternity Benefit Act 1961 through the Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act 2016. Key features of this amendment include:an increase in paid time off for eligible female employees from 12 weeks to 26 weeks in case a female employee has fewer than two children. If she has two or more children, she is entitled to 12 weeks’ leave;the introduction of the concepts of a 'commissioning mother' and an 'adopting mother', which widens the scope of the law. Such mothers are entitled to 12 weeks’ leave;the option to work from home once the paid maternity leave period has ended, based on an agreement with the employer; andrequiring an establishment with 50 or more employees to set up a crèche facility.Overall, the amendments are progressive in nature. From an employer’s perspective, there will be greater financial implications due to the increased maternity leave payment and also the benefits to be paid to the new categories of eligible female employees.In December 2016 the Employee’s State Insurance Act 1948 was amended, increasing the salary or wages threshold for coverage of an employee to Rs21,000 (approximately $309) per month from the previous wage cap of Rs15,000 (approximately $221) per month. The act applies to commercial establishments and provides for social security insurance for employees in case of sickness. The amendment has led to higher employee coverage under the law.What are the emerging trends in employment law in your jurisdiction?After decades of the government and courts adopting a somewhat socialist mind set, there has been a shift to a more pragmatic, business-friendly approach. The old approach, which focused on unskilled and daily wage workers, has given way to a focus on India’s growing service industry. There is heightened interest in rewriting the employment laws to make them more business friendly. India’s newest employment law on the prevention of sexual harassment is also leading to an increased number of sexual harassment complaints and additional processes to be followed.Another important aspect is the move towards e-governance in the labour law sector. A new web portal launched by the government provides users with a unique labour identification number, facilitating online registration, the filing of self-certified, simplified and single online returns for specific federal laws, and a transparent labour inspection scheme on risk-based criteria. Some concessions have also been provided for start ups in terms of employment law compliances.The employment relationshipCountry specific lawsWhat laws and regulations govern the employment relationship?Some states require that the employer prepare an appointment order for new hires, although this is seldom observed. There are no direct laws dealing with probation on a general basis in India, which is, however, a common practice. The (federal) Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act1946 (which is applicable to workmen), provides for a probationary period of up to three months. Certain states have built in the probation concept indirectly into their local laws, which ranges from three to six months. Ideally, a probation period should not exceed 240 days, as several statutory social welfare laws apply to employees who have worked for such period. The Industrial Disputes Act 1947 (applicable to workmen), prescribes that if certain terms of service change, notice must be given to the employee. It also prescribes requirements for termination for convenience, including notice and compensation.Who do these cover, including categories of worker?There are essentially two types of employer and two types of employee. Employers are either:‘establishments’ – a term which encompasses all employers; or‘factories’ – a term which typically encompasses manufacturing units. Mines are sometimes covered along with factories.Employees are either:‘employees’ – a term which covers all employees in any kind of role; or‘workmen’ (as defined in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947) – that is, employees whose primary role is not supervisory, managerial or administrative.In addition, certain state laws may exclude senior management employees from their scope of application.MisclassificationAre there specific rules regarding employee/contractor classification?Indian law regulates and in some cases prohibits the use of contract workers. To engage contract workers, the contractor must hold a licence and the employer must be registered as a ‘principal employer’.ContractsMust an employment contract be in writing?Except in states which require an appointment order, Indian law does not explicitly require that an employment contract be in writing, although this is the typical practice followed by most employers.Are any terms implied into employment contracts?Certain legal terms are implied in the employment contract. A duty of care, a right to privacy and a duty to maintain confidentiality are implied in the employment contract.Are mandatory arbitration/dispute resolution agreements enforceable?Yes.How can employers make changes to existing employment agreements?Under Indian contract law, a contract requires the consent of both parties. Thus, the employer cannot unilaterally make changes to the employment agreement. Typically, compensation terms are set out in an annex to the agreement, which should provide that these will be subject to change from time to time. Standard terms of employment – such as working hours, vacation, benefits, security procedures and disciplinary procedures – are normally set out in the employment terms of service, rather than in the employment contract. The employment contract should state that these terms of service apply to the employee and will be subject to change from time to time.An employer cannot change specified service conditions (eg, compensation, grade classification and customary concessions) for ‘workmen’ (as defined in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947) without providing 21 days’ prior statutory notice and notice to the labour authorities. This should be considered when implementing changes to an employment agreement.Foreign workersIs a distinction drawn between local and foreign workers?A significant difference between local and foreign employees is evident in the law on provident funds, which is a type of pension. The threshold to qualify, the manner of deduction and the benefits are different for foreign employee, and differ further depending on whether the country of origin has a social service agreement with India. There are no other substantive distinctions between local and foreign employees.RecruitmentAdvertisingWhat are the requirements relating to advertising positions?Under the Employment Exchange (Compulsory Notification of Vacancies) Act, 1959, if the state so requires, a private sector establishment with 25 or more employees must notify vacancies to specific employment exchanges. However, this is seldom observed.Background checksWhat can employers do with regard to background checks and inquiries in relation to the following:(a) Criminal records?While it is possible to conduct criminal background checks, this is extremely difficult in practice because criminal records are not digitised and are not consolidated nationwide. Accordingly, where a criminal background check must be carried out, this is typically done at the police station with jurisdiction over the employee’s current place of residence or anywhere that he or she has lived for a reasonable period.(b) Medical history?Employees’ medical histories cannot be accessed easily, since these are not digitised and there is no repository of medical records. Employee consent is required to disclose medical records to the employer. However, some employers require employees to undergo medical checks and have the diagnostic centre send the report directly to the employer. Subject to certain specific restrictions (eg, pre-employment testing for HIV is not permitted), there is no prohibition against this practice under Indian law.(c) Drug screening?Indian law does not prohibit drug screening.(d) Credit checks?An individual is entitled to obtain information on his or her credit rating. The employer can also access this information, with the employee’s permission and on providing necessary proof of identity. Access to credit rating information is more common in banks and financial institutions.(e) Immigration status?Indian law does not specifically require an employer to check the immigration status of a foreigner. Indian law does not prevent the employer from checking whether a foreign employee holds the necessary visa to work in India. If a foreign individual on an employment visa wishes to change employment to another company, he or she must leave India and apply afresh for a visa. The only exception is where the foreigner is changing jobs between a registered holding company and its subsidiaries or vice versa, or between subsidiaries of a registered holding company. In such case the foreigner may not need to leave India, provided that he or she fulfils specific criteria, including obtaining prior government approval for the change in employment.(f) Social media?There is no bar against conducting background checks through social media.(g) Other?The most common background checks undertaken are of educational qualifications. The employee must consent to this and the employer (or an outsourced provider) will then write to the relevant institution requesting confirmation. The institution may charge a fee for providing this information. Most institutions have a procedure in place in this regard.Wages and working timePayIs there a national minimum wage and, if so, what is it?There is no national minimum wage. However, the central and state governments can issue notifications on minimum wages in specific industries. The federal government has set the recommended minimum wage to Rs176 per day and advised state governments to implement the same.Are there restrictions on working hours?By and large, working up to nine hours a day is permitted, with a weekly limit of 48 to 50 hours. There are laws that restrict women from working at night (between 8:00pm and 6:00am). Some states also have a maximum number of hours of overtime that can be worked.Hours and overtimeWhat are the requirements for meal and rest breaks?Most state laws provide for a break of 30 to 60 minutes after four to five hours of work. In practice, it is typical to provide a one-hour lunch break in an eight-hour day.How should overtime be calculated?Overtime is usually calculated at twice the rate of normal wages. State law defines what the term ‘wages’ covers; this typically includes basic wages plus normal allowances, but excludes any bonus component.What exemptions are there from overtime?There are no exemptions from paying overtime. However, the overtime provisions are seldom observed – generally, companies do not pay overtime when employees stay late to complete their work. It is recommended that employers pay overtime at least when employees are required by the nature of the assignment to work overtime – for example, call centre employees.Is there a minimum paid holiday entitlement?Yes. This varies from state to state, but is generally about 15 days. Most states prescribe up to 10 days of sick leave and some states prescribe another entitlement of up to 10 days of casual leave. In addition, most states prescribe about 10 days of public holidays; four to five of these are mandatory national and state holidays, while the remainder are chosen by the employer from a larger list provided by the state.What are the rules applicable to final pay and deductions from wages?Final pay must be made within two days of the date of termination where the employee’s services are terminated by the employer. In case of the employee’s resignation, the final pay-out can be made as part of the company’s normal payment cycle.Deductions are permitted from an employee’s wages, but only for specified reasons (eg, on account of fines, deductions for damage to or loss of goods expressly entrusted to the employee and recovery of loans or advances). Deductions are generally permitted only up to 50% of the employee’s wages.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, Bangalore6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar"

Further, there is a ground floor with two rooms for a shop and watchman stay, two floors above, and one more floor with a pent house with two rooms for rent. Further, property may not be divided vertically due to construction. Also, your brother wants the ground floor and 1st floor. You had told him to take the second floor and pent house. But the resale value of the ground floor is higher than the pent house. Herein, firstly, you may allocate the specific floors to each brother based on a mutual agreement between you, wherein, your brother may take the ground and first floor, and you may take the second floor and the pent house. Secondly, you may make a division on the basis of resale value. Thirdly, you may draft a sale agreement as to how the profit sharing would take place, based on the floor each occupies. However, it is suggested that the sale is made as a legal documentation, specifying the rights and obligations of each brother.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "- As per law, A development agreement is a contract between a landowner and a developer where the landowner provides land and the developer undertakes to develop it by constructing buildings.- Further, as per Section 10 of the Indian Contract Act, all agreements are contracts if they are made by the free consent of the parties competent to contract, for a lawful consideration and with a lawful object and are not expressly declared to be void.- Further, a development agreement is a statement of understanding between two or more parties which when made has no enforceability in the eyes of law , as such an agreement has no intention to create a legal bond between such persons.- But , when the development agreement has been made as per section 10 of the Indian contract Act, then it is a valid agreement.- Hence, if there is mention that the landowner will have his right to transfer his share to anyone on the basis of this agreement , then the landowner can execute gift deed to his children on the basis of the unregistered development agreement .Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Tenant asks for refund due to dissatisfaction with property maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, your name is Jay from Tanzania, and you have a tenant who had paid one year rent without a written contract. After living in the property premises for 8 months, the tenant had showed his dissatisfaction with respect to property maintenance, and required a rent refund for the remaining 4 months. But you presently do not have money for a refund to be made. Herein, since there is no contract in the written form, you will have to prove the agreement between you and the tenant that was present in verbal terms. With respect to the tenant's dissatisfaction, maintenance issue may be a sufficient ground for breach of an implied contract between the tenant and you, if not maintained to a reasonable standard. However, if you do not have an adequate amount for refund, it is suggested you negotiate or mediate with the tenant on the issue, and offer to address the maintenance issues promptly. However, it is important that all these conversations are documented properly.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Tenant asks for refund due to dissatisfaction with property maintenance",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts. I can understand your concern in this regard. Initially try to convince the tenant with the intervention of elderly persons. Negotiation is usually the first approach to take before resorting to other Alternative Dispute Redressal methods. It is more informal and affords the parties flexibility. Essentially, negotiation is simply parties identifying an issue and meeting to fix it—they control the process and the solution. One of the key reasons why negotiation is important is its ability to preserve relationships. Unlike litigation, which often results in winners and losers, negotiation allows people to work together towards a resolution that meets everyone’s needs. This collaborative approach fosters understanding, builds trust, and maintains positive connections for future interactions.Let the tenant go to the Court and file the case. You can defend it accordingly. At present, you cannot stop him to file any case. In case, he threatens to file any case, please lodge a police complaint in the nearest police department in Tanzania, East Africa.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with relevant documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Shri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. My team has dealt with various disputes of such nature. You can go ahead and deposit the cheque in bank and by only presenting the cheque in bank, it can add pressure on him. Pro Note is valid evidence to prove your case in Cour of law. No one is above the law. Let me be clear - no one is above the law. Not a politician, not a priest, not a criminal and not even a police officer. We are all accountable for our actions. As per guidelines of Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the validity period of cheque from the date of issue is 3 months.Acheque bounce, also known as a dishonored cheque, occurs when a cheque issued by someone (drawer) cannot be cleared due to insufficient funds or any other reason in their account. In India, the Negotiable Instruments Act (NI Act) governscheque bouncecases andCheque BounceCase Procedure pursuing legal action.After the cheque gets dishonoured, a legal notice should be sent by way of R.P.A.D. to the drawer of the cheque through an advocate within 30 days from the date of the cheque return memo. Demanding the amount of the cheque within 15 days from the date of receipt of the notice.When the drawer fails to repay the amount within 15 days from the service of the notice, the receiver can file a criminal complaint against the drawer u/s 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The complaint must be filed before the Magistrate within 30 days after the expiration of 15 days from the service of notice.The affidavit is filed and attached to the complaint. The Court examines the original documents and checks for validity and limitation of the complaint filed. The complaint can also be filed by the power of attorney of the complainant. After satisfaction, the court issues a summons against the accused, and the case is tried as a summary criminal proceeding.When the accused presents himself before the court, the court asks the accused to furnish surety and to submit bail bonds, in order to make certain that the accused will remain present on every date of the proceedings. The plea of the accused is recorded, and particulars are framed.At the stage of evidence, the complainant files all the original documents before the court, followed by an examination in chief and cross examination of the complainant. The complainant can give further witnesses if he wants to; otherwise, the evidence of the complainant is closed.Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, provides presumptions in favour of a complaint. Accused can rebut the presumption by taking a probable defence. After competition of complainant’s evidence, statement u/s 313 ofCode of Criminal Procedure, of accused is recorded. Accused can give his witnesses if he wants to.After closing of evidence of both sides, arguments are heard by both parties and conducted by their respective counsels. Then the court pronounces judgement in open court. Furthermore, a criminal complaint can also be filed for early action and to build pressure on him.After the amendment of 2002, the term of imprisonment was extended to 2 years, or the fine, which may extend to double the amount of the cheque or both.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification with documents.Shri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

Further, there is a ground floor with two rooms for a shop and watchman stay, two floors above, and one more floor with a pent house with two rooms for rent. Further, property may not be divided vertically due to construction. Also, your brother wants the ground floor and 1st floor. You had told him to take the second floor and pent house. But the resale value of the ground floor is higher than the pent house. Herein, firstly, you may allocate the specific floors to each brother based on a mutual agreement between you, wherein, your brother may take the ground and first floor, and you may take the second floor and the pent house. Secondly, you may make a division on the basis of resale value. Thirdly, you may draft a sale agreement as to how the profit sharing would take place, based on the floor each occupies.

    "question": "Criminal contempt impleading into a civil contempt case",
    "answer": "Criminal contempt can arise either from your actions or from publishing a matter which:(i) scandalizes or tends to scandalize, or lowers or tends to lower the authority of, any court; or(ii) prejudices, or interferes or tends to interfere with, the due course of any judicial proceeding; or(iii) interferes or tends to interfere with, or obstructs or tends to obstruct, the administration of justice in any other manner;2) criminal contempt is of a criminal nature. It encompasses acts such as wilful disobedience to Judges in Court, disrespectful behaviour towards Judges in open Court, defamation of Judges or Courts, interference with the judicial process, or any act that has the potential to prejudice the course of justice. A person is found guilty of criminal contempt when their conduct tends to bring disrespect to the authority and administration of the law or interferes with or prejudices litigants during the legal proceedings.3)  Civil Contempt\" as per Section 2 (b), pertains to the intentional refusal to comply with any judgment, decree, direction, order, writ, or other legal process of a Court, or the intentional violation of an undertaking given to the Court.4)The Constitution Bench of Supreme  Court in State of Bihar v. Sonabati Kumari [AIR 1961 SC 221] , held that the provisions of Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 (for short \"the 1971 Act\") deal with the wilful defiance of the order passed by the court. Order of punishment be not passed if the court is satisfied that the party was, in fact, under a misapprehension as to the scope of the order or there was an unintentional wrong for the reason that the order was ambiguous and reasonably capable of more than one interpretation or the party never intended to disobey the order but conducted himself in accordance with the interpretation of the order.5) it is necessary to peruse the circular and judgment to advice whether cone,tot or court proceedings are maintainable or not6) if you have already filed civil contempt case doubtful whether criminal contempt case would be maintainableAjay SethiAdvocate, Mumbai98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi"

    "question": "Criminal contempt impleading into a civil contempt case",
    "answer": "Contempt of court refers to the act of interfering with the administration of justice, which can take various forms and may result in the improper execution of justice. It is considered a serious offense that can lead to imprisonment, and it involves making false statements or interfering with the judicial proceedings.The main difference between civil contempt and criminal contempt in India is that civil contempt is a violation of a court order, while criminal contempt is an act that interferes with the administration of justice.In India, the punishment for civil contempt of court is as follows: Simple imprisonment for up to six months, A fine of up to two thousand rupees, and Both.The accused can be discharged or the punishment can be remitted if they apologize to the satisfaction of the court. The apology must be bona fide and not qualified or conditionalCriminal contempt of court is different from civil contempt of court, which is usually used to enforce legal directives like child support payments. Criminal contempt of court is intended to punish misconduct, while civil contempt is intended to compel compliance.The punishment for criminal contempt of court is a fine of up to Rs 2,000, or simple imprisonment for up to 6 months, or both. However, this limit only applies to the High Courts, and the Supreme Court has more discretion in what punishment to giveT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Criminal contempt impleading into a civil contempt case",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, a civil case had been filed against a statutory authority, in what is essentially a criminal contempt case. However, the Authority had picked the directions issued, altered the same, and published the court directions on their circular, wherein, it has omitted the most important directions with relevance to the illegal gain made for its regulated entities, committing bias and legal opportunism. With respect to your first query, as to whether it is possible for any other who has similarly been affected to plead themselves into the civil contempt case, along with a criminal contempt petition, and thus pursue the case. According to the Civil Procedure Code, a person may be added as a party if their presence is deemed necessary for the proper and complete adjudication of the case. However, such party should have been directly affected by the actions of the statutory authority. With respect to the query as to whether the same petitioner who filed the civil contempt, will it be possible to file another criminal contempt case and pursue both cases together, it can be noted that, the same can be done as there is no bar to present a civil and a criminal case for the same fact situation.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "context": "Asked 7 months ago in Constitutional Law",
    "question": "Criminal contempt impleading into a civil contempt case",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. Third party (similarly affected) can be impleaded in the case. The Hon’ble Supreme Court has emphasized that Section 20 applies to civil and criminal contempts and would also apply to the contempt committed on the face of High Court or the Supreme Court or even Subordinate Courts. Therefore, with regard the instituting both together, the documents is to be examined. In an inter-party proceeding, orders of the Court bind only the parties to such proceedings. Therefore, violation of such orders by any of the parties to the proceedings may amount to contempt of Court, punishable in terms of the provisions of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971. However, there may be instances where the violation/ disregard of Court's order results not only from the conduct of the parties to the proceedings, rather, from the conduct of persons totally unrelated thereto (\"third person\"). Under such circumstances, providing immunity to third person on pure technical grounds that the orders of Court bind only parties to the proceedings, would amount to permitting indirect assault on the majesty and supremacy of judiciary, which the Courts are bound to protect.Law on third party liability in contempt proceedings in India is primarily an adaptation of the principles of English Law. One of the earliest English cases discussing the liability of third party in contempt proceedings is that ofSeaward v. Paterson, (1897) 1 Ch. 545. The Hon'ble Chancery Division, while acknowledging the difference between the person bound by order of Court and a person, though not bound by such order, but conducting himself in the manner so as to obstruct the course of justice, held,\"In the one case the party who is bound by the injunction is proceeded against for the purpose of enforcing the order of the Court for the benefit of the person who got it. In the other case the Court will not allow its process to be set at naught and treated with contempt.\"Similarly, Lord Denning inAcrow (Automation) Ltd. v. Rex Chainbelt Inc., (1971) 3 All ER 1175held,\"The Court has jurisdiction to commit for contempt person, not a party to the action who knowing of an injunction, aids and abets the defendant in breaking it.\"The aforementioned principles were adopted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court inSita Ram v. Balbir alias Bali, (2017) 2 SCC 456, while imposing liability on third persons, aiding and abetting the contemnor in flouting the orders of the Hon'ble Court. The Hon'ble Madras High Court inVidya Charan Shukla v. Tamil Nadu Olympic Association & Anr., AIR 1991 Mad. 323,while carrying out an exhaustive review of the case laws on the subject, observed,\"We can see thus clearly that the Courts in India invariably accepted the law applied in England and found (1) a party to the suit if he had notice or knowledge of the order of the Court and (2) a third party or a stranger, if he had aided or abetted the violation with notice or knowledge of the order of injunction guilty of civil contempt and otherwise found a third party guilty of criminal contempt if he has been found knowingly obstructing implementation of its order or direction..\"Conclusively, mere absence of law specifically providing for the liability of third party in contempt proceedings has not acted as a deterrent for the Courts to reprimand the violators of its orders, though, not specifically named therein or expressly bound by it. In fact, through the process of adoption and traversing the rugged terrains through years, Courts have developed a mechanism wherein no violator of its order/ injunction is left unpunished, even though not a party to a proceeding before Court. Clearly an act of violation of order of the order of Court or interfering with the administration of justice by third person amounts to contempt by such third person. As Lord Justice Eveleigh inZ LTD. v. A-Z AND AA-LL, [1982] Q.B. 558observed,\"It is true that his conduct may very often be seen as possessing a dual character of contempt of court by himself and aiding and abetting the contempt by another, but the conduct will always amount to contempt of court by himself.It will be conduct which knowingly interferes with the administration of justice by causing the order of the court to be thwarted.\"Detailed discussion is required in such cases with relevant documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Shri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

Further, there is a ground floor with two rooms for a shop and watchman stay, two floors above, and one more floor with a pent house with two rooms for rent. Further, property may not be divided vertically due to construction. Also, your brother wants the ground floor and 1st floor. You had told him to take the second floor and pent house. But the resale value of the ground floor is higher than the pent house. Herein, firstly, you may allocate the specific floors to each brother based on a mutual agreement between you, wherein, your brother may take the ground and first floor, and you may take the second floor and the pent house. Secondly, you may make a division on the basis of resale value. Thirdly, you may draft a sale agreement as to how the profit sharing would take place, based on the floor each occupies.

    "answer": "To my mind a corporation or LLC can provide certain tax benefits. For example, the money you earn from collecting rent payments could put you in a higher income tax bracket, leading to you paying more on your personal tax return. You can help mitigate this by having a business collect the rent and pay you a salary.Most of the expenses associated with operating a rental property are tax-deductible. This may include anything from purchasing a new refrigerator for a unit in your building to making repairs to the front door. Operating as a corporation or LLC can make it easier to claim these expenses as tax deductions.Sole proprietors and general partners have personal liability for business debts, meaning that business creditors may be able to come after the business owners’ personal assets. In addition to lenders, people who get hurt on the property and file personal injury claims may seek damages that come from the business owners’ personal assets. You could find yourself in serious debt, or even bankrupt, which makes liability protection one of the most important benefits of registering an LLC or corporation. The business structure shields your personal income and assets from business creditors and other claimants. The corporation or LLC would be liable for the debts and other claims and not you.Rest, you may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification with complete documents.Shri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, your name is Jay from Tanzania, and you have a tenant who had paid one year rent without a written contract. After living in the property premises for 8 months, the tenant had showed his dissatisfaction with respect to property maintenance, and required a rent refund for the remaining 4 months. But you presently do not have money for a refund to be made. Herein, since there is no contract in the written form, you will have to prove the agreement between you and the tenant that was present in verbal terms. With respect to the tenant's dissatisfaction, maintenance issue may be a sufficient ground for breach of an implied contract between the tenant and you, if not maintained to a reasonable standard. However, if you do not have an adequate amount for refund, it is suggested you negotiate or mediate with the tenant on the issue, and offer to address the maintenance issues promptly. However, it is important that all these conversations are documented properly.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "- The tenancy can be without a written contract , if the tenant is paying rent to the landlord- Since, the said tenant has paid you one year rent , it means that he entered into an oral agreement with you that he needs the tenanted premises for one year.- Further, in the middle of the tenancy period of one year , then tenant cannot ask refund of the rent for the remaining period on the ground of dissatisfaction.- Hence, the said tenant cannot claim refund of 4 months from you on any ground , as with the payment of the 12 months rent he admit to live in the tenanted premises for one year.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts. I can understand your concern in this regard. Initially try to convince the tenant with the intervention of elderly persons. Negotiation is usually the first approach to take before resorting to other Alternative Dispute Redressal methods. It is more informal and affords the parties flexibility. Essentially, negotiation is simply parties identifying an issue and meeting to fix it—they control the process and the solution. One of the key reasons why negotiation is important is its ability to preserve relationships. Unlike litigation, which often results in winners and losers, negotiation allows people to work together towards a resolution that meets everyone’s needs. This collaborative approach fosters understanding, builds trust, and maintains positive connections for future interactions.Let the tenant go to the Court and file the case. You can defend it accordingly. At present, you cannot stop him to file any case. In case, he threatens to file any case, please lodge a police complaint in the nearest police department in Tanzania, East Africa.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with relevant documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Shri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "answer": "Criminal contempt can arise either from your actions or from publishing a matter which:(i) scandalizes or tends to scandalize, or lowers or tends to lower the authority of, any court; or(ii) prejudices, or interferes or tends to interfere with, the due course of any judicial proceeding; or(iii) interferes or tends to interfere with, or obstructs or tends to obstruct, the administration of justice in any other manner;2) criminal contempt is of a criminal nature. It encompasses acts such as wilful disobedience to Judges in Court, disrespectful behaviour towards Judges in open Court, defamation of Judges or Courts, interference with the judicial process, or any act that has the potential to prejudice the course of justice. A person is found guilty of criminal contempt when their conduct tends to bring disrespect to the authority and administration of the law or interferes with or prejudices litigants during the legal proceedings.3)  Civil Contempt\" as per Section 2 (b), pertains to the intentional refusal to comply with any judgment, decree, direction, order, writ, or other legal process of a Court, or the intentional violation of an undertaking given to the Court.4)The Constitution Bench of Supreme  Court in State of Bihar v. Sonabati Kumari [AIR 1961 SC 221] , held that the provisions of Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 (for short \"the 1971 Act\") deal with the wilful defiance of the order passed by the court. Order of punishment be not passed if the court is satisfied that the party was, in fact, under a misapprehension as to the scope of the order or there was an unintentional wrong for the reason that the order was ambiguous and reasonably capable of more than one interpretation or the party never intended to disobey the order but conducted himself in accordance with the interpretation of the order.5) it is necessary to peruse the circular and judgment to advice whether cone,tot or court proceedings are maintainable or not6) if you have already filed civil contempt case doubtful whether criminal contempt case would be maintainableAjay SethiAdvocate, Mumbai98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi"

    "question": "Criminal contempt impleading into a civil contempt case",
    "answer": "Contempt of court refers to the act of interfering with the administration of justice, which can take various forms and may result in the improper execution of justice. It is considered a serious offense that can lead to imprisonment, and it involves making false statements or interfering with the judicial proceedings.The main difference between civil contempt and criminal contempt in India is that civil contempt is a violation of a court order, while criminal contempt is an act that interferes with the administration of justice.In India, the punishment for civil contempt of court is as follows: Simple imprisonment for up to six months, A fine of up to two thousand rupees, and Both.The accused can be discharged or the punishment can be remitted if they apologize to the satisfaction of the court. The apology must be bona fide and not qualified or conditionalCriminal contempt of court is different from civil contempt of court, which is usually used to enforce legal directives like child support payments. Criminal contempt of court is intended to punish misconduct, while civil contempt is intended to compel compliance.The punishment for criminal contempt of court is a fine of up to Rs 2,000, or simple imprisonment for up to 6 months, or both. However, this limit only applies to the High Courts, and the Supreme Court has more discretion in what punishment to giveT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Criminal contempt impleading into a civil contempt case",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, a civil case had been filed against a statutory authority, in what is essentially a criminal contempt case. However, the Authority had picked the directions issued, altered the same, and published the court directions on their circular, wherein, it has omitted the most important directions with relevance to the illegal gain made for its regulated entities, committing bias and legal opportunism. With respect to your first query, as to whether it is possible for any other who has similarly been affected to plead themselves into the civil contempt case, along with a criminal contempt petition, and thus pursue the case. According to the Civil Procedure Code, a person may be added as a party if their presence is deemed necessary for the proper and complete adjudication of the case. However, such party should have been directly affected by the actions of the statutory authority. With respect to the query as to whether the same petitioner who filed the civil contempt, will it be possible to file another criminal contempt case and pursue both cases together, it can be noted that, the same can be done as there is no bar to present a civil and a criminal case for the same fact situation.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Criminal contempt impleading into a civil contempt case",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. Third party (similarly affected) can be impleaded in the case. The Hon’ble Supreme Court has emphasized that Section 20 applies to civil and criminal contempts and would also apply to the contempt committed on the face of High Court or the Supreme Court or even Subordinate Courts. Therefore, with regard the instituting both together, the documents is to be examined. In an inter-party proceeding, orders of the Court bind only the parties to such proceedings. Therefore, violation of such orders by any of the parties to the proceedings may amount to contempt of Court, punishable in terms of the provisions of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971. However, there may be instances where the violation/ disregard of Court's order results not only from the conduct of the parties to the proceedings, rather, from the conduct of persons totally unrelated thereto (\"third person\"). Under such circumstances, providing immunity to third person on pure technical grounds that the orders of Court bind only parties to the proceedings, would amount to permitting indirect assault on the majesty and supremacy of judiciary, which the Courts are bound to protect.Law on third party liability in contempt proceedings in India is primarily an adaptation of the principles of English Law. One of the earliest English cases discussing the liability of third party in contempt proceedings is that ofSeaward v. Paterson, (1897) 1 Ch. 545. The Hon'ble Chancery Division, while acknowledging the difference between the person bound by order of Court and a person, though not bound by such order, but conducting himself in the manner so as to obstruct the course of justice, held,\"In the one case the party who is bound by the injunction is proceeded against for the purpose of enforcing the order of the Court for the benefit of the person who got it. In the other case the Court will not allow its process to be set at naught and treated with contempt.\"Similarly, Lord Denning inAcrow (Automation) Ltd. v. Rex Chainbelt Inc., (1971) 3 All ER 1175held,\"The Court has jurisdiction to commit for contempt person, not a party to the action who knowing of an injunction, aids and abets the defendant in breaking it.\"The aforementioned principles were adopted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court inSita Ram v. Balbir alias Bali, (2017) 2 SCC 456, while imposing liability on third persons, aiding and abetting the contemnor in flouting the orders of the Hon'ble Court. The Hon'ble Madras High Court inVidya Charan Shukla v. Tamil Nadu Olympic Association & Anr., AIR 1991 Mad. 323,while carrying out an exhaustive review of the case laws on the subject, observed,\"We can see thus clearly that the Courts in India invariably accepted the law applied in England and found (1) a party to the suit if he had notice or knowledge of the order of the Court and (2) a third party or a stranger, if he had aided or abetted the violation with notice or knowledge of the order of injunction guilty of civil contempt and otherwise found a third party guilty of criminal contempt if he has been found knowingly obstructing implementation of its order or direction..\"Conclusively, mere absence of law specifically providing for the liability of third party in contempt proceedings has not acted as a deterrent for the Courts to reprimand the violators of its orders, though, not specifically named therein or expressly bound by it. In fact, through the process of adoption and traversing the rugged terrains through years, Courts have developed a mechanism wherein no violator of its order/ injunction is left unpunished, even though not a party to a proceeding before Court. Clearly an act of violation of order of the order of Court or interfering with the administration of justice by third person amounts to contempt by such third person. As Lord Justice Eveleigh inZ LTD. v. A-Z AND AA-LL, [1982] Q.B. 558observed,\"It is true that his conduct may very often be seen as possessing a dual character of contempt of court by himself and aiding and abetting the contempt by another, but the conduct will always amount to contempt of court by himself.It will be conduct which knowingly interferes with the administration of justice by causing the order of the court to be thwarted.\"Detailed discussion is required in such cases with relevant documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Shri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

You can go ahead and deposit the cheque in bank and by only presenting the cheque in bank, it can add pressure on him. Pro Note is valid evidence to prove your case in Cour of law. No one is above the law. Let me be clear - no one is above the law. Not a politician, not a priest, not a criminal and not even a police officer. We are all accountable for our actions. As per guidelines of Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the validity period of cheque from the date of issue is 3 months.Acheque bounce, also known as a dishonored cheque, occurs when a cheque issued by someone (drawer) cannot be cleared due to insufficient funds or any other reason in their account. In India, the Negotiable Instruments Act (NI Act) governscheque bouncecases andCheque BounceCase Procedure pursuing legal action.After the cheque gets dishonoured, a legal notice should be sent by way of R.P.A.D. to the drawer of the cheque through an advocate within 30 days from the date of the cheque return memo. Demanding the amount of the cheque within 15 days from the date of receipt of the notice.When the drawer fails to repay the amount within 15 days from the service of the notice, the receiver can file a criminal complaint against the drawer u/s 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The complaint must be filed before the Magistrate within 30 days after the expiration of 15 days from the service of notice.The affidavit is filed and attached to the complaint. The Court examines the original documents and checks for validity and limitation of the complaint filed. The complaint can also be filed by the power of attorney of the complainant. After satisfaction, the court issues a summons against the accused, and the case is tried as a summary criminal proceeding.When the accused presents himself before the court, the court asks the accused to furnish surety and to submit bail bonds, in order to make certain that the accused will remain present on every date of the proceedings. The plea of the accused is recorded, and particulars are framed.At the stage of evidence, the complainant files all the original documents before the court, followed by an examination in chief and cross examination of the complainant. The complainant can give further witnesses if he wants to; otherwise, the evidence of the complainant is closed.Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, provides presumptions in favour of a complaint. Accused can rebut the presumption by taking a probable defence. After competition of complainant’s evidence, statement u/s 313 ofCode of Criminal Procedure, of accused is recorded. Accused can give his witnesses if he wants to.After closing of evidence of both sides, arguments are heard by both parties and conducted by their respective counsels. Then the court pronounces judgement in open court. Furthermore, a criminal complaint can also be filed for early action and to build pressure on him.After the amendment of 2002, the term of imprisonment was extended to 2 years, or the fine, which may extend to double the amount of the cheque or both.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification with documents.Shri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "answer": "To my mind a corporation or LLC can provide certain tax benefits. For example, the money you earn from collecting rent payments could put you in a higher income tax bracket, leading to you paying more on your personal tax return. You can help mitigate this by having a business collect the rent and pay you a salary.Most of the expenses associated with operating a rental property are tax-deductible. This may include anything from purchasing a new refrigerator for a unit in your building to making repairs to the front door. Operating as a corporation or LLC can make it easier to claim these expenses as tax deductions.Sole proprietors and general partners have personal liability for business debts, meaning that business creditors may be able to come after the business owners’ personal assets. In addition to lenders, people who get hurt on the property and file personal injury claims may seek damages that come from the business owners’ personal assets. You could find yourself in serious debt, or even bankrupt, which makes liability protection one of the most important benefits of registering an LLC or corporation. The business structure shields your personal income and assets from business creditors and other claimants. The corporation or LLC would be liable for the debts and other claims and not you.Rest, you may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification with complete documents.Shri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "question": "Cheque details before deposit, new cheque related laws",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. My team has dealt with various disputes of such nature. You can go ahead and deposit the cheque in bank and by only presenting the cheque in bank, it can add pressure on him. Pro Note is valid evidence to prove your case in Cour of law. No one is above the law. Let me be clear - no one is above the law. Not a politician, not a priest, not a criminal and not even a police officer. We are all accountable for our actions. As per guidelines of Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the validity period of cheque from the date of issue is 3 months.Acheque bounce, also known as a dishonored cheque, occurs when a cheque issued by someone (drawer) cannot be cleared due to insufficient funds or any other reason in their account. In India, the Negotiable Instruments Act (NI Act) governscheque bouncecases andCheque BounceCase Procedure pursuing legal action.After the cheque gets dishonoured, a legal notice should be sent by way of R.P.A.D. to the drawer of the cheque through an advocate within 30 days from the date of the cheque return memo. Demanding the amount of the cheque within 15 days from the date of receipt of the notice.When the drawer fails to repay the amount within 15 days from the service of the notice, the receiver can file a criminal complaint against the drawer u/s 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The complaint must be filed before the Magistrate within 30 days after the expiration of 15 days from the service of notice.The affidavit is filed and attached to the complaint. The Court examines the original documents and checks for validity and limitation of the complaint filed. The complaint can also be filed by the power of attorney of the complainant. After satisfaction, the court issues a summons against the accused, and the case is tried as a summary criminal proceeding.When the accused presents himself before the court, the court asks the accused to furnish surety and to submit bail bonds, in order to make certain that the accused will remain present on every date of the proceedings. The plea of the accused is recorded, and particulars are framed.At the stage of evidence, the complainant files all the original documents before the court, followed by an examination in chief and cross examination of the complainant. The complainant can give further witnesses if he wants to; otherwise, the evidence of the complainant is closed.Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, provides presumptions in favour of a complaint. Accused can rebut the presumption by taking a probable defence. After competition of complainant’s evidence, statement u/s 313 ofCode of Criminal Procedure, of accused is recorded. Accused can give his witnesses if he wants to.After closing of evidence of both sides, arguments are heard by both parties and conducted by their respective counsels. Then the court pronounces judgement in open court. Furthermore, a criminal complaint can also be filed for early action and to build pressure on him.After the amendment of 2002, the term of imprisonment was extended to 2 years, or the fine, which may extend to double the amount of the cheque or both.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification with documents.Shri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the present case, the father has transferred his Parts of land (A & B) in favour of his two sons. While one son sold his part of the land to a third party without informing about the same, to the other son, before 1 year 8 months, mutation, i.e., change in the ownership records has also been done already. Hence, you want to file a suit of pre-emption here. While there exists Land Reforms Act for each State, there exists the West Bengal Land Reforms Act, which may be applicable in the instant case, as the property was located in Kolkata, West Bengal. Under this Act, a suit may be filed by the other brother on grounds of being the co-sharer of property, and lack of notice of the sale for the same. Though you would have to inform on your interest to buy the property within 3 months of receiving the notice of transfer, and since you did not receive any such notice, a Suit for pre-emption filed may compel the buyer to sell the property to you, as you will have a priority over other buyers.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. My team has dealt with various disputes of such nature. You can go ahead and deposit the cheque in bank and by only presenting the cheque in bank, it can add pressure on him. Pro Note is valid evidence to prove your case in Cour of law. No one is above the law. Let me be clear - no one is above the law. Not a politician, not a priest, not a criminal and not even a police officer. We are all accountable for our actions. As per guidelines of Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the validity period of cheque from the date of issue is 3 months.Acheque bounce, also known as a dishonored cheque, occurs when a cheque issued by someone (drawer) cannot be cleared due to insufficient funds or any other reason in their account. In India, the Negotiable Instruments Act (NI Act) governscheque bouncecases andCheque BounceCase Procedure pursuing legal action.After the cheque gets dishonoured, a legal notice should be sent by way of R.P.A.D. to the drawer of the cheque through an advocate within 30 days from the date of the cheque return memo. Demanding the amount of the cheque within 15 days from the date of receipt of the notice.When the drawer fails to repay the amount within 15 days from the service of the notice, the receiver can file a criminal complaint against the drawer u/s 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The complaint must be filed before the Magistrate within 30 days after the expiration of 15 days from the service of notice.The affidavit is filed and attached to the complaint. The Court examines the original documents and checks for validity and limitation of the complaint filed. The complaint can also be filed by the power of attorney of the complainant. After satisfaction, the court issues a summons against the accused, and the case is tried as a summary criminal proceeding.When the accused presents himself before the court, the court asks the accused to furnish surety and to submit bail bonds, in order to make certain that the accused will remain present on every date of the proceedings. The plea of the accused is recorded, and particulars are framed.At the stage of evidence, the complainant files all the original documents before the court, followed by an examination in chief and cross examination of the complainant. The complainant can give further witnesses if he wants to; otherwise, the evidence of the complainant is closed.Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, provides presumptions in favour of a complaint. Accused can rebut the presumption by taking a probable defence. After competition of complainant’s evidence, statement u/s 313 ofCode of Criminal Procedure, of accused is recorded. Accused can give his witnesses if he wants to.After closing of evidence of both sides, arguments are heard by both parties and conducted by their respective counsels. Then the court pronounces judgement in open court. Furthermore, a criminal complaint can also be filed for early action and to build pressure on him.After the amendment of 2002, the term of imprisonment was extended to 2 years, or the fine, which may extend to double the amount of the cheque or both.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification with documents.Shri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

After living in the property premises for 8 months, the tenant had showed his dissatisfaction with respect to property maintenance, and required a rent refund for the remaining 4 months. But you presently do not have money for a refund to be made. Herein, since there is no contract in the written form, you will have to prove the agreement between you and the tenant that was present in verbal terms. With respect to the tenant's dissatisfaction, maintenance issue may be a sufficient ground for breach of an implied contract between the tenant and you, if not maintained to a reasonable standard. However, if you do not have an adequate amount for refund, it is suggested you negotiate or mediate with the tenant on the issue, and offer to address the maintenance issues promptly. However, it is important that all these conversations are documented properly.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts. I can understand your concern in this regard. Initially try to convince the tenant with the intervention of elderly persons. Negotiation is usually the first approach to take before resorting to other Alternative Dispute Redressal methods. It is more informal and affords the parties flexibility. Essentially, negotiation is simply parties identifying an issue and meeting to fix it—they control the process and the solution. One of the key reasons why negotiation is important is its ability to preserve relationships. Unlike litigation, which often results in winners and losers, negotiation allows people to work together towards a resolution that meets everyone’s needs. This collaborative approach fosters understanding, builds trust, and maintains positive connections for future interactions.Let the tenant go to the Court and file the case. You can defend it accordingly. At present, you cannot stop him to file any case. In case, he threatens to file any case, please lodge a police complaint in the nearest police department in Tanzania, East Africa.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with relevant documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Shri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the present case, the father has transferred his Parts of land (A & B) in favour of his two sons. While one son sold his part of the land to a third party without informing about the same, to the other son, before 1 year 8 months, mutation, i.e., change in the ownership records has also been done already. Hence, you want to file a suit of pre-emption here. While there exists Land Reforms Act for each State, there exists the West Bengal Land Reforms Act, which may be applicable in the instant case, as the property was located in Kolkata, West Bengal. Under this Act, a suit may be filed by the other brother on grounds of being the co-sharer of property, and lack of notice of the sale for the same. Though you would have to inform on your interest to buy the property within 3 months of receiving the notice of transfer, and since you did not receive any such notice, a Suit for pre-emption filed may compel the buyer to sell the property to you, as you will have a priority over other buyers.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

After living in the property premises for 8 months, the tenant had showed his dissatisfaction with respect to property maintenance, and required a rent refund for the remaining 4 months. But you presently do not have money for a refund to be made.

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts. I can understand your concern in this regard. Initially try to convince the tenant with the intervention of elderly persons. Negotiation is usually the first approach to take before resorting to other Alternative Dispute Redressal methods. It is more informal and affords the parties flexibility. Essentially, negotiation is simply parties identifying an issue and meeting to fix it—they control the process and the solution. One of the key reasons why negotiation is important is its ability to preserve relationships. Unlike litigation, which often results in winners and losers, negotiation allows people to work together towards a resolution that meets everyone’s needs. This collaborative approach fosters understanding, builds trust, and maintains positive connections for future interactions.Let the tenant go to the Court and file the case. You can defend it accordingly. At present, you cannot stop him to file any case. In case, he threatens to file any case, please lodge a police complaint in the nearest police department in Tanzania, East Africa.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with relevant documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Shri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "answer": "Criminal contempt can arise either from your actions or from publishing a matter which:(i) scandalizes or tends to scandalize, or lowers or tends to lower the authority of, any court; or(ii) prejudices, or interferes or tends to interfere with, the due course of any judicial proceeding; or(iii) interferes or tends to interfere with, or obstructs or tends to obstruct, the administration of justice in any other manner;2) criminal contempt is of a criminal nature. It encompasses acts such as wilful disobedience to Judges in Court, disrespectful behaviour towards Judges in open Court, defamation of Judges or Courts, interference with the judicial process, or any act that has the potential to prejudice the course of justice. A person is found guilty of criminal contempt when their conduct tends to bring disrespect to the authority and administration of the law or interferes with or prejudices litigants during the legal proceedings.3)  Civil Contempt\" as per Section 2 (b), pertains to the intentional refusal to comply with any judgment, decree, direction, order, writ, or other legal process of a Court, or the intentional violation of an undertaking given to the Court.4)The Constitution Bench of Supreme  Court in State of Bihar v. Sonabati Kumari [AIR 1961 SC 221] , held that the provisions of Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 (for short \"the 1971 Act\") deal with the wilful defiance of the order passed by the court. Order of punishment be not passed if the court is satisfied that the party was, in fact, under a misapprehension as to the scope of the order or there was an unintentional wrong for the reason that the order was ambiguous and reasonably capable of more than one interpretation or the party never intended to disobey the order but conducted himself in accordance with the interpretation of the order.5) it is necessary to peruse the circular and judgment to advice whether cone,tot or court proceedings are maintainable or not6) if you have already filed civil contempt case doubtful whether criminal contempt case would be maintainableAjay SethiAdvocate, Mumbai98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi"

    "question": "Criminal contempt impleading into a civil contempt case",
    "answer": "Contempt of court refers to the act of interfering with the administration of justice, which can take various forms and may result in the improper execution of justice. It is considered a serious offense that can lead to imprisonment, and it involves making false statements or interfering with the judicial proceedings.The main difference between civil contempt and criminal contempt in India is that civil contempt is a violation of a court order, while criminal contempt is an act that interferes with the administration of justice.In India, the punishment for civil contempt of court is as follows: Simple imprisonment for up to six months, A fine of up to two thousand rupees, and Both.The accused can be discharged or the punishment can be remitted if they apologize to the satisfaction of the court. The apology must be bona fide and not qualified or conditionalCriminal contempt of court is different from civil contempt of court, which is usually used to enforce legal directives like child support payments. Criminal contempt of court is intended to punish misconduct, while civil contempt is intended to compel compliance.The punishment for criminal contempt of court is a fine of up to Rs 2,000, or simple imprisonment for up to 6 months, or both. However, this limit only applies to the High Courts, and the Supreme Court has more discretion in what punishment to giveT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Criminal contempt impleading into a civil contempt case",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, a civil case had been filed against a statutory authority, in what is essentially a criminal contempt case. However, the Authority had picked the directions issued, altered the same, and published the court directions on their circular, wherein, it has omitted the most important directions with relevance to the illegal gain made for its regulated entities, committing bias and legal opportunism. With respect to your first query, as to whether it is possible for any other who has similarly been affected to plead themselves into the civil contempt case, along with a criminal contempt petition, and thus pursue the case. According to the Civil Procedure Code, a person may be added as a party if their presence is deemed necessary for the proper and complete adjudication of the case. However, such party should have been directly affected by the actions of the statutory authority. With respect to the query as to whether the same petitioner who filed the civil contempt, will it be possible to file another criminal contempt case and pursue both cases together, it can be noted that, the same can be done as there is no bar to present a civil and a criminal case for the same fact situation.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Criminal contempt impleading into a civil contempt case",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. Third party (similarly affected) can be impleaded in the case. The Hon’ble Supreme Court has emphasized that Section 20 applies to civil and criminal contempts and would also apply to the contempt committed on the face of High Court or the Supreme Court or even Subordinate Courts. Therefore, with regard the instituting both together, the documents is to be examined. In an inter-party proceeding, orders of the Court bind only the parties to such proceedings. Therefore, violation of such orders by any of the parties to the proceedings may amount to contempt of Court, punishable in terms of the provisions of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971. However, there may be instances where the violation/ disregard of Court's order results not only from the conduct of the parties to the proceedings, rather, from the conduct of persons totally unrelated thereto (\"third person\"). Under such circumstances, providing immunity to third person on pure technical grounds that the orders of Court bind only parties to the proceedings, would amount to permitting indirect assault on the majesty and supremacy of judiciary, which the Courts are bound to protect.Law on third party liability in contempt proceedings in India is primarily an adaptation of the principles of English Law. One of the earliest English cases discussing the liability of third party in contempt proceedings is that ofSeaward v. Paterson, (1897) 1 Ch. 545. The Hon'ble Chancery Division, while acknowledging the difference between the person bound by order of Court and a person, though not bound by such order, but conducting himself in the manner so as to obstruct the course of justice, held,\"In the one case the party who is bound by the injunction is proceeded against for the purpose of enforcing the order of the Court for the benefit of the person who got it. In the other case the Court will not allow its process to be set at naught and treated with contempt.\"Similarly, Lord Denning inAcrow (Automation) Ltd. v. Rex Chainbelt Inc., (1971) 3 All ER 1175held,\"The Court has jurisdiction to commit for contempt person, not a party to the action who knowing of an injunction, aids and abets the defendant in breaking it.\"The aforementioned principles were adopted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court inSita Ram v. Balbir alias Bali, (2017) 2 SCC 456, while imposing liability on third persons, aiding and abetting the contemnor in flouting the orders of the Hon'ble Court. The Hon'ble Madras High Court inVidya Charan Shukla v. Tamil Nadu Olympic Association & Anr., AIR 1991 Mad. 323,while carrying out an exhaustive review of the case laws on the subject, observed,\"We can see thus clearly that the Courts in India invariably accepted the law applied in England and found (1) a party to the suit if he had notice or knowledge of the order of the Court and (2) a third party or a stranger, if he had aided or abetted the violation with notice or knowledge of the order of injunction guilty of civil contempt and otherwise found a third party guilty of criminal contempt if he has been found knowingly obstructing implementation of its order or direction..\"Conclusively, mere absence of law specifically providing for the liability of third party in contempt proceedings has not acted as a deterrent for the Courts to reprimand the violators of its orders, though, not specifically named therein or expressly bound by it. In fact, through the process of adoption and traversing the rugged terrains through years, Courts have developed a mechanism wherein no violator of its order/ injunction is left unpunished, even though not a party to a proceeding before Court. Clearly an act of violation of order of the order of Court or interfering with the administration of justice by third person amounts to contempt by such third person. As Lord Justice Eveleigh inZ LTD. v. A-Z AND AA-LL, [1982] Q.B. 558observed,\"It is true that his conduct may very often be seen as possessing a dual character of contempt of court by himself and aiding and abetting the contempt by another, but the conduct will always amount to contempt of court by himself.It will be conduct which knowingly interferes with the administration of justice by causing the order of the court to be thwarted.\"Detailed discussion is required in such cases with relevant documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Shri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, your father had passed away without leaving a Will for his self-acquired property in Hyderabad, India. You are five siblings in total and each will inherit 1/5th of the share of Property. Your query is whether the property would be treated as Self-acquired or Ancestral Property. Firstly, Self-acquired property is a property which is acquired by an individual during his/her lifetime, from their own resources and not inherited from anyone else. On the other hand, Ancestral Property can be considered as a property that has been inherited from the previous generations, and is further passed on to the further generations. According to theHindu Succession Act, 1956, in the absence of will, the property would be distributed as per the rules laid down in the Act. But with respect to the nature of the property, since the property is your father's self-acquired property, through his own efforts, and as the property has been divided among the siblings, it would retain the nature of being self-acquired property.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Tenant asks for refund due to dissatisfaction with property maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, your name is Jay from Tanzania, and you have a tenant who had paid one year rent without a written contract. After living in the property premises for 8 months, the tenant had showed his dissatisfaction with respect to property maintenance, and required a rent refund for the remaining 4 months. But you presently do not have money for a refund to be made. Herein, since there is no contract in the written form, you will have to prove the agreement between you and the tenant that was present in verbal terms. With respect to the tenant's dissatisfaction, maintenance issue may be a sufficient ground for breach of an implied contract between the tenant and you, if not maintained to a reasonable standard. However, if you do not have an adequate amount for refund, it is suggested you negotiate or mediate with the tenant on the issue, and offer to address the maintenance issues promptly. However, it is important that all these conversations are documented properly.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Tenant asks for refund due to dissatisfaction with property maintenance",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts. I can understand your concern in this regard. Initially try to convince the tenant with the intervention of elderly persons. Negotiation is usually the first approach to take before resorting to other Alternative Dispute Redressal methods. It is more informal and affords the parties flexibility. Essentially, negotiation is simply parties identifying an issue and meeting to fix it—they control the process and the solution. One of the key reasons why negotiation is important is its ability to preserve relationships. Unlike litigation, which often results in winners and losers, negotiation allows people to work together towards a resolution that meets everyone’s needs. This collaborative approach fosters understanding, builds trust, and maintains positive connections for future interactions.Let the tenant go to the Court and file the case. You can defend it accordingly. At present, you cannot stop him to file any case. In case, he threatens to file any case, please lodge a police complaint in the nearest police department in Tanzania, East Africa.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with relevant documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Shri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "question": "Nomination and succession in Housing society",
    "answer": "1. Your wife who is a co owner will be added as a joint member and not as an associate member2. You can make your wife a nominee as regards your 50% share in the flat3. After your demise your wife cannot become the 100% owner since your 50% share in the flat will go to your wife and your daughter (assuming they are your only heirs). Only in case of your daughter releasing her share (which she would have inherited from you) in favor of your wife, would she become the exclusive owner4. Please note that a nominee only holds the property in trust for the deceased member and does not automatically become the owner of the property upon demise of the owner/member5. You can very well make a Will in respect of your 50% share in the flat in favor of your wife but in all likelihood the society will require such a Will to be probated.6. There is also a possibility of your wife predeceasing you in which event you and your daughter will inherit your wife's 50% share.7. Your requirement of your daughter succeeding to the flat after you and your wife die, is practically not possible, unless both of you die together. So when one spouse dies before the other, the daughter will inherit from the share of the deceased spouse and thus she cannot be excluded until after the demise of both spouse,  unless both of them die together.Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Herein, you have jointly purchase a flat with your wife, naming her as the co-owner in the New Co-operative housing society in Mumbai. Now, you have to fill the membership form and the nominee form, wherein, you want your wife's name to be added as an associate member, who will jointly hold the shareholding of the society with you. Further, you also want to add her name as the nominee in the nomination form. With regard to your first query on whether an associate member can be nominated as a nominee of the original member in a cooperative housing society, yes, the same can be done. It can be duly filled in the nomination form. With respect to your second query, as to whether and how your daughter's name of age 17 years can be added as a successor or a nominee, in case of your and your wife's death, though you can nominate your daughter's name, but however, the rights on the same will transfer after she reaches the age of majority, i.e., 18 years of age. The Society, may also require a guardian's name to be appointed for the management of her interest in the property, until she reaches the age of majority. With respect to your third query, to nominate your wife as the sole owner after you, you can specify the same in the nomination form, as your wife being the primary nominee, and your daughter being the successor of the property, when both you and your wife are not present. For your fourth query, since you have prepared a will, it is suggested that your will outlines the transfer and the shares to be held by your wife and daughter being clearly stated as you wish. Further, it is better if your will is registered, as the same may add an advantage on your will being considered legally valid.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "How to transfer property to co-owner after one joint owner in deceased",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, the Property was co-owned by your father and mother with a share of 50% each. However, after the death of your father, you have a query as to what is the procedure of transferring 100% of that Property in the name of your mother. With respect to this, firstly a legal heir certificate is necessary to be obtained that specifies the legal heirs of the deceased. For the same, your father's death certificate and identity proof of the legal heirs is necessary to be submitted. After obtaining the certificate, mutation of property may be done, so as to change the ownership and update the records of the land, in your mother's name. Besides this, considering theHindu Succession Act, 1956, the property of your father would generally devolve upon your mother as a legal heir, being the spouse of your father. Henceforth, in accordance to the laws of India, the land would typically transfer to your mother and other legal heirs, but the other legal heirs may present a no-objection certificate to transfer the complete share of the property.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, Shanti Lal is a widower, whose wife has been dead, but he has surviving children. Further, both his mother and father have also been dead, but his wife has a brother and a sister. Now, the query you have is whether Shanti Lal's children can claim their right to property from the maternal side, which is an ancestral property, and not a self-acquired property. Herein, usually the children have the right to inherit their mother's ancestral property, even if the mother has been deceased. TheHindu Succession Act, 1956 governs the inheritance of property, and the share they may claim out of the ancestral property. Furthermore, since Shanti Lal's late wife had a brother and a sister, they would also be entitled to claim a share in the ancestral property, being legal heirs to the ancestral property.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

While one son sold his part of the land to a third party without informing about the same, to the other son, before 1 year 8 months, mutation, i.e., change in the ownership records has also been done already. Hence, you want to file a suit of pre-emption here. While there exists Land Reforms Act for each State, there exists the West Bengal Land Reforms Act, which may be applicable in the instant case, as the property was located in Kolkata, West Bengal. Under this Act, a suit may be filed by the other brother on grounds of being the co-sharer of property, and lack of notice of the sale for the same. Though you would have to inform on your interest to buy the property within 3 months of receiving the notice of transfer, and since you did not receive any such notice, a Suit for pre-emption filed may compel the buyer to sell the property to you, as you will have a priority over other buyers.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Further, the Assistant Charity Commissioner under §41A, had ordered the recorded trustees to hold election, but they are not allowing 800 members, made in your tenure, to vote, stating that they are illegal members. Hence, it is enquired as to the status of the members and on the membership fees that has been collected from them. Herein, firstly, it has been clearly stated under the relevant legislation that, trusts must follow the prescribed protocols of holding elections and membership. If the 800 members had been admitted, in compliance with the rules laid down, then their membership would be considered valid unless they have been disqualified. However, an evidence may be asked for to prove their illegality. With respect to the membership fees, if the members are valid, then there is no need of refund, however, if ruled invalid, their fees may be refunded, but in consideration of the trust's best interest. Therefore, it is suggested that, an appeal is made to the Assistant Charity Commissioner, to deal with the issue, asking for voting rights, and if still denied, they may file a petition in the civil court, seeking for enforcement of their rights.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If the said Flat was purchased by your father through a registered POA from a third party who was the original owner , then the DDA cannot update the ownership of that Flat on that POA , as the POA is not a valid document for transfer of the property.- Further, as the said Flat was not transferred in your fathers name legally , then presently after the demise of your father intestate your fathers death certificate is required for mutation , as she was having a share in the flat- However, if the DDA record was already updated after the purchase of that Flat , then there is not requirement for death certificate , and the said Relinquishment deed is enough.2.

    "question": "DDA freehold / conveyance deed - after death of GPA holder",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, your father had purchased DDA Flat from the original allottee in Jan 1987 through a registered Power of Attorney. However, your father passed away in 2005, and subsequently, a registered relinquishment deed was executed in 2006 wherein, the legal heirs of your father relinquished their rights on the flat to your mother. Presently, in 2024, you applied for mutation of the flat in favour of your mother. Herein, the DDA Officer is asking you to submit a copy of the death certificate of your father's mother, though she had already relinquished her rights via the registered deed. Further, you also do not have that certificate, as your father's mother passed away in 2010. Additionally, the draft of the conveyance deed drafted by your agent states the execution of power of attorney by the original allottee, appointing your mother for the same. Now, with respect your first query, usually a relinquishment deed is sufficient to establish the transfer of rights. Since you have the evidence for the same, it would be sufficient. However, it is possible that a death certificate may be required for procedural requirements, and on its absence, you may have to explain the situation. With respect to the second query on the standard format, generally, it is necessary that the deed accurately reflects the legal status of the parties clearly, and the purpose of the deed. However, you may modify the same, discussing with your agent.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "context": "Asked 7 months ago in Property Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Daughters rights on father property share",
    "answer": "Daughter’s Right in PropertyBackground on Property Rights in IndiaSince medieval times till early 1900, Property Rights in India were governed by laws that differed from religion to religion,These property rights differed from region to region.Property Rights of Hindus before 1956, were governed by customary laws & Shashtric laws, these laws varied in some regions of India on caste basis. Mitakshara School of Thought largely governed the Hindu Property Rights.Property rights of Hindus, Sikh, Jain & Buddhist after 1956, were governed by TheHindu Succession Act, 1956.Property rights of Muslims, were largely governed by the imams , imams relied upon the sources of law which the prophet himself directed, some of which are The Qur'an, Sunna or Ahadis, Ijma & Qiyas. Muslim Law is still largely uncodified, & for the said reason courts rely upon the primary sources of Shia Law & the sources above mentioned. Property Rights of Muslim married under TheSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 are not governed by Muslim Law for the purpose of inheritance, instead it is governed by Indian Succession Act, 1925.Property Rights of Persons of other religions were also customary in past but after 1925, Property Rights are governed by Indian Succession Act, 1925.Daughter’s Right in Property underHindu Succession Act, 1956TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, divided property under to subsets, which were self acquired property & ancestral property. Before The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, ancestral property was inherited as the Survivor-ship rule.As per the survivor-ship rule, coparceners were the persons having right over the ancestral property. As per TheHindu Succession Act, 1956 at that time, coparcners were those who were lenial descendants of the same ancestor, till 3 generations next to holder. The flaw in this provision was that it only allowed the male descendants of an ancestor to become coparceners, and in turn the right in inheriting the property were only given to males. This restricted right to inherit property of any female from Hindu, Sikh, Jain & Buddhist communities.In 2005, to curb this discrimination, The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 amended the provisions of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, including Section 6 of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956.The said amendment deleted the Survivor-ship rule. The said amendment bought Intestate Rule for Ancestral Property or when the person dies without will & Testamentary Rule for Self Acquired Property. According to this, a person can give his or her self acquired property by the way of will(testament) to any person. In the case of ancestral property or when a person dies without will, intestate rules govern the inheritance given to the coparceners. Intestate rule create 4 classes of persons as coparceners, which are to be given equal amount of share in property among the classes. These classes include both male & female members of the family, with daughters included in the Class 1 Persons. This rule made daughters coparceners from birth & gave them equal liability.Confusions in the Implementation of The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, came into force from 9 September, 2005. Soon after the enforcement date, while implementation of the provisions of the said amendment, judicial minds started to ponder over the question, as to whether on 9 September, 2005, it is necessary for the father to be alive for daughter to claim its right in ancestral property?In 2016, the above question was answered for the first time by a Supreme Court Bench in the case of Prakash & Ors. V. Phulavati & Ors. The two judge bench headed by Honourable Justice Anil Dave & Honourable Justice A.K. Goyal, held that for a daughter to claim its right in property, father needs to be alive on 9 September, 2005. As per this judgement, both coparcener and his daughter needs to be alive on 9 September, 2005 for the daughters right in property. This judgement restricted the daughters right in property, where the coparcener has expired before September 9, 2005.In 2018, the above question was again put before a Supreme Court Bench in the case of Danamma& Ors. V. Amar & Ors.. The two judge bench headed by Honourable Justice A.K. Sikri & Honourable Justice Ashok Bhushan, held that for a daughter to claim its right in property, father need not be alive as on September 9, 2005. As per this judgement, even though the coparcener have expired before September 9, 2005 in 2001(in this case), prior to the amendment in TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, the daughter can claim its right in her property. This judgement gave every daughter right to claim its right in the property.The judgments, given in Prakash & Ors. V. Phulavati & Ors & Danamma& Ors. V. Amar & Ors., were giving conflicting opinions and no judgement was able to supersede the other judgement by authority, as both judgments were given by two judge Supreme Court Bench.The confusion created by these two judgments continued till 2020. In 2020, the question as to whether on 9 September, 2005, it is necessary for the father to be alive for daughter to claim its right in ancestral property, was again put before The Supreme Court in the case of Vineeta Sharma V. Rakesh Sharma & Ors. but this time the question was answered by a three judge bench, comprising of Honourable Justice Arun Mishra, Honourable Justice S. Abdul Nazeer & Honourable Justice M.R. Shah. The court held that Daughter’s Right in Coparcenary Property given under Section 6 of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, for daughters born before September 9, 2005 has same rights as for daughters born on or after September 9,2005. The court further said that, the necessity of the father to be alive on September 9, 2005 is irrelevant and not required, as the daughter is alive on the September 9, 2005, she becomes coparcener from the date of amendment,I.e. September 9, 2005. The said amendment to Section 6 of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, give status of coparcener to daughters born before or on or after September 9, 2005 in the same way it grant the status of coparcener to sons. As coparcener status under Section 6 of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, is granted by birth it is not necessary for father of daughters to be alive on the  said date of amendment, I.e. September 9, 2005. This judgement ended the confusion and finally gave daughters their right in property.The above judgement of Vineeta Sharma V. Rakesh Sharma & Ors., were relating to coparcenary/ ancestral property & not the self acquired property of father. Thus, the battle for rights were still not over.In 2022, the question of daughters right in self acquired property was properly answered by the Supreme Court in the case of Arunachala Gounder (Dead) by Lrs V.Ponnusamy & Ors.. The two judge bench headed by Honourable Justice S. Abdul Nazeer & Honourable Justice Krishna Murari, held that  self acquired property of male dying intestate would be inherited by testament, and not secession & daughters will have right to inherit the said property or property obtained in partition in case of male expiring without testament or invalid testament. When female is expired instate without any children, then ancestral property inherited from father, the said property will be inherited by fathers heir in accordance with intestate rules. When a female is expired instate without any children, the ancestral property inherited from husband’s side, the said property will be inherited by husband’s heir in accordance with intestate rules. Thus, with this judgement daughters got their right in property.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, Bangalore6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar"

    "question": "Rental agreement - father passed away",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, your father had a plot since 1 year, and he has passed away. The plot was in his name and had been given to rent for a person from 2011, and the outside shop was given on rent to another person for a low rent, as your father knew him for past 30 years. Presently, you are in a dilemma as to whether you must vacate them or write a rent agreement. However, the property is in your father’s name, and hence you wish to enquire as to how to make a rent agreement, and what are the steps involved in the same. Furthermore, you have also asked that, if an authorization is required, how would the same work, as two out of 4 daughters live outside India. Herein, firstly, since you father has passed away, it is significant that you obtain a legal heir certificate, that certifies who may handle property matters, after your father. Secondly, it is also essential that the revenue records are transferred either in your mother’s name or in any of your father’s legal heirs’ name, under the Land Revenue Act. With respect to drafting of the Rent Agreement, generally, your mother and siblings must sign the document, however, in the absence of your siblings, a Power of Attorney may be executed authorizing your mother or any of your siblings to sign the agreement on their behalf. Such an agreement may clearly state the notice period and the termination clause applicable.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Mutual divorce but home loan on both names",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. Since the home loan is in both your names and the original papers are with the bank, your wife can surrender or transfer her share of the property to you through a gift deed or relinquishment deed. However, this transfer is subject to the bank’s approval because the property is under a mortgage. You should first discuss your intentions with the bank to ensure they agree to the transfer and can provide guidance on their specific requirements.2. The bank can remove your wife's name from the loan if they approve the gift deed or relinquishment deed and you demonstrate your ability to repay the loan independently. The procedure generally involves submitting a formal request to the bank, along with the necessary documents, such as the gift deed, proof of your financial stability, and any additional documentation the bank requires. The bank will reassess the loan terms and may require you to refinance the loan solely in your name.3. Yes, you will need the bank's NOC (No Objection Certificate) to execute a gift deed or relinquishment deed while the property is under a mortgage. The bank must approve the transfer of property rights and ensure that their interests are protected. Once the gift deed is completed and approved by the bank, you can proceed with the transfer of the loan solely to your name, provided you meet the bank's criteria for the loan restructuring.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Mutual divorce but home loan on both names",
    "answer": "1. Transferring Ownership with an Ongoing Home Loan:It is possible to transfer ownership of a property even when a home loan is ongoing. There are two primary ways to do this:Gift Deed:Your wife can execute a gift deed in your favor, transferring her share of the property to you. This would need to be registered at the sub-registrar's office.Relinquishment Deed:Your wife can sign a relinquishment deed, giving up her rights to the property. This would also need to be registered.However, keep in mind that transferring ownership does not automatically remove your wife from the home loan. You'll need to address that separately with the bank.2. Removing a Co-Borrower from the Home Loan:The process for removing a co-borrower from a home loan varies depending on the bank's policies. Here's the general procedure:Inform the Bank:You'll need to notify IDBI Bank about your wife's desire to be removed from the loan.Documentation:You'll likely need to provide the bank with the gift deed or relinquishment deed as proof of ownership transfer.Assessment:The bank will assess your income and repayment capacity to ensure you can handle the loan alone. They may also consider factors like your credit score and the outstanding loan amount.Approval:If the bank approves the removal, they'll amend the loan agreement to reflect you as the sole borrower.Important Considerations:Bank's Consent:The bank's consent is crucial for any ownership transfer or co-borrower removal. They may have specific requirements or conditions you need to fulfill.Tax Implications:Transferring ownership through a gift deed or relinquishment deed may have tax implications. It's advisable to consult with a tax advisor to understand the potential tax liabilities.Romesh Pratap SinghAdvocate, Gwalior23 AnswersTalk to Advocate Romesh Pratap Singh"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, your father had purchased DDA Flat from the original allottee in Jan 1987 through a registered Power of Attorney. However, your father passed away in 2005, and subsequently, a registered relinquishment deed was executed in 2006 wherein, the legal heirs of your father relinquished their rights on the flat to your mother. Presently, in 2024, you applied for mutation of the flat in favour of your mother. Herein, the DDA Officer is asking you to submit a copy of the death certificate of your father's mother, though she had already relinquished her rights via the registered deed. Further, you also do not have that certificate, as your father's mother passed away in 2010. Additionally, the draft of the conveyance deed drafted by your agent states the execution of power of attorney by the original allottee, appointing your mother for the same. Now, with respect your first query, usually a relinquishment deed is sufficient to establish the transfer of rights. Since you have the evidence for the same, it would be sufficient. However, it is possible that a death certificate may be required for procedural requirements, and on its absence, you may have to explain the situation. With respect to the second query on the standard format, generally, it is necessary that the deed accurately reflects the legal status of the parties clearly, and the purpose of the deed.

    "question": "Maharashtra Public Trust Act 1950",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, the recorded trustees of the trust had not filed any change report since its inception. Further, the Assistant Charity Commissioner under §41A, had ordered the recorded trustees to hold election, but they are not allowing 800 members, made in your tenure, to vote, stating that they are illegal members. Hence, it is enquired as to the status of the members and on the membership fees that has been collected from them. Herein, firstly, it has been clearly stated under the relevant legislation that, trusts must follow the prescribed protocols of holding elections and membership. If the 800 members had been admitted, in compliance with the rules laid down, then their membership would be considered valid unless they have been disqualified. However, an evidence may be asked for to prove their illegality. With respect to the membership fees, if the members are valid, then there is no need of refund, however, if ruled invalid, their fees may be refunded, but in consideration of the trust's best interest. Therefore, it is suggested that, an appeal is made to the Assistant Charity Commissioner, to deal with the issue, asking for voting rights, and if still denied, they may file a petition in the civil court, seeking for enforcement of their rights.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "NRI holding indian account and wants buyer to do transaction in it",
    "answer": "TDS on Sale of Property by an NRI:UnderSection 195of theIncome Tax Act, 1961, when a property is purchased from an NRI, the buyer is obligated to deductTDS at 20%onlong-term capital gains(if the property was held for more than 2 years). The 1% TDS rule underSection 194-IAapplies only when both the buyer and seller areresidentsof India.Even if the seller (NRI) uses aresident savings accountfor the transaction and provides a PAN card, he is still treated as an NRI for tax purposes. Thus, a lower TDS rate of 1% cannot be applied in this scenario unless special approvals or tax clearance are obtained.Remittance and Reinvestment in India:The fact that the seller does not intend to remit the money outside India and plans to reinvest it in India does not change the TDS obligations. The tax treatment remains based on the seller'sresidential statusunder the Income Tax Act, not on where the funds are being reinvested.Opening of NRE/NRO Account:The NRI seller is required by law to handle such transactions through anNRO account.

Presently, the bank has agreed to take back the case if he pays back Rs. 1,50,000, and hence you wish to enquire on the legal course of actions to be taken so that the back does not ask you to pay the remaining amount, and if there is an option to recover the amount paid by you to the bank. Herein, firstly, it is suggested that your relative has a negotiation with a bank for a formal settlement and agreement of only up to Rs. 1,50,000 from your relative, and not ask the remaining Rs. 2,00,000 for thecheque bounce. With respect to the recovery of amount from his friend, your relative may file a suit under the Specific Relief Act or the Indian Contract Act, claiming that your relative is the guarantor and hence, entitled to recover the amount paid for his friend. To prevent from any future course of action, it is recommended that the statement, of bank to release your relative from recovering for further claims, is clearly documented.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Furthermore, you have also asked that, if an authorization is required, how would the same work, as two out of 4 daughters live outside India. Herein, firstly, since you father has passed away, it is significant that you obtain a legal heir certificate, that certifies who may handle property matters, after your father. Secondly, it is also essential that the revenue records are transferred either in your mother’s name or in any of your father’s legal heirs’ name, under the Land Revenue Act. With respect to drafting of the Rent Agreement, generally, your mother and siblings must sign the document, however, in the absence of your siblings, a Power of Attorney may be executed authorizing your mother or any of your siblings to sign the agreement on their behalf.

    "question": "NRI holding indian account and wants buyer to do transaction in it",
    "answer": "TDS on Sale of Property by an NRI:UnderSection 195of theIncome Tax Act, 1961, when a property is purchased from an NRI, the buyer is obligated to deductTDS at 20%onlong-term capital gains(if the property was held for more than 2 years). The 1% TDS rule underSection 194-IAapplies only when both the buyer and seller areresidentsof India.Even if the seller (NRI) uses aresident savings accountfor the transaction and provides a PAN card, he is still treated as an NRI for tax purposes. Thus, a lower TDS rate of 1% cannot be applied in this scenario unless special approvals or tax clearance are obtained.Remittance and Reinvestment in India:The fact that the seller does not intend to remit the money outside India and plans to reinvest it in India does not change the TDS obligations. The tax treatment remains based on the seller'sresidential statusunder the Income Tax Act, not on where the funds are being reinvested.Opening of NRE/NRO Account:The NRI seller is required by law to handle such transactions through anNRO account. Using a regularresident savings accountfor these transactions could raise compliance issues with both theIncome Tax DepartmentandRBI. Even though the seller is providing Indian ID and PAN card, it does not override their NRI status for tax purposes.As a  buyer, you are legally responsible for ensuring the correct TDS is deducted and deposited with the tax authorities. If the correct TDS is not deducted (i.e., 20% for NRI), the tax department can hold thebuyer liablefor any shortfall, including penalties and interest.Shiva BharathyAdvocate, Chennai102 Answers1 ConsultationTalk to Advocate Shiva Bharathy"

    "context": "Asked 7 months ago in Property Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Daughters rights on father property share",
    "answer": "Daughter’s Right in PropertyBackground on Property Rights in IndiaSince medieval times till early 1900, Property Rights in India were governed by laws that differed from religion to religion,These property rights differed from region to region.Property Rights of Hindus before 1956, were governed by customary laws & Shashtric laws, these laws varied in some regions of India on caste basis. Mitakshara School of Thought largely governed the Hindu Property Rights.Property rights of Hindus, Sikh, Jain & Buddhist after 1956, were governed by TheHindu Succession Act, 1956.Property rights of Muslims, were largely governed by the imams , imams relied upon the sources of law which the prophet himself directed, some of which are The Qur'an, Sunna or Ahadis, Ijma & Qiyas. Muslim Law is still largely uncodified, & for the said reason courts rely upon the primary sources of Shia Law & the sources above mentioned. Property Rights of Muslim married under TheSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 are not governed by Muslim Law for the purpose of inheritance, instead it is governed by Indian Succession Act, 1925.Property Rights of Persons of other religions were also customary in past but after 1925, Property Rights are governed by Indian Succession Act, 1925.Daughter’s Right in Property underHindu Succession Act, 1956TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, divided property under to subsets, which were self acquired property & ancestral property. Before The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, ancestral property was inherited as the Survivor-ship rule.As per the survivor-ship rule, coparceners were the persons having right over the ancestral property. As per TheHindu Succession Act, 1956 at that time, coparcners were those who were lenial descendants of the same ancestor, till 3 generations next to holder. The flaw in this provision was that it only allowed the male descendants of an ancestor to become coparceners, and in turn the right in inheriting the property were only given to males. This restricted right to inherit property of any female from Hindu, Sikh, Jain & Buddhist communities.In 2005, to curb this discrimination, The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 amended the provisions of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, including Section 6 of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956.The said amendment deleted the Survivor-ship rule. The said amendment bought Intestate Rule for Ancestral Property or when the person dies without will & Testamentary Rule for Self Acquired Property. According to this, a person can give his or her self acquired property by the way of will(testament) to any person. In the case of ancestral property or when a person dies without will, intestate rules govern the inheritance given to the coparceners. Intestate rule create 4 classes of persons as coparceners, which are to be given equal amount of share in property among the classes. These classes include both male & female members of the family, with daughters included in the Class 1 Persons. This rule made daughters coparceners from birth & gave them equal liability.Confusions in the Implementation of The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, came into force from 9 September, 2005. Soon after the enforcement date, while implementation of the provisions of the said amendment, judicial minds started to ponder over the question, as to whether on 9 September, 2005, it is necessary for the father to be alive for daughter to claim its right in ancestral property?In 2016, the above question was answered for the first time by a Supreme Court Bench in the case of Prakash & Ors. V. Phulavati & Ors. The two judge bench headed by Honourable Justice Anil Dave & Honourable Justice A.K. Goyal, held that for a daughter to claim its right in property, father needs to be alive on 9 September, 2005. As per this judgement, both coparcener and his daughter needs to be alive on 9 September, 2005 for the daughters right in property. This judgement restricted the daughters right in property, where the coparcener has expired before September 9, 2005.In 2018, the above question was again put before a Supreme Court Bench in the case of Danamma& Ors. V. Amar & Ors.. The two judge bench headed by Honourable Justice A.K. Sikri & Honourable Justice Ashok Bhushan, held that for a daughter to claim its right in property, father need not be alive as on September 9, 2005. As per this judgement, even though the coparcener have expired before September 9, 2005 in 2001(in this case), prior to the amendment in TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, the daughter can claim its right in her property. This judgement gave every daughter right to claim its right in the property.The judgments, given in Prakash & Ors. V. Phulavati & Ors & Danamma& Ors. V. Amar & Ors., were giving conflicting opinions and no judgement was able to supersede the other judgement by authority, as both judgments were given by two judge Supreme Court Bench.The confusion created by these two judgments continued till 2020. In 2020, the question as to whether on 9 September, 2005, it is necessary for the father to be alive for daughter to claim its right in ancestral property, was again put before The Supreme Court in the case of Vineeta Sharma V. Rakesh Sharma & Ors. but this time the question was answered by a three judge bench, comprising of Honourable Justice Arun Mishra, Honourable Justice S. Abdul Nazeer & Honourable Justice M.R. Shah. The court held that Daughter’s Right in Coparcenary Property given under Section 6 of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, for daughters born before September 9, 2005 has same rights as for daughters born on or after September 9,2005. The court further said that, the necessity of the father to be alive on September 9, 2005 is irrelevant and not required, as the daughter is alive on the September 9, 2005, she becomes coparcener from the date of amendment,I.e. September 9, 2005. The said amendment to Section 6 of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, give status of coparcener to daughters born before or on or after September 9, 2005 in the same way it grant the status of coparcener to sons. As coparcener status under Section 6 of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, is granted by birth it is not necessary for father of daughters to be alive on the  said date of amendment, I.e. September 9, 2005. This judgement ended the confusion and finally gave daughters their right in property.The above judgement of Vineeta Sharma V. Rakesh Sharma & Ors., were relating to coparcenary/ ancestral property & not the self acquired property of father. Thus, the battle for rights were still not over.In 2022, the question of daughters right in self acquired property was properly answered by the Supreme Court in the case of Arunachala Gounder (Dead) by Lrs V.Ponnusamy & Ors.. The two judge bench headed by Honourable Justice S. Abdul Nazeer & Honourable Justice Krishna Murari, held that  self acquired property of male dying intestate would be inherited by testament, and not secession & daughters will have right to inherit the said property or property obtained in partition in case of male expiring without testament or invalid testament. When female is expired instate without any children, then ancestral property inherited from father, the said property will be inherited by fathers heir in accordance with intestate rules. When a female is expired instate without any children, the ancestral property inherited from husband’s side, the said property will be inherited by husband’s heir in accordance with intestate rules. Thus, with this judgement daughters got their right in property.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, Bangalore6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar"

    "question": "Is hiding the fraud done by a fraud Indian person considered a fraud as per Indian law?",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, your father Mr. Jayvir Singh Tomar, is a fugitive from Kuwait since 2016. He has multiple arrest warrants issued against him, and furthermore, a jail sentence for 5 years in Kuwait since 2017 but he did not serve the same. He had taken corporate loans for about Rs. 60 Crores, as a personal guarantor, and refused to pay back the same. There are other directors who know about the fraud, but are nevertheless supporting his business and have created an ecosystem of fraud. Therefore, you wish to enquire what action may be taken against them. Herein, firstly, under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, previously theIndian Penal Code, action may be taken for cheating and dishonestly inducing people. Further, they may also be liable for criminal breach of trust. Additionally, the money here, can be understood as proceeds of crime, and hence resulting in money laundering. Action may also be taken in accordance to the Companies Act, for fraud, and you may initiate proceedings. However, it is suggested that all the relevant evidences are documented and then a complaint is lodged with the authorities.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, your father had a plot since 1 year, and he has passed away. The plot was in his name and had been given to rent for a person from 2011, and the outside shop was given on rent to another person for a low rent, as your father knew him for past 30 years. Presently, you are in a dilemma as to whether you must vacate them or write a rent agreement. However, the property is in your father’s name, and hence you wish to enquire as to how to make a rent agreement, and what are the steps involved in the same. Furthermore, you have also asked that, if an authorization is required, how would the same work, as two out of 4 daughters live outside India. Herein, firstly, since you father has passed away, it is significant that you obtain a legal heir certificate, that certifies who may handle property matters, after your father. Secondly, it is also essential that the revenue records are transferred either in your mother’s name or in any of your father’s legal heirs’ name, under the Land Revenue Act. With respect to drafting of the Rent Agreement, generally, your mother and siblings must sign the document, however, in the absence of your siblings, a Power of Attorney may be executed authorizing your mother or any of your siblings to sign the agreement on their behalf. Such an agreement may clearly state the notice period and the termination clause applicable.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "You can claim easmentary right of necessity if there is no other access to your land2) Section 13 of the Indian Easements Act deals with easement of necessity An easement of necessity means an easement without which the property cannot be used at all. Mere convenience is not the test of an easement of necessity. It can be claimed only when there is absolute necessity for it, i.e. when the property cannot be used at all without the easement and not merely where it is necessary for its reasonable, or more convenient enjoyment. A man cannot acquire a right of way as an easement of necessity, if he has any other means of access to his land however more inconvenient it may be than be passing over his neighbours.3) under section 35 of easement act you can obtain permanent injunction restraining your brother family   from obstructing your right of passage . pending hearing and final disposal of suit you can claim interim reliefs .Ajay SethiAdvocate, Mumbai98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi"

He has multiple arrest warrants issued against him, and furthermore, a jail sentence for 5 years in Kuwait since 2017 but he did not serve the same. He had taken corporate loans for about Rs. 60 Crores, as a personal guarantor, and refused to pay back the same.

Therefore, you wish to enquire what action may be taken against them. Herein, firstly, under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, previously theIndian Penal Code, action may be taken for cheating and dishonestly inducing people. Further, they may also be liable for criminal breach of trust. Additionally, the money here, can be understood as proceeds of crime, and hence resulting in money laundering.

    "context": "Asked 7 months ago in Property Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Daughters rights on father property share",
    "answer": "Daughter’s Right in PropertyBackground on Property Rights in IndiaSince medieval times till early 1900, Property Rights in India were governed by laws that differed from religion to religion,These property rights differed from region to region.Property Rights of Hindus before 1956, were governed by customary laws & Shashtric laws, these laws varied in some regions of India on caste basis. Mitakshara School of Thought largely governed the Hindu Property Rights.Property rights of Hindus, Sikh, Jain & Buddhist after 1956, were governed by TheHindu Succession Act, 1956.Property rights of Muslims, were largely governed by the imams , imams relied upon the sources of law which the prophet himself directed, some of which are The Qur'an, Sunna or Ahadis, Ijma & Qiyas. Muslim Law is still largely uncodified, & for the said reason courts rely upon the primary sources of Shia Law & the sources above mentioned. Property Rights of Muslim married under TheSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 are not governed by Muslim Law for the purpose of inheritance, instead it is governed by Indian Succession Act, 1925.Property Rights of Persons of other religions were also customary in past but after 1925, Property Rights are governed by Indian Succession Act, 1925.Daughter’s Right in Property underHindu Succession Act, 1956TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, divided property under to subsets, which were self acquired property & ancestral property. Before The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, ancestral property was inherited as the Survivor-ship rule.As per the survivor-ship rule, coparceners were the persons having right over the ancestral property. As per TheHindu Succession Act, 1956 at that time, coparcners were those who were lenial descendants of the same ancestor, till 3 generations next to holder. The flaw in this provision was that it only allowed the male descendants of an ancestor to become coparceners, and in turn the right in inheriting the property were only given to males. This restricted right to inherit property of any female from Hindu, Sikh, Jain & Buddhist communities.In 2005, to curb this discrimination, The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 amended the provisions of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, including Section 6 of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956.The said amendment deleted the Survivor-ship rule. The said amendment bought Intestate Rule for Ancestral Property or when the person dies without will & Testamentary Rule for Self Acquired Property. According to this, a person can give his or her self acquired property by the way of will(testament) to any person. In the case of ancestral property or when a person dies without will, intestate rules govern the inheritance given to the coparceners. Intestate rule create 4 classes of persons as coparceners, which are to be given equal amount of share in property among the classes. These classes include both male & female members of the family, with daughters included in the Class 1 Persons. This rule made daughters coparceners from birth & gave them equal liability.Confusions in the Implementation of The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, came into force from 9 September, 2005. Soon after the enforcement date, while implementation of the provisions of the said amendment, judicial minds started to ponder over the question, as to whether on 9 September, 2005, it is necessary for the father to be alive for daughter to claim its right in ancestral property?In 2016, the above question was answered for the first time by a Supreme Court Bench in the case of Prakash & Ors. V. Phulavati & Ors. The two judge bench headed by Honourable Justice Anil Dave & Honourable Justice A.K. Goyal, held that for a daughter to claim its right in property, father needs to be alive on 9 September, 2005. As per this judgement, both coparcener and his daughter needs to be alive on 9 September, 2005 for the daughters right in property. This judgement restricted the daughters right in property, where the coparcener has expired before September 9, 2005.In 2018, the above question was again put before a Supreme Court Bench in the case of Danamma& Ors. V. Amar & Ors.. The two judge bench headed by Honourable Justice A.K. Sikri & Honourable Justice Ashok Bhushan, held that for a daughter to claim its right in property, father need not be alive as on September 9, 2005. As per this judgement, even though the coparcener have expired before September 9, 2005 in 2001(in this case), prior to the amendment in TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, the daughter can claim its right in her property. This judgement gave every daughter right to claim its right in the property.The judgments, given in Prakash & Ors. V. Phulavati & Ors & Danamma& Ors. V. Amar & Ors., were giving conflicting opinions and no judgement was able to supersede the other judgement by authority, as both judgments were given by two judge Supreme Court Bench.The confusion created by these two judgments continued till 2020. In 2020, the question as to whether on 9 September, 2005, it is necessary for the father to be alive for daughter to claim its right in ancestral property, was again put before The Supreme Court in the case of Vineeta Sharma V. Rakesh Sharma & Ors. but this time the question was answered by a three judge bench, comprising of Honourable Justice Arun Mishra, Honourable Justice S. Abdul Nazeer & Honourable Justice M.R. Shah. The court held that Daughter’s Right in Coparcenary Property given under Section 6 of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, for daughters born before September 9, 2005 has same rights as for daughters born on or after September 9,2005. The court further said that, the necessity of the father to be alive on September 9, 2005 is irrelevant and not required, as the daughter is alive on the September 9, 2005, she becomes coparcener from the date of amendment,I.e. September 9, 2005. The said amendment to Section 6 of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, give status of coparcener to daughters born before or on or after September 9, 2005 in the same way it grant the status of coparcener to sons. As coparcener status under Section 6 of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, is granted by birth it is not necessary for father of daughters to be alive on the  said date of amendment, I.e. September 9, 2005. This judgement ended the confusion and finally gave daughters their right in property.The above judgement of Vineeta Sharma V. Rakesh Sharma & Ors., were relating to coparcenary/ ancestral property & not the self acquired property of father. Thus, the battle for rights were still not over.In 2022, the question of daughters right in self acquired property was properly answered by the Supreme Court in the case of Arunachala Gounder (Dead) by Lrs V.Ponnusamy & Ors.. The two judge bench headed by Honourable Justice S. Abdul Nazeer & Honourable Justice Krishna Murari, held that  self acquired property of male dying intestate would be inherited by testament, and not secession & daughters will have right to inherit the said property or property obtained in partition in case of male expiring without testament or invalid testament. When female is expired instate without any children, then ancestral property inherited from father, the said property will be inherited by fathers heir in accordance with intestate rules. When a female is expired instate without any children, the ancestral property inherited from husband’s side, the said property will be inherited by husband’s heir in accordance with intestate rules. Thus, with this judgement daughters got their right in property.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, Bangalore6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar"

    "question": "NRI holding indian account and wants buyer to do transaction in it",
    "answer": "TDS on Sale of Property by an NRI:UnderSection 195of theIncome Tax Act, 1961, when a property is purchased from an NRI, the buyer is obligated to deductTDS at 20%onlong-term capital gains(if the property was held for more than 2 years). The 1% TDS rule underSection 194-IAapplies only when both the buyer and seller areresidentsof India.Even if the seller (NRI) uses aresident savings accountfor the transaction and provides a PAN card, he is still treated as an NRI for tax purposes. Thus, a lower TDS rate of 1% cannot be applied in this scenario unless special approvals or tax clearance are obtained.Remittance and Reinvestment in India:The fact that the seller does not intend to remit the money outside India and plans to reinvest it in India does not change the TDS obligations. The tax treatment remains based on the seller'sresidential statusunder the Income Tax Act, not on where the funds are being reinvested.Opening of NRE/NRO Account:The NRI seller is required by law to handle such transactions through anNRO account. Using a regularresident savings accountfor these transactions could raise compliance issues with both theIncome Tax DepartmentandRBI. Even though the seller is providing Indian ID and PAN card, it does not override their NRI status for tax purposes.As a  buyer, you are legally responsible for ensuring the correct TDS is deducted and deposited with the tax authorities. If the correct TDS is not deducted (i.e., 20% for NRI), the tax department can hold thebuyer liablefor any shortfall, including penalties and interest.Shiva BharathyAdvocate, Chennai102 Answers1 ConsultationTalk to Advocate Shiva Bharathy"

Your father passed away in 2013 and your mother in 2022, and presently your sisters are asking for an equal share in the properties. Under theHindu Succession Act, when a Hindu male dies, his property usually goes on to his legal heirs. However, it does not automatically pass on to your mother unless the same has been mentioned in his will. With respect to rights of daughters, according to the amendment made in 2005, married daughters are given a right in the father's property, in the same way as that of unmarried daughters. But, usually the property would be divided equally among all the legal heirs, including your mother, sons, and daughters. Arunachala Gounder (Dead) By Lrs v. Ponnusamy (2022) is one case where such a ruling was held by the Supreme Court.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "context": "Asked 7 months ago in Property Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Daughters rights on father property share",
    "answer": "Daughter’s Right in PropertyBackground on Property Rights in IndiaSince medieval times till early 1900, Property Rights in India were governed by laws that differed from religion to religion,These property rights differed from region to region.Property Rights of Hindus before 1956, were governed by customary laws & Shashtric laws, these laws varied in some regions of India on caste basis. Mitakshara School of Thought largely governed the Hindu Property Rights.Property rights of Hindus, Sikh, Jain & Buddhist after 1956, were governed by TheHindu Succession Act, 1956.Property rights of Muslims, were largely governed by the imams , imams relied upon the sources of law which the prophet himself directed, some of which are The Qur'an, Sunna or Ahadis, Ijma & Qiyas. Muslim Law is still largely uncodified, & for the said reason courts rely upon the primary sources of Shia Law & the sources above mentioned. Property Rights of Muslim married under TheSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 are not governed by Muslim Law for the purpose of inheritance, instead it is governed by Indian Succession Act, 1925.Property Rights of Persons of other religions were also customary in past but after 1925, Property Rights are governed by Indian Succession Act, 1925.Daughter’s Right in Property underHindu Succession Act, 1956TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, divided property under to subsets, which were self acquired property & ancestral property. Before The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, ancestral property was inherited as the Survivor-ship rule.As per the survivor-ship rule, coparceners were the persons having right over the ancestral property. As per TheHindu Succession Act, 1956 at that time, coparcners were those who were lenial descendants of the same ancestor, till 3 generations next to holder. The flaw in this provision was that it only allowed the male descendants of an ancestor to become coparceners, and in turn the right in inheriting the property were only given to males. This restricted right to inherit property of any female from Hindu, Sikh, Jain & Buddhist communities.In 2005, to curb this discrimination, The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 amended the provisions of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, including Section 6 of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956.The said amendment deleted the Survivor-ship rule. The said amendment bought Intestate Rule for Ancestral Property or when the person dies without will & Testamentary Rule for Self Acquired Property. According to this, a person can give his or her self acquired property by the way of will(testament) to any person. In the case of ancestral property or when a person dies without will, intestate rules govern the inheritance given to the coparceners. Intestate rule create 4 classes of persons as coparceners, which are to be given equal amount of share in property among the classes. These classes include both male & female members of the family, with daughters included in the Class 1 Persons. This rule made daughters coparceners from birth & gave them equal liability.Confusions in the Implementation of The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, came into force from 9 September, 2005. Soon after the enforcement date, while implementation of the provisions of the said amendment, judicial minds started to ponder over the question, as to whether on 9 September, 2005, it is necessary for the father to be alive for daughter to claim its right in ancestral property?In 2016, the above question was answered for the first time by a Supreme Court Bench in the case of Prakash & Ors. V. Phulavati & Ors. The two judge bench headed by Honourable Justice Anil Dave & Honourable Justice A.K. Goyal, held that for a daughter to claim its right in property, father needs to be alive on 9 September, 2005. As per this judgement, both coparcener and his daughter needs to be alive on 9 September, 2005 for the daughters right in property. This judgement restricted the daughters right in property, where the coparcener has expired before September 9, 2005.In 2018, the above question was again put before a Supreme Court Bench in the case of Danamma& Ors. V. Amar & Ors.. The two judge bench headed by Honourable Justice A.K. Sikri & Honourable Justice Ashok Bhushan, held that for a daughter to claim its right in property, father need not be alive as on September 9, 2005. As per this judgement, even though the coparcener have expired before September 9, 2005 in 2001(in this case), prior to the amendment in TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, the daughter can claim its right in her property. This judgement gave every daughter right to claim its right in the property.The judgments, given in Prakash & Ors. V. Phulavati & Ors & Danamma& Ors. V. Amar & Ors., were giving conflicting opinions and no judgement was able to supersede the other judgement by authority, as both judgments were given by two judge Supreme Court Bench.The confusion created by these two judgments continued till 2020. In 2020, the question as to whether on 9 September, 2005, it is necessary for the father to be alive for daughter to claim its right in ancestral property, was again put before The Supreme Court in the case of Vineeta Sharma V. Rakesh Sharma & Ors. but this time the question was answered by a three judge bench, comprising of Honourable Justice Arun Mishra, Honourable Justice S. Abdul Nazeer & Honourable Justice M.R. Shah. The court held that Daughter’s Right in Coparcenary Property given under Section 6 of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, for daughters born before September 9, 2005 has same rights as for daughters born on or after September 9,2005. The court further said that, the necessity of the father to be alive on September 9, 2005 is irrelevant and not required, as the daughter is alive on the September 9, 2005, she becomes coparcener from the date of amendment,I.e. September 9, 2005. The said amendment to Section 6 of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, give status of coparcener to daughters born before or on or after September 9, 2005 in the same way it grant the status of coparcener to sons. As coparcener status under Section 6 of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, is granted by birth it is not necessary for father of daughters to be alive on the  said date of amendment, I.e. September 9, 2005. This judgement ended the confusion and finally gave daughters their right in property.The above judgement of Vineeta Sharma V. Rakesh Sharma & Ors., were relating to coparcenary/ ancestral property & not the self acquired property of father. Thus, the battle for rights were still not over.In 2022, the question of daughters right in self acquired property was properly answered by the Supreme Court in the case of Arunachala Gounder (Dead) by Lrs V.Ponnusamy & Ors.. The two judge bench headed by Honourable Justice S. Abdul Nazeer & Honourable Justice Krishna Murari, held that  self acquired property of male dying intestate would be inherited by testament, and not secession & daughters will have right to inherit the said property or property obtained in partition in case of male expiring without testament or invalid testament. When female is expired instate without any children, then ancestral property inherited from father, the said property will be inherited by fathers heir in accordance with intestate rules. When a female is expired instate without any children, the ancestral property inherited from husband’s side, the said property will be inherited by husband’s heir in accordance with intestate rules. Thus, with this judgement daughters got their right in property.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, Bangalore6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar"

    "answer": "TDS on Sale of Property by an NRI:UnderSection 195of theIncome Tax Act, 1961, when a property is purchased from an NRI, the buyer is obligated to deductTDS at 20%onlong-term capital gains(if the property was held for more than 2 years). The 1% TDS rule underSection 194-IAapplies only when both the buyer and seller areresidentsof India.Even if the seller (NRI) uses aresident savings accountfor the transaction and provides a PAN card, he is still treated as an NRI for tax purposes. Thus, a lower TDS rate of 1% cannot be applied in this scenario unless special approvals or tax clearance are obtained.Remittance and Reinvestment in India:The fact that the seller does not intend to remit the money outside India and plans to reinvest it in India does not change the TDS obligations. The tax treatment remains based on the seller'sresidential statusunder the Income Tax Act, not on where the funds are being reinvested.Opening of NRE/NRO Account:The NRI seller is required by law to handle such transactions through anNRO account. Using a regularresident savings accountfor these transactions could raise compliance issues with both theIncome Tax DepartmentandRBI. Even though the seller is providing Indian ID and PAN card, it does not override their NRI status for tax purposes.As a  buyer, you are legally responsible for ensuring the correct TDS is deducted and deposited with the tax authorities. If the correct TDS is not deducted (i.e., 20% for NRI), the tax department can hold thebuyer liablefor any shortfall, including penalties and interest.Shiva BharathyAdvocate, Chennai102 Answers1 ConsultationTalk to Advocate Shiva Bharathy"

Your father passed away in 2013 and your mother in 2022, and presently your sisters are asking for an equal share in the properties. Under theHindu Succession Act, when a Hindu male dies, his property usually goes on to his legal heirs. However, it does not automatically pass on to your mother unless the same has been mentioned in his will. With respect to rights of daughters, according to the amendment made in 2005, married daughters are given a right in the father's property, in the same way as that of unmarried daughters. But, usually the property would be divided equally among all the legal heirs, including your mother, sons, and daughters. Arunachala Gounder (Dead) By Lrs v. Ponnusamy (2022) is one case where such a ruling was held by the Supreme Court.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "context": "Asked 7 months ago in Property Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Daughters rights on father property share",
    "answer": "Daughter’s Right in PropertyBackground on Property Rights in IndiaSince medieval times till early 1900, Property Rights in India were governed by laws that differed from religion to religion,These property rights differed from region to region.Property Rights of Hindus before 1956, were governed by customary laws & Shashtric laws, these laws varied in some regions of India on caste basis. Mitakshara School of Thought largely governed the Hindu Property Rights.Property rights of Hindus, Sikh, Jain & Buddhist after 1956, were governed by TheHindu Succession Act, 1956.Property rights of Muslims, were largely governed by the imams , imams relied upon the sources of law which the prophet himself directed, some of which are The Qur'an, Sunna or Ahadis, Ijma & Qiyas. Muslim Law is still largely uncodified, & for the said reason courts rely upon the primary sources of Shia Law & the sources above mentioned. Property Rights of Muslim married under TheSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 are not governed by Muslim Law for the purpose of inheritance, instead it is governed by Indian Succession Act, 1925.Property Rights of Persons of other religions were also customary in past but after 1925, Property Rights are governed by Indian Succession Act, 1925.Daughter’s Right in Property underHindu Succession Act, 1956TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, divided property under to subsets, which were self acquired property & ancestral property. Before The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, ancestral property was inherited as the Survivor-ship rule.As per the survivor-ship rule, coparceners were the persons having right over the ancestral property. As per TheHindu Succession Act, 1956 at that time, coparcners were those who were lenial descendants of the same ancestor, till 3 generations next to holder. The flaw in this provision was that it only allowed the male descendants of an ancestor to become coparceners, and in turn the right in inheriting the property were only given to males. This restricted right to inherit property of any female from Hindu, Sikh, Jain & Buddhist communities.In 2005, to curb this discrimination, The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 amended the provisions of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, including Section 6 of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956.The said amendment deleted the Survivor-ship rule. The said amendment bought Intestate Rule for Ancestral Property or when the person dies without will & Testamentary Rule for Self Acquired Property. According to this, a person can give his or her self acquired property by the way of will(testament) to any person. In the case of ancestral property or when a person dies without will, intestate rules govern the inheritance given to the coparceners. Intestate rule create 4 classes of persons as coparceners, which are to be given equal amount of share in property among the classes. These classes include both male & female members of the family, with daughters included in the Class 1 Persons. This rule made daughters coparceners from birth & gave them equal liability.Confusions in the Implementation of The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, came into force from 9 September, 2005. Soon after the enforcement date, while implementation of the provisions of the said amendment, judicial minds started to ponder over the question, as to whether on 9 September, 2005, it is necessary for the father to be alive for daughter to claim its right in ancestral property?In 2016, the above question was answered for the first time by a Supreme Court Bench in the case of Prakash & Ors. V. Phulavati & Ors. The two judge bench headed by Honourable Justice Anil Dave & Honourable Justice A.K. Goyal, held that for a daughter to claim its right in property, father needs to be alive on 9 September, 2005. As per this judgement, both coparcener and his daughter needs to be alive on 9 September, 2005 for the daughters right in property. This judgement restricted the daughters right in property, where the coparcener has expired before September 9, 2005.In 2018, the above question was again put before a Supreme Court Bench in the case of Danamma& Ors. V. Amar & Ors.. The two judge bench headed by Honourable Justice A.K. Sikri & Honourable Justice Ashok Bhushan, held that for a daughter to claim its right in property, father need not be alive as on September 9, 2005. As per this judgement, even though the coparcener have expired before September 9, 2005 in 2001(in this case), prior to the amendment in TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, the daughter can claim its right in her property. This judgement gave every daughter right to claim its right in the property.The judgments, given in Prakash & Ors. V. Phulavati & Ors & Danamma& Ors. V. Amar & Ors., were giving conflicting opinions and no judgement was able to supersede the other judgement by authority, as both judgments were given by two judge Supreme Court Bench.The confusion created by these two judgments continued till 2020. In 2020, the question as to whether on 9 September, 2005, it is necessary for the father to be alive for daughter to claim its right in ancestral property, was again put before The Supreme Court in the case of Vineeta Sharma V. Rakesh Sharma & Ors. but this time the question was answered by a three judge bench, comprising of Honourable Justice Arun Mishra, Honourable Justice S. Abdul Nazeer & Honourable Justice M.R. Shah. The court held that Daughter’s Right in Coparcenary Property given under Section 6 of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, for daughters born before September 9, 2005 has same rights as for daughters born on or after September 9,2005. The court further said that, the necessity of the father to be alive on September 9, 2005 is irrelevant and not required, as the daughter is alive on the September 9, 2005, she becomes coparcener from the date of amendment,I.e. September 9, 2005. The said amendment to Section 6 of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, give status of coparcener to daughters born before or on or after September 9, 2005 in the same way it grant the status of coparcener to sons. As coparcener status under Section 6 of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, is granted by birth it is not necessary for father of daughters to be alive on the  said date of amendment, I.e. September 9, 2005. This judgement ended the confusion and finally gave daughters their right in property.The above judgement of Vineeta Sharma V. Rakesh Sharma & Ors., were relating to coparcenary/ ancestral property & not the self acquired property of father. Thus, the battle for rights were still not over.In 2022, the question of daughters right in self acquired property was properly answered by the Supreme Court in the case of Arunachala Gounder (Dead) by Lrs V.Ponnusamy & Ors.. The two judge bench headed by Honourable Justice S. Abdul Nazeer & Honourable Justice Krishna Murari, held that  self acquired property of male dying intestate would be inherited by testament, and not secession & daughters will have right to inherit the said property or property obtained in partition in case of male expiring without testament or invalid testament. When female is expired instate without any children, then ancestral property inherited from father, the said property will be inherited by fathers heir in accordance with intestate rules. When a female is expired instate without any children, the ancestral property inherited from husband’s side, the said property will be inherited by husband’s heir in accordance with intestate rules. Thus, with this judgement daughters got their right in property.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, Bangalore6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar"

    "answer": "If she refuses to admit the photos or any other type social media evidence calling them as fake or fabricated then the court will not permit you to mark them as exhibits, in that case you have no other option than to summon the employment details by sending a notice to her employer through court to establish your case.The maintenance orders is always passed from the date of application.  You first prove that she is employed hence not eligible for maintenance.As far as the jurisdiction is concerned she can claim maintenance for the period she was living with you in the same house also or she might state that since she went to her parents house after dispute with you hence filed the case from that place but subsequently she came and live in your house for a short period.  Therefore that will not be a very good ground to deny the maintenance to her, however you can state that she has not approached the court with clean hands and is full of lies and false allegations. The case is based on your strong arguments and merits.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"
