If someone is causing trouble, you can file a First Information Report (FIR) against them. If there is a legal case pending (lis pendens) that concerns a property, the eventual outcome of the case will determine the property's fate. According to Section 52 of theTransfer of Property Act, any transfer made while legal proceedings are ongoing is subject to the final decision of the litigation. It is advisable to inform the police about the situation and simultaneously file an application for an injunction or stay in the court.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Such income is considered to be speculative income and is taxed at 30%.Since binary opinion trading is not legal in India, there is some level of ambiguity in its taxation as well. Like income from futures and opinions trading, many experts believe income from binary trading can also be treated as business income.

    "answer": "Binary option trading is considered to be illegal in Indiabut still, traders across the country carry out such trading and the income from the same is liable to be taxed. Such income is considered to be speculative income and is taxed at 30%.Since binary opinion trading is not legal in India, there is some level of ambiguity in its taxation as well. Like income from futures and opinions trading, many experts believe income from binary trading can also be treated as business income. However, the widely popular opinion is that it will be treated as speculative income. Therefore, it is better to consult a tax expert in this regard to arrive at a definite solution.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear client,If you want to raise the issue of your wife's mental health in court, you may need to obtain a medical opinion from a qualified expert to support your claim. However, the court may not consider the issue of your wife's mental health unless it is relevant to the case, and even then, the court may be reluctant to rely on unproven claims.During the cross-examination, you can ask questions that are relevant to the case and that will help you prove your case. However, the court may disallow questions that are irrelevant or are intended to harass or embarrass the witness. If the judge deems a question to be irrelevant or inappropriate, the judge may sustain an objection from the opposing counsel.Annulment is a legal process by which a marriage is declared null and void. In India, annulment is available only in limited circumstances, such as when the marriage was not consummated or was entered into under coercion or fraud. Mental illness is not generally considered grounds for annulment. If you want to seek a medical examination of your wife, you would need to have a valid reason for doing so and obtain a court order.If custody has not yet been decided, you may have the opportunity to ask questions during the hearing or trial. You may also want to consider hiring a lawyer to represent you in the custody proceedings.Whether or not you can get the 498A case quashed will depend on the specific circumstances of the case. You would need to consult with a lawyer who is familiar with criminal law to determine your options.If you want to reopen cross-examination in family court or in a 354A case, you would need to have a valid reason for doing so and obtain a court order.

    "answer": "- Since, the said flat was given on tenancy before the separation , it means that the said tenant is having consent of the joint owners of the tenanted premises, and hence your wife cannot say that her consent was not there .- Further, as the said property is joint ownership , then she has no right over entire portion of the property and she cannot considered herself as single owner of the property.- Further , if she is creating trouble for the tenant , then tenant can file an Injunction suit before the court for restraining her from taking possession of the tenanted premises forcibly .- Further, if you are paying emi of the said flat and no payment has been made by your wife, then you can be declared as single owner of the flat after filing a suit for declaration before the court.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "She is also the joint owner of the flat hence without jher consent you cannot let out or renew the rental agreement.If she is unwilling or reluctant to sign the agreement as a joint owner, you cannot force her neither you can enter into the agreement on your own alone.You ma be paying the EMI, but that will not make you to own the entire property.If you want to claim the title or the ownership of the entire property then you have to file a suit for declaration to declare the title to your name for the reasons and the documentary evidences yo rely upon, but that will take time.In the meantime if your wife is filing an injunction suit against you and the tenant to restrain yo from letting out or renewing the expired rental agreement, the court may pass a temporary injunction as prayed for by her, in that case you will have to unnecessarily participate in the civil litigation and waste your time, energy and money due to the civil dispute.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The managing committee of your housing society seems to be engaging in some questionable practices. Here are some of the issues you have raised:The managing committee is defending a case that you filed against the society without the approval of the members. This is a violation of the bylaws of most housing societies, which require that major decisions be made with the consent of the majority of the members.The managing committee is charging court expenses in your maintenance bills and charging arrears along with interest. This is also a violation of the bylaws, as the managing committee is not allowed to charge for expenses that are not authorized by the members.The managing committee submitted false evidence in court, which led you to file a contempt case against the society. The managing committee is now defending this case without the consent of the members. This is a serious abuse of power.The managing committee is not providing a breakdown of expenses. This makes it difficult for you to determine whether the charges you are being assessed are legitimate.It is unclear whether you are liable to pay the society's legal expenses for the case you filed against them. This would depend on the specific circumstances of the case and the bylaws of your housing society. However, even if you are not legally liable to pay the expenses, you may still want to consider doing so in order to avoid further conflict with the managing committee.In addition to taking legal action, you may also want to consider speaking to other members of the housing society about the managing committee's behavior. If enough members are concerned, you may be able to force the managing committee to resign or to change their behavior.Here are some of the actions you can take against the managing committee for misusing power and funds of the society:You can file a complaint with the Registrar of Cooperative Societies.You can file a civil suit against the managing committee.You can approach the Consumer Court.You can approach the police and file a complaint against the managing committee for fraud and misrepresentation.It is important to note that the specific actions you can take will depend on the specific circumstances of your case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "NRI (PR of Canada) marrying a Korean citizen (PR of Canda)",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The residency requirements for marriage registration in Bengaluru and Bihar are indeed 30 days. This means that you would need to have been living in either city for at least 30 days before you can apply for a marriage certificate.If you are unable to meet the residency requirements, you can still register your marriage in India, but you will need to do so under theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954. This act allows for the registration of marriages between people of different religions or nationalities, and it does not have any residency requirements.However, there are some potential drawbacks to registering your marriage under theSpecial Marriage Act. For example, the certificate that you receive may not be as widely recognized as a certificate issued under theHindu Marriage Actor the Indian Christian Marriage Act.Another option would be to register your marriage in Canada. This would be the easiest option, as you would not need to meet any residency requirements. However, it is important to note that a Canadian marriage certificate may not be recognized in India.Ultimately, the decision of where to register your marriage is a personal one. You will need to weigh the pros and cons of each option and decide what is best for you and your partner.Here are some additional things to consider when making your decision:Where do you plan to live after your wedding?Where do you want to raise your children?Where do you want to retire?Where do you want to be buried?Once you have considered all of these factors, you will be in a better position to make a decision about where to register your marriage.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "This property was sold in the year 2017 whereas your father died in the year 2023 only, hence he is very well aware of the sale of the property. therefore it cannot be said to be an illegal sale by the POA holder, moreover the power deed is executed by a registered document, hence the deed is also valid till the death of the executant.The POA has acted on behalf of the principal hence the POA cannot be held liable for the fraudulent sale, because the buyer never raised this issue during the lifetime of the principal.Let the buyer file the case and implead the legal heirs of the principal i.e., you and your mother, on receipt of summons, you can challenge the same on merits and documentary evidences.The legal heirs of your father's self acquired property shall include the children born to him out of his illicit affairs with his mistress as well.To know about any other properties or fixed deposit amounts lying on your deceased father's name, you have to use your own source to find them out.For now you don't entertain any claim made orally by the buyer in this regard, you claim innocence about the deal as well as the properties sold to him, let him go top court and prove it against the legal heirs, it will take years for him to get his case disposed, in the meantime you can set things right by compromise or otherwise.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

The POA holder is obligated to return any consideration received to the property owner. If the consideration hasn't been returned, the POA holder is responsible for reimbursing it, along with interest. Neither you, your father, nor his property should be held accountable for the illegal actions of the POA holder, who wrongly sold government land under the pretense of the POA. It's important to note that the POA was meant for your father's own property, not for any government land.The claimed second marriage is not legally valid.

    "answer": "Muslim does not create any distinction between the rights of men and women.On the death of their ancestor, nothing can prevent both girl and boy child to become the legal heirs of inheritable property.However, it is generally found that the quantum of the share of a female heir is half of that of the male heirs.The reason behind this is that under the Muslim law a female shall upon marriage receive mehr and maintenance from her husband whereas males will have only the property of the ancestors for inheritance.Also, males have the duty of maintaining their wife and children.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Property distribution",
    "answer": "- As per Muslim Law, the right of inheritance of property comes only after the death of a person.- Further, any child born into a Muslim family does not get his right to property on his birth.- Further, distribution of property can be made in two ways, firstly per capita or per strip distribution.- Per – Capita distribution method is used in the Sunni law, and according to this method, the estate left over by the ancestors gets equally distributed among the heirs. Therefore, the share of each person depends on the number of heirs.- Per strip distribution method is used in the Shia law, and according to this method, the property gets distributed among the heirs according to the strip they belong to, and hence the quantum of their inheritance also depends upon the branch and the number of persons that belong to the branch.- Further, there is no distinction between the right of men and women; each has right over the said property.- However, a female will get half of the male share.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

To terminate employment for misconduct it is essential to establish the misconduct through a disciplinary enquiry that is held for such purpose in accordance with the principles of natural justice.In case the reasons are unjust, the employee has the right to conduct an inquiry against the unjust treatment. The employee can send a legal notice to the employer in case of such unjust termination.The employee can finally move the Labor Court, in case no relief is provided from the employer.It is always suggested to consult an employment and labor lawyer in India to sue an employer for wrongful termination, understand your legal rights, have a strong case against the employer and make an informed decision about how to proceed with the case.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

Therefore, the share of each person depends on the number of heirs.- Per strip distribution method is used in the Shia law, and according to this method, the property gets distributed among the heirs according to the strip they belong to, and hence the quantum of their inheritance also depends upon the branch and the number of persons that belong to the branch.- Further, there is no distinction between the right of men and women; each has right over the said property.- However, a female will get half of the male share.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

To terminate employment for misconduct it is essential to establish the misconduct through a disciplinary enquiry that is held for such purpose in accordance with the principles of natural justice.In case the reasons are unjust, the employee has the right to conduct an inquiry against the unjust treatment. The employee can send a legal notice to the employer in case of such unjust termination.The employee can finally move the Labor Court, in case no relief is provided from the employer.It is always suggested to consult an employment and labor lawyer in India to sue an employer for wrongful termination, understand your legal rights, have a strong case against the employer and make an informed decision about how to proceed with the case.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "- As per Muslim Law, the right of inheritance of property comes only after the death of a person.- Further, any child born into a Muslim family does not get his right to property on his birth.- Further, distribution of property can be made in two ways, firstly per capita or per strip distribution.- Per – Capita distribution method is used in the Sunni law, and according to this method, the estate left over by the ancestors gets equally distributed among the heirs. Therefore, the share of each person depends on the number of heirs.- Per strip distribution method is used in the Shia law, and according to this method, the property gets distributed among the heirs according to the strip they belong to, and hence the quantum of their inheritance also depends upon the branch and the number of persons that belong to the branch.- Further, there is no distinction between the right of men and women; each has right over the said property.- However, a female will get half of the male share.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "This property was sold in the year 2017 whereas your father died in the year 2023 only, hence he is very well aware of the sale of the property. therefore it cannot be said to be an illegal sale by the POA holder, moreover the power deed is executed by a registered document, hence the deed is also valid till the death of the executant.The POA has acted on behalf of the principal hence the POA cannot be held liable for the fraudulent sale, because the buyer never raised this issue during the lifetime of the principal.Let the buyer file the case and implead the legal heirs of the principal i.e., you and your mother, on receipt of summons, you can challenge the same on merits and documentary evidences.The legal heirs of your father's self acquired property shall include the children born to him out of his illicit affairs with his mistress as well.To know about any other properties or fixed deposit amounts lying on your deceased father's name, you have to use your own source to find them out.For now you don't entertain any claim made orally by the buyer in this regard, you claim innocence about the deal as well as the properties sold to him, let him go top court and prove it against the legal heirs, it will take years for him to get his case disposed, in the meantime you can set things right by compromise or otherwise.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "PoA sold government land & who will repay when principal died",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The Power of Attorney (POA) holder is authorized to act on behalf of the executors, in this case, your father. The POA holder is obligated to return any consideration received to the property owner. If the consideration hasn't been returned, the POA holder is responsible for reimbursing it, along with interest. Neither you, your father, nor his property should be held accountable for the illegal actions of the POA holder, who wrongly sold government land under the pretense of the POA. It's important to note that the POA was meant for your father's own property, not for any government land.The claimed second marriage is not legally valid. If she chooses to initiate legal proceedings, a DNA test can be conducted for her children. Both you and your mother have the right to contest the paternity of the children.

This means that you would need to have been living in either city for at least 30 days before you can apply for a marriage certificate.If you are unable to meet the residency requirements, you can still register your marriage in India, but you will need to do so under theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954. This act allows for the registration of marriages between people of different religions or nationalities, and it does not have any residency requirements.However, there are some potential drawbacks to registering your marriage under theSpecial Marriage Act. For example, the certificate that you receive may not be as widely recognized as a certificate issued under theHindu Marriage Actor the Indian Christian Marriage Act.Another option would be to register your marriage in Canada. This would be the easiest option, as you would not need to meet any residency requirements. However, it is important to note that a Canadian marriage certificate may not be recognized in India.Ultimately, the decision of where to register your marriage is a personal one. You will need to weigh the pros and cons of each option and decide what is best for you and your partner.Here are some additional things to consider when making your decision:Where do you plan to live after your wedding?Where do you want to raise your children?Where do you want to retire?Where do you want to be buried?Once you have considered all of these factors, you will be in a better position to make a decision about where to register your marriage.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Muslim law recognizes two types of heirs, Sharers and Residuaries.Sharers are the ones who are entitled to a certain share in the deceased’s property and Residuaries would take up the share in the property that is left over after the sharers have taken their part.If the deceased had left behind son(s) and daughter(s), then, the daughters cease to be sharers and become residuaries instead, with the residue being so distributed as to ensure that each son gets double of what each daughter gets.Thus your sister shall be eligible for half share of the share that you would be eligible to inherit.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Muslim does not create any distinction between the rights of men and women.On the death of their ancestor, nothing can prevent both girl and boy child to become the legal heirs of inheritable property.However, it is generally found that the quantum of the share of a female heir is half of that of the male heirs.The reason behind this is that under the Muslim law a female shall upon marriage receive mehr and maintenance from her husband whereas males will have only the property of the ancestors for inheritance.Also, males have the duty of maintaining their wife and children.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Property distribution",
    "answer": "- As per Muslim Law, the right of inheritance of property comes only after the death of a person.- Further, any child born into a Muslim family does not get his right to property on his birth.- Further, distribution of property can be made in two ways, firstly per capita or per strip distribution.- Per – Capita distribution method is used in the Sunni law, and according to this method, the estate left over by the ancestors gets equally distributed among the heirs. Therefore, the share of each person depends on the number of heirs.- Per strip distribution method is used in the Shia law, and according to this method, the property gets distributed among the heirs according to the strip they belong to, and hence the quantum of their inheritance also depends upon the branch and the number of persons that belong to the branch.- Further, there is no distinction between the right of men and women; each has right over the said property.- However, a female will get half of the male share.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

Therefore, the share of each person depends on the number of heirs.- Per strip distribution method is used in the Shia law, and according to this method, the property gets distributed among the heirs according to the strip they belong to, and hence the quantum of their inheritance also depends upon the branch and the number of persons that belong to the branch.- Further, there is no distinction between the right of men and women; each has right over the said property.- However, a female will get half of the male share.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The residency requirements for marriage registration in Bengaluru and Bihar are indeed 30 days. This means that you would need to have been living in either city for at least 30 days before you can apply for a marriage certificate.If you are unable to meet the residency requirements, you can still register your marriage in India, but you will need to do so under theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954. This act allows for the registration of marriages between people of different religions or nationalities, and it does not have any residency requirements.However, there are some potential drawbacks to registering your marriage under theSpecial Marriage Act. For example, the certificate that you receive may not be as widely recognized as a certificate issued under theHindu Marriage Actor the Indian Christian Marriage Act.Another option would be to register your marriage in Canada. This would be the easiest option, as you would not need to meet any residency requirements. However, it is important to note that a Canadian marriage certificate may not be recognized in India.Ultimately, the decision of where to register your marriage is a personal one.

This act allows for the registration of marriages between people of different religions or nationalities, and it does not have any residency requirements.However, there are some potential drawbacks to registering your marriage under theSpecial Marriage Act. For example, the certificate that you receive may not be as widely recognized as a certificate issued under theHindu Marriage Actor the Indian Christian Marriage Act.Another option would be to register your marriage in Canada. This would be the easiest option, as you would not need to meet any residency requirements. However, it is important to note that a Canadian marriage certificate may not be recognized in India.Ultimately, the decision of where to register your marriage is a personal one.

    "question": "Sale agreement cancellation by Seller",
    "answer": "1.  It's not clear in your query as to the sale agreement was with possession or without possession.  If it were to be without possession, then the prospective buyer's action in dumping the waste items inside your property is not acceptable till the registered sale deed in his favour is completed.2.  Since the sale agreement is not registered and only notarised, use breach of contract clause if it's there in the sale agreement to your advantage and send him a legal notice for cancellation of the sale agreement due to non-adherence of terms & conditions such as dumping waste during the course of sale itself. After sending notice for cancellation of sale agreement and if no reply is received from the buyer, you can sell/rent the property to any third party.3.  Buyer may take a stand that legally sale agreement would be valid upto 3 years and he may take recourse in that line.Shashidhar S.

    "answer": "Dear Client,The managing committee of your housing society seems to be engaging in some questionable practices. Here are some of the issues you have raised:The managing committee is defending a case that you filed against the society without the approval of the members. This is a violation of the bylaws of most housing societies, which require that major decisions be made with the consent of the majority of the members.The managing committee is charging court expenses in your maintenance bills and charging arrears along with interest. This is also a violation of the bylaws, as the managing committee is not allowed to charge for expenses that are not authorized by the members.The managing committee submitted false evidence in court, which led you to file a contempt case against the society. The managing committee is now defending this case without the consent of the members. This is a serious abuse of power.The managing committee is not providing a breakdown of expenses. This makes it difficult for you to determine whether the charges you are being assessed are legitimate.It is unclear whether you are liable to pay the society's legal expenses for the case you filed against them. This would depend on the specific circumstances of the case and the bylaws of your housing society. However, even if you are not legally liable to pay the expenses, you may still want to consider doing so in order to avoid further conflict with the managing committee.In addition to taking legal action, you may also want to consider speaking to other members of the housing society about the managing committee's behavior. If enough members are concerned, you may be able to force the managing committee to resign or to change their behavior.Here are some of the actions you can take against the managing committee for misusing power and funds of the society:You can file a complaint with the Registrar of Cooperative Societies.You can file a civil suit against the managing committee.You can approach the Consumer Court.You can approach the police and file a complaint against the managing committee for fraud and misrepresentation.It is important to note that the specific actions you can take will depend on the specific circumstances of your case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The residency requirements for marriage registration in Bengaluru and Bihar are indeed 30 days. This means that you would need to have been living in either city for at least 30 days before you can apply for a marriage certificate.If you are unable to meet the residency requirements, you can still register your marriage in India, but you will need to do so under theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954. This act allows for the registration of marriages between people of different religions or nationalities, and it does not have any residency requirements.However, there are some potential drawbacks to registering your marriage under theSpecial Marriage Act. For example, the certificate that you receive may not be as widely recognized as a certificate issued under theHindu Marriage Actor the Indian Christian Marriage Act.Another option would be to register your marriage in Canada. This would be the easiest option, as you would not need to meet any residency requirements. However, it is important to note that a Canadian marriage certificate may not be recognized in India.Ultimately, the decision of where to register your marriage is a personal one. You will need to weigh the pros and cons of each option and decide what is best for you and your partner.Here are some additional things to consider when making your decision:Where do you plan to live after your wedding?Where do you want to raise your children?Where do you want to retire?Where do you want to be buried?Once you have considered all of these factors, you will be in a better position to make a decision about where to register your marriage.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

After sending notice for cancellation of sale agreement and if no reply is received from the buyer, you can sell/rent the property to any third party.3.  Buyer may take a stand that legally sale agreement would be valid upto 3 years and he may take recourse in that line.Shashidhar S.

Here are some of the issues you have raised:The managing committee is defending a case that you filed against the society without the approval of the members. This is a violation of the bylaws of most housing societies, which require that major decisions be made with the consent of the majority of the members.The managing committee is charging court expenses in your maintenance bills and charging arrears along with interest. This is also a violation of the bylaws, as the managing committee is not allowed to charge for expenses that are not authorized by the members.The managing committee submitted false evidence in court, which led you to file a contempt case against the society. The managing committee is now defending this case without the consent of the members. This is a serious abuse of power.The managing committee is not providing a breakdown of expenses. This makes it difficult for you to determine whether the charges you are being assessed are legitimate.It is unclear whether you are liable to pay the society's legal expenses for the case you filed against them. This would depend on the specific circumstances of the case and the bylaws of your housing society. However, even if you are not legally liable to pay the expenses, you may still want to consider doing so in order to avoid further conflict with the managing committee.In addition to taking legal action, you may also want to consider speaking to other members of the housing society about the managing committee's behavior. If enough members are concerned, you may be able to force the managing committee to resign or to change their behavior.Here are some of the actions you can take against the managing committee for misusing power and funds of the society:You can file a complaint with the Registrar of Cooperative Societies.You can file a civil suit against the managing committee.You can approach the Consumer Court.You can approach the police and file a complaint against the managing committee for fraud and misrepresentation.It is important to note that the specific actions you can take will depend on the specific circumstances of your case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Bombay High Court“in Kishore Shankar Signapurkar v. The State of Maharashtra”,  held that the term “any property” coined in the sub-section (1) of Section 102 of CrPC does not include immovable property and hence, the police authority cannot take custody of or seize any immovable property for investigation even if that immovable property reasonably doubtful or found suspicious in between investigation of the crime or offense.However, the police authority is not barred or prohibited from seizing any documents or papers of title correlated with the immovable property, as the same is different from the seizure of immovable property.SC has   in case ofNevada Properties Private Limited Through Its Directors v. The State of Maharashtra And Anotherheld  that the matter or dispute regarding land, house, etc. comes under the jurisdiction of the civil court, and any such inappropriate attempt to convert a civil matter into a criminal dispute should be discouraged.2)Section 102 of CrPC is not entitled to authorize or allow the police authority to dispose of a man from his immovable property for the sake of investigation.Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98561 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The managing committee of your housing society seems to be engaging in some questionable practices. Here are some of the issues you have raised:The managing committee is defending a case that you filed against the society without the approval of the members. This is a violation of the bylaws of most housing societies, which require that major decisions be made with the consent of the majority of the members.The managing committee is charging court expenses in your maintenance bills and charging arrears along with interest. This is also a violation of the bylaws, as the managing committee is not allowed to charge for expenses that are not authorized by the members.The managing committee submitted false evidence in court, which led you to file a contempt case against the society. The managing committee is now defending this case without the consent of the members. This is a serious abuse of power.The managing committee is not providing a breakdown of expenses. This makes it difficult for you to determine whether the charges you are being assessed are legitimate.It is unclear whether you are liable to pay the society's legal expenses for the case you filed against them. This would depend on the specific circumstances of the case and the bylaws of your housing society. However, even if you are not legally liable to pay the expenses, you may still want to consider doing so in order to avoid further conflict with the managing committee.In addition to taking legal action, you may also want to consider speaking to other members of the housing society about the managing committee's behavior. If enough members are concerned, you may be able to force the managing committee to resign or to change their behavior.Here are some of the actions you can take against the managing committee for misusing power and funds of the society:You can file a complaint with the Registrar of Cooperative Societies.You can file a civil suit against the managing committee.You can approach the Consumer Court.You can approach the police and file a complaint against the managing committee for fraud and misrepresentation.It is important to note that the specific actions you can take will depend on the specific circumstances of your case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Sale agreement cancellation by Seller",
    "answer": "1.  It's not clear in your query as to the sale agreement was with possession or without possession.  If it were to be without possession, then the prospective buyer's action in dumping the waste items inside your property is not acceptable till the registered sale deed in his favour is completed.2.  Since the sale agreement is not registered and only notarised, use breach of contract clause if it's there in the sale agreement to your advantage and send him a legal notice for cancellation of the sale agreement due to non-adherence of terms & conditions such as dumping waste during the course of sale itself. After sending notice for cancellation of sale agreement and if no reply is received from the buyer, you can sell/rent the property to any third party.3.  Buyer may take a stand that legally sale agreement would be valid upto 3 years and he may take recourse in that line.Shashidhar S.

If respondent No. 1 was not in a position to take the physical possession of the same before the sale, then they had to adopt course under Section 14 of the Act.

    "question": "Bought a property in bank auction which has dispute",
    "answer": "Symbolic possession is when the bank has the legal right over a property, even though the previous owner continues to have physical possession (occupancy) in the property. Under the law,banks are required to take physical possession and then transfer the rights to the buyer.It isn’t banks’ liability, the buyer assumes all the risks associated with the property. “Buyers are required to conduct thorough checks regarding the title and possession as once the property is conveyed to the buyer, all the risks and liabilities are assumed by the buyer,Typically, the auction notice has a clause, which reads something like this: to the best of the knowledge and information of the authorized officer, no encumbrances exist on the property, and that the said officer shall not be responsible for any unknown existing and future encumbrances or for any third-party claims, rights or dues.However in a judgment by a high court it was observed that the Bank could auction the property even with encumbrances attached to property but it was incumbent upon the Bank to disclose the encumbrances and litigation on the same or tenancy, if any, attached to the property.It was also observed that bank cannot shed away their responsibility for delivering physical possession to the successful bidder after the entire bid amount has been realised by the bank from the bidder. It is the bank's duty to invoke section 14 of the Sarfaesi act to take physical possession.You send a legal notice to the bank to deliver physical possession of the property sold through auction failing which you can approach court with a suit for specific releif to direct the bank to deliver possession or to return the entire amount with interest.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88759 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

Further, it was observed that no doubt, the Bank could auction the property even with encumbrances attached to property but it was incumbent upon the Bank to disclose the encumbrances and litigations on the same or tenancy, if any, attached to the property to all the persons who wanted to participate in the same and to the successful bidder.4) Though, the physical possession of the property need not be taken before being put to auction but the respondents cannot shirk from their duty to hand over the physical possession of the property to the auction purchaser. If respondent No. 1 was not in a position to take the physical possession of the same before the sale, then they had to adopt course under Section 14 of the Act.

    "question": "Bought a property in bank auction which has dispute",
    "answer": "Symbolic possession is when the bank has the legal right over a property, even though the previous owner continues to have physical possession (occupancy) in the property. Under the law,banks are required to take physical possession and then transfer the rights to the buyer.It isn’t banks’ liability, the buyer assumes all the risks associated with the property. “Buyers are required to conduct thorough checks regarding the title and possession as once the property is conveyed to the buyer, all the risks and liabilities are assumed by the buyer,Typically, the auction notice has a clause, which reads something like this: to the best of the knowledge and information of the authorized officer, no encumbrances exist on the property, and that the said officer shall not be responsible for any unknown existing and future encumbrances or for any third-party claims, rights or dues.However in a judgment by a high court it was observed that the Bank could auction the property even with encumbrances attached to property but it was incumbent upon the Bank to disclose the encumbrances and litigation on the same or tenancy, if any, attached to the property.It was also observed that bank cannot shed away their responsibility for delivering physical possession to the successful bidder after the entire bid amount has been realised by the bank from the bidder. It is the bank's duty to invoke section 14 of the Sarfaesi act to take physical possession.You send a legal notice to the bank to deliver physical possession of the property sold through auction failing which you can approach court with a suit for specific releif to direct the bank to deliver possession or to return the entire amount with interest.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88759 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

It is the bank's duty to invoke section 14 of the Sarfaesi act to take physical possession.You send a legal notice to the bank to deliver physical possession of the property sold through auction failing which you can approach court with a suit for specific releif to direct the bank to deliver possession or to return the entire amount with interest.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88759 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "-  As per Supreme court Judgment, provisions on adverse possession are made under the Limitation Act, 1963. In case an owner does not stake his claim over his property for 12 years, a squatter can acquire legal rights over the property. The prescribed period in case of for government-owned properties is 30 years.• To claim his ownership, this squatter has to prove that his occupancy of the property has been uninterrupted for the entire period. You cannot break the period into halves.• He will also have to prove that he has been the sole occupant of the property. There cannot be under the provisions of the law multiple claimants.- Since, the said land is in use and occupation of you for last 29 years continuously then you can claim that property on the ground of adverse possession.- However, the co-sharer can file the case without the consent of other shares.- You should produce the proofs of living and constructing the said house from 1994 to till date for proving your possession in the property.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

Further, it was observed that no doubt, the Bank could auction the property even with encumbrances attached to property but it was incumbent upon the Bank to disclose the encumbrances and litigations on the same or tenancy, if any, attached to the property to all the persons who wanted to participate in the same and to the successful bidder.4) Though, the physical possession of the property need not be taken before being put to auction but the respondents cannot shirk from their duty to hand over the physical possession of the property to the auction purchaser. If respondent No. 1 was not in a position to take the physical possession of the same before the sale, then they had to adopt course under Section 14 of the Act.

    "question": "Bought a property in bank auction which has dispute",
    "answer": "Symbolic possession is when the bank has the legal right over a property, even though the previous owner continues to have physical possession (occupancy) in the property. Under the law,banks are required to take physical possession and then transfer the rights to the buyer.It isn’t banks’ liability, the buyer assumes all the risks associated with the property. “Buyers are required to conduct thorough checks regarding the title and possession as once the property is conveyed to the buyer, all the risks and liabilities are assumed by the buyer,Typically, the auction notice has a clause, which reads something like this: to the best of the knowledge and information of the authorized officer, no encumbrances exist on the property, and that the said officer shall not be responsible for any unknown existing and future encumbrances or for any third-party claims, rights or dues.However in a judgment by a high court it was observed that the Bank could auction the property even with encumbrances attached to property but it was incumbent upon the Bank to disclose the encumbrances and litigation on the same or tenancy, if any, attached to the property.It was also observed that bank cannot shed away their responsibility for delivering physical possession to the successful bidder after the entire bid amount has been realised by the bank from the bidder. It is the bank's duty to invoke section 14 of the Sarfaesi act to take physical possession.You send a legal notice to the bank to deliver physical possession of the property sold through auction failing which you can approach court with a suit for specific releif to direct the bank to deliver possession or to return the entire amount with interest.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88759 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Certainly, an individual can file a lawsuit without the consent of other co-sharers. However, claiming title through adverse possession while being a tenant on the land is not possible. Being a tenant once means remaining a tenant always, so no documents will support a claim of adverse possession. To protect one's interests, it is advisable to actively participate in the case and avoid the plaintiff obtaining an ex parte decision in their favor."

Further, it was observed that no doubt, the Bank could auction the property even with encumbrances attached to property but it was incumbent upon the Bank to disclose the encumbrances and litigations on the same or tenancy, if any, attached to the property to all the persons who wanted to participate in the same and to the successful bidder.4) Though, the physical possession of the property need not be taken before being put to auction but the respondents cannot shirk from their duty to hand over the physical possession of the property to the auction purchaser. If respondent No. 1 was not in a position to take the physical possession of the same before the sale, then they had to adopt course under Section 14 of the Act.

    "answer": "Symbolic possession is when the bank has the legal right over a property, even though the previous owner continues to have physical possession (occupancy) in the property. Under the law,banks are required to take physical possession and then transfer the rights to the buyer.It isn’t banks’ liability, the buyer assumes all the risks associated with the property. “Buyers are required to conduct thorough checks regarding the title and possession as once the property is conveyed to the buyer, all the risks and liabilities are assumed by the buyer,Typically, the auction notice has a clause, which reads something like this: to the best of the knowledge and information of the authorized officer, no encumbrances exist on the property, and that the said officer shall not be responsible for any unknown existing and future encumbrances or for any third-party claims, rights or dues.However in a judgment by a high court it was observed that the Bank could auction the property even with encumbrances attached to property but it was incumbent upon the Bank to disclose the encumbrances and litigation on the same or tenancy, if any, attached to the property.It was also observed that bank cannot shed away their responsibility for delivering physical possession to the successful bidder after the entire bid amount has been realised by the bank from the bidder. It is the bank's duty to invoke section 14 of the Sarfaesi act to take physical possession.You send a legal notice to the bank to deliver physical possession of the property sold through auction failing which you can approach court with a suit for specific releif to direct the bank to deliver possession or to return the entire amount with interest.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88759 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Gratuity Act - Section 4(1)(c)",
    "answer": "The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 provides that an employee who has served for at least 5 years is eligible to receive gratuity, even if they resign. This is because the term \"termination of employment\" in Section 4(1)(b) of the Act includes resignation.The Supreme Court recently upheld this interpretation of the Act in a case involving the Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation (RSRTC). The widow of a deceased RSRTC employee had filed a claim for gratuity, arguing that her husband had been eligible for it because he had served for more than 5 years before resigning. The RSRTC argued that gratuity was not payable in cases of resignation.The Supreme Court rejected the RSRTC's argument, holding that the term \"termination of employment\" in the Act is broad enough to include resignation. The Court also noted that the purpose of the Act is to provide financial assistance to employees who have served for a long period of time, regardless of the reason for their termination of employment.This decision is a significant victory for employees who resign after serving for at least 5 years. It ensures that they will be able to receive gratuity, which can provide them with much-needed financial support during their retirement or other life eventsAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Gratuity Act - Section 4(1)(c)",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You've done a good job summarizing the legal references. Based on the information you've provided:The Gratuity Act, 1972, does indeed state that gratuity is payable to an employee upon the termination of employment due to death or disablement due to accident or disease, and the requirement for continuous service of five years is waived in such cases.The Supreme Court judgment you referenced (Ref-1) suggests that terminating an employee solely because they have acquired a disability and are not fit for service in a particular department is not valid. This aligns with principles of non-discrimination and protection of disabled individuals.The reference to Section 20 of the Persons with Disabilities (PWD) Act, 2016 (Ref-2) reinforces the idea of non-discrimination in employment for disabled individuals. The PWD Act emphasizes that employees with disabilities should not be terminated solely on the basis of disability. It also highlights the need to provide reasonable accommodations, adjust the employee to a suitable post with the same pay scale and benefits, and even consider supernumerary positions if necessary.Based on these references, your understanding is generally accurate:Termination solely due to an employee's disability, especially if they are not fit for a specific post or department, could be seen as discriminatory and invalid under the PWD Act and related legal principles.If an employee acquires a disability and becomes unfit for their current role, employers are expected to provide reasonable accommodations or find an alternative suitable role within the organization.However, it's important to remember that the specific circumstances of each case can impact how these legal principles are applied.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Also that that BLOs should necessarily be sanctioned TA/DA, if they make travels outside their Polling Station areas for the purpose of training.3.  If there is a biased treatment by the Electoral officer to appoint the teachers as BLO, the matter can be represented to the District returning officer for direction to intervene in this attitude render equal justice to all..4. The system is that some people with the influence of political people are able to manage, your complaint about this may not be entertained by the higher officer fearing repercussions.5. You can apply for sick leave on the basis of the medical certificate including the treatment particulars and seek to relieve you.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88759 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Based on the information you have provided, it is not legal for the owner of flat 701 to have acquired the 1500 sq.ft. terrace in the name of allotment. The terrace is a common area for the benefit of all flat owners, and it cannot be allotted to a single flat owner.The fact that the sale deed mentions that the terrace is allotted to flat 701 does not make it legal. The sale deed cannot override the provisions of the Maharashtra Ownership Flats Act, 1963 (MOFA), which states that all common areas in a building must be shared by all flat owners.The owner of flat 701 is also not entitled to use the terrace for free. They must pay their share of the maintenance expenses for the terrace, just like all the other flat owners.If the owner of flat 701 is refusing to allow access to the terrace or to pay their share of the maintenance, you can take legal action against them.

    "question": "Regarding part OC vs complete OC and flat possession",
    "answer": "If your builder has issued a possession letter without obtaining an Occupancy Certificate, it could be considered as an irregularity and there may be legal issues related to the occupancy of the flat.A possession certificate states the property completion date. It doesn't make you the rightful of the property. On the other hand, an occupancy certificate is issued by the local authorities stating the completion of the project and that the building is fit to be occupied.An Occupancy Certificate (OC) is necessaryto apply for civic facilities like water, electricity, and sanitation, among others. The local municipal body needs this document, in the absence of which home buyers can complain to the consumer forum or the State Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) body.Once the entire project is completed, the issuing authority grants a single OC for the project as a whole. Thus, as is clear,partial OC allows the complete portion of the project to be opened for occupancy. Naturally, partial OCs are valid till the entire project is completed and the final OC is issued.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88759 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "1.Occupancy Certificate evidences the completion of the building as per the approved plan and compliance of local laws.- If the builder is unable to obtain the occupancy certificate, it means that the builder has violated building law or deviated from Construction Plan, and further it is illegal to occupy in a building or apartment that doesn’t have an occupancy certificate.- Further, It is illegal to occupy in a building or apartment that doesn’t have an occupancy certificate , and a building without OCs is  not given a water connection and are charged a higher property tax.- Hence, in the absence of an OC, you should not accept the possession letter from the builder and not make further payment2. If the builder has violated building law or deviated from Construction Plan , then the chance of getting OC may be less.3. No4.

However, if the OC reveals that there are issues affecting your flat, it is advisable not to take possession until those problems are resolved.The validity of the OC depends on whether the project adheres to legal regulations. In the case of water-related matters, having the OC should be sufficient.However, there is a possibility that the OC might not be approved if there are non-compliances or issues with the project. In such cases, it is crucial to address the concerns before taking possession of the flat.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "First document wrong registration",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In 2019, Snivas Reddy acquired a property through a registered sale deed from the seller. This means that he holds a stronger claim to the property since the transaction was legally documented and recorded. However, it's important to note that the act of mutation, which is the process of updating land records to reflect the change in ownership, does not, by itself, grant ownership rights. Mutation is primarily for the purpose of property tax payment and maintaining accurate records.Now, in the present situation, if Snivas Reddy finds himself in a situation where he has paid money for the purchase of agricultural land in 2021, he can potentially utilize the indemnity clause within the sale deed. This clause could allow him to claim a refund of the money he paid, as it offers protection against certain legal or financial risks arising from the transaction. However, it is essential for Snivas Reddy to review the terms and conditions of the indemnity clause and seek legal advice to ensure the validity and effectiveness of his claim.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In 2019, Snivas Reddy acquired a property through a registered sale deed from the seller. This means that he holds a stronger claim to the property since the transaction was legally documented and recorded. However, it's important to note that the act of mutation, which is the process of updating land records to reflect the change in ownership, does not, by itself, grant ownership rights. Mutation is primarily for the purpose of property tax payment and maintaining accurate records.Now, in the present situation, if Snivas Reddy finds himself in a situation where he has paid money for the purchase of agricultural land in 2021, he can potentially utilize the indemnity clause within the sale deed. This clause could allow him to claim a refund of the money he paid, as it offers protection against certain legal or financial risks arising from the transaction. However, it is essential for Snivas Reddy to review the terms and conditions of the indemnity clause and seek legal advice to ensure the validity and effectiveness of his claim.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The State of Maharashtra And Anotherheld  that the matter or dispute regarding land, house, etc. comes under the jurisdiction of the civil court, and any such inappropriate attempt to convert a civil matter into a criminal dispute should be discouraged.2)Section 102 of CrPC is not entitled to authorize or allow the police authority to dispose of a man from his immovable property for the sake of investigation.Ajay SethiAdvocate, Mumbai98562 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi"

    "question": "First document wrong registration",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In 2019, Snivas Reddy acquired a property through a registered sale deed from the seller. This means that he holds a stronger claim to the property since the transaction was legally documented and recorded. However, it's important to note that the act of mutation, which is the process of updating land records to reflect the change in ownership, does not, by itself, grant ownership rights. Mutation is primarily for the purpose of property tax payment and maintaining accurate records.Now, in the present situation, if Snivas Reddy finds himself in a situation where he has paid money for the purchase of agricultural land in 2021, he can potentially utilize the indemnity clause within the sale deed. This clause could allow him to claim a refund of the money he paid, as it offers protection against certain legal or financial risks arising from the transaction. However, it is essential for Snivas Reddy to review the terms and conditions of the indemnity clause and seek legal advice to ensure the validity and effectiveness of his claim.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Basically, no interest in the property is transferred to the tenant.  “Te legal possession, thereof, continues to be with the owner of the property but the licensee is permitted to make use of the premises for a particular purpose.  It does not create in his favour any estate or interest in the property.A lease grants a tenant with exclusive possession while a leave and licence agreement only grants permission to occupy the property.  Licences are revocable; leases are not.  Leases are transferable while licences are not. A lease creates inheritable rights unlike licences.Once there is a lease agreement there exist no use of executing a leave and licence agreement.

    "question": "Gratuity Act - Section 4(1)(c)",
    "answer": "The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 provides that an employee who has served for at least 5 years is eligible to receive gratuity, even if they resign. This is because the term \"termination of employment\" in Section 4(1)(b) of the Act includes resignation.The Supreme Court recently upheld this interpretation of the Act in a case involving the Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation (RSRTC). The widow of a deceased RSRTC employee had filed a claim for gratuity, arguing that her husband had been eligible for it because he had served for more than 5 years before resigning. The RSRTC argued that gratuity was not payable in cases of resignation.The Supreme Court rejected the RSRTC's argument, holding that the term \"termination of employment\" in the Act is broad enough to include resignation. The Court also noted that the purpose of the Act is to provide financial assistance to employees who have served for a long period of time, regardless of the reason for their termination of employment.This decision is a significant victory for employees who resign after serving for at least 5 years. It ensures that they will be able to receive gratuity, which can provide them with much-needed financial support during their retirement or other life eventsAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Gratuity Act - Section 4(1)(c)",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You've done a good job summarizing the legal references. Based on the information you've provided:The Gratuity Act, 1972, does indeed state that gratuity is payable to an employee upon the termination of employment due to death or disablement due to accident or disease, and the requirement for continuous service of five years is waived in such cases.The Supreme Court judgment you referenced (Ref-1) suggests that terminating an employee solely because they have acquired a disability and are not fit for service in a particular department is not valid. This aligns with principles of non-discrimination and protection of disabled individuals.The reference to Section 20 of the Persons with Disabilities (PWD) Act, 2016 (Ref-2) reinforces the idea of non-discrimination in employment for disabled individuals. The PWD Act emphasizes that employees with disabilities should not be terminated solely on the basis of disability. It also highlights the need to provide reasonable accommodations, adjust the employee to a suitable post with the same pay scale and benefits, and even consider supernumerary positions if necessary.Based on these references, your understanding is generally accurate:Termination solely due to an employee's disability, especially if they are not fit for a specific post or department, could be seen as discriminatory and invalid under the PWD Act and related legal principles.If an employee acquires a disability and becomes unfit for their current role, employers are expected to provide reasonable accommodations or find an alternative suitable role within the organization.However, it's important to remember that the specific circumstances of each case can impact how these legal principles are applied.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In light of this, it is essential to promptly inform the registrar about the vacancy and the reluctance of elected members to assume office.

In other cases Rule 74 of New Election Rules applies. Newly set up State Cooperative Election Authority only can handle the co option.Co-opt members cannot become office bearers in any case. Membership can be obtained through a process of elections in most societies. Nobody can be a member without the consent of other members. He may stand in an election and get elected unopposed..Generally the Deputy/Assistant Registrar of co-operative societies (“the Registrar”) appoints an administrator upon complaint(s) from member(s) of the society, if he finds that it is a fit case to expell the managing committee of the societyWhen the committee is removed, the Registrar has two options : i. to appoint 3 or more society members, who should not be the members of the committee being removed, or ii. to appoint administrator(s) in place of the expelled committee. However, in practice the first option is hardly exercised. On the contrary the same person is appointed as an administrator of more than one society.The Administrator enjoysall the powers of the Managing Committee.

    "answer": "Dear Client,If the employment offer letter does not mention obtaining a No Objection Certificate (NOC) for international travel during vacations or for personal reasons, it implies that private sector employees may not be obligated to seek an NOC from their employer before traveling abroad.If your employer has issued a show cause notice, you can respond by contesting its validity, as it appears to be in violation of both the company's established rules and regulations, as well as the conditions stated in the employment offer letter. Furthermore, you can assert that you decline to provide any explanation, as this matter is strictly personal and beyond the employer's purview.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "- As per law, an NOC is mandatory for a government Employee for travel abroad, however this not applied in case of private school .- Further, a teacher in a private non-aided school is neither a public servant or a Govt. Servant and he is purely a private employee, and no rules and procedures like a govt. school is applied in such school.- However, if the offer letter signed by you having such restrictions , then it will applied in your case , and if not mentioned then the school cannot dictate you for the NOC , and hence you should reply to the said notice that no such restriction was mentioned in the offer letter and hence it is not mandatory to take NOC before travelling abroad.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Regarding part OC vs complete OC and flat possession",
    "answer": "If your builder has issued a possession letter without obtaining an Occupancy Certificate, it could be considered as an irregularity and there may be legal issues related to the occupancy of the flat.A possession certificate states the property completion date. It doesn't make you the rightful of the property. On the other hand, an occupancy certificate is issued by the local authorities stating the completion of the project and that the building is fit to be occupied.An Occupancy Certificate (OC) is necessaryto apply for civic facilities like water, electricity, and sanitation, among others. The local municipal body needs this document, in the absence of which home buyers can complain to the consumer forum or the State Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) body.Once the entire project is completed, the issuing authority grants a single OC for the project as a whole. Thus, as is clear,partial OC allows the complete portion of the project to be opened for occupancy. Naturally, partial OCs are valid till the entire project is completed and the final OC is issued.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88759 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Regarding part OC vs complete OC and flat possession",
    "answer": "1.Occupancy Certificate evidences the completion of the building as per the approved plan and compliance of local laws.- If the builder is unable to obtain the occupancy certificate, it means that the builder has violated building law or deviated from Construction Plan, and further it is illegal to occupy in a building or apartment that doesn’t have an occupancy certificate.- Further, It is illegal to occupy in a building or apartment that doesn’t have an occupancy certificate , and a building without OCs is  not given a water connection and are charged a higher property tax.- Hence, in the absence of an OC, you should not accept the possession letter from the builder and not make further payment2. If the builder has violated building law or deviated from Construction Plan , then the chance of getting OC may be less.3. No4.

However, if the OC reveals that there are issues affecting your flat, it is advisable not to take possession until those problems are resolved.The validity of the OC depends on whether the project adheres to legal regulations. In the case of water-related matters, having the OC should be sufficient.However, there is a possibility that the OC might not be approved if there are non-compliances or issues with the project.

    "question": "Regarding part OC vs complete OC and flat possession",
    "answer": "If your builder has issued a possession letter without obtaining an Occupancy Certificate, it could be considered as an irregularity and there may be legal issues related to the occupancy of the flat.A possession certificate states the property completion date. It doesn't make you the rightful of the property. On the other hand, an occupancy certificate is issued by the local authorities stating the completion of the project and that the building is fit to be occupied.An Occupancy Certificate (OC) is necessaryto apply for civic facilities like water, electricity, and sanitation, among others. The local municipal body needs this document, in the absence of which home buyers can complain to the consumer forum or the State Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) body.Once the entire project is completed, the issuing authority grants a single OC for the project as a whole. Thus, as is clear,partial OC allows the complete portion of the project to be opened for occupancy. Naturally, partial OCs are valid till the entire project is completed and the final OC is issued.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88759 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Regarding part OC vs complete OC and flat possession",
    "answer": "1.Occupancy Certificate evidences the completion of the building as per the approved plan and compliance of local laws.- If the builder is unable to obtain the occupancy certificate, it means that the builder has violated building law or deviated from Construction Plan, and further it is illegal to occupy in a building or apartment that doesn’t have an occupancy certificate.- Further, It is illegal to occupy in a building or apartment that doesn’t have an occupancy certificate , and a building without OCs is  not given a water connection and are charged a higher property tax.- Hence, in the absence of an OC, you should not accept the possession letter from the builder and not make further payment2. If the builder has violated building law or deviated from Construction Plan , then the chance of getting OC may be less.3. No4.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Possession of the completion certificate (OC) is generally legal, and you are allowed to take possession of your flat if you have the OC. However, if the OC reveals that there are issues affecting your flat, it is advisable not to take possession until those problems are resolved.The validity of the OC depends on whether the project adheres to legal regulations. In the case of water-related matters, having the OC should be sufficient.However, there is a possibility that the OC might not be approved if there are non-compliances or issues with the project. In such cases, it is crucial to address the concerns before taking possession of the flat.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, if the son has willingly given up his rights in favor of his mother, then he cannot claim an equal share in the property or the sale proceeds.

    "question": "Gratuity Act - Section 4(1)(c)",
    "answer": "The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 provides that an employee who has served for at least 5 years is eligible to receive gratuity, even if they resign. This is because the term \"termination of employment\" in Section 4(1)(b) of the Act includes resignation.The Supreme Court recently upheld this interpretation of the Act in a case involving the Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation (RSRTC). The widow of a deceased RSRTC employee had filed a claim for gratuity, arguing that her husband had been eligible for it because he had served for more than 5 years before resigning. The RSRTC argued that gratuity was not payable in cases of resignation.The Supreme Court rejected the RSRTC's argument, holding that the term \"termination of employment\" in the Act is broad enough to include resignation. The Court also noted that the purpose of the Act is to provide financial assistance to employees who have served for a long period of time, regardless of the reason for their termination of employment.This decision is a significant victory for employees who resign after serving for at least 5 years. It ensures that they will be able to receive gratuity, which can provide them with much-needed financial support during their retirement or other life eventsAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Gratuity Act - Section 4(1)(c)",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You've done a good job summarizing the legal references. Based on the information you've provided:The Gratuity Act, 1972, does indeed state that gratuity is payable to an employee upon the termination of employment due to death or disablement due to accident or disease, and the requirement for continuous service of five years is waived in such cases.The Supreme Court judgment you referenced (Ref-1) suggests that terminating an employee solely because they have acquired a disability and are not fit for service in a particular department is not valid. This aligns with principles of non-discrimination and protection of disabled individuals.The reference to Section 20 of the Persons with Disabilities (PWD) Act, 2016 (Ref-2) reinforces the idea of non-discrimination in employment for disabled individuals. The PWD Act emphasizes that employees with disabilities should not be terminated solely on the basis of disability. It also highlights the need to provide reasonable accommodations, adjust the employee to a suitable post with the same pay scale and benefits, and even consider supernumerary positions if necessary.Based on these references, your understanding is generally accurate:Termination solely due to an employee's disability, especially if they are not fit for a specific post or department, could be seen as discriminatory and invalid under the PWD Act and related legal principles.If an employee acquires a disability and becomes unfit for their current role, employers are expected to provide reasonable accommodations or find an alternative suitable role within the organization.However, it's important to remember that the specific circumstances of each case can impact how these legal principles are applied.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, if the son has executed a registered Release/ Relinquishment Deed in the jurisdictional Sub Registrar's Office relinquishing his share in the property in favour of his mother,  then son's consent is not required for the wife to sell the property and the proceeds can be kept singularly by wife herself without sharing with her son.4.  Son has equal right on the deceased father's property alongwith his mother.  However if he has executed a registered Release/Relinquishment Deed in favour of his mother, he loses his right over the property.Shashidhar S.

As per the established guidelines, only members who have been elected through the proper democratic process are qualified to assume such roles. Unfortunately, the current secretary has tendered their resignation, and none of the elected members are willing to step up and take on the responsibilities of office bearers. In light of this, it is essential to promptly inform the registrar about the vacancy and the reluctance of elected members to assume office. Consequently, the appointment of an administrator for the society becomes necessary until a fresh round of elections can be conducted to fill the vacant positions and restore the functioning of the society to its full capacity.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "With effect from 14 2 2013 co option rule is laid down in a following Proviso to Article 243Zj (2) of theConstitution of India.“Provided that the board may fill a casual vacancy on the board by nomination out of the same class of members in respect of which the casual vacancy has arisen, if the term of office of the board is less than half of its original term.”Only Two Committee members can fill co-opt members to fill up vacant seats provided the Committee goes by above Provision. In other cases Rule 74 of New Election Rules applies. Newly set up State Cooperative Election Authority only can handle the co option.Co-opt members cannot become office bearers in any case. Membership can be obtained through a process of elections in most societies. Nobody can be a member without the consent of other members. He may stand in an election and get elected unopposed..Generally the Deputy/Assistant Registrar of co-operative societies (“the Registrar”) appoints an administrator upon complaint(s) from member(s) of the society, if he finds that it is a fit case to expell the managing committee of the societyWhen the committee is removed, the Registrar has two options : i. to appoint 3 or more society members, who should not be the members of the committee being removed, or ii. to appoint administrator(s) in place of the expelled committee. However, in practice the first option is hardly exercised. On the contrary the same person is appointed as an administrator of more than one society.The Administrator enjoysall the powers of the Managing Committee. He is also entitled to call a Special General Body Meeting to reconsider the decisions of the earlier Committee. The remuneration of the Administrator is fixed by the Dy.

    "question": "Leave and license agreement instead of lease agreement",
    "answer": "Dear sir,A lease creates an interest in the property unlike a leave and license agreement.     Leave and license agreement.    gives only a right to use the property in a particular way or under certain terms, while it remains in the posession and control of the owner thereof, it will be a license. Basically, no interest in the property is transferred to the tenant.  “Te legal possession, thereof, continues to be with the owner of the property but the licensee is permitted to make use of the premises for a particular purpose.  It does not create in his favour any estate or interest in the property.A lease grants a tenant with exclusive possession while a leave and licence agreement only grants permission to occupy the property.  Licences are revocable; leases are not.  Leases are transferable while licences are not. A lease creates inheritable rights unlike licences.Once there is a lease agreement there exist no use of executing a leave and licence agreement. Go for leave and licence agreement and cancel the lease agreement.  Thank youAjeesh Kalathil GopiAdvocate, New Delhi11 AnswersTalk to Advocate Ajeesh Kalathil Gopi"

As per the established guidelines, only members who have been elected through the proper democratic process are qualified to assume such roles. Unfortunately, the current secretary has tendered their resignation, and none of the elected members are willing to step up and take on the responsibilities of office bearers. In light of this, it is essential to promptly inform the registrar about the vacancy and the reluctance of elected members to assume office.

Membership can be obtained through a process of elections in most societies. Nobody can be a member without the consent of other members. He may stand in an election and get elected unopposed..Generally the Deputy/Assistant Registrar of co-operative societies (“the Registrar”) appoints an administrator upon complaint(s) from member(s) of the society, if he finds that it is a fit case to expell the managing committee of the societyWhen the committee is removed, the Registrar has two options : i. to appoint 3 or more society members, who should not be the members of the committee being removed, or ii. to appoint administrator(s) in place of the expelled committee. However, in practice the first option is hardly exercised. On the contrary the same person is appointed as an administrator of more than one society.The Administrator enjoysall the powers of the Managing Committee.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In accordance with the society's regulations, it is explicitly stated that co-opted members are ineligible to hold office bearer positions within the organization. As per the established guidelines, only members who have been elected through the proper democratic process are qualified to assume such roles. Unfortunately, the current secretary has tendered their resignation, and none of the elected members are willing to step up and take on the responsibilities of office bearers. In light of this, it is essential to promptly inform the registrar about the vacancy and the reluctance of elected members to assume office. Consequently, the appointment of an administrator for the society becomes necessary until a fresh round of elections can be conducted to fill the vacant positions and restore the functioning of the society to its full capacity.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Mumbai managing committee dissolution",
    "answer": "With effect from 14 2 2013 co option rule is laid down in a following Proviso to Article 243Zj (2) of theConstitution of India.“Provided that the board may fill a casual vacancy on the board by nomination out of the same class of members in respect of which the casual vacancy has arisen, if the term of office of the board is less than half of its original term.”Only Two Committee members can fill co-opt members to fill up vacant seats provided the Committee goes by above Provision. In other cases Rule 74 of New Election Rules applies. Newly set up State Cooperative Election Authority only can handle the co option.Co-opt members cannot become office bearers in any case. Membership can be obtained through a process of elections in most societies. Nobody can be a member without the consent of other members. He may stand in an election and get elected unopposed..Generally the Deputy/Assistant Registrar of co-operative societies (“the Registrar”) appoints an administrator upon complaint(s) from member(s) of the society, if he finds that it is a fit case to expell the managing committee of the societyWhen the committee is removed, the Registrar has two options : i. to appoint 3 or more society members, who should not be the members of the committee being removed, or ii. to appoint administrator(s) in place of the expelled committee. However, in practice the first option is hardly exercised. On the contrary the same person is appointed as an administrator of more than one society.The Administrator enjoysall the powers of the Managing Committee. He is also entitled to call a Special General Body Meeting to reconsider the decisions of the earlier Committee. The remuneration of the Administrator is fixed by the Dy.
