    "question": "VAO is not prepared to issue patta for partial heirs",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Regarding the property pattas you should now write a legal notice to the local VAO and the two identified heirs to inform them of your position as co-owner as per your grandfather’s will and to demand them to include the name of the remaining heirs in the pattas. If your request is turned down, you should file an application in respect of the pending partition suit for an order to be made to the VAO to cause the pattas to be brought up to date. It is important to document any communication made to and from the VAO and the named heirs since this may be of value in the court. For any notifications and dealing with a lawyer in a court, it will be wise to seek the services of an attorney who has transitioned in property law. Some of the legislative statutes on the topic include The Indian Succession Act of 1925, theHindu Succession Actof 1956 and the Partition Act of 1893.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "context": "Asked 8 months ago in Family Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Divorce filing on the ground of cruelty against husband by wife",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I want to let you know that,you are entitled to seek divorce on grounds of cruelty, even though you reside with your wife. Till now, you have been suffering from physical as well as mental cruelties. Section 13(1)(ia) defines cruelty to include both physical as well as mental. All the audio recordings of her shouting, threatening, and trying to hit your son can be used in evidence to prove your case.There is no such law that requires you to leave the house before filing for divorce. Living together will not make you ineligible to seek divorce, especially when your concern remains the welfare of your child. It may be that desertion for 6 months forms part of proving desertion advice by your lawyer; in this case, it is a case of cruelty instead of desertion.Regarding the question you have further sought clarification on, your wife has absolutely no rights on your parents' property or properties. As per Hindu law, she is not entitled to claim any rights over your parents' ancestral or personal properties considering the fact that they have been staying apart for 9 long years and did not care to get in touch with her. If she files any claims of this nature, your parents will likely be impleaded in that case but they will not automatically be liable. It would be a declaration of their non-involvement with court action.There is very crucial presentation of all the evidence for the case, and a sound family lawyer would be capable enough to help create a strong case.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Neighbor wants NOC to get plan sanction in Gurugram",
    "answer": "Dear Client,To relieve your apprehensions with the construction plans of your neighbours in Gurugram you should ask him to furnish a written commitment that he will not encroach the basement nearer that 2 feet from your property in order to preserve the stability of the structure of your property. Also, you can get a guarantee for the future construction consent and also provide a clause where any future owners pledge to this agreement. This may improve the concept of the enforcement of the undertaking. In the Haryana Building Code, developers are often expected to obtain No Objection Certificates from their neighbours, hence such agreements should be reduced into writing. As much as courtesy goes in any neighbourly relation, getting these commitments may save your net as you prepare for future constructions. The best thing that could be done when preparing such documents is to seek the service of a legal attorney.Hope you find this answer helpful in resolving your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In your situation, given the lack of documentary proof and the significant time lapse, the legal options may be limited. Instead, under the principles of bailment where all your mother's jewellery had been left with her mother for safe custody, you could have attempted to start a civil suit to recover either the jewelry itself or its equivalent value. Since you do not have any documentary evidence and proof, you would have to depend upon oral testimony and circumstances with all the witnesses as well as patterns of conduct which would support your case.You may file a civil suit on the recovery of the jewellery. In this case, your mother's brothers will be obliged to respond. It would, however, depend on the presentation of oral evidence and circumstances, with no documentary evidence and the passage of time. It may also be wise to consult with an attorney on the strength of your case prior to approaching the courts legally, as the burden of proof, in this case, lies on your side.Otherwise, you might consider mediation with your uncles as the law process may be too tedious and a trial without concrete evidence will not be sure, either.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Parking slots in a redeveloped building",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case, where the redevelopment has left you with fewer slots for parking, the choice of who gets those slots should really be governed by the terms of the redevelopment agreement or as under the rules put in place by the housing society, as per the Maharashtra Ownership Flats Act, 1963 and the Maharashtra Apartment Ownership Act, 1970. Here, the developer has allotted parking slots to new members; however, the remaining slots have to be shared fairly among the original owners.Since you do not own a car currently but wish to have a parking slot for future sale purposes, you can seek out the society and request it to allot you a parking slot. The society has all the rights when first established to allot the parking slots fairly and in a clear manner, normally either through a lottery system or even an equal distribution. You can ask for the society to use some criteria, such as considering your ownership of a 3-bedroom flat and applying it in order to allocate a parking slot appropriately, or whatever other equitable method may apply.If such a fair solution is not provided then, you can raise a dispute with the Cooperative Court or under relevant provisions of MOFA so that proper demand allocation will be made. However, any allocations have to be in accordance with the society's decision, and the allocations have to be according to the rules and regulations fixed by the managing committee of the society.Thank you.

    "question": "Property division by partition",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I would like to inform you that,where your great-grandfather partitioned the property which was self-acquired, and which he divided among his sons, you will qualify to be a co-owner with your father if your grandfather received the particular property in that partition. But the rights of ownership depend upon whether the property is self-acquired or ancestral.If the property was held as ancestral at partition, then your father and his first elder brother would have a birthright on the property. As your father was a minor at the time of the partition, he was entitled to get share once he attained majority. Your grandfather cannot sell the whole property without taking consent from your father because your father holds an undivided interest in the ancestral property.On your father's share, since the elder brother left no issue behind, your father's share would enhanced. The share of the deceased brother would vest on your father and grand father equitably. Your uncle, since he is a post partition child, would likewise enjoy a right of a share in the ancestral property by virtue of birth under theHindu Succession Act, 1956.If the property is self-acquired by your grandfather, that is, it was given to him at partition and is only his, then he can sell it without your father's consent.Regarding the question of your grandfather's mental capacity at the time of sale, generally, if he is said not to have been in sound mind, that will probably be a burden for the party that appealed the sale-your father. However, if the buyer knew about the said mental incapacity of your grandfather, they will then be challenged to establish, in turn, that the sale was made in good faith and that his grandfather was capable at the time.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Wife files a false 498a case as FIR, false DVC, MC for sake of maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case it is possible that you may have to pay maintenance during theDomestic Violence(DV) proceedings though your wife may be levelling baseless allegations. Your wife will be able to claim from your income of ₹ 90,000 or any reasonable amount minus the medical bills. While the DV case might be false, and may change maintenance obligations if proven so, it does not necessarily remove you from paying unless a court allows it to do so. As for making home dues, since your wife is capable of earning but decide not to work then this too can be taken to court to try and reduce her maintenance claim. Furthermore, an act can be an act of cruelty in terms of Section 13(1)(ia) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 where false allegations have been made. Once you prove that the allegations made by her are false you can file a defamation case undersection 354of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (previously, Section 499 IPC) or can lodge a complaint under section 246 of BNS (Previously, Section 211 of IPC) for filing a false case.

    "question": "Wife files a false 498a case as FIR, false DVC, MC for sake of maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queries1. In the case ofDomestic Violence, if your wife produces before the court photographs of bruises, then that may be taken into consideration, but she has to prove that such injuries have been given to her by you. Mere photographs cannot prove anything against a person, therefore, there is scope for argument against such evidence.2. In cases of maintenance, prima facie evidence may be permitted by the court even without any proper investigation, and an order for interim maintenance can be passed by the judge. You will have to pay maintenance even if you prove her allegations of default to be false, but the amount may be reduced or even disallowed by the court as per its estimation of her needs and your ability to pay.3. If you can show your wife is capable of earning -- by showing past work as a beautician or education -- the court may remit or refuse to award maintenance. The courts, in general, are reluctant to award maintenance if wife has deliberately avoided employment with the sole intention of claiming maintenance.4. Maintenance amount is usually computed on your income and not your parent's. If your monthly salary is ₹90,000 and you have heavy financial commitments like loan repayments or medical and legal charges, the court is likely to consider all these points while deciding an amount for you. The figure can range between 20-30% of your net income with deductions.5. If allegations prove untrue, one could prohibit future maintenance but could not recover past payments.6.a) A police can even file an FIR without investigation in false cases. b) Maintenance can also be granted in false cases. c) Husband protection laws are lesser but exist.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queries,1. Your child and second wife's case: Visiting your child will not add to complication in the 498A case filed against you by your second wife. This is because child visitation rights are separate, cannot be tagged with that kind of case.2. Right to visit your child: You have the right to visit your child at home or at school, other than that allowed by the conditions of a court order. Hostile behavior by the family of your first wife can be legally controlled through the enforcement of your visitation rights.3. Rights to visit your child: Regardless of whether you ever remarry, nothing impacts on the rights to visit your child from the previous marriage.4. False enrollment in land registration: In case there have been forged engravings in your wife's and father-in-law's land registration you may file a complaint against them. However, the legal significance to your case depends on how you word it legally.5. Income proof: Gather evidence that she earns her money by sending business advertisements and photographs or even client feedback. You can present these in court to prove that she is indeed capable of earning.6. Effect of acting in court: lllCourts do not rely on acting.

    "question": "No will - how to partition property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queriesUnder theHindu Succession Act, when a Hindu male dies intestate, then his property is divided equally among his Class I legal heirs which in your case are you, your mother and sister. You are, therefore, entitled to a one-third share in both the houses, regardless of whether your mother or sister are staying in one of them. In case you let go of the property to your mother, you will surrender your claim; therefore, it would not be easy raising your stake after some time. Technically, the law would have given her full ownership of the property.The property would otherwise be divided equally among the three of you. After having received her one third, your mother is free to gift or transfer her share to your sister, but this does not affect your right to your one third.Correspondingly, regarding your father's Provident Fund (PF), you are at par with a share in that amount as a Class I heir. If the PF has already been claimed by your mother and sister, you can demand to know the details of the amounts and take legal recourse to stake your claims if necessary.If they are trying to sell their holdings and are asking you to transfer your share to your mother, you should not do that without ensuring first that you are adequately compensated for your share or otherwise protected. A consultation with a lawyer would make sure your interests were looked after in all eventualities of transfer or sale agreements.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Parking slots in a redeveloped building",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case, where the redevelopment has left you with fewer slots for parking, the choice of who gets those slots should really be governed by the terms of the redevelopment agreement or as under the rules put in place by the housing society, as per the Maharashtra Ownership Flats Act, 1963 and the Maharashtra Apartment Ownership Act, 1970. Here, the developer has allotted parking slots to new members; however, the remaining slots have to be shared fairly among the original owners.Since you do not own a car currently but wish to have a parking slot for future sale purposes, you can seek out the society and request it to allot you a parking slot. The society has all the rights when first established to allot the parking slots fairly and in a clear manner, normally either through a lottery system or even an equal distribution. You can ask for the society to use some criteria, such as considering your ownership of a 3-bedroom flat and applying it in order to allocate a parking slot appropriately, or whatever other equitable method may apply.If such a fair solution is not provided then, you can raise a dispute with the Cooperative Court or under relevant provisions of MOFA so that proper demand allocation will be made. However, any allocations have to be in accordance with the society's decision, and the allocations have to be according to the rules and regulations fixed by the managing committee of the society.Thank you.

    "question": "Property division by partition",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I would like to inform you that,where your great-grandfather partitioned the property which was self-acquired, and which he divided among his sons, you will qualify to be a co-owner with your father if your grandfather received the particular property in that partition. But the rights of ownership depend upon whether the property is self-acquired or ancestral.If the property was held as ancestral at partition, then your father and his first elder brother would have a birthright on the property. As your father was a minor at the time of the partition, he was entitled to get share once he attained majority. Your grandfather cannot sell the whole property without taking consent from your father because your father holds an undivided interest in the ancestral property.On your father's share, since the elder brother left no issue behind, your father's share would enhanced. The share of the deceased brother would vest on your father and grand father equitably. Your uncle, since he is a post partition child, would likewise enjoy a right of a share in the ancestral property by virtue of birth under theHindu Succession Act, 1956.If the property is self-acquired by your grandfather, that is, it was given to him at partition and is only his, then he can sell it without your father's consent.Regarding the question of your grandfather's mental capacity at the time of sale, generally, if he is said not to have been in sound mind, that will probably be a burden for the party that appealed the sale-your father. However, if the buyer knew about the said mental incapacity of your grandfather, they will then be challenged to establish, in turn, that the sale was made in good faith and that his grandfather was capable at the time.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Parking slots in a redeveloped building",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case, where the redevelopment has left you with fewer slots for parking, the choice of who gets those slots should really be governed by the terms of the redevelopment agreement or as under the rules put in place by the housing society, as per the Maharashtra Ownership Flats Act, 1963 and the Maharashtra Apartment Ownership Act, 1970. Here, the developer has allotted parking slots to new members; however, the remaining slots have to be shared fairly among the original owners.Since you do not own a car currently but wish to have a parking slot for future sale purposes, you can seek out the society and request it to allot you a parking slot. The society has all the rights when first established to allot the parking slots fairly and in a clear manner, normally either through a lottery system or even an equal distribution. You can ask for the society to use some criteria, such as considering your ownership of a 3-bedroom flat and applying it in order to allocate a parking slot appropriately, or whatever other equitable method may apply.If such a fair solution is not provided then, you can raise a dispute with the Cooperative Court or under relevant provisions of MOFA so that proper demand allocation will be made. However, any allocations have to be in accordance with the society's decision, and the allocations have to be according to the rules and regulations fixed by the managing committee of the society.Thank you.

Instead, under the principles of bailment where all your mother's jewellery had been left with her mother for safe custody, you could have attempted to start a civil suit to recover either the jewelry itself or its equivalent value. Since you do not have any documentary evidence and proof, you would have to depend upon oral testimony and circumstances with all the witnesses as well as patterns of conduct which would support your case.You may file a civil suit on the recovery of the jewellery. In this case, your mother's brothers will be obliged to respond. It would, however, depend on the presentation of oral evidence and circumstances, with no documentary evidence and the passage of time. It may also be wise to consult with an attorney on the strength of your case prior to approaching the courts legally, as the burden of proof, in this case, lies on your side.Otherwise, you might consider mediation with your uncles as the law process may be too tedious and a trial without concrete evidence will not be sure, either.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Parking slots in a redeveloped building",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case, where the redevelopment has left you with fewer slots for parking, the choice of who gets those slots should really be governed by the terms of the redevelopment agreement or as under the rules put in place by the housing society, as per the Maharashtra Ownership Flats Act, 1963 and the Maharashtra Apartment Ownership Act, 1970. Here, the developer has allotted parking slots to new members; however, the remaining slots have to be shared fairly among the original owners.Since you do not own a car currently but wish to have a parking slot for future sale purposes, you can seek out the society and request it to allot you a parking slot. The society has all the rights when first established to allot the parking slots fairly and in a clear manner, normally either through a lottery system or even an equal distribution. You can ask for the society to use some criteria, such as considering your ownership of a 3-bedroom flat and applying it in order to allocate a parking slot appropriately, or whatever other equitable method may apply.If such a fair solution is not provided then, you can raise a dispute with the Cooperative Court or under relevant provisions of MOFA so that proper demand allocation will be made. However, any allocations have to be in accordance with the society's decision, and the allocations have to be according to the rules and regulations fixed by the managing committee of the society.Thank you. Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Property division by partition",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I would like to inform you that,where your great-grandfather partitioned the property which was self-acquired, and which he divided among his sons, you will qualify to be a co-owner with your father if your grandfather received the particular property in that partition. But the rights of ownership depend upon whether the property is self-acquired or ancestral.If the property was held as ancestral at partition, then your father and his first elder brother would have a birthright on the property. As your father was a minor at the time of the partition, he was entitled to get share once he attained majority. Your grandfather cannot sell the whole property without taking consent from your father because your father holds an undivided interest in the ancestral property.On your father's share, since the elder brother left no issue behind, your father's share would enhanced. The share of the deceased brother would vest on your father and grand father equitably. Your uncle, since he is a post partition child, would likewise enjoy a right of a share in the ancestral property by virtue of birth under theHindu Succession Act, 1956.If the property is self-acquired by your grandfather, that is, it was given to him at partition and is only his, then he can sell it without your father's consent.Regarding the question of your grandfather's mental capacity at the time of sale, generally, if he is said not to have been in sound mind, that will probably be a burden for the party that appealed the sale-your father. However, if the buyer knew about the said mental incapacity of your grandfather, they will then be challenged to establish, in turn, that the sale was made in good faith and that his grandfather was capable at the time.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Instead, under the principles of bailment where all your mother's jewellery had been left with her mother for safe custody, you could have attempted to start a civil suit to recover either the jewelry itself or its equivalent value. Since you do not have any documentary evidence and proof, you would have to depend upon oral testimony and circumstances with all the witnesses as well as patterns of conduct which would support your case.You may file a civil suit on the recovery of the jewellery. In this case, your mother's brothers will be obliged to respond. It would, however, depend on the presentation of oral evidence and circumstances, with no documentary evidence and the passage of time. It may also be wise to consult with an attorney on the strength of your case prior to approaching the courts legally, as the burden of proof, in this case, lies on your side.Otherwise, you might consider mediation with your uncles as the law process may be too tedious and a trial without concrete evidence will not be sure, either.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "context": "Asked 8 months ago in Property Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "No will - how to partition property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queriesUnder theHindu Succession Act, when a Hindu male dies intestate, then his property is divided equally among his Class I legal heirs which in your case are you, your mother and sister. You are, therefore, entitled to a one-third share in both the houses, regardless of whether your mother or sister are staying in one of them. In case you let go of the property to your mother, you will surrender your claim; therefore, it would not be easy raising your stake after some time. Technically, the law would have given her full ownership of the property.The property would otherwise be divided equally among the three of you. After having received her one third, your mother is free to gift or transfer her share to your sister, but this does not affect your right to your one third.Correspondingly, regarding your father's Provident Fund (PF), you are at par with a share in that amount as a Class I heir. If the PF has already been claimed by your mother and sister, you can demand to know the details of the amounts and take legal recourse to stake your claims if necessary.If they are trying to sell their holdings and are asking you to transfer your share to your mother, you should not do that without ensuring first that you are adequately compensated for your share or otherwise protected. A consultation with a lawyer would make sure your interests were looked after in all eventualities of transfer or sale agreements.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If possible it is wise to seek the help of an attorney, when translating documents, or when filing and other legal procedures needed when traveling internationally with an adopted child.Hope you find this answer suitable for resolving you query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "No will - how to partition property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queriesUnder theHindu Succession Act, when a Hindu male dies intestate, then his property is divided equally among his Class I legal heirs which in your case are you, your mother and sister. You are, therefore, entitled to a one-third share in both the houses, regardless of whether your mother or sister are staying in one of them. In case you let go of the property to your mother, you will surrender your claim; therefore, it would not be easy raising your stake after some time. Technically, the law would have given her full ownership of the property.The property would otherwise be divided equally among the three of you. After having received her one third, your mother is free to gift or transfer her share to your sister, but this does not affect your right to your one third.Correspondingly, regarding your father's Provident Fund (PF), you are at par with a share in that amount as a Class I heir. If the PF has already been claimed by your mother and sister, you can demand to know the details of the amounts and take legal recourse to stake your claims if necessary.If they are trying to sell their holdings and are asking you to transfer your share to your mother, you should not do that without ensuring first that you are adequately compensated for your share or otherwise protected. A consultation with a lawyer would make sure your interests were looked after in all eventualities of transfer or sale agreements.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "context": "Asked 8 months ago in Property Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "No will - how to partition property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queriesUnder theHindu Succession Act, when a Hindu male dies intestate, then his property is divided equally among his Class I legal heirs which in your case are you, your mother and sister. You are, therefore, entitled to a one-third share in both the houses, regardless of whether your mother or sister are staying in one of them. In case you let go of the property to your mother, you will surrender your claim; therefore, it would not be easy raising your stake after some time. Technically, the law would have given her full ownership of the property.The property would otherwise be divided equally among the three of you. After having received her one third, your mother is free to gift or transfer her share to your sister, but this does not affect your right to your one third.Correspondingly, regarding your father's Provident Fund (PF), you are at par with a share in that amount as a Class I heir. If the PF has already been claimed by your mother and sister, you can demand to know the details of the amounts and take legal recourse to stake your claims if necessary.If they are trying to sell their holdings and are asking you to transfer your share to your mother, you should not do that without ensuring first that you are adequately compensated for your share or otherwise protected. A consultation with a lawyer would make sure your interests were looked after in all eventualities of transfer or sale agreements.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Before legally opening the flat in Dombivli to your tenant, make sure you have given the legal eviction notice along with the time and reason to leave. This means that after the stipulated period and serving the tenant with the notice as per your agreement, if they continue to hold on the premise then you can institute an eviction suit in the legal forum in the civil court and attach the Leave and License agreement and the notice to the case files. If the parties disagree, the litigants have to attend other court sessions to defend their case, and if the court orders the eviction, the litigant will produce an eviction order. The local authorities can come in and help make the tenant leave, if they are also not willing to move out as well.

Also, you can get a guarantee for the future construction consent and also provide a clause where any future owners pledge to this agreement. This may improve the concept of the enforcement of the undertaking. In the Haryana Building Code, developers are often expected to obtain No Objection Certificates from their neighbours, hence such agreements should be reduced into writing. As much as courtesy goes in any neighbourly relation, getting these commitments may save your net as you prepare for future constructions.

She entered by Through Teacher Recruitment Board TRBs in the year 2004, her services were regularized from 2006 and going by the pay structure relevant to her time her designation was probably in Group C. Group C assignments are normally prescribed by certification and generally are not related to manual work, whereas group D is generally for manual job posts. As to confirm the classification as per Annexure II it would be advisable to crosscheck such papers like appointment letters and joining orders from the TRB.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queriesSince your father had died intestate, i.e., without a will, you have a right to inherit the property under theHindu Succession Act, 1956. To record the house in your name legally, you need to obtain a legal heir certificate from any local authority, such as Tehsildar or district office establishing your right to inherit the property.You'll require the following papers for this legal heir certificate1. Father's death certificate2. Mother's death certificate. She was deceased prior to father3. Birth certificate- The birth related proof with your father4. Identity proof such as Aadhar and PAN5. Address proof.Once you obtain the legal heir certificate, you can approach the local revenue authorities or municipal office to get the property mutated in your name by submitting a legal heir certificate along with other documents called for in the process. Through mutation, your property records will be updated.Normally, you do not need a succession certificate to transfer immovable property like a house. A succession certificate is required for movable assets; it is not required for immovable property.Regarding the sale of the property, once it gets mutated in your name you can sell it freely without any kind of problem arising. Incase of a dispute in contention you may have to file a civil suit for declaring yourself as the sole legal heir but no stamp duty needs to be paid like in succession certificate cases; only court fees are applicable according to the case.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

But for now that you have the child’s passport, ensure that you carry along other important papers such as; adoption order, marriage certificate among others which will be required at immigration. If you have never got a response from CARA or HAMA then it is wiser to write an email, message or follow up a call or one should consult a lawyer who specializes in adoption cases. Some of legal provisions for definition of NOC contain in Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 and guidelines as prescribed by Central Adoption Resource Authority popularly known as CARA lay down the formalities that are required for NOC.Hope you find this answer suitable for resolving you query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queriesSince your father had died intestate, i.e., without a will, you have a right to inherit the property under theHindu Succession Act, 1956. To record the house in your name legally, you need to obtain a legal heir certificate from any local authority, such as Tehsildar or district office establishing your right to inherit the property.You'll require the following papers for this legal heir certificate1. Father's death certificate2. Mother's death certificate. She was deceased prior to father3. Birth certificate- The birth related proof with your father4. Identity proof such as Aadhar and PAN5. Address proof.Once you obtain the legal heir certificate, you can approach the local revenue authorities or municipal office to get the property mutated in your name by submitting a legal heir certificate along with other documents called for in the process. Through mutation, your property records will be updated.Normally, you do not need a succession certificate to transfer immovable property like a house. A succession certificate is required for movable assets; it is not required for immovable property.Regarding the sale of the property, once it gets mutated in your name you can sell it freely without any kind of problem arising. Incase of a dispute in contention you may have to file a civil suit for declaring yourself as the sole legal heir but no stamp duty needs to be paid like in succession certificate cases; only court fees are applicable according to the case.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If anyone of, father or mother is direct recruited class 1 servants than their children won't be eligible for NCL. But if he/she is promoted to class 1 then the kids will be eligible2. If both of the parents are class 2 then their kids won't be eligible for OBC quota , and in case of one only , then the child would be off from creamy layer and they can avail benefits of quota3. If father was recruited direct to class 2 positions and then prompted to class 1 before age of 40 than it would be no longer NCL. However this scenario only applies to father not the mother- The government servants who don’t fall under this category are all non-creamy layer.- Government Employees of Class 3 or below class 3 officers are eligible for OBC Quota., and the salary/ income of the government employees are not to be taken into consideration for considering the OBC NCL category certificate.- Since your father is under group B m, and mother is promoted in group B, then you are eligible to get non-creamy OBC Certificate.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

The requirement is that you will need to spend around two weeks in Denmark and provide such documents as, respectively, valid passports and certificate of no impediment to marriage. Once married, the marriage will be legal, enabling the Spousal Immigrant Visa process which is normally fourteen months. If you prefer waiting in Poland or in India, it is possible, but it is necessary to meet the demands of U.S immigration services regarding residency in this country. As much as possible, stay clear of misconceptions surrounding documents in both the marriage and visa process. Proper paperwork is essential in this process. It is advisable to consult with an immigration lawyer to clarify these issues as you proceed with your further plans.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Foreign and Indian Citizen Marriage",
    "answer": "Dear Client,If a couple wants to marry under theSpecial Marriage Actin India then both parties can take the affidavit of non-availability from any notary in the country. The NOC from the US Embassy in Delhi for marriage is usually accepted by the marriage registrars, but it is advisable to clear this by consulting the marriage registrar that you intend to use. Besides the papers you mentioned (passport, visa, birth certificates, proof of address, single status affidavit, notice of intended marriage, photographs, witnesses, NOC, divorce certificate), it is possible you may be required to produce your self-attested proof of date of birth, proof of your residence in the district for at least thirty days and two affidavits proving that you two are not related in a manner prohibited by the law. Marriage registrars can be consulted as well as a legal advisor in order to meet all the legal formalities for the registration.Hope you find this answer suitable for resolving you query.Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queries1. Affidavit of marital status: Yes, this can be obtained from any notary public in India, but these must be authenticated by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), and even authenticated by the county's embassy where the marriage is going to take place.2. NOC issued from the U.S. Embassy in Delhi: The NOC issued from the U.S. Embassy, Delhi, will establish marital status on the part of your fiancé. However, it may not be acceptable everywhere and acceptance may depend on the local rules in the court or the marriage registrar of the region. You are therefore requested to obtain the local rules of the marriage registrar.3. Documents The list of documents accepted includes, to a large extent, the following: Passport, Visa, Birth Certificate, Proof of Address, Single Status Affidavit, Notice of Intended Marriage, Photographs, Witnesses, NOC and Divorce Certificate, if the applicant has been divorced.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "- As far as the Government employees are considered, the entry cadre/post is to be taken into consideration, and salary and agricultural income are not to be considered as income for calculating annual income for creamy layer status.1. If anyone of, father or mother is direct recruited class 1 servants than their children won't be eligible for NCL. But if he/she is promoted to class 1 then the kids will be eligible2. If both of the parents are class 2 then their kids won't be eligible for OBC quota , and in case of one only , then the child would be off from creamy layer and they can avail benefits of quota3. If father was recruited direct to class 2 positions and then prompted to class 1 before age of 40 than it would be no longer NCL. However this scenario only applies to father not the mother- The government servants who don’t fall under this category are all non-creamy layer.- Government Employees of Class 3 or below class 3 officers are eligible for OBC Quota., and the salary/ income of the government employees are not to be taken into consideration for considering the OBC NCL category certificate.- Since your father is under group B m, and mother is promoted in group B, then you are eligible to get non-creamy OBC Certificate.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case, your mother was recruited as a Consolidated BT Assistant in 2004 on a fixed pay, which probably categorizes her under Group C at that time, since consolidated pay is more or less associated with lower categories. However, the moment she was regularized in the year 2006, she was placed under Group B, as that indicated her position after regularization with pay scale benefits and allowances.For OBC-NCL Eligibility: If your both parents are Group B officers and no one of your parents has been promoted to a higher level than Group B, you fall within the category of OBC-NCL according to the eligible criteria of the Government of India.

She entered by Through Teacher Recruitment Board TRBs in the year 2004, her services were regularized from 2006 and going by the pay structure relevant to her time her designation was probably in Group C. Group C assignments are normally prescribed by certification and generally are not related to manual work, whereas group D is generally for manual job posts. As to confirm the classification as per Annexure II it would be advisable to crosscheck such papers like appointment letters and joining orders from the TRB.

    "question": "Advance rental, defaulted to pay the agreed amount",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I would like to inform you that,In your situation, a request to declare the plaintiff as a tenant without a rental agreement or occupation cannot be considered. In order for a lease agreement to be legitimate, it must include mutual agreement, complete rent payment, and possession, all of which are absent in this particular situation. If a rental contract was not signed and the plaintiff did not meet their responsibilities, they have no grounds to assert tenancy.Part performance by the transferee is necessary for Section 53A of theTransfer of Property Act(doctrine of part performance) to be applicable. The plaintiff is not eligible for protection under this section since he did not fulfill his obligations in the contract.A true owner is typically not allowed to be subjected to an injunction. You can challenge the plaintiff's effort to prevent you from managing your own property with an ex-parte order. You can find support from the ruling of the Supreme Court in Karnataka Board of Wakf v. Government of India (2004) 10 SCC 779, which affirmed that a tenant or claimant without legal possession or agreement cannot seek injunction against the rightful owner.An unmarked complaint is also not considered legitimate according to Order VI Rule 14 of the CPC, 1908, which requires pleadings to be signed by the party or their authorized agent. Additionally, it should also be raised during arguments as it questions the validity.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Advance rental, defaulted to pay the agreed amount",
    "answer": "If the P claims that he is the lessee then he has to produce a registered lease deed since lease is a transfer of property and is compulsorily registrable u/s 17 of the registration, unless his claim is that the lease was granted to him on month to month basis for which a registered lease deed is not requiredThe P cannot obviously ask for the relief of permanent injunction. His claim is that of a lessee and not of an owner. So the actual owner can never be permanently injuncted in respect of his own property since the lessor owner has a right of re entry in the demised property upon breach of the lease conditions and also has a reversionary interest in the leased propertyThus the suit so far it seeks the relief of a permanent injunction against the owner is not maintainableHowever I assume that there is a pending application under order 7 rule 11 regarding rejection of the plaint /maintainability of suit. However a 7/11 application can only be tried based on averments in the plaint and not considering defense of defendant. So the court may hold that the suit will have to await a trial and may not reject the plaint at the thresholdHowever if the So called lessee has not sought for relief of possession then seeking a declaration of his alleged leasehold rights without seeking relief of possession,  is unheard of , as no tenant would only be interested in a mere paper declaration about his lease right without actual physical possession of the leased property. Thus the suit can be attacked under 7/11 clause a , that is, there is no cause of action in favor of P.It appears that relief of possession is omitted to be sought in order to save court fee which is payable on the market value of the subject propertyAlso If the P omits to sue in respect of the relief of possession,  then without leave of the court,  he cannot sue in future for such relief of possession (just check Order 2 of cpc)I suggest you file a counter claim in the P's suit under Order 8 Rule 6A for a declaration that you are in lawful possession and for a negative declaration that the Property was never agreed to be let to the P on lease basis. As you are in possession,  no court fee is payable except nominal court fee for relief of declarationYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Advance rental, defaulted to pay the agreed amount",
    "answer": "Based on the facts provided, here is an expert legal analysis and advice:1. Maintainability of the Suit:The plaintiff's suit seeking a decree of declaration to establish him as a lessee and for permanent injunction against the defendant (owner) appears to be not maintainable. The following legal principles support this position:a) A person cannot be declared a tenant or lessee without a valid lease deed and without being put in possession of the property .b) A mere agreement to lease or an incomplete transaction does not create a lease or tenancy .c) A suit for permanent injunction against the true owner restraining him from dealing with his property is not maintainable.2. Unsigned Plaint:As per Order VI Rule 14 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, every pleading (including the plaint) must be signed by the party and their pleader. An unsigned plaint is a defective plaint and can be rejected under Order VII Rule 11 of CPC.3. Advance Payment and Receipt:The fact that the plaintiff paid an advance of Rs. 3,00,000/- and was issued a receipt mentioning it as an advance and part payment, does not automatically create a lease or tenancy. It merely shows an intention to enter into a lease agreement, which did not materialize due to the plaintiff's failure to pay the balance amount and sign the rent agreement.4. Suggested Arguments:Based on the above legal principles and case laws, you can argue the following points:a) The suit is not maintainable as the plaintiff cannot be declared a lessee or tenant without a valid lease deed and without being put in possession of the property.b) The mere payment of an advance and issuance of a receipt does not create a lease or tenancy, as the essential requirements of a valid lease agreement were not fulfilled.c) The suit for permanent injunction against the true owner restraining him from dealing with his property is not maintainable.d) The plaint itself is defective and liable to be rejected as it is unsigned, violating Order VI Rule 14 of CPC.e) The ex-parte order passed by the court restraining the creation of third-party rights is unsustainable in law, as the plaintiff has no legal right or interest in the property.It is advisable to file a comprehensive written statement raising these objections and citing relevant case laws to support your arguments. Additionally, you may consider filing an application under Order VII Rule 11 of CPC for rejection of the plaint on the ground of being unsigned and legally untenable.Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "answer": "Dear Client,With respect to civil suit filed against you by the plaintiff seeking a declaration as a lessee and a permanent injunction, on this one, it clear that the suit is not actionable at law or in equity because the plaintiff does not seek possession of the property and cannot therefore be regarded as a lessee under a valid lease agreement. Thus payment of an advance does not make the person a lessee as according to the Indian Contract act, 1872 there exists certain ingredients for making the contract a valid one. In addition, ensure a point is made to the effect that a permanent injunction cannot be passed against the person who is the real owner of the property under the Specific Relief Act 1963. The issues of filing a counter-claim for damages in contract as well as the legal implication of this legal case is discussed.

In Asha John Divianathan v. In Vikram Malhotra (2021) the Supreme Court has made it very clear that where RBI permission is necessary for a transaction, it cannot be enforced without permission although the sender has given a mere receipt, this means where legal formalities have to be complied with they cannot be displaced by a mere acknowledgment. Additionally, in the principles outlined in N.N. Global Mercantile Pvt. Ltd. v. Indo Unique Flame Ltd. (2021) it is equally true that the unstamped document cannot be accorded the legal enforceability and therefore cannot be substituted by a receipt alone. It advisable to make sure that every legal requirement for enforcing the agreement as a contract has been complied with the provisions of the Indian Contract Act.Hope you find this answer helpful in resolving your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queriesSince your father had died intestate, i.e., without a will, you have a right to inherit the property under theHindu Succession Act, 1956. To record the house in your name legally, you need to obtain a legal heir certificate from any local authority, such as Tehsildar or district office establishing your right to inherit the property.You'll require the following papers for this legal heir certificate1. Father's death certificate2. Mother's death certificate. She was deceased prior to father3. Birth certificate- The birth related proof with your father4. Identity proof such as Aadhar and PAN5. Address proof.Once you obtain the legal heir certificate, you can approach the local revenue authorities or municipal office to get the property mutated in your name by submitting a legal heir certificate along with other documents called for in the process. Through mutation, your property records will be updated.Normally, you do not need a succession certificate to transfer immovable property like a house. A succession certificate is required for movable assets; it is not required for immovable property.Regarding the sale of the property, once it gets mutated in your name you can sell it freely without any kind of problem arising. Incase of a dispute in contention you may have to file a civil suit for declaring yourself as the sole legal heir but no stamp duty needs to be paid like in succession certificate cases; only court fees are applicable according to the case.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The requirement is that you will need to spend around two weeks in Denmark and provide such documents as, respectively, valid passports and certificate of no impediment to marriage. Once married, the marriage will be legal, enabling the Spousal Immigrant Visa process which is normally fourteen months. If you prefer waiting in Poland or in India, it is possible, but it is necessary to meet the demands of U.S immigration services regarding residency in this country. As much as possible, stay clear of misconceptions surrounding documents in both the marriage and visa process. Proper paperwork is essential in this process. It is advisable to consult with an immigration lawyer to clarify these issues as you proceed with your further plans.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The NOC from the US Embassy in Delhi for marriage is usually accepted by the marriage registrars, but it is advisable to clear this by consulting the marriage registrar that you intend to use. Besides the papers you mentioned (passport, visa, birth certificates, proof of address, single status affidavit, notice of intended marriage, photographs, witnesses, NOC, divorce certificate), it is possible you may be required to produce your self-attested proof of date of birth, proof of your residence in the district for at least thirty days and two affidavits proving that you two are not related in a manner prohibited by the law. Marriage registrars can be consulted as well as a legal advisor in order to meet all the legal formalities for the registration.Hope you find this answer suitable for resolving you query.Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queries1. Affidavit of marital status: Yes, this can be obtained from any notary public in India, but these must be authenticated by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), and even authenticated by the county's embassy where the marriage is going to take place.2. NOC issued from the U.S. Embassy in Delhi: The NOC issued from the U.S. Embassy, Delhi, will establish marital status on the part of your fiancé. However, it may not be acceptable everywhere and acceptance may depend on the local rules in the court or the marriage registrar of the region. You are therefore requested to obtain the local rules of the marriage registrar.3. Documents The list of documents accepted includes, to a large extent, the following: Passport, Visa, Birth Certificate, Proof of Address, Single Status Affidavit, Notice of Intended Marriage, Photographs, Witnesses, NOC and Divorce Certificate, if the applicant has been divorced.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If anyone of, father or mother is direct recruited class 1 servants than their children won't be eligible for NCL. But if he/she is promoted to class 1 then the kids will be eligible2. If both of the parents are class 2 then their kids won't be eligible for OBC quota , and in case of one only , then the child would be off from creamy layer and they can avail benefits of quota3. If father was recruited direct to class 2 positions and then prompted to class 1 before age of 40 than it would be no longer NCL. However this scenario only applies to father not the mother- The government servants who don’t fall under this category are all non-creamy layer.- Government Employees of Class 3 or below class 3 officers are eligible for OBC Quota., and the salary/ income of the government employees are not to be taken into consideration for considering the OBC NCL category certificate.- Since your father is under group B m, and mother is promoted in group B, then you are eligible to get non-creamy OBC Certificate.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Advance rental, defaulted to pay the agreed amount",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I would like to inform you that,In your situation, a request to declare the plaintiff as a tenant without a rental agreement or occupation cannot be considered. In order for a lease agreement to be legitimate, it must include mutual agreement, complete rent payment, and possession, all of which are absent in this particular situation. If a rental contract was not signed and the plaintiff did not meet their responsibilities, they have no grounds to assert tenancy.Part performance by the transferee is necessary for Section 53A of theTransfer of Property Act(doctrine of part performance) to be applicable. The plaintiff is not eligible for protection under this section since he did not fulfill his obligations in the contract.A true owner is typically not allowed to be subjected to an injunction. You can challenge the plaintiff's effort to prevent you from managing your own property with an ex-parte order. You can find support from the ruling of the Supreme Court in Karnataka Board of Wakf v. Government of India (2004) 10 SCC 779, which affirmed that a tenant or claimant without legal possession or agreement cannot seek injunction against the rightful owner.An unmarked complaint is also not considered legitimate according to Order VI Rule 14 of the CPC, 1908, which requires pleadings to be signed by the party or their authorized agent. Additionally, it should also be raised during arguments as it questions the validity.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Without any valid rental or lease agreement he cannot claim himself to be a lessee neither he can claim the privileges of a tenant in the property which was not at all occupied by him nor there was any rent paid by him during the interim period.Moreover he paid a partial amount towards the agreed advance amount hence it cannot be concluded that he had paid the advance or security amount towards leasing the property.You can file a petition to vacate the exparte order restricting you to not to create third party interest in the property.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Advance rental, defaulted to pay the agreed amount",
    "answer": "If the P claims that he is the lessee then he has to produce a registered lease deed since lease is a transfer of property and is compulsorily registrable u/s 17 of the registration, unless his claim is that the lease was granted to him on month to month basis for which a registered lease deed is not requiredThe P cannot obviously ask for the relief of permanent injunction. His claim is that of a lessee and not of an owner. So the actual owner can never be permanently injuncted in respect of his own property since the lessor owner has a right of re entry in the demised property upon breach of the lease conditions and also has a reversionary interest in the leased propertyThus the suit so far it seeks the relief of a permanent injunction against the owner is not maintainableHowever I assume that there is a pending application under order 7 rule 11 regarding rejection of the plaint /maintainability of suit. However a 7/11 application can only be tried based on averments in the plaint and not considering defense of defendant. So the court may hold that the suit will have to await a trial and may not reject the plaint at the thresholdHowever if the So called lessee has not sought for relief of possession then seeking a declaration of his alleged leasehold rights without seeking relief of possession,  is unheard of , as no tenant would only be interested in a mere paper declaration about his lease right without actual physical possession of the leased property. Thus the suit can be attacked under 7/11 clause a , that is, there is no cause of action in favor of P.It appears that relief of possession is omitted to be sought in order to save court fee which is payable on the market value of the subject propertyAlso If the P omits to sue in respect of the relief of possession,  then without leave of the court,  he cannot sue in future for such relief of possession (just check Order 2 of cpc)I suggest you file a counter claim in the P's suit under Order 8 Rule 6A for a declaration that you are in lawful possession and for a negative declaration that the Property was never agreed to be let to the P on lease basis. As you are in possession,  no court fee is payable except nominal court fee for relief of declarationYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Advance rental, defaulted to pay the agreed amount",
    "answer": "Based on the facts provided, here is an expert legal analysis and advice:1. Maintainability of the Suit:The plaintiff's suit seeking a decree of declaration to establish him as a lessee and for permanent injunction against the defendant (owner) appears to be not maintainable. The following legal principles support this position:a) A person cannot be declared a tenant or lessee without a valid lease deed and without being put in possession of the property .b) A mere agreement to lease or an incomplete transaction does not create a lease or tenancy .c) A suit for permanent injunction against the true owner restraining him from dealing with his property is not maintainable.2. Unsigned Plaint:As per Order VI Rule 14 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, every pleading (including the plaint) must be signed by the party and their pleader. An unsigned plaint is a defective plaint and can be rejected under Order VII Rule 11 of CPC.3. Advance Payment and Receipt:The fact that the plaintiff paid an advance of Rs. 3,00,000/- and was issued a receipt mentioning it as an advance and part payment, does not automatically create a lease or tenancy. It merely shows an intention to enter into a lease agreement, which did not materialize due to the plaintiff's failure to pay the balance amount and sign the rent agreement.4. Suggested Arguments:Based on the above legal principles and case laws, you can argue the following points:a) The suit is not maintainable as the plaintiff cannot be declared a lessee or tenant without a valid lease deed and without being put in possession of the property.b) The mere payment of an advance and issuance of a receipt does not create a lease or tenancy, as the essential requirements of a valid lease agreement were not fulfilled.c) The suit for permanent injunction against the true owner restraining him from dealing with his property is not maintainable.d) The plaint itself is defective and liable to be rejected as it is unsigned, violating Order VI Rule 14 of CPC.e) The ex-parte order passed by the court restraining the creation of third-party rights is unsustainable in law, as the plaintiff has no legal right or interest in the property.It is advisable to file a comprehensive written statement raising these objections and citing relevant case laws to support your arguments. Additionally, you may consider filing an application under Order VII Rule 11 of CPC for rejection of the plaint on the ground of being unsigned and legally untenable.Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "question": "Advance rental, defaulted to pay the agreed amount",
    "answer": "Dear Client,With respect to civil suit filed against you by the plaintiff seeking a declaration as a lessee and a permanent injunction, on this one, it clear that the suit is not actionable at law or in equity because the plaintiff does not seek possession of the property and cannot therefore be regarded as a lessee under a valid lease agreement. Thus payment of an advance does not make the person a lessee as according to the Indian Contract act, 1872 there exists certain ingredients for making the contract a valid one. In addition, ensure a point is made to the effect that a permanent injunction cannot be passed against the person who is the real owner of the property under the Specific Relief Act 1963. The issues of filing a counter-claim for damages in contract as well as the legal implication of this legal case is discussed. The aspect of a Contract under the license agreement following the Indian Contract Act Section 2(h), Section 10 and Section 73, the determination of the Proprietary Right, Section 105 ofTransfer of Property Act, Section 106 of the same act, Section 117, The Remedy of Rescission by delivering up the thing and compensation Section 37 of Specific Relief Act, and Section 38 of Specific Relief Act.Hope you find this answer suitable for resolving you query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The Supreme Court has not held that a receipt is no agreement but what has been settled law that a receipt alone will not amount to an agreement unless the receipt and terms contained in it constitute an agreement under the India Contract Act, 1872. In Asha John Divianathan v. In Vikram Malhotra (2021) the Supreme Court has made it very clear that where RBI permission is necessary for a transaction, it cannot be enforced without permission although the sender has given a mere receipt, this means where legal formalities have to be complied with they cannot be displaced by a mere acknowledgment. Additionally, in the principles outlined in N.N. Global Mercantile Pvt. Ltd. v. Indo Unique Flame Ltd. (2021) it is equally true that the unstamped document cannot be accorded the legal enforceability and therefore cannot be substituted by a receipt alone. It advisable to make sure that every legal requirement for enforcing the agreement as a contract has been complied with the provisions of the Indian Contract Act.Hope you find this answer helpful in resolving your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Suit for permanent injunction restraining interference vs injunction against alienation",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I want to let you know that,It is permissible under Indian law to bring two different suits based on the same subject matter if the relief sought in each is different and not barred by the principles of res judicata as applied by a competent court (Section 11, Code of Civil Procedure,1908). Since your suit is on permanent injunction restraining interference, whereas the counter claim by defendants involves an averment that the property is an ancestral one, if they give rise to different questions of law each may be allowed to proceed with the court dealing with each case on their respective merits.With regard to the contention of the defendants that the property is an ancestral one, a registered sale deed as in the case of acquisition made by your grandfather in the year 1944 would certainly break the chain. This would mean your mother bought the property as self-acquired, not ancestral. A father can sell property to his daughter by way of executing a sale deed, if it is his self-acquired property, and the rules are stipulated under Section 54 of theTransfer of Property Act, 1882. It has been held in a series of judgments by the courts that once the property is acquired by purchase, it cannot be termed as ancestral property (See S. Sai Reddy v. S. Narayana Reddy, AIR 1991 SC 2086).You could represent yourself under Order III Rule 1 of the CPC, whereby parties are allowed to represent themselves. To adequately represent, ensure you have all documentary evidence, be it a sale deed, and prepare to argue on facts and legal principles, more so on the point of whether the property is ancestral or self-acquired.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In Telangana you may approach a civil court for a declaratory relief and recovery of property seeking relief on the ground that the transfers made by your father to his brother’s daughters are unlawful. Even though, the act was passed 16 years ago, it may be possible to use the Section 17 of the Limitation Act, 1963 to request the extension of limitation period if the accused did not know about the fraud until now.

This can establish the boundaries of your property.Complaint to the High Court:Grounds for Complaint:You can file a complaint with the High Court against the judge's son's actions and potential influence on lower courts and police.Allege bias in the issuance of the injunction order.Mention the police inaction on your complaint and their cooperation with the other party despite the injunction order exceeding permissible boundaries.Evidence:Include copies of all the documents mentioned earlier as evidence to support your claims.Maintain Records:Document all future interactions with the other party, police, and revenue officials.Highlight Injustice:While presenting your case, emphasize the power imbalance created by the judge's family's influence.Focus on Facts:Base your arguments on facts and verifiable documents.Consider Media Attention (Optional):In some cases, bringing media attention to situations involving. potential judicial bias can be helpful. However, this should be a last resort and doneRegards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay Highcourt"

    "answer": "Dear client,In your legal situation, it is necessary to deal with the procedural irregularities on the wrong entry of defendants and the unclear addresses that has hindered proper delivery of summons. These are relevant when giving a petition to have the ex-parte injunction set aside on the 1st of October in the year 2024 be kicked out because under the CPC under Order V, proper service must have been made. You should consider bringing an application for contempt against Judge P. Nageswara Rao for granting the injunction when there is no sufficient basis to do so without sufficient notice violating your rights and procedurally unfair. Although there are concerns that complaints against both judges should be made, it may be more beneficial to aim at the junior judge if you think he is pressured by the first judge. Whatever samples of his calls or conversation or other such material for substantiating the allegations compiled by her must be compiled completely. The approach is associated with Section 27 of the CPC pointing out that proper summon and fair hearing should be conducted in the case.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Advance rental, defaulted to pay the agreed amount",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I would like to inform you that,In your situation, a request to declare the plaintiff as a tenant without a rental agreement or occupation cannot be considered. In order for a lease agreement to be legitimate, it must include mutual agreement, complete rent payment, and possession, all of which are absent in this particular situation. If a rental contract was not signed and the plaintiff did not meet their responsibilities, they have no grounds to assert tenancy.Part performance by the transferee is necessary for Section 53A of theTransfer of Property Act(doctrine of part performance) to be applicable. The plaintiff is not eligible for protection under this section since he did not fulfill his obligations in the contract.A true owner is typically not allowed to be subjected to an injunction. You can challenge the plaintiff's effort to prevent you from managing your own property with an ex-parte order. You can find support from the ruling of the Supreme Court in Karnataka Board of Wakf v. Government of India (2004) 10 SCC 779, which affirmed that a tenant or claimant without legal possession or agreement cannot seek injunction against the rightful owner.An unmarked complaint is also not considered legitimate according to Order VI Rule 14 of the CPC, 1908, which requires pleadings to be signed by the party or their authorized agent. Additionally, it should also be raised during arguments as it questions the validity.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Advance rental, defaulted to pay the agreed amount",
    "answer": "If the P claims that he is the lessee then he has to produce a registered lease deed since lease is a transfer of property and is compulsorily registrable u/s 17 of the registration, unless his claim is that the lease was granted to him on month to month basis for which a registered lease deed is not requiredThe P cannot obviously ask for the relief of permanent injunction. His claim is that of a lessee and not of an owner. So the actual owner can never be permanently injuncted in respect of his own property since the lessor owner has a right of re entry in the demised property upon breach of the lease conditions and also has a reversionary interest in the leased propertyThus the suit so far it seeks the relief of a permanent injunction against the owner is not maintainableHowever I assume that there is a pending application under order 7 rule 11 regarding rejection of the plaint /maintainability of suit. However a 7/11 application can only be tried based on averments in the plaint and not considering defense of defendant. So the court may hold that the suit will have to await a trial and may not reject the plaint at the thresholdHowever if the So called lessee has not sought for relief of possession then seeking a declaration of his alleged leasehold rights without seeking relief of possession,  is unheard of , as no tenant would only be interested in a mere paper declaration about his lease right without actual physical possession of the leased property. Thus the suit can be attacked under 7/11 clause a , that is, there is no cause of action in favor of P.It appears that relief of possession is omitted to be sought in order to save court fee which is payable on the market value of the subject propertyAlso If the P omits to sue in respect of the relief of possession,  then without leave of the court,  he cannot sue in future for such relief of possession (just check Order 2 of cpc)I suggest you file a counter claim in the P's suit under Order 8 Rule 6A for a declaration that you are in lawful possession and for a negative declaration that the Property was never agreed to be let to the P on lease basis.

    "question": "Advance rental, defaulted to pay the agreed amount",
    "answer": "Based on the facts provided, here is an expert legal analysis and advice:1. Maintainability of the Suit:The plaintiff's suit seeking a decree of declaration to establish him as a lessee and for permanent injunction against the defendant (owner) appears to be not maintainable. The following legal principles support this position:a) A person cannot be declared a tenant or lessee without a valid lease deed and without being put in possession of the property .b) A mere agreement to lease or an incomplete transaction does not create a lease or tenancy .c) A suit for permanent injunction against the true owner restraining him from dealing with his property is not maintainable.2. Unsigned Plaint:As per Order VI Rule 14 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, every pleading (including the plaint) must be signed by the party and their pleader. An unsigned plaint is a defective plaint and can be rejected under Order VII Rule 11 of CPC.3. Advance Payment and Receipt:The fact that the plaintiff paid an advance of Rs. 3,00,000/- and was issued a receipt mentioning it as an advance and part payment, does not automatically create a lease or tenancy. It merely shows an intention to enter into a lease agreement, which did not materialize due to the plaintiff's failure to pay the balance amount and sign the rent agreement.4. Suggested Arguments:Based on the above legal principles and case laws, you can argue the following points:a) The suit is not maintainable as the plaintiff cannot be declared a lessee or tenant without a valid lease deed and without being put in possession of the property.b) The mere payment of an advance and issuance of a receipt does not create a lease or tenancy, as the essential requirements of a valid lease agreement were not fulfilled.c) The suit for permanent injunction against the true owner restraining him from dealing with his property is not maintainable.d) The plaint itself is defective and liable to be rejected as it is unsigned, violating Order VI Rule 14 of CPC.e) The ex-parte order passed by the court restraining the creation of third-party rights is unsustainable in law, as the plaintiff has no legal right or interest in the property.It is advisable to file a comprehensive written statement raising these objections and citing relevant case laws to support your arguments. Additionally, you may consider filing an application under Order VII Rule 11 of CPC for rejection of the plaint on the ground of being unsigned and legally untenable.Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "question": "Advance rental, defaulted to pay the agreed amount",
    "answer": "Dear Client,With respect to civil suit filed against you by the plaintiff seeking a declaration as a lessee and a permanent injunction, on this one, it clear that the suit is not actionable at law or in equity because the plaintiff does not seek possession of the property and cannot therefore be regarded as a lessee under a valid lease agreement. Thus payment of an advance does not make the person a lessee as according to the Indian Contract act, 1872 there exists certain ingredients for making the contract a valid one. In addition, ensure a point is made to the effect that a permanent injunction cannot be passed against the person who is the real owner of the property under the Specific Relief Act 1963. The issues of filing a counter-claim for damages in contract as well as the legal implication of this legal case is discussed. The aspect of a Contract under the license agreement following the Indian Contract Act Section 2(h), Section 10 and Section 73, the determination of the Proprietary Right, Section 105 ofTransfer of Property Act, Section 106 of the same act, Section 117, The Remedy of Rescission by delivering up the thing and compensation Section 37 of Specific Relief Act, and Section 38 of Specific Relief Act.Hope you find this answer suitable for resolving you query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Advance rental, defaulted to pay the agreed amount",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The Supreme Court has not held that a receipt is no agreement but what has been settled law that a receipt alone will not amount to an agreement unless the receipt and terms contained in it constitute an agreement under the India Contract Act, 1872. In Asha John Divianathan v. In Vikram Malhotra (2021) the Supreme Court has made it very clear that where RBI permission is necessary for a transaction, it cannot be enforced without permission although the sender has given a mere receipt, this means where legal formalities have to be complied with they cannot be displaced by a mere acknowledgment. Additionally, in the principles outlined in N.N. Global Mercantile Pvt. Ltd. v. Indo Unique Flame Ltd. (2021) it is equally true that the unstamped document cannot be accorded the legal enforceability and therefore cannot be substituted by a receipt alone. It advisable to make sure that every legal requirement for enforcing the agreement as a contract has been complied with the provisions of the Indian Contract Act.Hope you find this answer helpful in resolving your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "I have been victimised in cybercrime",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I understand your concern regarding the blocking of INR 15,000 from your bank account due to a cyber complaint. Based on the information provided, I will provide an expert legal response to address your query.Under Indian law, banks are required to comply with the provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000, and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines on cybersecurity. If a bank receives a cyber complaint or suspects any unauthorized or fraudulent activity related to a customer's account, it has the authority to temporarily block or freeze the account as a precautionary measure.The blocking of funds in your account could be due to the following reasons:1. Suspected Unauthorized Transaction: If the bank suspects that your account has been compromised or used for unauthorized transactions, it may block the funds as a security measure to prevent further misuse.2. Cybercrime Investigation: If a cybercrime complaint has been filed against you or your account, the bank may have received a request from law enforcement agencies to block the funds temporarily for investigation purposes.3. Compliance with Regulatory Requirements: Banks are required to comply with various regulatory requirements, including those related to anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT). If any suspicious activity is detected, the bank may block the funds as a precautionary measure.Regarding the lack of communication from the cybercrime authorities or the police station, it is possible that the investigation is still ongoing, and they may contact you at a later stage if required.Here are some steps you can take:1. Obtain a Written Explanation: Request a written explanation from the bank regarding the specific reasons for blocking your funds and the nature of the cyber complaint. This will help you understand the situation better and take appropriate action.2. Provide Necessary Information: If the bank requests any additional information or documentation from you, promptly provide the same to facilitate the resolution of the issue.3. Seek Legal Assistance: If the issue persists or if you believe that the bank's actions are unjustified, you may consider seeking legal assistance from a competent lawyer specializing in banking and cybercrime laws.4. File a Complaint: If the bank fails to provide a satisfactory explanation or resolution, you can file a complaint with the Banking Ombudsman or the Cyber Crime Cell of your local police station, depending on the nature of the issue.It is important to note that banks are required to follow due process and provide reasonable justification for blocking funds. If it is indeed a mistake on their part, they should rectify the situation promptly.I hope this expert legal response helps you understand the situation better and guides you on the appropriate course of action. If you require any further assistance or have additional queries, please feel free to reach out.Regards,Adv Arunkumar KhediaBombay HighcourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In your instance, it appears that the bank has restricted your account on the basis of a cyber complaint, most likely as a result of a fraud investigation or identity theft. This would be applicable if the fact that the OTP is being sent to a different number suggests that there might be a mistake or that there might be another party connected to the complaint. In order to obtain all the specifics of the complaint and have it referred to you, you need to file a formal complaint right away with the bank and the authorities investigating cybercrime. Additionally, to speed the processing of your involvement-related case, you can just walk to the closest police station or cybercrime cell with an acknowledgment number in hand.In case if it is a mistake or your complaint has no relevance to you, you can ask to have your account unblocked by providing evidence such as bank statements as well as proof of no unlawful transactions. It would also be prudent to seek legal assistance so that in the process you would not miss out on your rights.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Advance rental, defaulted to pay the agreed amount",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I would like to inform you that,In your situation, a request to declare the plaintiff as a tenant without a rental agreement or occupation cannot be considered. In order for a lease agreement to be legitimate, it must include mutual agreement, complete rent payment, and possession, all of which are absent in this particular situation. If a rental contract was not signed and the plaintiff did not meet their responsibilities, they have no grounds to assert tenancy.Part performance by the transferee is necessary for Section 53A of theTransfer of Property Act(doctrine of part performance) to be applicable. The plaintiff is not eligible for protection under this section since he did not fulfill his obligations in the contract.A true owner is typically not allowed to be subjected to an injunction. You can challenge the plaintiff's effort to prevent you from managing your own property with an ex-parte order. You can find support from the ruling of the Supreme Court in Karnataka Board of Wakf v. Government of India (2004) 10 SCC 779, which affirmed that a tenant or claimant without legal possession or agreement cannot seek injunction against the rightful owner.An unmarked complaint is also not considered legitimate according to Order VI Rule 14 of the CPC, 1908, which requires pleadings to be signed by the party or their authorized agent. Additionally, it should also be raised during arguments as it questions the validity.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Advance rental, defaulted to pay the agreed amount",
    "answer": "If the P claims that he is the lessee then he has to produce a registered lease deed since lease is a transfer of property and is compulsorily registrable u/s 17 of the registration, unless his claim is that the lease was granted to him on month to month basis for which a registered lease deed is not requiredThe P cannot obviously ask for the relief of permanent injunction. His claim is that of a lessee and not of an owner. So the actual owner can never be permanently injuncted in respect of his own property since the lessor owner has a right of re entry in the demised property upon breach of the lease conditions and also has a reversionary interest in the leased propertyThus the suit so far it seeks the relief of a permanent injunction against the owner is not maintainableHowever I assume that there is a pending application under order 7 rule 11 regarding rejection of the plaint /maintainability of suit. However a 7/11 application can only be tried based on averments in the plaint and not considering defense of defendant. So the court may hold that the suit will have to await a trial and may not reject the plaint at the thresholdHowever if the So called lessee has not sought for relief of possession then seeking a declaration of his alleged leasehold rights without seeking relief of possession,  is unheard of , as no tenant would only be interested in a mere paper declaration about his lease right without actual physical possession of the leased property. Thus the suit can be attacked under 7/11 clause a , that is, there is no cause of action in favor of P.It appears that relief of possession is omitted to be sought in order to save court fee which is payable on the market value of the subject propertyAlso If the P omits to sue in respect of the relief of possession,  then without leave of the court,  he cannot sue in future for such relief of possession (just check Order 2 of cpc)I suggest you file a counter claim in the P's suit under Order 8 Rule 6A for a declaration that you are in lawful possession and for a negative declaration that the Property was never agreed to be let to the P on lease basis. As you are in possession,  no court fee is payable except nominal court fee for relief of declarationYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Advance rental, defaulted to pay the agreed amount",
    "answer": "Based on the facts provided, here is an expert legal analysis and advice:1. Maintainability of the Suit:The plaintiff's suit seeking a decree of declaration to establish him as a lessee and for permanent injunction against the defendant (owner) appears to be not maintainable. The following legal principles support this position:a) A person cannot be declared a tenant or lessee without a valid lease deed and without being put in possession of the property .b) A mere agreement to lease or an incomplete transaction does not create a lease or tenancy .c) A suit for permanent injunction against the true owner restraining him from dealing with his property is not maintainable.2. Unsigned Plaint:As per Order VI Rule 14 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, every pleading (including the plaint) must be signed by the party and their pleader. An unsigned plaint is a defective plaint and can be rejected under Order VII Rule 11 of CPC.3. Advance Payment and Receipt:The fact that the plaintiff paid an advance of Rs. 3,00,000/- and was issued a receipt mentioning it as an advance and part payment, does not automatically create a lease or tenancy. It merely shows an intention to enter into a lease agreement, which did not materialize due to the plaintiff's failure to pay the balance amount and sign the rent agreement.4. Suggested Arguments:Based on the above legal principles and case laws, you can argue the following points:a) The suit is not maintainable as the plaintiff cannot be declared a lessee or tenant without a valid lease deed and without being put in possession of the property.b) The mere payment of an advance and issuance of a receipt does not create a lease or tenancy, as the essential requirements of a valid lease agreement were not fulfilled.c) The suit for permanent injunction against the true owner restraining him from dealing with his property is not maintainable.d) The plaint itself is defective and liable to be rejected as it is unsigned, violating Order VI Rule 14 of CPC.e) The ex-parte order passed by the court restraining the creation of third-party rights is unsustainable in law, as the plaintiff has no legal right or interest in the property.It is advisable to file a comprehensive written statement raising these objections and citing relevant case laws to support your arguments. Additionally, you may consider filing an application under Order VII Rule 11 of CPC for rejection of the plaint on the ground of being unsigned and legally untenable.Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "question": "Advance rental, defaulted to pay the agreed amount",
    "answer": "Dear Client,With respect to civil suit filed against you by the plaintiff seeking a declaration as a lessee and a permanent injunction, on this one, it clear that the suit is not actionable at law or in equity because the plaintiff does not seek possession of the property and cannot therefore be regarded as a lessee under a valid lease agreement. Thus payment of an advance does not make the person a lessee as according to the Indian Contract act, 1872 there exists certain ingredients for making the contract a valid one. In addition, ensure a point is made to the effect that a permanent injunction cannot be passed against the person who is the real owner of the property under the Specific Relief Act 1963. The issues of filing a counter-claim for damages in contract as well as the legal implication of this legal case is discussed. The aspect of a Contract under the license agreement following the Indian Contract Act Section 2(h), Section 10 and Section 73, the determination of the Proprietary Right, Section 105 ofTransfer of Property Act, Section 106 of the same act, Section 117, The Remedy of Rescission by delivering up the thing and compensation Section 37 of Specific Relief Act, and Section 38 of Specific Relief Act.Hope you find this answer suitable for resolving you query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

(2021) it is equally true that the unstamped document cannot be accorded the legal enforceability and therefore cannot be substituted by a receipt alone. It advisable to make sure that every legal requirement for enforcing the agreement as a contract has been complied with the provisions of the Indian Contract Act.Hope you find this answer helpful in resolving your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "I have been victimised in cybercrime",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I understand your concern regarding the blocking of INR 15,000 from your bank account due to a cyber complaint. Based on the information provided, I will provide an expert legal response to address your query.Under Indian law, banks are required to comply with the provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000, and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines on cybersecurity. If a bank receives a cyber complaint or suspects any unauthorized or fraudulent activity related to a customer's account, it has the authority to temporarily block or freeze the account as a precautionary measure.The blocking of funds in your account could be due to the following reasons:1. Suspected Unauthorized Transaction: If the bank suspects that your account has been compromised or used for unauthorized transactions, it may block the funds as a security measure to prevent further misuse.2. Cybercrime Investigation: If a cybercrime complaint has been filed against you or your account, the bank may have received a request from law enforcement agencies to block the funds temporarily for investigation purposes.3. Compliance with Regulatory Requirements: Banks are required to comply with various regulatory requirements, including those related to anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT). If any suspicious activity is detected, the bank may block the funds as a precautionary measure.Regarding the lack of communication from the cybercrime authorities or the police station, it is possible that the investigation is still ongoing, and they may contact you at a later stage if required.Here are some steps you can take:1. Obtain a Written Explanation: Request a written explanation from the bank regarding the specific reasons for blocking your funds and the nature of the cyber complaint. This will help you understand the situation better and take appropriate action.2. Provide Necessary Information: If the bank requests any additional information or documentation from you, promptly provide the same to facilitate the resolution of the issue.3. Seek Legal Assistance: If the issue persists or if you believe that the bank's actions are unjustified, you may consider seeking legal assistance from a competent lawyer specializing in banking and cybercrime laws.4. File a Complaint: If the bank fails to provide a satisfactory explanation or resolution, you can file a complaint with the Banking Ombudsman or the Cyber Crime Cell of your local police station, depending on the nature of the issue.It is important to note that banks are required to follow due process and provide reasonable justification for blocking funds. If it is indeed a mistake on their part, they should rectify the situation promptly.I hope this expert legal response helps you understand the situation better and guides you on the appropriate course of action. If you require any further assistance or have additional queries, please feel free to reach out.Regards,Adv Arunkumar KhediaBombay HighcourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "question": "I have been victimised in cybercrime",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your instance, it appears that the bank has restricted your account on the basis of a cyber complaint, most likely as a result of a fraud investigation or identity theft. This would be applicable if the fact that the OTP is being sent to a different number suggests that there might be a mistake or that there might be another party connected to the complaint. In order to obtain all the specifics of the complaint and have it referred to you, you need to file a formal complaint right away with the bank and the authorities investigating cybercrime. Additionally, to speed the processing of your involvement-related case, you can just walk to the closest police station or cybercrime cell with an acknowledgment number in hand.In case if it is a mistake or your complaint has no relevance to you, you can ask to have your account unblocked by providing evidence such as bank statements as well as proof of no unlawful transactions. It would also be prudent to seek legal assistance so that in the process you would not miss out on your rights.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

These are relevant when giving a petition to have the ex-parte injunction set aside on the 1st of October in the year 2024 be kicked out because under the CPC under Order V, proper service must have been made. You should consider bringing an application for contempt against Judge P. Nageswara Rao for granting the injunction when there is no sufficient basis to do so without sufficient notice violating your rights and procedurally unfair. Although there are concerns that complaints against both judges should be made, it may be more beneficial to aim at the junior judge if you think he is pressured by the first judge. Whatever samples of his calls or conversation or other such material for substantiating the allegations compiled by her must be compiled completely. The approach is associated with Section 27 of the CPC pointing out that proper summon and fair hearing should be conducted in the case.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Agreement to sale",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The Indian law does not mandate the writing and  registration of an agreement to sell property but it is advisable that such an agreement be in writing and or registered because an unregistered document may not be acted upon by courts of law. The statement of sale by means of an agreement to sell does not even vest the title of the property to the buyer, it simply lays down detailed provisions of a sale. Title to the property passes only by operation of a sale deed, as per Section 54 of theTransfer of Property Act1882. For this reason, the sale deed should be prepared and needful to register legally so that the title of property gets transferred appropriately. As for all these issues it is always advisable to consult a lawyer especially when in property related activities/businesses/transactions.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Non-consummation of marriage, admittance of marriage under pressure",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the case you have described, the wife's rejection to consummate her marriage and her statement that she was married against her will by her parents can be grounds for an annulment. According to Section 12(1)(a) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, a marriage is annulled when it has not been consummated with the intention or willful refusal of the other spouse. Moreover, if she had a marriage sullenly induced against her will, that too might be a ground for annulment under Section 12(1)(c) because of a lack of free consent.To get this marriage annulled, your brother has to file a petition in the family court and present proof that it hasn't been consummated with her and has no intention of fulfilling marital duties. Whatever be the case, her parents' silence is immaterial to the case, since the case involves only the couple. The court will study circumstances and determine if the marriage can be declared voidable. Since this marriage isn't consummated, there's more chances of a successful annulment petition.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Advance rental, defaulted to pay the agreed amount",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I would like to inform you that,In your situation, a request to declare the plaintiff as a tenant without a rental agreement or occupation cannot be considered. In order for a lease agreement to be legitimate, it must include mutual agreement, complete rent payment, and possession, all of which are absent in this particular situation. If a rental contract was not signed and the plaintiff did not meet their responsibilities, they have no grounds to assert tenancy.Part performance by the transferee is necessary for Section 53A of theTransfer of Property Act(doctrine of part performance) to be applicable. The plaintiff is not eligible for protection under this section since he did not fulfill his obligations in the contract.A true owner is typically not allowed to be subjected to an injunction. You can challenge the plaintiff's effort to prevent you from managing your own property with an ex-parte order. You can find support from the ruling of the Supreme Court in Karnataka Board of Wakf v. Government of India (2004) 10 SCC 779, which affirmed that a tenant or claimant without legal possession or agreement cannot seek injunction against the rightful owner.An unmarked complaint is also not considered legitimate according to Order VI Rule 14 of the CPC, 1908, which requires pleadings to be signed by the party or their authorized agent. Additionally, it should also be raised during arguments as it questions the validity.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Advance rental, defaulted to pay the agreed amount",
    "answer": "If the P claims that he is the lessee then he has to produce a registered lease deed since lease is a transfer of property and is compulsorily registrable u/s 17 of the registration, unless his claim is that the lease was granted to him on month to month basis for which a registered lease deed is not requiredThe P cannot obviously ask for the relief of permanent injunction. His claim is that of a lessee and not of an owner. So the actual owner can never be permanently injuncted in respect of his own property since the lessor owner has a right of re entry in the demised property upon breach of the lease conditions and also has a reversionary interest in the leased propertyThus the suit so far it seeks the relief of a permanent injunction against the owner is not maintainableHowever I assume that there is a pending application under order 7 rule 11 regarding rejection of the plaint /maintainability of suit. However a 7/11 application can only be tried based on averments in the plaint and not considering defense of defendant. So the court may hold that the suit will have to await a trial and may not reject the plaint at the thresholdHowever if the So called lessee has not sought for relief of possession then seeking a declaration of his alleged leasehold rights without seeking relief of possession,  is unheard of , as no tenant would only be interested in a mere paper declaration about his lease right without actual physical possession of the leased property. Thus the suit can be attacked under 7/11 clause a , that is, there is no cause of action in favor of P.It appears that relief of possession is omitted to be sought in order to save court fee which is payable on the market value of the subject propertyAlso If the P omits to sue in respect of the relief of possession,  then without leave of the court,  he cannot sue in future for such relief of possession (just check Order 2 of cpc)I suggest you file a counter claim in the P's suit under Order 8 Rule 6A for a declaration that you are in lawful possession and for a negative declaration that the Property was never agreed to be let to the P on lease basis.

    "question": "Advance rental, defaulted to pay the agreed amount",
    "answer": "Based on the facts provided, here is an expert legal analysis and advice:1. Maintainability of the Suit:The plaintiff's suit seeking a decree of declaration to establish him as a lessee and for permanent injunction against the defendant (owner) appears to be not maintainable. The following legal principles support this position:a) A person cannot be declared a tenant or lessee without a valid lease deed and without being put in possession of the property .b) A mere agreement to lease or an incomplete transaction does not create a lease or tenancy .c) A suit for permanent injunction against the true owner restraining him from dealing with his property is not maintainable.2. Unsigned Plaint:As per Order VI Rule 14 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, every pleading (including the plaint) must be signed by the party and their pleader. An unsigned plaint is a defective plaint and can be rejected under Order VII Rule 11 of CPC.3. Advance Payment and Receipt:The fact that the plaintiff paid an advance of Rs. 3,00,000/- and was issued a receipt mentioning it as an advance and part payment, does not automatically create a lease or tenancy. It merely shows an intention to enter into a lease agreement, which did not materialize due to the plaintiff's failure to pay the balance amount and sign the rent agreement.4. Suggested Arguments:Based on the above legal principles and case laws, you can argue the following points:a) The suit is not maintainable as the plaintiff cannot be declared a lessee or tenant without a valid lease deed and without being put in possession of the property.b) The mere payment of an advance and issuance of a receipt does not create a lease or tenancy, as the essential requirements of a valid lease agreement were not fulfilled.c) The suit for permanent injunction against the true owner restraining him from dealing with his property is not maintainable.d) The plaint itself is defective and liable to be rejected as it is unsigned, violating Order VI Rule 14 of CPC.e) The ex-parte order passed by the court restraining the creation of third-party rights is unsustainable in law, as the plaintiff has no legal right or interest in the property.It is advisable to file a comprehensive written statement raising these objections and citing relevant case laws to support your arguments. Additionally, you may consider filing an application under Order VII Rule 11 of CPC for rejection of the plaint on the ground of being unsigned and legally untenable.Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "question": "Advance rental, defaulted to pay the agreed amount",
    "answer": "Dear Client,With respect to civil suit filed against you by the plaintiff seeking a declaration as a lessee and a permanent injunction, on this one, it clear that the suit is not actionable at law or in equity because the plaintiff does not seek possession of the property and cannot therefore be regarded as a lessee under a valid lease agreement. Thus payment of an advance does not make the person a lessee as according to the Indian Contract act, 1872 there exists certain ingredients for making the contract a valid one. In addition, ensure a point is made to the effect that a permanent injunction cannot be passed against the person who is the real owner of the property under the Specific Relief Act 1963. The issues of filing a counter-claim for damages in contract as well as the legal implication of this legal case is discussed. The aspect of a Contract under the license agreement following the Indian Contract Act Section 2(h), Section 10 and Section 73, the determination of the Proprietary Right, Section 105 ofTransfer of Property Act, Section 106 of the same act, Section 117, The Remedy of Rescission by delivering up the thing and compensation Section 37 of Specific Relief Act, and Section 38 of Specific Relief Act.Hope you find this answer suitable for resolving you query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Advance rental, defaulted to pay the agreed amount",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The Supreme Court has not held that a receipt is no agreement but what has been settled law that a receipt alone will not amount to an agreement unless the receipt and terms contained in it constitute an agreement under the India Contract Act, 1872. In Asha John Divianathan v. In Vikram Malhotra (2021) the Supreme Court has made it very clear that where RBI permission is necessary for a transaction, it cannot be enforced without permission although the sender has given a mere receipt, this means where legal formalities have to be complied with they cannot be displaced by a mere acknowledgment. Additionally, in the principles outlined in N.N. Global Mercantile Pvt. Ltd. v. Indo Unique Flame Ltd. (2021) it is equally true that the unstamped document cannot be accorded the legal enforceability and therefore cannot be substituted by a receipt alone. It advisable to make sure that every legal requirement for enforcing the agreement as a contract has been complied with the provisions of the Indian Contract Act.Hope you find this answer helpful in resolving your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In any case, your court marriage in the UK is valid under the Hindu law even if not registered in India but the marriage must have been solemnized according to the Hindu customs.  The failure to include this may lead to some complications with your legal ability especially when planning to undergo a divorce. The Indian law on divorce is based onHindu Marriage Actof 1955 and you can have the marriage dissolved whether or not it was celebrated in India. This marriage should not make prenuptial agreement an unenforceable agreement, though there might be such legal problem in India. Of course, you could have rights as a spouse pending maintenance and property division claim, although such rights may not be expressly as certain as when one registers. These matters should therefore be handled by a family law attorney knowledgeable in both the UK and the Indian law systems.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Married in the UK but husband doesn’t want to marry in India",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the event of divorce, Indian courts, even though your prenuptial agreement waives alimony or maintenance in the UK, are not bound to respect such agreements under Indian law. Prenuptial agreements are not specifically recognized under India as defined in any relevant laws and cannot be enforced in the way they have been derogated from their statutory rights of a spouse. Even in India, you may file for divorce, but you can still claim alimony or maintenance under Section 25 of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, or Section 125 of theCriminal Procedure Code, 1973, irrespective of the terms of the prenuptial agreement. Indian courts would evaluate the matter concerning fairness and justice and would take all points relating to financial dependency and contributions into account.However, if divorce proceedings are initiated within the UK territory and the court has jurisdiction over the couple also, Indian courts may even hold up for the UK proceedings. In the end, it would depend upon such law prevailing in the jurisdiction where the divorce is filed as to how that should be dealt with.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Advance rental, defaulted to pay the agreed amount",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I would like to inform you that,In your situation, a request to declare the plaintiff as a tenant without a rental agreement or occupation cannot be considered. In order for a lease agreement to be legitimate, it must include mutual agreement, complete rent payment, and possession, all of which are absent in this particular situation. If a rental contract was not signed and the plaintiff did not meet their responsibilities, they have no grounds to assert tenancy.Part performance by the transferee is necessary for Section 53A of theTransfer of Property Act(doctrine of part performance) to be applicable. The plaintiff is not eligible for protection under this section since he did not fulfill his obligations in the contract.A true owner is typically not allowed to be subjected to an injunction. You can challenge the plaintiff's effort to prevent you from managing your own property with an ex-parte order. You can find support from the ruling of the Supreme Court in Karnataka Board of Wakf v. Government of India (2004) 10 SCC 779, which affirmed that a tenant or claimant without legal possession or agreement cannot seek injunction against the rightful owner.An unmarked complaint is also not considered legitimate according to Order VI Rule 14 of the CPC, 1908, which requires pleadings to be signed by the party or their authorized agent. Additionally, it should also be raised during arguments as it questions the validity.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Advance rental, defaulted to pay the agreed amount",
    "answer": "If the P claims that he is the lessee then he has to produce a registered lease deed since lease is a transfer of property and is compulsorily registrable u/s 17 of the registration, unless his claim is that the lease was granted to him on month to month basis for which a registered lease deed is not requiredThe P cannot obviously ask for the relief of permanent injunction. His claim is that of a lessee and not of an owner. So the actual owner can never be permanently injuncted in respect of his own property since the lessor owner has a right of re entry in the demised property upon breach of the lease conditions and also has a reversionary interest in the leased propertyThus the suit so far it seeks the relief of a permanent injunction against the owner is not maintainableHowever I assume that there is a pending application under order 7 rule 11 regarding rejection of the plaint /maintainability of suit. However a 7/11 application can only be tried based on averments in the plaint and not considering defense of defendant. So the court may hold that the suit will have to await a trial and may not reject the plaint at the thresholdHowever if the So called lessee has not sought for relief of possession then seeking a declaration of his alleged leasehold rights without seeking relief of possession,  is unheard of , as no tenant would only be interested in a mere paper declaration about his lease right without actual physical possession of the leased property. Thus the suit can be attacked under 7/11 clause a , that is, there is no cause of action in favor of P.It appears that relief of possession is omitted to be sought in order to save court fee which is payable on the market value of the subject propertyAlso If the P omits to sue in respect of the relief of possession,  then without leave of the court,  he cannot sue in future for such relief of possession (just check Order 2 of cpc)I suggest you file a counter claim in the P's suit under Order 8 Rule 6A for a declaration that you are in lawful possession and for a negative declaration that the Property was never agreed to be let to the P on lease basis. As you are in possession,  no court fee is payable except nominal court fee for relief of declarationYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Advance rental, defaulted to pay the agreed amount",
    "answer": "Based on the facts provided, here is an expert legal analysis and advice:1. Maintainability of the Suit:The plaintiff's suit seeking a decree of declaration to establish him as a lessee and for permanent injunction against the defendant (owner) appears to be not maintainable. The following legal principles support this position:a) A person cannot be declared a tenant or lessee without a valid lease deed and without being put in possession of the property .b) A mere agreement to lease or an incomplete transaction does not create a lease or tenancy .c) A suit for permanent injunction against the true owner restraining him from dealing with his property is not maintainable.2. Unsigned Plaint:As per Order VI Rule 14 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, every pleading (including the plaint) must be signed by the party and their pleader. An unsigned plaint is a defective plaint and can be rejected under Order VII Rule 11 of CPC.3. Advance Payment and Receipt:The fact that the plaintiff paid an advance of Rs. 3,00,000/- and was issued a receipt mentioning it as an advance and part payment, does not automatically create a lease or tenancy. It merely shows an intention to enter into a lease agreement, which did not materialize due to the plaintiff's failure to pay the balance amount and sign the rent agreement.4. Suggested Arguments:Based on the above legal principles and case laws, you can argue the following points:a) The suit is not maintainable as the plaintiff cannot be declared a lessee or tenant without a valid lease deed and without being put in possession of the property.b) The mere payment of an advance and issuance of a receipt does not create a lease or tenancy, as the essential requirements of a valid lease agreement were not fulfilled.c) The suit for permanent injunction against the true owner restraining him from dealing with his property is not maintainable.d) The plaint itself is defective and liable to be rejected as it is unsigned, violating Order VI Rule 14 of CPC.e) The ex-parte order passed by the court restraining the creation of third-party rights is unsustainable in law, as the plaintiff has no legal right or interest in the property.It is advisable to file a comprehensive written statement raising these objections and citing relevant case laws to support your arguments. Additionally, you may consider filing an application under Order VII Rule 11 of CPC for rejection of the plaint on the ground of being unsigned and legally untenable.Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "question": "Advance rental, defaulted to pay the agreed amount",
    "answer": "Dear Client,With respect to civil suit filed against you by the plaintiff seeking a declaration as a lessee and a permanent injunction, on this one, it clear that the suit is not actionable at law or in equity because the plaintiff does not seek possession of the property and cannot therefore be regarded as a lessee under a valid lease agreement. Thus payment of an advance does not make the person a lessee as according to the Indian Contract act, 1872 there exists certain ingredients for making the contract a valid one. In addition, ensure a point is made to the effect that a permanent injunction cannot be passed against the person who is the real owner of the property under the Specific Relief Act 1963. The issues of filing a counter-claim for damages in contract as well as the legal implication of this legal case is discussed. The aspect of a Contract under the license agreement following the Indian Contract Act Section 2(h), Section 10 and Section 73, the determination of the Proprietary Right, Section 105 ofTransfer of Property Act, Section 106 of the same act, Section 117, The Remedy of Rescission by delivering up the thing and compensation Section 37 of Specific Relief Act, and Section 38 of Specific Relief Act.Hope you find this answer suitable for resolving you query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Advance rental, defaulted to pay the agreed amount",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The Supreme Court has not held that a receipt is no agreement but what has been settled law that a receipt alone will not amount to an agreement unless the receipt and terms contained in it constitute an agreement under the India Contract Act, 1872. In Asha John Divianathan v. In Vikram Malhotra (2021) the Supreme Court has made it very clear that where RBI permission is necessary for a transaction, it cannot be enforced without permission although the sender has given a mere receipt, this means where legal formalities have to be complied with they cannot be displaced by a mere acknowledgment. Additionally, in the principles outlined in N.N. Global Mercantile Pvt. Ltd. v. Indo Unique Flame Ltd. (2021) it is equally true that the unstamped document cannot be accorded the legal enforceability and therefore cannot be substituted by a receipt alone. It advisable to make sure that every legal requirement for enforcing the agreement as a contract has been complied with the provisions of the Indian Contract Act.Hope you find this answer helpful in resolving your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Wife files a false 498a case as FIR, false DVC, MC for sake of maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case it is possible that you may have to pay maintenance during theDomestic Violence(DV) proceedings though your wife may be levelling baseless allegations. Your wife will be able to claim from your income of ₹ 90,000 or any reasonable amount minus the medical bills. While the DV case might be false, and may change maintenance obligations if proven so, it does not necessarily remove you from paying unless a court allows it to do so. As for making home dues, since your wife is capable of earning but decide not to work then this too can be taken to court to try and reduce her maintenance claim. Furthermore, an act can be an act of cruelty in terms of Section 13(1)(ia) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 where false allegations have been made. Once you prove that the allegations made by her are false you can file a defamation case undersection 354of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (previously, Section 499 IPC) or can lodge a complaint under section 246 of BNS (Previously, Section 211 of IPC) for filing a false case. For these legal issues, you should consult a family law attorney to assist you on the matter to avoid further complications.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Wife files a false 498a case as FIR, false DVC, MC for sake of maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queries1. In the case ofDomestic Violence, if your wife produces before the court photographs of bruises, then that may be taken into consideration, but she has to prove that such injuries have been given to her by you. Mere photographs cannot prove anything against a person, therefore, there is scope for argument against such evidence.2. In cases of maintenance, prima facie evidence may be permitted by the court even without any proper investigation, and an order for interim maintenance can be passed by the judge. You will have to pay maintenance even if you prove her allegations of default to be false, but the amount may be reduced or even disallowed by the court as per its estimation of her needs and your ability to pay.3. If you can show your wife is capable of earning -- by showing past work as a beautician or education -- the court may remit or refuse to award maintenance. The courts, in general, are reluctant to award maintenance if wife has deliberately avoided employment with the sole intention of claiming maintenance.4. Maintenance amount is usually computed on your income and not your parent's. If your monthly salary is ₹90,000 and you have heavy financial commitments like loan repayments or medical and legal charges, the court is likely to consider all these points while deciding an amount for you. The figure can range between 20-30% of your net income with deductions.5. If allegations prove untrue, one could prohibit future maintenance but could not recover past payments.6.a) A police can even file an FIR without investigation in false cases. b) Maintenance can also be granted in false cases. c) Husband protection laws are lesser but exist.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Wife files a false 498a case as FIR, false DVC, MC for sake of maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queries,1. Your child and second wife's case: Visiting your child will not add to complication in the 498A case filed against you by your second wife. This is because child visitation rights are separate, cannot be tagged with that kind of case.2. Right to visit your child: You have the right to visit your child at home or at school, other than that allowed by the conditions of a court order. Hostile behavior by the family of your first wife can be legally controlled through the enforcement of your visitation rights.3. Rights to visit your child: Regardless of whether you ever remarry, nothing impacts on the rights to visit your child from the previous marriage.4. False enrollment in land registration: In case there have been forged engravings in your wife's and father-in-law's land registration you may file a complaint against them. However, the legal significance to your case depends on how you word it legally.5. Income proof: Gather evidence that she earns her money by sending business advertisements and photographs or even client feedback. You can present these in court to prove that she is indeed capable of earning.6. Effect of acting in court: lllCourts do not rely on acting. If your wife cannot properly present her evidence, her exaggerated claims are likely to fall.

    "question": "Non-consummation of marriage, admittance of marriage under pressure",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the case you have described, the wife's rejection to consummate her marriage and her statement that she was married against her will by her parents can be grounds for an annulment. According to Section 12(1)(a) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, a marriage is annulled when it has not been consummated with the intention or willful refusal of the other spouse. Moreover, if she had a marriage sullenly induced against her will, that too might be a ground for annulment under Section 12(1)(c) because of a lack of free consent.To get this marriage annulled, your brother has to file a petition in the family court and present proof that it hasn't been consummated with her and has no intention of fulfilling marital duties. Whatever be the case, her parents' silence is immaterial to the case, since the case involves only the couple. The court will study circumstances and determine if the marriage can be declared voidable. Since this marriage isn't consummated, there's more chances of a successful annulment petition.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "- As per Supreme Court judgment, wife is expected to move in with the relatives of their husbands, follow the rules and customs of their home, and ideally, blend in seamlessly as a new daughter.- Further, the court granted divorce to a man on the grounds of “cruelty” after his wife refused to share a home with her in-laws.- Further, If wife is not supporting her husband for the enjoyment of life and denying relation, then the husband can get divorce after filing a divorce petition before the court on this ground.- Further, As per Delhi High Court, physical intimacy is an essential aspect of marriage and a wife's continuous refusal to have such relationship with her husband can be a ground for divorce,- Further, under section 12(1)(a) ofHindu Marriage Act, non consummation of marriage is a ground of divorce and annulment of marriage .- Since, the marriage is not consummated then your brother can file a petition before the family court for declaring the marriage as null and void.-  However , the petition for annulment should be presented within one year after the marriage .Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Suit for permanent injunction restraining interference vs injunction against alienation",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I want to let you know that,It is permissible under Indian law to bring two different suits based on the same subject matter if the relief sought in each is different and not barred by the principles of res judicata as applied by a competent court (Section 11, Code of Civil Procedure,1908). Since your suit is on permanent injunction restraining interference, whereas the counter claim by defendants involves an averment that the property is an ancestral one, if they give rise to different questions of law each may be allowed to proceed with the court dealing with each case on their respective merits.With regard to the contention of the defendants that the property is an ancestral one, a registered sale deed as in the case of acquisition made by your grandfather in the year 1944 would certainly break the chain. This would mean your mother bought the property as self-acquired, not ancestral. A father can sell property to his daughter by way of executing a sale deed, if it is his self-acquired property, and the rules are stipulated under Section 54 of theTransfer of Property Act, 1882. It has been held in a series of judgments by the courts that once the property is acquired by purchase, it cannot be termed as ancestral property (See S. Sai Reddy v. S. Narayana Reddy, AIR 1991 SC 2086).You could represent yourself under Order III Rule 1 of the CPC, whereby parties are allowed to represent themselves. To adequately represent, ensure you have all documentary evidence, be it a sale deed, and prepare to argue on facts and legal principles, more so on the point of whether the property is ancestral or self-acquired.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "- As per Muslim Law, there is no distinction between the self acquired or ancestral property.- Further, AMuslim is allowed to give away his entire property, whether the property is self acquired or ancestral, during his lifetimeby gift, but only one-third of the total property can be bequeathedby WILL.- Since, your mother acquired the property by way of registered sale deed, then she was having her right to transfer the same by way of gift deed to anyone- Further, as there is a registered sale deed in favor of mother , then it cannot be challenged after the demise of her father.- Yes, two cases can be filed on the same subject matter if the cause of action is different, however, two suits touching the same cause of action is not maintainable.- If the property is self acquired property of the father , then he has right to sell it to any person including daughter without the consent of others.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

The requirement is that you will need to spend around two weeks in Denmark and provide such documents as, respectively, valid passports and certificate of no impediment to marriage. Once married, the marriage will be legal, enabling the Spousal Immigrant Visa process which is normally fourteen months. If you prefer waiting in Poland or in India, it is possible, but it is necessary to meet the demands of U.S immigration services regarding residency in this country. As much as possible, stay clear of misconceptions surrounding documents in both the marriage and visa process. Proper paperwork is essential in this process.

The NOC from the US Embassy in Delhi for marriage is usually accepted by the marriage registrars, but it is advisable to clear this by consulting the marriage registrar that you intend to use. Besides the papers you mentioned (passport, visa, birth certificates, proof of address, single status affidavit, notice of intended marriage, photographs, witnesses, NOC, divorce certificate), it is possible you may be required to produce your self-attested proof of date of birth, proof of your residence in the district for at least thirty days and two affidavits proving that you two are not related in a manner prohibited by the law. Marriage registrars can be consulted as well as a legal advisor in order to meet all the legal formalities for the registration.Hope you find this answer suitable for resolving you query.Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queries1. Affidavit of marital status: Yes, this can be obtained from any notary public in India, but these must be authenticated by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), and even authenticated by the county's embassy where the marriage is going to take place.2. NOC issued from the U.S. Embassy in Delhi: The NOC issued from the U.S. Embassy, Delhi, will establish marital status on the part of your fiancé. However, it may not be acceptable everywhere and acceptance may depend on the local rules in the court or the marriage registrar of the region. You are therefore requested to obtain the local rules of the marriage registrar.3. Documents The list of documents accepted includes, to a large extent, the following: Passport, Visa, Birth Certificate, Proof of Address, Single Status Affidavit, Notice of Intended Marriage, Photographs, Witnesses, NOC and Divorce Certificate, if the applicant has been divorced.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the event of divorce, Indian courts, even though your prenuptial agreement waives alimony or maintenance in the UK, are not bound to respect such agreements under Indian law. Prenuptial agreements are not specifically recognized under India as defined in any relevant laws and cannot be enforced in the way they have been derogated from their statutory rights of a spouse. Even in India, you may file for divorce, but you can still claim alimony or maintenance under Section 25 of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, or Section 125 of theCriminal Procedure Code, 1973, irrespective of the terms of the prenuptial agreement. Indian courts would evaluate the matter concerning fairness and justice and would take all points relating to financial dependency and contributions into account.However, if divorce proceedings are initiated within the UK territory and the court has jurisdiction over the couple also, Indian courts may even hold up for the UK proceedings. In the end, it would depend upon such law prevailing in the jurisdiction where the divorce is filed as to how that should be dealt with.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Claiming agricultural land after 16 years",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You have legal basis to contest the fraudulent transfer of the property from your grandmother because your father never signed for the transfer made by your uncle. TheTransfer of Property Act, 1882 also states that every transfer made with the intention to defraud the heirs is voidable under section 52. In Telangana you may approach a civil court for a declaratory relief and recovery of property seeking relief on the ground that the transfers made by your father to his brother’s daughters are unlawful. Even though, the act was passed 16 years ago, it may be possible to use the Section 17 of the Limitation Act, 1963 to request the extension of limitation period if the accused did not know about the fraud until now. Procuring the services of a lawyer in property matters is the right step to take in order to be in a safer position as far as the property is concerned.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Non-consummation of marriage, admittance of marriage under pressure",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the case you have described, the wife's rejection to consummate her marriage and her statement that she was married against her will by her parents can be grounds for an annulment. According to Section 12(1)(a) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, a marriage is annulled when it has not been consummated with the intention or willful refusal of the other spouse. Moreover, if she had a marriage sullenly induced against her will, that too might be a ground for annulment under Section 12(1)(c) because of a lack of free consent.To get this marriage annulled, your brother has to file a petition in the family court and present proof that it hasn't been consummated with her and has no intention of fulfilling marital duties. Whatever be the case, her parents' silence is immaterial to the case, since the case involves only the couple. The court will study circumstances and determine if the marriage can be declared voidable. Since this marriage isn't consummated, there's more chances of a successful annulment petition.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Suit for permanent injunction restraining interference vs injunction against alienation",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I want to let you know that,It is permissible under Indian law to bring two different suits based on the same subject matter if the relief sought in each is different and not barred by the principles of res judicata as applied by a competent court (Section 11, Code of Civil Procedure,1908). Since your suit is on permanent injunction restraining interference, whereas the counter claim by defendants involves an averment that the property is an ancestral one, if they give rise to different questions of law each may be allowed to proceed with the court dealing with each case on their respective merits.With regard to the contention of the defendants that the property is an ancestral one, a registered sale deed as in the case of acquisition made by your grandfather in the year 1944 would certainly break the chain. This would mean your mother bought the property as self-acquired, not ancestral. A father can sell property to his daughter by way of executing a sale deed, if it is his self-acquired property, and the rules are stipulated under Section 54 of theTransfer of Property Act, 1882. It has been held in a series of judgments by the courts that once the property is acquired by purchase, it cannot be termed as ancestral property (See S. Sai Reddy v. S. Narayana Reddy, AIR 1991 SC 2086).You could represent yourself under Order III Rule 1 of the CPC, whereby parties are allowed to represent themselves. To adequately represent, ensure you have all documentary evidence, be it a sale deed, and prepare to argue on facts and legal principles, more so on the point of whether the property is ancestral or self-acquired.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The Indian law does not mandate the writing and  registration of an agreement to sell property but it is advisable that such an agreement be in writing and or registered because an unregistered document may not be acted upon by courts of law. The statement of sale by means of an agreement to sell does not even vest the title of the property to the buyer, it simply lays down detailed provisions of a sale. Title to the property passes only by operation of a sale deed, as per Section 54 of theTransfer of Property Act1882. For this reason, the sale deed should be prepared and needful to register legally so that the title of property gets transferred appropriately.

    "question": "Wife files a false 498a case as FIR, false DVC, MC for sake of maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case it is possible that you may have to pay maintenance during theDomestic Violence(DV) proceedings though your wife may be levelling baseless allegations. Your wife will be able to claim from your income of ₹ 90,000 or any reasonable amount minus the medical bills. While the DV case might be false, and may change maintenance obligations if proven so, it does not necessarily remove you from paying unless a court allows it to do so. As for making home dues, since your wife is capable of earning but decide not to work then this too can be taken to court to try and reduce her maintenance claim. Furthermore, an act can be an act of cruelty in terms of Section 13(1)(ia) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 where false allegations have been made. Once you prove that the allegations made by her are false you can file a defamation case undersection 354of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (previously, Section 499 IPC) or can lodge a complaint under section 246 of BNS (Previously, Section 211 of IPC) for filing a false case. For these legal issues, you should consult a family law attorney to assist you on the matter to avoid further complications.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Wife files a false 498a case as FIR, false DVC, MC for sake of maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queries1. In the case ofDomestic Violence, if your wife produces before the court photographs of bruises, then that may be taken into consideration, but she has to prove that such injuries have been given to her by you. Mere photographs cannot prove anything against a person, therefore, there is scope for argument against such evidence.2. In cases of maintenance, prima facie evidence may be permitted by the court even without any proper investigation, and an order for interim maintenance can be passed by the judge. You will have to pay maintenance even if you prove her allegations of default to be false, but the amount may be reduced or even disallowed by the court as per its estimation of her needs and your ability to pay.3. If you can show your wife is capable of earning -- by showing past work as a beautician or education -- the court may remit or refuse to award maintenance. The courts, in general, are reluctant to award maintenance if wife has deliberately avoided employment with the sole intention of claiming maintenance.4. Maintenance amount is usually computed on your income and not your parent's. If your monthly salary is ₹90,000 and you have heavy financial commitments like loan repayments or medical and legal charges, the court is likely to consider all these points while deciding an amount for you. The figure can range between 20-30% of your net income with deductions.5. If allegations prove untrue, one could prohibit future maintenance but could not recover past payments.6.a) A police can even file an FIR without investigation in false cases. b) Maintenance can also be granted in false cases. c) Husband protection laws are lesser but exist.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Wife files a false 498a case as FIR, false DVC, MC for sake of maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queries,1. Your child and second wife's case: Visiting your child will not add to complication in the 498A case filed against you by your second wife. This is because child visitation rights are separate, cannot be tagged with that kind of case.2. Right to visit your child: You have the right to visit your child at home or at school, other than that allowed by the conditions of a court order. Hostile behavior by the family of your first wife can be legally controlled through the enforcement of your visitation rights.3. Rights to visit your child: Regardless of whether you ever remarry, nothing impacts on the rights to visit your child from the previous marriage.4. False enrollment in land registration: In case there have been forged engravings in your wife's and father-in-law's land registration you may file a complaint against them. However, the legal significance to your case depends on how you word it legally.5. Income proof: Gather evidence that she earns her money by sending business advertisements and photographs or even client feedback. You can present these in court to prove that she is indeed capable of earning.6. Effect of acting in court: lllCourts do not rely on acting. If your wife cannot properly present her evidence, her exaggerated claims are likely to fall. Make sure you have good, factual evidence to defend yourself with.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Wife files a false 498a case as FIR, false DVC, MC for sake of maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case it is possible that you may have to pay maintenance during theDomestic Violence(DV) proceedings though your wife may be levelling baseless allegations. Your wife will be able to claim from your income of ₹ 90,000 or any reasonable amount minus the medical bills. While the DV case might be false, and may change maintenance obligations if proven so, it does not necessarily remove you from paying unless a court allows it to do so. As for making home dues, since your wife is capable of earning but decide not to work then this too can be taken to court to try and reduce her maintenance claim. Furthermore, an act can be an act of cruelty in terms of Section 13(1)(ia) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 where false allegations have been made. Once you prove that the allegations made by her are false you can file a defamation case undersection 354of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (previously, Section 499 IPC) or can lodge a complaint under section 246 of BNS (Previously, Section 211 of IPC) for filing a false case. For these legal issues, you should consult a family law attorney to assist you on the matter to avoid further complications.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Wife files a false 498a case as FIR, false DVC, MC for sake of maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queries1. In the case ofDomestic Violence, if your wife produces before the court photographs of bruises, then that may be taken into consideration, but she has to prove that such injuries have been given to her by you. Mere photographs cannot prove anything against a person, therefore, there is scope for argument against such evidence.2. In cases of maintenance, prima facie evidence may be permitted by the court even without any proper investigation, and an order for interim maintenance can be passed by the judge. You will have to pay maintenance even if you prove her allegations of default to be false, but the amount may be reduced or even disallowed by the court as per its estimation of her needs and your ability to pay.3. If you can show your wife is capable of earning -- by showing past work as a beautician or education -- the court may remit or refuse to award maintenance. The courts, in general, are reluctant to award maintenance if wife has deliberately avoided employment with the sole intention of claiming maintenance.4. Maintenance amount is usually computed on your income and not your parent's. If your monthly salary is ₹90,000 and you have heavy financial commitments like loan repayments or medical and legal charges, the court is likely to consider all these points while deciding an amount for you. The figure can range between 20-30% of your net income with deductions.5. If allegations prove untrue, one could prohibit future maintenance but could not recover past payments.6.a) A police can even file an FIR without investigation in false cases. b) Maintenance can also be granted in false cases. c) Husband protection laws are lesser but exist.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Wife files a false 498a case as FIR, false DVC, MC for sake of maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queries,1. Your child and second wife's case: Visiting your child will not add to complication in the 498A case filed against you by your second wife. This is because child visitation rights are separate, cannot be tagged with that kind of case.2. Right to visit your child: You have the right to visit your child at home or at school, other than that allowed by the conditions of a court order. Hostile behavior by the family of your first wife can be legally controlled through the enforcement of your visitation rights.3. Rights to visit your child: Regardless of whether you ever remarry, nothing impacts on the rights to visit your child from the previous marriage.4. False enrollment in land registration: In case there have been forged engravings in your wife's and father-in-law's land registration you may file a complaint against them. However, the legal significance to your case depends on how you word it legally.5. Income proof: Gather evidence that she earns her money by sending business advertisements and photographs or even client feedback. You can present these in court to prove that she is indeed capable of earning.6. Effect of acting in court: lllCourts do not rely on acting. If your wife cannot properly present her evidence, her exaggerated claims are likely to fall. Make sure you have good, factual evidence to defend yourself with.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

TheTransfer of Property Act, 1882 also states that every transfer made with the intention to defraud the heirs is voidable under section 52. In Telangana you may approach a civil court for a declaratory relief and recovery of property seeking relief on the ground that the transfers made by your father to his brother’s daughters are unlawful. Even though, the act was passed 16 years ago, it may be possible to use the Section 17 of the Limitation Act, 1963 to request the extension of limitation period if the accused did not know about the fraud until now. Procuring the services of a lawyer in property matters is the right step to take in order to be in a safer position as far as the property is concerned.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Non-consummation of marriage, admittance of marriage under pressure",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the case you have described, the wife's rejection to consummate her marriage and her statement that she was married against her will by her parents can be grounds for an annulment. According to Section 12(1)(a) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, a marriage is annulled when it has not been consummated with the intention or willful refusal of the other spouse. Moreover, if she had a marriage sullenly induced against her will, that too might be a ground for annulment under Section 12(1)(c) because of a lack of free consent.To get this marriage annulled, your brother has to file a petition in the family court and present proof that it hasn't been consummated with her and has no intention of fulfilling marital duties. Whatever be the case, her parents' silence is immaterial to the case, since the case involves only the couple. The court will study circumstances and determine if the marriage can be declared voidable. Since this marriage isn't consummated, there's more chances of a successful annulment petition.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The requirement is that you will need to spend around two weeks in Denmark and provide such documents as, respectively, valid passports and certificate of no impediment to marriage. Once married, the marriage will be legal, enabling the Spousal Immigrant Visa process which is normally fourteen months. If you prefer waiting in Poland or in India, it is possible, but it is necessary to meet the demands of U.S immigration services regarding residency in this country. As much as possible, stay clear of misconceptions surrounding documents in both the marriage and visa process. Proper paperwork is essential in this process. It is advisable to consult with an immigration lawyer to clarify these issues as you proceed with your further plans.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Foreign and Indian Citizen Marriage",
    "answer": "Dear Client,If a couple wants to marry under theSpecial Marriage Actin India then both parties can take the affidavit of non-availability from any notary in the country. The NOC from the US Embassy in Delhi for marriage is usually accepted by the marriage registrars, but it is advisable to clear this by consulting the marriage registrar that you intend to use. Besides the papers you mentioned (passport, visa, birth certificates, proof of address, single status affidavit, notice of intended marriage, photographs, witnesses, NOC, divorce certificate), it is possible you may be required to produce your self-attested proof of date of birth, proof of your residence in the district for at least thirty days and two affidavits proving that you two are not related in a manner prohibited by the law. Marriage registrars can be consulted as well as a legal advisor in order to meet all the legal formalities for the registration.Hope you find this answer suitable for resolving you query.Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queries1. Affidavit of marital status: Yes, this can be obtained from any notary public in India, but these must be authenticated by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), and even authenticated by the county's embassy where the marriage is going to take place.2. NOC issued from the U.S. Embassy in Delhi: The NOC issued from the U.S. Embassy, Delhi, will establish marital status on the part of your fiancé. However, it may not be acceptable everywhere and acceptance may depend on the local rules in the court or the marriage registrar of the region. You are therefore requested to obtain the local rules of the marriage registrar.3. Documents The list of documents accepted includes, to a large extent, the following: Passport, Visa, Birth Certificate, Proof of Address, Single Status Affidavit, Notice of Intended Marriage, Photographs, Witnesses, NOC and Divorce Certificate, if the applicant has been divorced.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Agreement to sale",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The Indian law does not mandate the writing and  registration of an agreement to sell property but it is advisable that such an agreement be in writing and or registered because an unregistered document may not be acted upon by courts of law. The statement of sale by means of an agreement to sell does not even vest the title of the property to the buyer, it simply lays down detailed provisions of a sale. Title to the property passes only by operation of a sale deed, as per Section 54 of theTransfer of Property Act1882. For this reason, the sale deed should be prepared and needful to register legally so that the title of property gets transferred appropriately. As for all these issues it is always advisable to consult a lawyer especially when in property related activities/businesses/transactions.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Marriage in Denmark is for you and for your fiancée is easy to get married in this country. The requirement is that you will need to spend around two weeks in Denmark and provide such documents as, respectively, valid passports and certificate of no impediment to marriage. Once married, the marriage will be legal, enabling the Spousal Immigrant Visa process which is normally fourteen months. If you prefer waiting in Poland or in India, it is possible, but it is necessary to meet the demands of U.S immigration services regarding residency in this country. As much as possible, stay clear of misconceptions surrounding documents in both the marriage and visa process. Proper paperwork is essential in this process. It is advisable to consult with an immigration lawyer to clarify these issues as you proceed with your further plans.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,If a couple wants to marry under theSpecial Marriage Actin India then both parties can take the affidavit of non-availability from any notary in the country. The NOC from the US Embassy in Delhi for marriage is usually accepted by the marriage registrars, but it is advisable to clear this by consulting the marriage registrar that you intend to use. Besides the papers you mentioned (passport, visa, birth certificates, proof of address, single status affidavit, notice of intended marriage, photographs, witnesses, NOC, divorce certificate), it is possible you may be required to produce your self-attested proof of date of birth, proof of your residence in the district for at least thirty days and two affidavits proving that you two are not related in a manner prohibited by the law. Marriage registrars can be consulted as well as a legal advisor in order to meet all the legal formalities for the registration.Hope you find this answer suitable for resolving you query.Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queries1. Affidavit of marital status: Yes, this can be obtained from any notary public in India, but these must be authenticated by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), and even authenticated by the county's embassy where the marriage is going to take place.2. NOC issued from the U.S. Embassy in Delhi: The NOC issued from the U.S. Embassy, Delhi, will establish marital status on the part of your fiancé. However, it may not be acceptable everywhere and acceptance may depend on the local rules in the court or the marriage registrar of the region. You are therefore requested to obtain the local rules of the marriage registrar.3. Documents The list of documents accepted includes, to a large extent, the following: Passport, Visa, Birth Certificate, Proof of Address, Single Status Affidavit, Notice of Intended Marriage, Photographs, Witnesses, NOC and Divorce Certificate, if the applicant has been divorced.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The Indian law does not mandate the writing and  registration of an agreement to sell property but it is advisable that such an agreement be in writing and or registered because an unregistered document may not be acted upon by courts of law. The statement of sale by means of an agreement to sell does not even vest the title of the property to the buyer, it simply lays down detailed provisions of a sale. Title to the property passes only by operation of a sale deed, as per Section 54 of theTransfer of Property Act1882. For this reason, the sale deed should be prepared and needful to register legally so that the title of property gets transferred appropriately.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Marriage in Denmark is for you and for your fiancée is easy to get married in this country. The requirement is that you will need to spend around two weeks in Denmark and provide such documents as, respectively, valid passports and certificate of no impediment to marriage. Once married, the marriage will be legal, enabling the Spousal Immigrant Visa process which is normally fourteen months. If you prefer waiting in Poland or in India, it is possible, but it is necessary to meet the demands of U.S immigration services regarding residency in this country. As much as possible, stay clear of misconceptions surrounding documents in both the marriage and visa process. Proper paperwork is essential in this process. It is advisable to consult with an immigration lawyer to clarify these issues as you proceed with your further plans.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The NOC from the US Embassy in Delhi for marriage is usually accepted by the marriage registrars, but it is advisable to clear this by consulting the marriage registrar that you intend to use. Besides the papers you mentioned (passport, visa, birth certificates, proof of address, single status affidavit, notice of intended marriage, photographs, witnesses, NOC, divorce certificate), it is possible you may be required to produce your self-attested proof of date of birth, proof of your residence in the district for at least thirty days and two affidavits proving that you two are not related in a manner prohibited by the law. Marriage registrars can be consulted as well as a legal advisor in order to meet all the legal formalities for the registration.Hope you find this answer suitable for resolving you query.Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queries1. Affidavit of marital status: Yes, this can be obtained from any notary public in India, but these must be authenticated by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), and even authenticated by the county's embassy where the marriage is going to take place.2. NOC issued from the U.S. Embassy in Delhi: The NOC issued from the U.S. Embassy, Delhi, will establish marital status on the part of your fiancé. However, it may not be acceptable everywhere and acceptance may depend on the local rules in the court or the marriage registrar of the region. You are therefore requested to obtain the local rules of the marriage registrar.3. Documents The list of documents accepted includes, to a large extent, the following: Passport, Visa, Birth Certificate, Proof of Address, Single Status Affidavit, Notice of Intended Marriage, Photographs, Witnesses, NOC and Divorce Certificate, if the applicant has been divorced.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The statement of sale by means of an agreement to sell does not even vest the title of the property to the buyer, it simply lays down detailed provisions of a sale. Title to the property passes only by operation of a sale deed, as per Section 54 of theTransfer of Property Act1882. For this reason, the sale deed should be prepared and needful to register legally so that the title of property gets transferred appropriately.

    "question": "No will - how to partition property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queriesUnder theHindu Succession Act, when a Hindu male dies intestate, then his property is divided equally among his Class I legal heirs which in your case are you, your mother and sister. You are, therefore, entitled to a one-third share in both the houses, regardless of whether your mother or sister are staying in one of them. In case you let go of the property to your mother, you will surrender your claim; therefore, it would not be easy raising your stake after some time. Technically, the law would have given her full ownership of the property.The property would otherwise be divided equally among the three of you. After having received her one third, your mother is free to gift or transfer her share to your sister, but this does not affect your right to your one third.Correspondingly, regarding your father's Provident Fund (PF), you are at par with a share in that amount as a Class I heir. If the PF has already been claimed by your mother and sister, you can demand to know the details of the amounts and take legal recourse to stake your claims if necessary.If they are trying to sell their holdings and are asking you to transfer your share to your mother, you should not do that without ensuring first that you are adequately compensated for your share or otherwise protected. A consultation with a lawyer would make sure your interests were looked after in all eventualities of transfer or sale agreements.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case it is possible that you may have to pay maintenance during theDomestic Violence(DV) proceedings though your wife may be levelling baseless allegations. Your wife will be able to claim from your income of ₹ 90,000 or any reasonable amount minus the medical bills. While the DV case might be false, and may change maintenance obligations if proven so, it does not necessarily remove you from paying unless a court allows it to do so. As for making home dues, since your wife is capable of earning but decide not to work then this too can be taken to court to try and reduce her maintenance claim. Furthermore, an act can be an act of cruelty in terms of Section 13(1)(ia) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 where false allegations have been made. Once you prove that the allegations made by her are false you can file a defamation case undersection 354of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (previously, Section 499 IPC) or can lodge a complaint under section 246 of BNS (Previously, Section 211 of IPC) for filing a false case.

    "question": "Wife files a false 498a case as FIR, false DVC, MC for sake of maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queries1. In the case ofDomestic Violence, if your wife produces before the court photographs of bruises, then that may be taken into consideration, but she has to prove that such injuries have been given to her by you. Mere photographs cannot prove anything against a person, therefore, there is scope for argument against such evidence.2. In cases of maintenance, prima facie evidence may be permitted by the court even without any proper investigation, and an order for interim maintenance can be passed by the judge. You will have to pay maintenance even if you prove her allegations of default to be false, but the amount may be reduced or even disallowed by the court as per its estimation of her needs and your ability to pay.3. If you can show your wife is capable of earning -- by showing past work as a beautician or education -- the court may remit or refuse to award maintenance. The courts, in general, are reluctant to award maintenance if wife has deliberately avoided employment with the sole intention of claiming maintenance.4. Maintenance amount is usually computed on your income and not your parent's. If your monthly salary is ₹90,000 and you have heavy financial commitments like loan repayments or medical and legal charges, the court is likely to consider all these points while deciding an amount for you. The figure can range between 20-30% of your net income with deductions.5. If allegations prove untrue, one could prohibit future maintenance but could not recover past payments.6.a) A police can even file an FIR without investigation in false cases. b) Maintenance can also be granted in false cases. c) Husband protection laws are lesser but exist.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Wife files a false 498a case as FIR, false DVC, MC for sake of maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queries,1. Your child and second wife's case: Visiting your child will not add to complication in the 498A case filed against you by your second wife. This is because child visitation rights are separate, cannot be tagged with that kind of case.2. Right to visit your child: You have the right to visit your child at home or at school, other than that allowed by the conditions of a court order. Hostile behavior by the family of your first wife can be legally controlled through the enforcement of your visitation rights.3. Rights to visit your child: Regardless of whether you ever remarry, nothing impacts on the rights to visit your child from the previous marriage.4. False enrollment in land registration: In case there have been forged engravings in your wife's and father-in-law's land registration you may file a complaint against them. However, the legal significance to your case depends on how you word it legally.5. Income proof: Gather evidence that she earns her money by sending business advertisements and photographs or even client feedback. You can present these in court to prove that she is indeed capable of earning.6. Effect of acting in court: lllCourts do not rely on acting. If your wife cannot properly present her evidence, her exaggerated claims are likely to fall. Make sure you have good, factual evidence to defend yourself with.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

TheTransfer of Property Act, 1882 also states that every transfer made with the intention to defraud the heirs is voidable under section 52. In Telangana you may approach a civil court for a declaratory relief and recovery of property seeking relief on the ground that the transfers made by your father to his brother’s daughters are unlawful. Even though, the act was passed 16 years ago, it may be possible to use the Section 17 of the Limitation Act, 1963 to request the extension of limitation period if the accused did not know about the fraud until now. Procuring the services of a lawyer in property matters is the right step to take in order to be in a safer position as far as the property is concerned.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Wife files a false 498a case as FIR, false DVC, MC for sake of maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case it is possible that you may have to pay maintenance during theDomestic Violence(DV) proceedings though your wife may be levelling baseless allegations. Your wife will be able to claim from your income of ₹ 90,000 or any reasonable amount minus the medical bills. While the DV case might be false, and may change maintenance obligations if proven so, it does not necessarily remove you from paying unless a court allows it to do so. As for making home dues, since your wife is capable of earning but decide not to work then this too can be taken to court to try and reduce her maintenance claim. Furthermore, an act can be an act of cruelty in terms of Section 13(1)(ia) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 where false allegations have been made. Once you prove that the allegations made by her are false you can file a defamation case undersection 354of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (previously, Section 499 IPC) or can lodge a complaint under section 246 of BNS (Previously, Section 211 of IPC) for filing a false case. For these legal issues, you should consult a family law attorney to assist you on the matter to avoid further complications.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Wife files a false 498a case as FIR, false DVC, MC for sake of maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queries1. In the case ofDomestic Violence, if your wife produces before the court photographs of bruises, then that may be taken into consideration, but she has to prove that such injuries have been given to her by you. Mere photographs cannot prove anything against a person, therefore, there is scope for argument against such evidence.2. In cases of maintenance, prima facie evidence may be permitted by the court even without any proper investigation, and an order for interim maintenance can be passed by the judge. You will have to pay maintenance even if you prove her allegations of default to be false, but the amount may be reduced or even disallowed by the court as per its estimation of her needs and your ability to pay.3. If you can show your wife is capable of earning -- by showing past work as a beautician or education -- the court may remit or refuse to award maintenance. The courts, in general, are reluctant to award maintenance if wife has deliberately avoided employment with the sole intention of claiming maintenance.4. Maintenance amount is usually computed on your income and not your parent's. If your monthly salary is ₹90,000 and you have heavy financial commitments like loan repayments or medical and legal charges, the court is likely to consider all these points while deciding an amount for you. The figure can range between 20-30% of your net income with deductions.5. If allegations prove untrue, one could prohibit future maintenance but could not recover past payments.6.a) A police can even file an FIR without investigation in false cases. b) Maintenance can also be granted in false cases. c) Husband protection laws are lesser but exist.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Wife files a false 498a case as FIR, false DVC, MC for sake of maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queries,1. Your child and second wife's case: Visiting your child will not add to complication in the 498A case filed against you by your second wife. This is because child visitation rights are separate, cannot be tagged with that kind of case.2. Right to visit your child: You have the right to visit your child at home or at school, other than that allowed by the conditions of a court order. Hostile behavior by the family of your first wife can be legally controlled through the enforcement of your visitation rights.3. Rights to visit your child: Regardless of whether you ever remarry, nothing impacts on the rights to visit your child from the previous marriage.4. False enrollment in land registration: In case there have been forged engravings in your wife's and father-in-law's land registration you may file a complaint against them. However, the legal significance to your case depends on how you word it legally.5. Income proof: Gather evidence that she earns her money by sending business advertisements and photographs or even client feedback. You can present these in court to prove that she is indeed capable of earning.6. Effect of acting in court: lllCourts do not rely on acting. If your wife cannot properly present her evidence, her exaggerated claims are likely to fall. Make sure you have good, factual evidence to defend yourself with.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,I want to let you know that,you are entitled to seek divorce on grounds of cruelty, even though you reside with your wife. Till now, you have been suffering from physical as well as mental cruelties. Section 13(1)(ia) defines cruelty to include both physical as well as mental. All the audio recordings of her shouting, threatening, and trying to hit your son can be used in evidence to prove your case.There is no such law that requires you to leave the house before filing for divorce. Living together will not make you ineligible to seek divorce, especially when your concern remains the welfare of your child. It may be that desertion for 6 months forms part of proving desertion advice by your lawyer; in this case, it is a case of cruelty instead of desertion.Regarding the question you have further sought clarification on, your wife has absolutely no rights on your parents' property or properties. As per Hindu law, she is not entitled to claim any rights over your parents' ancestral or personal properties considering the fact that they have been staying apart for 9 long years and did not care to get in touch with her. If she files any claims of this nature, your parents will likely be impleaded in that case but they will not automatically be liable. It would be a declaration of their non-involvement with court action.There is very crucial presentation of all the evidence for the case, and a sound family lawyer would be capable enough to help create a strong case.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Instead, a complaint under Section 246 of BNS may be filed against a party and their attorney for flagrantly false claims, falsifying facts, or misleading the court. Section 246 addresses what happens when someone makes a fraudulent or dishonest allegation in court that is known to be false or misleading with the intention of gaining unfair advantage or causing unfair damage. It may stipulate a fine and a maximum two-year sentence of incarceration. The same industrial court where the fraudulent submissions were submitted should hear the complaint. Furthermore, based on how terrible the acts are, a complaint may additionally lodged with the police for further investigation into possible offenses like cheating or fraud under other sections of BNS.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

No.2456/2017BETWEEN:Sri. Sandeep Bathija                                                       …..  PlaintiffANDSri. Mahesh Vasdev and others                                                …..  DefendantsA F F I D A V I TI, Sri. Mahesh Vashdev (Senior Citizen), S/o late T. Vashdev,  Aged about 71 years, Door No.118, 26th Cross, 6th Block, Jayanagar, Bengaluru – 560070, (Mob:[deleted]), do hereby state on oath as under:That I am defendant No.1 in this case as such know the full facts of this case. The plaintiff filed the present suit claiming himself as a co-sharer of the property and on the other hand claiming to the absolute owner of the suit schedule property. If at all he is co-owner he ought to have obtained consent of other co-owners by way of Power of Attorney before filing the suit. He entirely stated falsehood in his affidavit and also in his plaint which were declared by on ought as true and correct and also verified the plaint contents. Thus the very contrary contentions taken by the plaintiff in this case goes to show that he attempted to mislead this Hon’ble Court in order to grab illegal possession of suit schedule property.When false affidavit or false documents were given in any quasi judicial or administrative proceedings, then a private complaint can be filed U/s 200 before competent magistrate. The Plaintiff claims to be a co owner of the Property. The Plaintiff has filed a suit for property partition against his family hence the said property rights are not with clear Titles. The Plaintiff has not disclosed the truth.The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff submits that the 1 Defendant is a uncle. The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff has been tying a Rakhi to the wife of the 1 Defendant therefore the relationship changes. The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff has deliberately not disclosed the true fact.The deponent further states that, the lease agreement was not made with any favors. The deponent further states that, the lease agreement was drawn with a intention of generating a Revenue so as to meet the Legal expenditure of Property Settlements Suit and other expenses. The 1 Defendant has been paying Property taxes and Property maintenance charges from the day the Plaintiff has entrusted the authority to the 1Defendant. The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff has not disclosed to the Honourable Court with a intention of misleading the true facts.The Plaintiff claim that he has not received the security deposit of Rs.100000 is also false as the 1 Defendant had made a expense of the amount to get his wife a bail and providing a bond to the High Ground Police Station as she was involved in a Criminal Case.The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff statement stating that the Defendant 1 has not done anything is completely false. The Defendant 1 has arranged for the Plaintiff Funds for his lively hood and the main house for him to live undisturbed with complete privacy.The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff brother filled a police complaint against the Defendant as trespassing the said property. The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff made the Defendant file a suit for Injunction against his brother an himself.The Plaintiff voluntarily put a sub lease clause for the benefit of the Defendant No.1 as services rendered.The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff has never demanded any money as he knew that the Defendant No.1 is spending for his problems. As a matter of fact his wife has been taking funds from the Defendant No.1 from time to time for her Case against her mother in law. The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff has willingly extended the lease agreement on the ninth day of June 2014.The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff has no need for the property as he loves to live in his father house which is very dear to him in   remembrance of his late Father. The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff has executed a will in favour of the Defendant and also promised fifth percent of his share. He has promised in front of his Uncle and Aunty Mr. and Mrs. Beharilal Bathija when we went to attend a Marriage of his niece. Thus the conduct of the plaintiff invites criminal offences as such a criminal case as to be registered in view of documents available on record that is his own plaint and its verification and his other pleadings and affidavits. The entire documents and pleadings filed by the plaintiff and defendant No.1 shall be read as part of this affidavit.Thus it has been established the plaintiff mislead this Court for the purpose  of misleading the lawful authority thus plaintiff needs to be tried for the alleged offences which may be disclosed during the course of investigation and likely to disclose offences  u/s 191,193,195,199 of IPC, 1860and be punished accordingly.I, the above named deponent declares that the contents of this affidavit are true and correct to the best of my knowledge, belief and information.Identified by me                                                                                    DEPONENTAdvocatePlace: BengaluruDate:Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, BangaloreAvailable Now6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar NOW!"

    "question": "Rental issue",
    "answer": "Dear Client,For the renovation of the house and conversion of the electricity connection from residential to commercial, you can go ahead if the tenant has been evacuated already, or if you have a court order to do so. As you have recently provided the tenant with a final notice to quit the rented premises because of the current rental court case is close to being determined you have the authority to carry out the renovation work. But make sure that you do not infringe any court order regarding the status of the tenant during the eviction process to avert any legal hurt. If rental arrears cross ₹2 lakh, you can get a vacate order in your favour. If the court has granted you an ex parte order then you can enforce it to regain possession of the property. It is always wise to seek legal advice and help in order to conduct all actions without a violation of law and to help in the proper implementation of the court order.Hope you find this answer helpful in resolving your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Rental issue",
    "answer": "Dear Client,If you want to recover the rental arrears of ₹1,16,000, you need to file a separate civil suit for recovery of the unpaid rent under the Code of Civil Procedure,1908. As there is no rental agreement, you can still demand compensation based on the principle of unjust enrichment under section 70 of the Indian Contract Act,1872. This section will help you to get back what's owed to you when someone benefits from your property or service without a proper reason. The civil suit should be filed in the appropriate court having jurisdiction based on the amount of arrears and the location of the property.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,You have legal basis to contest the fraudulent transfer of the property from your grandmother because your father never signed for the transfer made by your uncle. TheTransfer of Property Act, 1882 also states that every transfer made with the intention to defraud the heirs is voidable under section 52. In Telangana you may approach a civil court for a declaratory relief and recovery of property seeking relief on the ground that the transfers made by your father to his brother’s daughters are unlawful. Even though, the act was passed 16 years ago, it may be possible to use the Section 17 of the Limitation Act, 1963 to request the extension of limitation period if the accused did not know about the fraud until now. Procuring the services of a lawyer in property matters is the right step to take in order to be in a safer position as far as the property is concerned.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Laws include the MC Act concerning the building permissions and any disciplinary actions that in regard to constructions that has been done without permission and BNS concerning criminal trespass and creating jeopardy. Besides, if construction has impacts on the environment the Environment Protection Act may also be imposed.Hence that is why in an effort to support the community’s perception of you as someone with authority, assemble all proofs and documents that are relevant to the unauthorized construction inclusive of FIRs letters to the municipal bodies. Cooperate with your advocate to put much weight behind your locus standi and to provide proof of infringements when in a hearing. Emphasize the fact that the agreement is fraudulent in the sale deed or in the clearances for construction especially the letter which shows that the Chief Electrical Inspector has indicated that no licence was given for the erection of the lift. If your interests are at large, public concern on aspects such as human rights and equity, you may decide to start a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) case.

The Indian law on divorce is based onHindu Marriage Actof 1955 and you can have the marriage dissolved whether or not it was celebrated in India. This marriage should not make prenuptial agreement an unenforceable agreement, though there might be such legal problem in India. Of course, you could have rights as a spouse pending maintenance and property division claim, although such rights may not be expressly as certain as when one registers.

    "question": "Married in the UK but husband doesn’t want to marry in India",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the event of divorce, Indian courts, even though your prenuptial agreement waives alimony or maintenance in the UK, are not bound to respect such agreements under Indian law. Prenuptial agreements are not specifically recognized under India as defined in any relevant laws and cannot be enforced in the way they have been derogated from their statutory rights of a spouse. Even in India, you may file for divorce, but you can still claim alimony or maintenance under Section 25 of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, or Section 125 of theCriminal Procedure Code, 1973, irrespective of the terms of the prenuptial agreement. Indian courts would evaluate the matter concerning fairness and justice and would take all points relating to financial dependency and contributions into account.However, if divorce proceedings are initiated within the UK territory and the court has jurisdiction over the couple also, Indian courts may even hold up for the UK proceedings. In the end, it would depend upon such law prevailing in the jurisdiction where the divorce is filed as to how that should be dealt with.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case it is possible that you may have to pay maintenance during theDomestic Violence(DV) proceedings though your wife may be levelling baseless allegations. Your wife will be able to claim from your income of ₹ 90,000 or any reasonable amount minus the medical bills. While the DV case might be false, and may change maintenance obligations if proven so, it does not necessarily remove you from paying unless a court allows it to do so. As for making home dues, since your wife is capable of earning but decide not to work then this too can be taken to court to try and reduce her maintenance claim. Furthermore, an act can be an act of cruelty in terms of Section 13(1)(ia) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 where false allegations have been made. Once you prove that the allegations made by her are false you can file a defamation case undersection 354of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (previously, Section 499 IPC) or can lodge a complaint under section 246 of BNS (Previously, Section 211 of IPC) for filing a false case. For these legal issues, you should consult a family law attorney to assist you on the matter to avoid further complications.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Wife files a false 498a case as FIR, false DVC, MC for sake of maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queries1. In the case ofDomestic Violence, if your wife produces before the court photographs of bruises, then that may be taken into consideration, but she has to prove that such injuries have been given to her by you. Mere photographs cannot prove anything against a person, therefore, there is scope for argument against such evidence.2. In cases of maintenance, prima facie evidence may be permitted by the court even without any proper investigation, and an order for interim maintenance can be passed by the judge. You will have to pay maintenance even if you prove her allegations of default to be false, but the amount may be reduced or even disallowed by the court as per its estimation of her needs and your ability to pay.3. If you can show your wife is capable of earning -- by showing past work as a beautician or education -- the court may remit or refuse to award maintenance. The courts, in general, are reluctant to award maintenance if wife has deliberately avoided employment with the sole intention of claiming maintenance.4. Maintenance amount is usually computed on your income and not your parent's. If your monthly salary is ₹90,000 and you have heavy financial commitments like loan repayments or medical and legal charges, the court is likely to consider all these points while deciding an amount for you. The figure can range between 20-30% of your net income with deductions.5. If allegations prove untrue, one could prohibit future maintenance but could not recover past payments.6.a) A police can even file an FIR without investigation in false cases. b) Maintenance can also be granted in false cases. c) Husband protection laws are lesser but exist.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Wife files a false 498a case as FIR, false DVC, MC for sake of maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queries,1. Your child and second wife's case: Visiting your child will not add to complication in the 498A case filed against you by your second wife. This is because child visitation rights are separate, cannot be tagged with that kind of case.2. Right to visit your child: You have the right to visit your child at home or at school, other than that allowed by the conditions of a court order. Hostile behavior by the family of your first wife can be legally controlled through the enforcement of your visitation rights.3. Rights to visit your child: Regardless of whether you ever remarry, nothing impacts on the rights to visit your child from the previous marriage.4. False enrollment in land registration: In case there have been forged engravings in your wife's and father-in-law's land registration you may file a complaint against them. However, the legal significance to your case depends on how you word it legally.5. Income proof: Gather evidence that she earns her money by sending business advertisements and photographs or even client feedback. You can present these in court to prove that she is indeed capable of earning.6. Effect of acting in court: lllCourts do not rely on acting. If your wife cannot properly present her evidence, her exaggerated claims are likely to fall. Make sure you have good, factual evidence to defend yourself with.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Divorce filing on the ground of cruelty against husband by wife",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I want to let you know that,you are entitled to seek divorce on grounds of cruelty, even though you reside with your wife. Till now, you have been suffering from physical as well as mental cruelties. Section 13(1)(ia) defines cruelty to include both physical as well as mental. All the audio recordings of her shouting, threatening, and trying to hit your son can be used in evidence to prove your case.There is no such law that requires you to leave the house before filing for divorce. Living together will not make you ineligible to seek divorce, especially when your concern remains the welfare of your child. It may be that desertion for 6 months forms part of proving desertion advice by your lawyer; in this case, it is a case of cruelty instead of desertion.Regarding the question you have further sought clarification on, your wife has absolutely no rights on your parents' property or properties. As per Hindu law, she is not entitled to claim any rights over your parents' ancestral or personal properties considering the fact that they have been staying apart for 9 long years and did not care to get in touch with her. If she files any claims of this nature, your parents will likely be impleaded in that case but they will not automatically be liable. It would be a declaration of their non-involvement with court action.There is very crucial presentation of all the evidence for the case, and a sound family lawyer would be capable enough to help create a strong case.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,I just want to let you know that,Since Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023(BNS) has superseded theIndian Penal Code, 1862, it is not applicable in this case. Instead, a complaint under Section 246 of BNS may be filed against a party and their attorney for flagrantly false claims, falsifying facts, or misleading the court. Section 246 addresses what happens when someone makes a fraudulent or dishonest allegation in court that is known to be false or misleading with the intention of gaining unfair advantage or causing unfair damage. It may stipulate a fine and a maximum two-year sentence of incarceration. The same industrial court where the fraudulent submissions were submitted should hear the complaint. Furthermore, based on how terrible the acts are, a complaint may additionally lodged with the police for further investigation into possible offenses like cheating or fraud under other sections of BNS.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Mahesh Vasdev and others                                                …..  DefendantsA F F I D A V I TI, Sri. Mahesh Vashdev (Senior Citizen), S/o late T. Vashdev,  Aged about 71 years, Door No.118, 26th Cross, 6th Block, Jayanagar, Bengaluru – 560070, (Mob:[deleted]), do hereby state on oath as under:That I am defendant No.1 in this case as such know the full facts of this case. The plaintiff filed the present suit claiming himself as a co-sharer of the property and on the other hand claiming to the absolute owner of the suit schedule property. If at all he is co-owner he ought to have obtained consent of other co-owners by way of Power of Attorney before filing the suit. He entirely stated falsehood in his affidavit and also in his plaint which were declared by on ought as true and correct and also verified the plaint contents. Thus the very contrary contentions taken by the plaintiff in this case goes to show that he attempted to mislead this Hon’ble Court in order to grab illegal possession of suit schedule property.When false affidavit or false documents were given in any quasi judicial or administrative proceedings, then a private complaint can be filed U/s 200 before competent magistrate. The Plaintiff claims to be a co owner of the Property. The Plaintiff has filed a suit for property partition against his family hence the said property rights are not with clear Titles. The Plaintiff has not disclosed the truth.The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff submits that the 1 Defendant is a uncle. The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff has been tying a Rakhi to the wife of the 1 Defendant therefore the relationship changes. The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff has deliberately not disclosed the true fact.The deponent further states that, the lease agreement was not made with any favors. The deponent further states that, the lease agreement was drawn with a intention of generating a Revenue so as to meet the Legal expenditure of Property Settlements Suit and other expenses. The 1 Defendant has been paying Property taxes and Property maintenance charges from the day the Plaintiff has entrusted the authority to the 1Defendant. The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff has not disclosed to the Honourable Court with a intention of misleading the true facts.The Plaintiff claim that he has not received the security deposit of Rs.100000 is also false as the 1 Defendant had made a expense of the amount to get his wife a bail and providing a bond to the High Ground Police Station as she was involved in a Criminal Case.The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff statement stating that the Defendant 1 has not done anything is completely false. The Defendant 1 has arranged for the Plaintiff Funds for his lively hood and the main house for him to live undisturbed with complete privacy.The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff brother filled a police complaint against the Defendant as trespassing the said property. The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff made the Defendant file a suit for Injunction against his brother an himself.The Plaintiff voluntarily put a sub lease clause for the benefit of the Defendant No.1 as services rendered.The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff has never demanded any money as he knew that the Defendant No.1 is spending for his problems. As a matter of fact his wife has been taking funds from the Defendant No.1 from time to time for her Case against her mother in law. The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff has willingly extended the lease agreement on the ninth day of June 2014.The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff has no need for the property as he loves to live in his father house which is very dear to him in   remembrance of his late Father. The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff has executed a will in favour of the Defendant and also promised fifth percent of his share. He has promised in front of his Uncle and Aunty Mr. and Mrs. Beharilal Bathija when we went to attend a Marriage of his niece. Thus the conduct of the plaintiff invites criminal offences as such a criminal case as to be registered in view of documents available on record that is his own plaint and its verification and his other pleadings and affidavits. The entire documents and pleadings filed by the plaintiff and defendant No.1 shall be read as part of this affidavit.Thus it has been established the plaintiff mislead this Court for the purpose  of misleading the lawful authority thus plaintiff needs to be tried for the alleged offences which may be disclosed during the course of investigation and likely to disclose offences  u/s 191,193,195,199 of IPC, 1860and be punished accordingly.I, the above named deponent declares that the contents of this affidavit are true and correct to the best of my knowledge, belief and information.Identified by me                                                                                    DEPONENTAdvocatePlace: BengaluruDate:Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, BangaloreAvailable Now6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar NOW!"

    "question": "Property dispute",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case,i just want to clarify you that, the registered sale deed between you and the District Collector and the NOC that confirms your status as a legal owner will stand in your favour.As per the  Section 6 ofTransfer of Property Act, 1882 the Registered Sale Deed is not affected by subsequent mutation as far as the conveyance of a freehold estate is concerned. The Rights of the other parties based on 20 year old registered agreement of sale cannot automatically vest him with ownership rights. Section 54 of theTransfer of Property Act,1882 grants ownership only upon a registered sale deed, but an agreement to sell merely indicates an intention to transfer property.If the other party has not filed a suit to enforce his claim over a period of two decades, then this might further fall within the limitation under the Limitation Act, 1963, because the suits for specific performance shall be filed within three years from the date of fixed performance. The possession taken by them is illegal because the deed of transfer is invalid.You can sue for ejectment against the occupier. In any event, as litigation is already pending, you should engage an attorney to intervene in the litigation to plead your interest under the registered sale deed. Your NOC and mutation now further strengthen your claim; you may even seek an injunction to restrain any further interference with your possession.Swift action in court will be taken to ascertain your rights as the rightful owner.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Academic questions on mutation of agriculture land in Gujarati for Hindus",
    "answer": "Dear Client,It is now clear that the two different mutations referred to as A (distribution throughout life) and B (distribution upon death) are in fact one and the same thing but different in name. Some beneficiaries may receive ancestral title which is not fair, it can cause conflicts because legal heirs are excluded while all legal heirs are expected to agree on the division. The legal heir of the property, one who has self-acquired property, has no obligation to consult other legal heirs in making decisions on utilization of the property. Not even in a simple event like the inheritance of property can those who are directly affected sit tight without giving their approval in order to safeguard those rights which if they don’t, would be violated. In India property rights or property laws are governed by several laws and part of them: ‘Hindu Succession Law’ and ‘Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 1956’ explains the concept related to the ‘inheritance of Ancestral as well as Self acquired property’. However, the issue raises a number of legal issues, and it would be more reasonable to address the experienced lawyer with an expertise in property law.Hope you find this answer helpful in resolving your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Misc Cri Application Order pending from long",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In this condition,i would like to suggest you that,In the case of Miscellaneous Criminal Application, your wife can make a written submission under Section 528 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita,2023(BNSS) for expeditious disposal of the case. She would emphasize the point that though in the police report it has been corroborated that the incident did take place, and even in the expert's report, it was also established that it is a forged signature, and yet the case has been reserved for an order for a pretty long time and no justification for it, and therefore affects the administration of justice. By exercising the inherent powers of the court, she can ask the judge to pass such an order at an earliest date possible. The other ground is excessive delay that bypasses the principles of a fair trial and speedy justice, which are violative of Article 21 of the Constitution. If the delay continues for a long period, she may also seek redress from the High Court under a writ petition to expedite her proceedings.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Hence for claiming the maintenance for her &child, she should file a petition under section125 CrPc.- Her husband is under legal obligation to provide the same to her at any cost, even he is working or not.2. Law entitles wives a basic right to reside in the matrimonial/ home, whether the house owned by her husband or his parents, a rented property or officially provided to him.- Hence, for claiming her residential right, medical expenses etc, and also for teaching a lesson to the family members of her husband, who subjected her torture &harassment, she should file a petition under the provisions ofDomestic ViolenceAct.3.  As per the Supreme Court, A wife has complete ownership rights over all her Streedhan, the gifts and money given to her before and after marriage. The denial of Streedhan to the wife makes the husband and in-laws liable for criminal charges.- And further, if the husband or his family members subjected a woman to cruelty for the dowry demand, then they can be booked under Section 498-A.- Your sister should lodge a written complaint against her husband & his family members, in the Women cell/Mahila Police, after mentioning all the details of torture &harassment.- The women cell firstly will try to reconcile between them, otherwise, they will lodge an FIR against her husband  who subjected your sister cruelty.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "Dear Client,It is so bad that your sister is trapped with her abusive husband and she needs to do so much to protect her and her child especially at this times. Its indeed a inhumane behaviour, your sister under section 84 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (previously,Section 498Aof theIndian Penal Code), can register a complaint against her husband for physical and other forms of abuse and then get a restraining order that bars him from communicating with her as provided by the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct of 2005. It is necessary to record all incidences of violence without being violated through the use of pictures and videos in case of threats. She should report abuse to the police since it is her legal requirement in accordance to section 84 of BNS on cruelty. Moreover, she can inform local NGOs or women’s helplines including the National Women’s Helpline 181. She has to visit a lawyer who prosecutesdomestic violencecases, and maybe find out how she could deal well with the case.Hope you find this answer helpful in resolving your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "No will - how to partition property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queriesUnder theHindu Succession Act, when a Hindu male dies intestate, then his property is divided equally among his Class I legal heirs which in your case are you, your mother and sister. You are, therefore, entitled to a one-third share in both the houses, regardless of whether your mother or sister are staying in one of them. In case you let go of the property to your mother, you will surrender your claim; therefore, it would not be easy raising your stake after some time. Technically, the law would have given her full ownership of the property.The property would otherwise be divided equally among the three of you. After having received her one third, your mother is free to gift or transfer her share to your sister, but this does not affect your right to your one third.Correspondingly, regarding your father's Provident Fund (PF), you are at par with a share in that amount as a Class I heir. If the PF has already been claimed by your mother and sister, you can demand to know the details of the amounts and take legal recourse to stake your claims if necessary.If they are trying to sell their holdings and are asking you to transfer your share to your mother, you should not do that without ensuring first that you are adequately compensated for your share or otherwise protected. A consultation with a lawyer would make sure your interests were looked after in all eventualities of transfer or sale agreements.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the event of divorce, Indian courts, even though your prenuptial agreement waives alimony or maintenance in the UK, are not bound to respect such agreements under Indian law. Prenuptial agreements are not specifically recognized under India as defined in any relevant laws and cannot be enforced in the way they have been derogated from their statutory rights of a spouse. Even in India, you may file for divorce, but you can still claim alimony or maintenance under Section 25 of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, or Section 125 of theCriminal Procedure Code, 1973, irrespective of the terms of the prenuptial agreement. Indian courts would evaluate the matter concerning fairness and justice and would take all points relating to financial dependency and contributions into account.However, if divorce proceedings are initiated within the UK territory and the court has jurisdiction over the couple also, Indian courts may even hold up for the UK proceedings. In the end, it would depend upon such law prevailing in the jurisdiction where the divorce is filed as to how that should be dealt with.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

You can give a complaint against the society, if it is a registered body, with the deputy registrar of cooperative societies for relief and remedy.  If you do not find any solution from the registrar then you can approach court of law seeking remedy to this.3. As per the National Building Code,one car parking space must not be less than 13.75 sq meters. For a 2-wheeler, it must not be less than 1.25 sq meters.4.  If the builder mentioned in the Sale deed regarding the sale of parking , then on this ground you can claim a right over the same from the society as well without having to produce the allotment letter.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Parking Allotment",
    "answer": "Dear Client,This is the possible response to your queriesUnder Indian law, especially the Maharashtra Ownership Flats Act, 1963, once parking space is mentioned in your property registry and you have paid stamp duty, your right to the parking space is established. The absence of a formal allotment letter from the builder does not nullify your right, especially if the sale deed mentions \"standard parking.\" The claim of the society that your allotment is invalid is not legally sound.The society cannot arbitrarily withhold services or rent out your parking space without your consent, as this would amount to illegal enrichment. The Supreme Court, in multiple rulings, has upheld that parking spaces sold along with flats become the property of the flat owner.You can approach the Registrar of Societies or even file a consumer court complaint against unfair trade practice and seek relief on the parking issue with compensation for unauthorised occupation of your space. The society cannot, lawfully speak of stopping services to your apartment for non-payment of maintenance while making handsome profits out of your parking space.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Parking Allotment",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,Can’t deprive residents of water, power: ExpertsBengaluru: Can an apartment association take coercive measures. Such as disconnecting water or power supply to a flat whose owner hasn’t paid maintenance charges?Though every association wants absolute power to crack down against errant flat owners, the reality is that legally, it is not allowed. According to the legal experts STOI spoke to, no resident welfare association (RWA), housing society or apartment association has the authority to deprive residents of water, electricity, housekeeping and other essential services.“Any non-payment or irregular payment of a resident’s share in the expenses would not confer any right on the apartment association to disconnect water supply,” said MP Srikanth, a practicing high court advocate.As per the procedure, the names of defaulters have to be published on the association notice board, and they have to be given a short period to comply. If they fail to respond, a legal notice demanding payment of arrears should be sent. If the defaulters fail to pay even after receipt of the notice a suit for recovery has to be filed in a civil court.SECTION 7 OF THE KARNATAKA APARTMENT OWNERSHIP ACT, 1972Compliance with covenants, bye-laws and administrative provisions.-Each apartment owner shall comply strictly with the bye-laws and with the administrative rules and regulations adopted pursuant thereto, as either of the same may be lawfully amended form time to time, and with the covenants, conditions and restrictions set forth in the Declaration or in the Deed to his Apartment. Failure to comply with any of the same shall be a ground for an action to recover sums due for damages or injunctive relief or both maintainable by the Manager or Board of Managers on behalf of the Association of Apartment Owners or, in a proper case by an aggrieved apartment owner.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, BangaloreAvailable Now6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar NOW!"

    "question": "No will - how to partition property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queriesUnder theHindu Succession Act, when a Hindu male dies intestate, then his property is divided equally among his Class I legal heirs which in your case are you, your mother and sister. You are, therefore, entitled to a one-third share in both the houses, regardless of whether your mother or sister are staying in one of them. In case you let go of the property to your mother, you will surrender your claim; therefore, it would not be easy raising your stake after some time. Technically, the law would have given her full ownership of the property.The property would otherwise be divided equally among the three of you. After having received her one third, your mother is free to gift or transfer her share to your sister, but this does not affect your right to your one third.Correspondingly, regarding your father's Provident Fund (PF), you are at par with a share in that amount as a Class I heir. If the PF has already been claimed by your mother and sister, you can demand to know the details of the amounts and take legal recourse to stake your claims if necessary.If they are trying to sell their holdings and are asking you to transfer your share to your mother, you should not do that without ensuring first that you are adequately compensated for your share or otherwise protected. A consultation with a lawyer would make sure your interests were looked after in all eventualities of transfer or sale agreements.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

There is the Partition Act of 1893 that enables co-owners to look for a partition of the properties, and your mother and sister can take an action of partition after his death. Daughters have been given rights through 1956Hindu Succession Actwhereby they can claim their fathers’ self-acquired property after his death. Before proceeding, it is essential to consult a property law attorney to learn your legal status and develop any paperwork. As for the division of the two houses, try to come to friendly terms with the family and be prepared to institute partition suit in the right court of Civil Jurisdiction once the father of the family is deceased.Hope you find this answer suitable for resolving you query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,I would like to let you know that,The flat is situated in a property co-owned between you and your deceased father, and falls under theHindu Succession Act, 1956. Since your father died intestate, his share in the said property would be distributed equally among his legal heirs, that is you and two sisters. Under the Act of Mental Health Care, 2017, one may file for guardianship for a mentally challenged sister who shall explain that condition and the role played by a person as a caregiver. The same may be filed under the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890. Once you gain her guardianship, you would have all rights to administer her share in the flat, if so required, and open a bank account in her name for filing her income tax returns and ensuring continued medical benefits. Distribution of assets would indeed be relevant during the process of obtaining guardianship in order to show that you have been responsible in managing her share, but your primary aim is to establish her inability and your status as guardian. It will be wise to consult a legal professional with experience in family or guardianship law to help you through this process.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Divorce filing on the ground of cruelty against husband by wife",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I want to let you know that,you are entitled to seek divorce on grounds of cruelty, even though you reside with your wife. Till now, you have been suffering from physical as well as mental cruelties. Section 13(1)(ia) defines cruelty to include both physical as well as mental. All the audio recordings of her shouting, threatening, and trying to hit your son can be used in evidence to prove your case.There is no such law that requires you to leave the house before filing for divorce. Living together will not make you ineligible to seek divorce, especially when your concern remains the welfare of your child. It may be that desertion for 6 months forms part of proving desertion advice by your lawyer; in this case, it is a case of cruelty instead of desertion.Regarding the question you have further sought clarification on, your wife has absolutely no rights on your parents' property or properties. As per Hindu law, she is not entitled to claim any rights over your parents' ancestral or personal properties considering the fact that they have been staying apart for 9 long years and did not care to get in touch with her. If she files any claims of this nature, your parents will likely be impleaded in that case but they will not automatically be liable. It would be a declaration of their non-involvement with court action.There is very crucial presentation of all the evidence for the case, and a sound family lawyer would be capable enough to help create a strong case.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Divorce filing on the ground of cruelty against husband by wife",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I want to let you know that,you are entitled to seek divorce on grounds of cruelty, even though you reside with your wife. Till now, you have been suffering from physical as well as mental cruelties. Section 13(1)(ia) defines cruelty to include both physical as well as mental. All the audio recordings of her shouting, threatening, and trying to hit your son can be used in evidence to prove your case.There is no such law that requires you to leave the house before filing for divorce. Living together will not make you ineligible to seek divorce, especially when your concern remains the welfare of your child. It may be that desertion for 6 months forms part of proving desertion advice by your lawyer; in this case, it is a case of cruelty instead of desertion.Regarding the question you have further sought clarification on, your wife has absolutely no rights on your parents' property or properties. As per Hindu law, she is not entitled to claim any rights over your parents' ancestral or personal properties considering the fact that they have been staying apart for 9 long years and did not care to get in touch with her. If she files any claims of this nature, your parents will likely be impleaded in that case but they will not automatically be liable. It would be a declaration of their non-involvement with court action.There is very crucial presentation of all the evidence for the case, and a sound family lawyer would be capable enough to help create a strong case.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Have you already filed a guardianship petition?There is a Right of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016 under which tribunals are set up to deal with such casesHowever to my knowledge so far no tribunal is constituted under the above actSo a writ petition can be filed in the High Court invoking its parens patriae jurisdiction seeking your appointment as a guardian of your younger sister with the consent of your other sisterI assume that you 3 are the only heirs of your late fatherThe guardian would be required to be appointed for opening a bank account in the name of the younger sister and for transferring her share in the flat which is jointly owned by you and your late fatherPlease note that even if your father had contributed only 1/3rd of the purchase price , in absence of any mention in the sale deed about the % holding of the co purchasers , it would be deemed that both hold equal undivided share in the flat , unless you can prove in a declaratory suit that your shareholding in the flat is more than that of your fatherSo taking the late father's share in the flat to be 50%, that share will equally devolve on his 3 children and upon your elder sister giving up her claim in the flat , the said 50% will go to you and your younger sister equally.

    "question": "Acquiring Guardianship of intellectually challenged sister and share in flat",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I would like to let you know that,The flat is situated in a property co-owned between you and your deceased father, and falls under theHindu Succession Act, 1956. Since your father died intestate, his share in the said property would be distributed equally among his legal heirs, that is you and two sisters. Under the Act of Mental Health Care, 2017, one may file for guardianship for a mentally challenged sister who shall explain that condition and the role played by a person as a caregiver. The same may be filed under the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890. Once you gain her guardianship, you would have all rights to administer her share in the flat, if so required, and open a bank account in her name for filing her income tax returns and ensuring continued medical benefits. Distribution of assets would indeed be relevant during the process of obtaining guardianship in order to show that you have been responsible in managing her share, but your primary aim is to establish her inability and your status as guardian. It will be wise to consult a legal professional with experience in family or guardianship law to help you through this process.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Section 246 addresses what happens when someone makes a fraudulent or dishonest allegation in court that is known to be false or misleading with the intention of gaining unfair advantage or causing unfair damage. It may stipulate a fine and a maximum two-year sentence of incarceration. The same industrial court where the fraudulent submissions were submitted should hear the complaint. Furthermore, based on how terrible the acts are, a complaint may additionally lodged with the police for further investigation into possible offenses like cheating or fraud under other sections of BNS.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Vashdev,  Aged about 71 years, Door No.118, 26th Cross, 6th Block, Jayanagar, Bengaluru – 560070, (Mob:[deleted]), do hereby state on oath as under:That I am defendant No.1 in this case as such know the full facts of this case. The plaintiff filed the present suit claiming himself as a co-sharer of the property and on the other hand claiming to the absolute owner of the suit schedule property. If at all he is co-owner he ought to have obtained consent of other co-owners by way of Power of Attorney before filing the suit. He entirely stated falsehood in his affidavit and also in his plaint which were declared by on ought as true and correct and also verified the plaint contents. Thus the very contrary contentions taken by the plaintiff in this case goes to show that he attempted to mislead this Hon’ble Court in order to grab illegal possession of suit schedule property.When false affidavit or false documents were given in any quasi judicial or administrative proceedings, then a private complaint can be filed U/s 200 before competent magistrate. The Plaintiff claims to be a co owner of the Property. The Plaintiff has filed a suit for property partition against his family hence the said property rights are not with clear Titles. The Plaintiff has not disclosed the truth.The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff submits that the 1 Defendant is a uncle. The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff has been tying a Rakhi to the wife of the 1 Defendant therefore the relationship changes. The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff has deliberately not disclosed the true fact.The deponent further states that, the lease agreement was not made with any favors. The deponent further states that, the lease agreement was drawn with a intention of generating a Revenue so as to meet the Legal expenditure of Property Settlements Suit and other expenses. The 1 Defendant has been paying Property taxes and Property maintenance charges from the day the Plaintiff has entrusted the authority to the 1Defendant. The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff has not disclosed to the Honourable Court with a intention of misleading the true facts.The Plaintiff claim that he has not received the security deposit of Rs.100000 is also false as the 1 Defendant had made a expense of the amount to get his wife a bail and providing a bond to the High Ground Police Station as she was involved in a Criminal Case.The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff statement stating that the Defendant 1 has not done anything is completely false. The Defendant 1 has arranged for the Plaintiff Funds for his lively hood and the main house for him to live undisturbed with complete privacy.The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff brother filled a police complaint against the Defendant as trespassing the said property. The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff made the Defendant file a suit for Injunction against his brother an himself.The Plaintiff voluntarily put a sub lease clause for the benefit of the Defendant No.1 as services rendered.The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff has never demanded any money as he knew that the Defendant No.1 is spending for his problems. As a matter of fact his wife has been taking funds from the Defendant No.1 from time to time for her Case against her mother in law. The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff has willingly extended the lease agreement on the ninth day of June 2014.The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff has no need for the property as he loves to live in his father house which is very dear to him in   remembrance of his late Father. The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff has executed a will in favour of the Defendant and also promised fifth percent of his share. He has promised in front of his Uncle and Aunty Mr. and Mrs. Beharilal Bathija when we went to attend a Marriage of his niece. Thus the conduct of the plaintiff invites criminal offences as such a criminal case as to be registered in view of documents available on record that is his own plaint and its verification and his other pleadings and affidavits. The entire documents and pleadings filed by the plaintiff and defendant No.1 shall be read as part of this affidavit.Thus it has been established the plaintiff mislead this Court for the purpose  of misleading the lawful authority thus plaintiff needs to be tried for the alleged offences which may be disclosed during the course of investigation and likely to disclose offences  u/s 191,193,195,199 of IPC, 1860and be punished accordingly.I, the above named deponent declares that the contents of this affidavit are true and correct to the best of my knowledge, belief and information.Identified by me                                                                                    DEPONENTAdvocatePlace: BengaluruDate:Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, BangaloreAvailable Now6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar NOW!"

    "question": "Property dispute",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case,i just want to clarify you that, the registered sale deed between you and the District Collector and the NOC that confirms your status as a legal owner will stand in your favour.As per the  Section 6 ofTransfer of Property Act, 1882 the Registered Sale Deed is not affected by subsequent mutation as far as the conveyance of a freehold estate is concerned. The Rights of the other parties based on 20 year old registered agreement of sale cannot automatically vest him with ownership rights. Section 54 of theTransfer of Property Act,1882 grants ownership only upon a registered sale deed, but an agreement to sell merely indicates an intention to transfer property.If the other party has not filed a suit to enforce his claim over a period of two decades, then this might further fall within the limitation under the Limitation Act, 1963, because the suits for specific performance shall be filed within three years from the date of fixed performance. The possession taken by them is illegal because the deed of transfer is invalid.You can sue for ejectment against the occupier. In any event, as litigation is already pending, you should engage an attorney to intervene in the litigation to plead your interest under the registered sale deed. Your NOC and mutation now further strengthen your claim; you may even seek an injunction to restrain any further interference with your possession.Swift action in court will be taken to ascertain your rights as the rightful owner.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Parking Allotment",
    "answer": "1.  If your registered sale deed is clear with recitals confirming allotment of parking space to you, then the association cannot refuse to allot the parking space to you.Under the \"Apartment Act\" in most States, parking spaces are considered a part of a society's common areas, making it unlawful for builders to sell them as separate units.It will also be illegal if a builder attempts to register parking spaces as independent units.2. You can give a complaint against the society, if it is a registered body, with the deputy registrar of cooperative societies for relief and remedy.  If you do not find any solution from the registrar then you can approach court of law seeking remedy to this.3. As per the National Building Code,one car parking space must not be less than 13.75 sq meters. For a 2-wheeler, it must not be less than 1.25 sq meters.4.  If the builder mentioned in the Sale deed regarding the sale of parking , then on this ground you can claim a right over the same from the society as well without having to produce the allotment letter.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Parking Allotment",
    "answer": "Dear Client,This is the possible response to your queriesUnder Indian law, especially the Maharashtra Ownership Flats Act, 1963, once parking space is mentioned in your property registry and you have paid stamp duty, your right to the parking space is established. The absence of a formal allotment letter from the builder does not nullify your right, especially if the sale deed mentions \"standard parking.\" The claim of the society that your allotment is invalid is not legally sound.The society cannot arbitrarily withhold services or rent out your parking space without your consent, as this would amount to illegal enrichment. The Supreme Court, in multiple rulings, has upheld that parking spaces sold along with flats become the property of the flat owner.You can approach the Registrar of Societies or even file a consumer court complaint against unfair trade practice and seek relief on the parking issue with compensation for unauthorised occupation of your space. The society cannot, lawfully speak of stopping services to your apartment for non-payment of maintenance while making handsome profits out of your parking space.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Parking Allotment",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,Can’t deprive residents of water, power: ExpertsBengaluru: Can an apartment association take coercive measures. Such as disconnecting water or power supply to a flat whose owner hasn’t paid maintenance charges?Though every association wants absolute power to crack down against errant flat owners, the reality is that legally, it is not allowed. According to the legal experts STOI spoke to, no resident welfare association (RWA), housing society or apartment association has the authority to deprive residents of water, electricity, housekeeping and other essential services.“Any non-payment or irregular payment of a resident’s share in the expenses would not confer any right on the apartment association to disconnect water supply,” said MP Srikanth, a practicing high court advocate.As per the procedure, the names of defaulters have to be published on the association notice board, and they have to be given a short period to comply. If they fail to respond, a legal notice demanding payment of arrears should be sent. If the defaulters fail to pay even after receipt of the notice a suit for recovery has to be filed in a civil court.SECTION 7 OF THE KARNATAKA APARTMENT OWNERSHIP ACT, 1972Compliance with covenants, bye-laws and administrative provisions.-Each apartment owner shall comply strictly with the bye-laws and with the administrative rules and regulations adopted pursuant thereto, as either of the same may be lawfully amended form time to time, and with the covenants, conditions and restrictions set forth in the Declaration or in the Deed to his Apartment. Failure to comply with any of the same shall be a ground for an action to recover sums due for damages or injunctive relief or both maintainable by the Manager or Board of Managers on behalf of the Association of Apartment Owners or, in a proper case by an aggrieved apartment owner.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, BangaloreAvailable Now6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,I want to let you know that,in Indian law, in particular under the Registration Act, 1908, original sale deeds are primarily needed to be produced in case of trial. The original copy of the sale deed issued between the builder and the landowner has been lost; hence, a certified copy of the sale deed may be deemed valid in appropriate circumstances along with the police report and newspaper advertisements declaring its loss. Although a registered FIR is preferred, a lost report accompanied by a public notice should be sufficient to prove the existence of such a document to be absent, unless objection is raised within the period indicated in the notice. The fact that the bank has approved your loan and the search report has come clean adds strength to the transaction.In that respect, if you want to save yourself from legal tussles in the near future, you have to make certain that the certified copy is registered and duly noted in your sale deed, and no other claims exist on the property. You may then consider asking the builder to get a court order declaring the original sale deed lost, which adds another layer of legal security.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "No will - how to partition property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queriesUnder theHindu Succession Act, when a Hindu male dies intestate, then his property is divided equally among his Class I legal heirs which in your case are you, your mother and sister. You are, therefore, entitled to a one-third share in both the houses, regardless of whether your mother or sister are staying in one of them. In case you let go of the property to your mother, you will surrender your claim; therefore, it would not be easy raising your stake after some time. Technically, the law would have given her full ownership of the property.The property would otherwise be divided equally among the three of you. After having received her one third, your mother is free to gift or transfer her share to your sister, but this does not affect your right to your one third.Correspondingly, regarding your father's Provident Fund (PF), you are at par with a share in that amount as a Class I heir. If the PF has already been claimed by your mother and sister, you can demand to know the details of the amounts and take legal recourse to stake your claims if necessary.If they are trying to sell their holdings and are asking you to transfer your share to your mother, you should not do that without ensuring first that you are adequately compensated for your share or otherwise protected. A consultation with a lawyer would make sure your interests were looked after in all eventualities of transfer or sale agreements.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "No will - how to partition property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,An individual’s exclusive property, like property owned by your father, cannot be partitioned during paternal lifetime without his permission. There is the Partition Act of 1893 that enables co-owners to look for a partition of the properties, and your mother and sister can take an action of partition after his death. Daughters have been given rights through 1956Hindu Succession Actwhereby they can claim their fathers’ self-acquired property after his death. Before proceeding, it is essential to consult a property law attorney to learn your legal status and develop any paperwork. As for the division of the two houses, try to come to friendly terms with the family and be prepared to institute partition suit in the right court of Civil Jurisdiction once the father of the family is deceased.Hope you find this answer suitable for resolving you query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Case dismissed on the basis of Power of Attorney !!!",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queriesYou still have the option to appeal in the High Court even if the 30-day deadline has passed by requesting condonation of delay through Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963. This can be done by citing the medical reasons for your mother’s illness as the cause for the delay, not her absence.According to theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, a gift deed from your mother to you is considered lawful. Ownership of the property might be contested or forcefully taken, but you can challenge the situation under your name once the gift is finalized.The mother’s health issues fall under Section 32 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908, where a power of attorney has been given due to her current incapacity to act and someone is authorized to act on her behalf. If the dismissal was based on procedural reasons, an appeal would be possible because Indian law does not require the power of attorney to be executed during the filing of the case.Your lawyer’s procedural mistake can be used as a reason for appeal, as procedural errors should not result in the unfair dismissal of the plaintiff’s substantive rights. You can dispute this based on the belief that legal technicalities should not supersede fairness, as indicated by past rulings from the Supreme Court of India.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Travelled abroad without NOC from university",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queries.1) In your case, purchasing tickets and proceeding on leave without NOC is not advisable. Government employees, as you are also part of this system at universities, have Indian law making it necessary to obtain a No Objection Certificate for foreign travel as a check to transparency and accountability, as per the guidelines of the Department of Personnel and Training, DoPT. Hence, proceeding without NOC may call for disciplinary action in the form of treating the absence as unauthorized leave, issuing a show-cause notice or suspension for non-compliance.2) Such actions may be taken by the university under the service conduct rules governing the behavior of government employees. In fact, the consistent refusal or even delay in the issuance of the NOC may well be a basis for a complaint under the rubric of harassment. You may file a formal grievance with the committee of the university, pointing out the unwarranted delay when all conditions are satisfied, including consent from your Head of Department, and there would be no implication on classes.3) If it is a recurring issue, you would be well advised to take up the issue with the UGC and approach the CAT seeking redress for the delay and harassment inflicted upon you under service rules. You may even file a writ petition in the High Court for redress for the undue delay and non-issuance of the NOC, which hinders your rights and causes unwarranted distress.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Divorce filing on the ground of cruelty against husband by wife",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I want to let you know that,you are entitled to seek divorce on grounds of cruelty, even though you reside with your wife. Till now, you have been suffering from physical as well as mental cruelties. Section 13(1)(ia) defines cruelty to include both physical as well as mental. All the audio recordings of her shouting, threatening, and trying to hit your son can be used in evidence to prove your case.There is no such law that requires you to leave the house before filing for divorce. Living together will not make you ineligible to seek divorce, especially when your concern remains the welfare of your child. It may be that desertion for 6 months forms part of proving desertion advice by your lawyer; in this case, it is a case of cruelty instead of desertion.Regarding the question you have further sought clarification on, your wife has absolutely no rights on your parents' property or properties. As per Hindu law, she is not entitled to claim any rights over your parents' ancestral or personal properties considering the fact that they have been staying apart for 9 long years and did not care to get in touch with her. If she files any claims of this nature, your parents will likely be impleaded in that case but they will not automatically be liable. It would be a declaration of their non-involvement with court action.There is very crucial presentation of all the evidence for the case, and a sound family lawyer would be capable enough to help create a strong case.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

She would emphasize the point that though in the police report it has been corroborated that the incident did take place, and even in the expert's report, it was also established that it is a forged signature, and yet the case has been reserved for an order for a pretty long time and no justification for it, and therefore affects the administration of justice. By exercising the inherent powers of the court, she can ask the judge to pass such an order at an earliest date possible. The other ground is excessive delay that bypasses the principles of a fair trial and speedy justice, which are violative of Article 21 of the Constitution. If the delay continues for a long period, she may also seek redress from the High Court under a writ petition to expedite her proceedings.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,In the case of failure of the CA to submit the said documents you can issue a notice to compliance as partners of the LLP have the privilege to retrieve records of the firm under Section 2(23) of the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008. Specifically, in case if you have resigned from the Chronos Clothes LLP, you can find some restrictions in terms of the documents shown below However, since the documents shared reflected annual reports of the LLP you can ask the authorized personnel of the LLP to provide a copy of the mentioned documents. Furthermore, in view of the allegations against you, it is important that you compile evidence to support your side on the issue of misuse of position. In case the CA refuses to cooperate if his refusal seems unjustified or if the LLP partners are not cooperative, you should complain to the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) or approach civil court for breach of duty. It is advisable that you consult a lawyer particularly one who is skilled in corporate law so that he/she can assist you in this issues.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Divorce filing on the ground of cruelty against husband by wife",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I want to let you know that,you are entitled to seek divorce on grounds of cruelty, even though you reside with your wife. Till now, you have been suffering from physical as well as mental cruelties. Section 13(1)(ia) defines cruelty to include both physical as well as mental. All the audio recordings of her shouting, threatening, and trying to hit your son can be used in evidence to prove your case.There is no such law that requires you to leave the house before filing for divorce. Living together will not make you ineligible to seek divorce, especially when your concern remains the welfare of your child. It may be that desertion for 6 months forms part of proving desertion advice by your lawyer; in this case, it is a case of cruelty instead of desertion.Regarding the question you have further sought clarification on, your wife has absolutely no rights on your parents' property or properties. As per Hindu law, she is not entitled to claim any rights over your parents' ancestral or personal properties considering the fact that they have been staying apart for 9 long years and did not care to get in touch with her. If she files any claims of this nature, your parents will likely be impleaded in that case but they will not automatically be liable. It would be a declaration of their non-involvement with court action.There is very crucial presentation of all the evidence for the case, and a sound family lawyer would be capable enough to help create a strong case.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Property dispute",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case,i just want to clarify you that, the registered sale deed between you and the District Collector and the NOC that confirms your status as a legal owner will stand in your favour.As per the  Section 6 ofTransfer of Property Act, 1882 the Registered Sale Deed is not affected by subsequent mutation as far as the conveyance of a freehold estate is concerned. The Rights of the other parties based on 20 year old registered agreement of sale cannot automatically vest him with ownership rights. Section 54 of theTransfer of Property Act,1882 grants ownership only upon a registered sale deed, but an agreement to sell merely indicates an intention to transfer property.If the other party has not filed a suit to enforce his claim over a period of two decades, then this might further fall within the limitation under the Limitation Act, 1963, because the suits for specific performance shall be filed within three years from the date of fixed performance. The possession taken by them is illegal because the deed of transfer is invalid.You can sue for ejectment against the occupier. In any event, as litigation is already pending, you should engage an attorney to intervene in the litigation to plead your interest under the registered sale deed. Your NOC and mutation now further strengthen your claim; you may even seek an injunction to restrain any further interference with your possession.Swift action in court will be taken to ascertain your rights as the rightful owner.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

She would emphasize the point that though in the police report it has been corroborated that the incident did take place, and even in the expert's report, it was also established that it is a forged signature, and yet the case has been reserved for an order for a pretty long time and no justification for it, and therefore affects the administration of justice. By exercising the inherent powers of the court, she can ask the judge to pass such an order at an earliest date possible. The other ground is excessive delay that bypasses the principles of a fair trial and speedy justice, which are violative of Article 21 of the Constitution. If the delay continues for a long period, she may also seek redress from the High Court under a writ petition to expedite her proceedings.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Travelled abroad without NOC from university",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queries.1) In your case, purchasing tickets and proceeding on leave without NOC is not advisable. Government employees, as you are also part of this system at universities, have Indian law making it necessary to obtain a No Objection Certificate for foreign travel as a check to transparency and accountability, as per the guidelines of the Department of Personnel and Training, DoPT. Hence, proceeding without NOC may call for disciplinary action in the form of treating the absence as unauthorized leave, issuing a show-cause notice or suspension for non-compliance.2) Such actions may be taken by the university under the service conduct rules governing the behavior of government employees. In fact, the consistent refusal or even delay in the issuance of the NOC may well be a basis for a complaint under the rubric of harassment. You may file a formal grievance with the committee of the university, pointing out the unwarranted delay when all conditions are satisfied, including consent from your Head of Department, and there would be no implication on classes.3) If it is a recurring issue, you would be well advised to take up the issue with the UGC and approach the CAT seeking redress for the delay and harassment inflicted upon you under service rules. You may even file a writ petition in the High Court for redress for the undue delay and non-issuance of the NOC, which hinders your rights and causes unwarranted distress.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In any case, your court marriage in the UK is valid under the Hindu law even if not registered in India but the marriage must have been solemnized according to the Hindu customs.  The failure to include this may lead to some complications with your legal ability especially when planning to undergo a divorce. The Indian law on divorce is based onHindu Marriage Actof 1955 and you can have the marriage dissolved whether or not it was celebrated in India. This marriage should not make prenuptial agreement an unenforceable agreement, though there might be such legal problem in India. Of course, you could have rights as a spouse pending maintenance and property division claim, although such rights may not be expressly as certain as when one registers. These matters should therefore be handled by a family law attorney knowledgeable in both the UK and the Indian law systems.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Married in the UK but husband doesn’t want to marry in India",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the event of divorce, Indian courts, even though your prenuptial agreement waives alimony or maintenance in the UK, are not bound to respect such agreements under Indian law. Prenuptial agreements are not specifically recognized under India as defined in any relevant laws and cannot be enforced in the way they have been derogated from their statutory rights of a spouse. Even in India, you may file for divorce, but you can still claim alimony or maintenance under Section 25 of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, or Section 125 of theCriminal Procedure Code, 1973, irrespective of the terms of the prenuptial agreement. Indian courts would evaluate the matter concerning fairness and justice and would take all points relating to financial dependency and contributions into account.However, if divorce proceedings are initiated within the UK territory and the court has jurisdiction over the couple also, Indian courts may even hold up for the UK proceedings. In the end, it would depend upon such law prevailing in the jurisdiction where the divorce is filed as to how that should be dealt with.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Divorce filing on the ground of cruelty against husband by wife",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I want to let you know that,you are entitled to seek divorce on grounds of cruelty, even though you reside with your wife. Till now, you have been suffering from physical as well as mental cruelties. Section 13(1)(ia) defines cruelty to include both physical as well as mental. All the audio recordings of her shouting, threatening, and trying to hit your son can be used in evidence to prove your case.There is no such law that requires you to leave the house before filing for divorce. Living together will not make you ineligible to seek divorce, especially when your concern remains the welfare of your child. It may be that desertion for 6 months forms part of proving desertion advice by your lawyer; in this case, it is a case of cruelty instead of desertion.Regarding the question you have further sought clarification on, your wife has absolutely no rights on your parents' property or properties. As per Hindu law, she is not entitled to claim any rights over your parents' ancestral or personal properties considering the fact that they have been staying apart for 9 long years and did not care to get in touch with her. If she files any claims of this nature, your parents will likely be impleaded in that case but they will not automatically be liable. It would be a declaration of their non-involvement with court action.There is very crucial presentation of all the evidence for the case, and a sound family lawyer would be capable enough to help create a strong case.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Complaint for giving false evidence before the industrial court",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I just want to let you know that,Since Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023(BNS) has superseded theIndian Penal Code, 1862, it is not applicable in this case. Instead, a complaint under Section 246 of BNS may be filed against a party and their attorney for flagrantly false claims, falsifying facts, or misleading the court. Section 246 addresses what happens when someone makes a fraudulent or dishonest allegation in court that is known to be false or misleading with the intention of gaining unfair advantage or causing unfair damage. It may stipulate a fine and a maximum two-year sentence of incarceration. The same industrial court where the fraudulent submissions were submitted should hear the complaint. Furthermore, based on how terrible the acts are, a complaint may additionally lodged with the police for further investigation into possible offenses like cheating or fraud under other sections of BNS.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

No.2456/2017BETWEEN:Sri. Sandeep Bathija                                                       …..  PlaintiffANDSri. Mahesh Vasdev and others                                                …..  DefendantsA F F I D A V I TI, Sri. Mahesh Vashdev (Senior Citizen), S/o late T. Vashdev,  Aged about 71 years, Door No.118, 26th Cross, 6th Block, Jayanagar, Bengaluru – 560070, (Mob:[deleted]), do hereby state on oath as under:That I am defendant No.1 in this case as such know the full facts of this case. The plaintiff filed the present suit claiming himself as a co-sharer of the property and on the other hand claiming to the absolute owner of the suit schedule property. If at all he is co-owner he ought to have obtained consent of other co-owners by way of Power of Attorney before filing the suit. He entirely stated falsehood in his affidavit and also in his plaint which were declared by on ought as true and correct and also verified the plaint contents. Thus the very contrary contentions taken by the plaintiff in this case goes to show that he attempted to mislead this Hon’ble Court in order to grab illegal possession of suit schedule property.When false affidavit or false documents were given in any quasi judicial or administrative proceedings, then a private complaint can be filed U/s 200 before competent magistrate. The Plaintiff claims to be a co owner of the Property. The Plaintiff has filed a suit for property partition against his family hence the said property rights are not with clear Titles. The Plaintiff has not disclosed the truth.The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff submits that the 1 Defendant is a uncle. The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff has been tying a Rakhi to the wife of the 1 Defendant therefore the relationship changes. The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff has deliberately not disclosed the true fact.The deponent further states that, the lease agreement was not made with any favors. The deponent further states that, the lease agreement was drawn with a intention of generating a Revenue so as to meet the Legal expenditure of Property Settlements Suit and other expenses. The 1 Defendant has been paying Property taxes and Property maintenance charges from the day the Plaintiff has entrusted the authority to the 1Defendant. The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff has not disclosed to the Honourable Court with a intention of misleading the true facts.The Plaintiff claim that he has not received the security deposit of Rs.100000 is also false as the 1 Defendant had made a expense of the amount to get his wife a bail and providing a bond to the High Ground Police Station as she was involved in a Criminal Case.The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff statement stating that the Defendant 1 has not done anything is completely false. The Defendant 1 has arranged for the Plaintiff Funds for his lively hood and the main house for him to live undisturbed with complete privacy.The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff brother filled a police complaint against the Defendant as trespassing the said property. The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff made the Defendant file a suit for Injunction against his brother an himself.The Plaintiff voluntarily put a sub lease clause for the benefit of the Defendant No.1 as services rendered.The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff has never demanded any money as he knew that the Defendant No.1 is spending for his problems. As a matter of fact his wife has been taking funds from the Defendant No.1 from time to time for her Case against her mother in law. The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff has willingly extended the lease agreement on the ninth day of June 2014.The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff has no need for the property as he loves to live in his father house which is very dear to him in   remembrance of his late Father. The deponent further states that, the Plaintiff has executed a will in favour of the Defendant and also promised fifth percent of his share. He has promised in front of his Uncle and Aunty Mr. and Mrs. Beharilal Bathija when we went to attend a Marriage of his niece. Thus the conduct of the plaintiff invites criminal offences as such a criminal case as to be registered in view of documents available on record that is his own plaint and its verification and his other pleadings and affidavits. The entire documents and pleadings filed by the plaintiff and defendant No.1 shall be read as part of this affidavit.Thus it has been established the plaintiff mislead this Court for the purpose  of misleading the lawful authority thus plaintiff needs to be tried for the alleged offences which may be disclosed during the course of investigation and likely to disclose offences  u/s 191,193,195,199 of IPC, 1860and be punished accordingly.I, the above named deponent declares that the contents of this affidavit are true and correct to the best of my knowledge, belief and information.Identified by me                                                                                    DEPONENTAdvocatePlace: BengaluruDate:Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, BangaloreAvailable Now6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar NOW!"

    "question": "Property dispute",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case,i just want to clarify you that, the registered sale deed between you and the District Collector and the NOC that confirms your status as a legal owner will stand in your favour.As per the  Section 6 ofTransfer of Property Act, 1882 the Registered Sale Deed is not affected by subsequent mutation as far as the conveyance of a freehold estate is concerned. The Rights of the other parties based on 20 year old registered agreement of sale cannot automatically vest him with ownership rights. Section 54 of theTransfer of Property Act,1882 grants ownership only upon a registered sale deed, but an agreement to sell merely indicates an intention to transfer property.If the other party has not filed a suit to enforce his claim over a period of two decades, then this might further fall within the limitation under the Limitation Act, 1963, because the suits for specific performance shall be filed within three years from the date of fixed performance. The possession taken by them is illegal because the deed of transfer is invalid.You can sue for ejectment against the occupier. In any event, as litigation is already pending, you should engage an attorney to intervene in the litigation to plead your interest under the registered sale deed. Your NOC and mutation now further strengthen your claim; you may even seek an injunction to restrain any further interference with your possession.Swift action in court will be taken to ascertain your rights as the rightful owner.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

She would emphasize the point that though in the police report it has been corroborated that the incident did take place, and even in the expert's report, it was also established that it is a forged signature, and yet the case has been reserved for an order for a pretty long time and no justification for it, and therefore affects the administration of justice. By exercising the inherent powers of the court, she can ask the judge to pass such an order at an earliest date possible. The other ground is excessive delay that bypasses the principles of a fair trial and speedy justice, which are violative of Article 21 of the Constitution. If the delay continues for a long period, she may also seek redress from the High Court under a writ petition to expedite her proceedings.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Lost original sale deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I want to let you know that,in Indian law, in particular under the Registration Act, 1908, original sale deeds are primarily needed to be produced in case of trial. The original copy of the sale deed issued between the builder and the landowner has been lost; hence, a certified copy of the sale deed may be deemed valid in appropriate circumstances along with the police report and newspaper advertisements declaring its loss. Although a registered FIR is preferred, a lost report accompanied by a public notice should be sufficient to prove the existence of such a document to be absent, unless objection is raised within the period indicated in the notice. The fact that the bank has approved your loan and the search report has come clean adds strength to the transaction.In that respect, if you want to save yourself from legal tussles in the near future, you have to make certain that the certified copy is registered and duly noted in your sale deed, and no other claims exist on the property. You may then consider asking the builder to get a court order declaring the original sale deed lost, which adds another layer of legal security.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "context": "Asked 8 months ago in Labour",
    "question": "Travelled abroad without NOC from university",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queries.1) In your case, purchasing tickets and proceeding on leave without NOC is not advisable. Government employees, as you are also part of this system at universities, have Indian law making it necessary to obtain a No Objection Certificate for foreign travel as a check to transparency and accountability, as per the guidelines of the Department of Personnel and Training, DoPT. Hence, proceeding without NOC may call for disciplinary action in the form of treating the absence as unauthorized leave, issuing a show-cause notice or suspension for non-compliance.2) Such actions may be taken by the university under the service conduct rules governing the behavior of government employees. In fact, the consistent refusal or even delay in the issuance of the NOC may well be a basis for a complaint under the rubric of harassment. You may file a formal grievance with the committee of the university, pointing out the unwarranted delay when all conditions are satisfied, including consent from your Head of Department, and there would be no implication on classes.3) If it is a recurring issue, you would be well advised to take up the issue with the UGC and approach the CAT seeking redress for the delay and harassment inflicted upon you under service rules. You may even file a writ petition in the High Court for redress for the undue delay and non-issuance of the NOC, which hinders your rights and causes unwarranted distress.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In any case, your court marriage in the UK is valid under the Hindu law even if not registered in India but the marriage must have been solemnized according to the Hindu customs.  The failure to include this may lead to some complications with your legal ability especially when planning to undergo a divorce. The Indian law on divorce is based onHindu Marriage Actof 1955 and you can have the marriage dissolved whether or not it was celebrated in India. This marriage should not make prenuptial agreement an unenforceable agreement, though there might be such legal problem in India. Of course, you could have rights as a spouse pending maintenance and property division claim, although such rights may not be expressly as certain as when one registers. These matters should therefore be handled by a family law attorney knowledgeable in both the UK and the Indian law systems.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Married in the UK but husband doesn’t want to marry in India",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the event of divorce, Indian courts, even though your prenuptial agreement waives alimony or maintenance in the UK, are not bound to respect such agreements under Indian law. Prenuptial agreements are not specifically recognized under India as defined in any relevant laws and cannot be enforced in the way they have been derogated from their statutory rights of a spouse. Even in India, you may file for divorce, but you can still claim alimony or maintenance under Section 25 of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, or Section 125 of theCriminal Procedure Code, 1973, irrespective of the terms of the prenuptial agreement. Indian courts would evaluate the matter concerning fairness and justice and would take all points relating to financial dependency and contributions into account.However, if divorce proceedings are initiated within the UK territory and the court has jurisdiction over the couple also, Indian courts may even hold up for the UK proceedings. In the end, it would depend upon such law prevailing in the jurisdiction where the divorce is filed as to how that should be dealt with.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Divorce filing on the ground of cruelty against husband by wife",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I want to let you know that,you are entitled to seek divorce on grounds of cruelty, even though you reside with your wife. Till now, you have been suffering from physical as well as mental cruelties. Section 13(1)(ia) defines cruelty to include both physical as well as mental. All the audio recordings of her shouting, threatening, and trying to hit your son can be used in evidence to prove your case.There is no such law that requires you to leave the house before filing for divorce. Living together will not make you ineligible to seek divorce, especially when your concern remains the welfare of your child. It may be that desertion for 6 months forms part of proving desertion advice by your lawyer; in this case, it is a case of cruelty instead of desertion.Regarding the question you have further sought clarification on, your wife has absolutely no rights on your parents' property or properties. As per Hindu law, she is not entitled to claim any rights over your parents' ancestral or personal properties considering the fact that they have been staying apart for 9 long years and did not care to get in touch with her. If she files any claims of this nature, your parents will likely be impleaded in that case but they will not automatically be liable. It would be a declaration of their non-involvement with court action.There is very crucial presentation of all the evidence for the case, and a sound family lawyer would be capable enough to help create a strong case.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The PoA registration time must be precise and legitimate.2.The petition was filed after the case was filed, which is likely why the case was dismissed. This, however, can be contested on the grounds that it was carried out because of her deteriorating condition. There is merit to this case; in instances like this, procedural formalities have no place.3.In certain situations where the dismissal orders are purely procedural and will cause injustice, an individual may file an appeal under Article 227 to the High Court in addition to the Sessions Court appeal, which must be filed within 30 days of the judgment's announcement.4.Submit a writ petition or an appeal with the following focus: Mother's health and the pressing nature of the matter. The PoA's validity in light of disease. -Showing off all the evidence, which establishes her ownership prima facie.

    "question": "Case dismissed on the basis of Power of Attorney !!!",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queriesYou still have the option to appeal in the High Court even if the 30-day deadline has passed by requesting condonation of delay through Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963. This can be done by citing the medical reasons for your mother’s illness as the cause for the delay, not her absence.According to theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, a gift deed from your mother to you is considered lawful. Ownership of the property might be contested or forcefully taken, but you can challenge the situation under your name once the gift is finalized.The mother’s health issues fall under Section 32 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908, where a power of attorney has been given due to her current incapacity to act and someone is authorized to act on her behalf. If the dismissal was based on procedural reasons, an appeal would be possible because Indian law does not require the power of attorney to be executed during the filing of the case.Your lawyer’s procedural mistake can be used as a reason for appeal, as procedural errors should not result in the unfair dismissal of the plaintiff’s substantive rights. You can dispute this based on the belief that legal technicalities should not supersede fairness, as indicated by past rulings from the Supreme Court of India.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Travelled abroad without NOC from university",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queries.1) In your case, purchasing tickets and proceeding on leave without NOC is not advisable. Government employees, as you are also part of this system at universities, have Indian law making it necessary to obtain a No Objection Certificate for foreign travel as a check to transparency and accountability, as per the guidelines of the Department of Personnel and Training, DoPT. Hence, proceeding without NOC may call for disciplinary action in the form of treating the absence as unauthorized leave, issuing a show-cause notice or suspension for non-compliance.2) Such actions may be taken by the university under the service conduct rules governing the behavior of government employees. In fact, the consistent refusal or even delay in the issuance of the NOC may well be a basis for a complaint under the rubric of harassment. You may file a formal grievance with the committee of the university, pointing out the unwarranted delay when all conditions are satisfied, including consent from your Head of Department, and there would be no implication on classes.3) If it is a recurring issue, you would be well advised to take up the issue with the UGC and approach the CAT seeking redress for the delay and harassment inflicted upon you under service rules. You may even file a writ petition in the High Court for redress for the undue delay and non-issuance of the NOC, which hinders your rights and causes unwarranted distress.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The Indian law on divorce is based onHindu Marriage Actof 1955 and you can have the marriage dissolved whether or not it was celebrated in India. This marriage should not make prenuptial agreement an unenforceable agreement, though there might be such legal problem in India. Of course, you could have rights as a spouse pending maintenance and property division claim, although such rights may not be expressly as certain as when one registers.

    "question": "Married in the UK but husband doesn’t want to marry in India",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the event of divorce, Indian courts, even though your prenuptial agreement waives alimony or maintenance in the UK, are not bound to respect such agreements under Indian law. Prenuptial agreements are not specifically recognized under India as defined in any relevant laws and cannot be enforced in the way they have been derogated from their statutory rights of a spouse. Even in India, you may file for divorce, but you can still claim alimony or maintenance under Section 25 of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, or Section 125 of theCriminal Procedure Code, 1973, irrespective of the terms of the prenuptial agreement. Indian courts would evaluate the matter concerning fairness and justice and would take all points relating to financial dependency and contributions into account.However, if divorce proceedings are initiated within the UK territory and the court has jurisdiction over the couple also, Indian courts may even hold up for the UK proceedings. In the end, it would depend upon such law prevailing in the jurisdiction where the divorce is filed as to how that should be dealt with.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,I deeply sympathize with your situation regarding the loss of your valuable gold jewellery, and I understand how distressing this must be for you and your family. In Indian law there is a provision which allows the person to complain to the police even after so much delay.For theft, you should file an FIR under Section 303 of BNS Act. I think it is wise to file a complaint at both Bangalore and at your village in Andhra Pradesh since the theft may have taken place at either of these two places.It is usually accepted by the police especially bearing in mind that a lot of times one can give health issues as the cause of a delay in reporting the incident. Also, be sure to give information regarding the people who had access to the house, such as, the maids, the driver among others.You will get the police involved depending on the information you pass to them. Despite the fact that it has been five months now, it is vital to make the report at the earliest stage possible in order to increase the possibility of the recovery or else investigation.I hope this explanation meets your needs precisely.

    "answer": "Dear Client,I want to let you know that,in Indian law, in particular under the Registration Act, 1908, original sale deeds are primarily needed to be produced in case of trial. The original copy of the sale deed issued between the builder and the landowner has been lost; hence, a certified copy of the sale deed may be deemed valid in appropriate circumstances along with the police report and newspaper advertisements declaring its loss. Although a registered FIR is preferred, a lost report accompanied by a public notice should be sufficient to prove the existence of such a document to be absent, unless objection is raised within the period indicated in the notice. The fact that the bank has approved your loan and the search report has come clean adds strength to the transaction.In that respect, if you want to save yourself from legal tussles in the near future, you have to make certain that the certified copy is registered and duly noted in your sale deed, and no other claims exist on the property. You may then consider asking the builder to get a court order declaring the original sale deed lost, which adds another layer of legal security.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If they still don't comply, you can ask the Charity Commissioner to step in as he has supervisory authority under Section 41D of the Act. This clause gives the Commissioner the authority to dismiss trustees if they behave carelessly or violate trust.

Law entitles wives a basic right to reside in the matrimonial/ home, whether the house owned by her husband or his parents, a rented property or officially provided to him.- Hence, for claiming her residential right, medical expenses etc, and also for teaching a lesson to the family members of her husband, who subjected her torture &harassment, she should file a petition under the provisions ofDomestic ViolenceAct.3.  As per the Supreme Court, A wife has complete ownership rights over all her Streedhan, the gifts and money given to her before and after marriage. The denial of Streedhan to the wife makes the husband and in-laws liable for criminal charges.- And further, if the husband or his family members subjected a woman to cruelty for the dowry demand, then they can be booked under Section 498-A.- Your sister should lodge a written complaint against her husband & his family members, in the Women cell/Mahila Police, after mentioning all the details of torture &harassment.- The women cell firstly will try to reconcile between them, otherwise, they will lodge an FIR against her husband  who subjected your sister cruelty.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

Its indeed a inhumane behaviour, your sister under section 84 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (previously,Section 498Aof theIndian Penal Code), can register a complaint against her husband for physical and other forms of abuse and then get a restraining order that bars him from communicating with her as provided by the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct of 2005. It is necessary to record all incidences of violence without being violated through the use of pictures and videos in case of threats. She should report abuse to the police since it is her legal requirement in accordance to section 84 of BNS on cruelty. Moreover, she can inform local NGOs or women’s helplines including the National Women’s Helpline 181. She has to visit a lawyer who prosecutesdomestic violencecases, and maybe find out how she could deal well with the case.Hope you find this answer helpful in resolving your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "BDA property gift deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Regarding the issue of your mother-in-law wishing to execute a gift deed for the BDA-allotted site, it is important to consider the specific legal constraints associated with the property. As per BDA allotment rules, the sale or transfer of the allotted property is restricted based on a regulation that does not allow the separation of the property for 10 years from the date of allotment.As the allotment only occurred seven years ago then any dealing regarding the site, through sale or through gift deeds will definitely be considered against these regulations. While a gift deed is not a sale, it is a conveyance of property and as such BDA considers all such conveyances to be restricted until the end of the 10 year term.In case your mother-in-law goes on to execute the gift deed before this period is over then the BDA has the potential client’s right to sue and this can be in a bid to counter the allotment. It would of course be safer from a legal perspective to simply wait ten years, or alternatively apply to the BDA to find out whether an such a transfer, under any circumstances, is possible at all. It is for this reason I advised to conform to these regulations and seek legal advice from a specialized lawyer in order to ensure that your mother-in-law is fully compliant with the regulations outlined by BDA.I hope this insight provides the direction you need.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queriesYou still have the option to appeal in the High Court even if the 30-day deadline has passed by requesting condonation of delay through Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963. This can be done by citing the medical reasons for your mother’s illness as the cause for the delay, not her absence.According to theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, a gift deed from your mother to you is considered lawful. Ownership of the property might be contested or forcefully taken, but you can challenge the situation under your name once the gift is finalized.The mother’s health issues fall under Section 32 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908, where a power of attorney has been given due to her current incapacity to act and someone is authorized to act on her behalf. If the dismissal was based on procedural reasons, an appeal would be possible because Indian law does not require the power of attorney to be executed during the filing of the case.Your lawyer’s procedural mistake can be used as a reason for appeal, as procedural errors should not result in the unfair dismissal of the plaintiff’s substantive rights. You can dispute this based on the belief that legal technicalities should not supersede fairness, as indicated by past rulings from the Supreme Court of India.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Yet, it is advisable to consult a legal expert in India to ensure there are no extra steps necessary to confirm the validity of the decree.

However, it is ambiguous whether this condition would be relevant for you since the divorce took place overseas.

Also, this difference in treatment may encourage her brothers to desire that their sister marry at the earliest possible opportunity, so that she will not compete with them for inheritance.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Agricultural land Uttar Pradesh",
    "answer": "Dear Client,As per your concerns regarding the agricultural land in Uttar Pradesh and your married sister’s actions, let me clarify your legal standing under Indian laws.Firstly, according to theHindu Succession Actof 1956 with amendment in year 2005, the rights of the married as well as unmarried daughter regarding their father’s property including the agricultural one are identical.Due to UP Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950, in Uttar Pradesh married daughters were not allowed to take agriculture land but Supreme Court of India in recent judgments has clarified that daughters also are co-heirs and thus entitled to equal share in ancestral property.Thus your married sister does have your right to the agricultural land.As for your mother’s share, since she died intestate, this share of the property will now go to legal heirs which are you and your sister.However, as far as the existing legislation which governs the property rights in the country concerns, your sister has the legal right to also stake a claim over the share of your mother’s portion.The same can be said for the other assets like the flat and fixed deposits, for nomination in your sisters favor legally entitles her unless of course a civil lawsuit is filed against the nomination.In my opinion, you should object to mutation proceedings and if needed file a partition suit in the civil court to protect your share in the said property.In light of these issues, it is essential to contact a competent lawyer immediately to protect your inheritance from your sister and manage with any unjustified misuse.Please seek further legal advice from a property lawyer as regards to the actions that should be taken especially in compiling evidence, filing for claims among other matters.I hope this perspective adds value to your considerations.

    "answer": "- Delhi High Court granted divorce to a man on the grounds of his in-laws' frequent interference in his marital life and noted that parents should \"draw a line\" and let their daughters lead a happy, married life.- Further, the Allahabad High Court in the matter of Kumar Devi & Anr. V. State of U.P. & Ors stated that, nobody including the parents of a man and woman can interfere in the couple's married life and their living together if the two individuals are of legal age.- Hence, they cannot interfere in your personal matter after visiting again and again- Your wife should object for the same , otherwise you can file a divorce petition before the court on this ground.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "How can I prevent my wife's troublesome parents/siblings from visiting my home?",
    "answer": "First of all, I'm assuming it's women's cell of police. See, the police hasn't lodged any complaint against you, nor are you summoned for questioning. You can refuse the counselling and refuse to go & I would advice you to refuse to go for any counselling at police station (women's cell). You' must go only if you are summoned for questioning.My advice is based on fact that the police isn't professional trained for counselling. What happens is they pressurize both parties not to complain whatsoever and settle the matter amongst themselves. So it's just a waste of time. You go to professional marriage counsellors for counselling.As to the legalities of the situation,  well you are well within your rights to prohibit disagreeable individuals, the threatening rowdy types from entering your home, be it your wife's relatives and/or parents. Be rest assured, it doesn't amount to any cruelty and hence, you can be defended before any court of law on this count.Rather it's you, who suffers from mental cruelty and harassment on the count of your wife allowing such elements to interfere in your sacrosanct matrimonial relationship. Hence,  I would suggest you encourage your wife to seek assistance of a professional marriage counsellor along with you so that both of you can enjoy matrimonial bliss.As to your wife not yielding to 4, and then your legal remedies,  there are quite a few options involving litigation. You could opt for judicial separation, or petition restraining your wife to entertain such elements at your home without your consent. Divorce would be last resort.Which remedy would best suit your purpose and handling that litigation ---- for that I require an exhaustive consultation session with you first. You need to visit me for that. I'm based in Mumbai /navimumbai just as you are, so it shouldn't be much of an issue for you to visit me.९८२०८९७८८४ (nine eight two zero eight nine seven eight eight four)Netra Mohanchandra PantAdvocate, Navi Mumbai1591 Answers5 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Netra Mohanchandra Pant"

    "question": "How can I prevent my wife's troublesome parents/siblings from visiting my home?",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I recognize the difficulties you are facing due to the repeated disruptive actions of your wife’s parents and siblings, and your intent to prevent them from entering your home. According to Indian laws, the following is a formal legal approach to address this matter.Since you are the owner or the lawful possessor of your residence, you have every right to control who should gain access to your home or not. The previous placement, providing your wife an option to visit her parents without the interference of relatives you consider as problematic, yet denying them access to your home, was logical. Since your wife is now going to complain that you are harassing her mentally by preventing her family from visiting, I want to reiterate to you that you have never locked her out of your house from seeing her family and the restrictions are placed to ensure that you are not disturbed in your home. When counseling, it should be illustrated why certain past incidents of harassment and misconduct had to occur from her family members, and how the previous agreement made by both families was an attempt of good will. Your wife has rights to visit her family members, that you as a husband cannot refuse, but that does not mean the people who have been causing disturbances are free to enter into your home. You may ask the women’s cell or court to allow you to not have disturbance in your home while at the same time still allow your wife to visit her family as she wishes.Thus, you should stick to your decision to let your wife visit her family without limitation while explaining the legitimate grounds for limiting access of those causing disturbances to your home. In the meantime, it is also recommended to consult a lawyer about filing an injunction or any other kind of protection from further harassment.I hope this response is helpful in addressing your challenges.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Though some may think courts generally support women in divorce situations, but the outcomes really depend on the unique factors and evidence provided for each case. TheHindu Marriage Actallows a husband to file for divorce for reasons such as mental cruelty, which courts accept if reasonably shown. Consulting a divorce lawyer can raise your chances of a positive result by making sure your case is thoroughly organized and well managed. You should note that courts investigate the qualities of each case distinctly, and legal principles shape their decisions.

Being the Karta, you manage the affairs of HUF, such as property acquisitions, yet all significant decisions involve the consultation of all adult members. Applicable statutes contain theHindu Succession Act, 1956, which defines rights pertaining to ancestral property, the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956  and the Income Tax Act, 1961, offering tax breaks for HUFs.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queriesYou still have the option to appeal in the High Court even if the 30-day deadline has passed by requesting condonation of delay through Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963. This can be done by citing the medical reasons for your mother’s illness as the cause for the delay, not her absence.According to theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, a gift deed from your mother to you is considered lawful. Ownership of the property might be contested or forcefully taken, but you can challenge the situation under your name once the gift is finalized.The mother’s health issues fall under Section 32 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908, where a power of attorney has been given due to her current incapacity to act and someone is authorized to act on her behalf. If the dismissal was based on procedural reasons, an appeal would be possible because Indian law does not require the power of attorney to be executed during the filing of the case.Your lawyer’s procedural mistake can be used as a reason for appeal, as procedural errors should not result in the unfair dismissal of the plaintiff’s substantive rights. You can dispute this based on the belief that legal technicalities should not supersede fairness, as indicated by past rulings from the Supreme Court of India.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Laws include the MC Act concerning the building permissions and any disciplinary actions that in regard to constructions that has been done without permission and BNS concerning criminal trespass and creating jeopardy. Besides, if construction has impacts on the environment the Environment Protection Act may also be imposed.Hence that is why in an effort to support the community’s perception of you as someone with authority, assemble all proofs and documents that are relevant to the unauthorized construction inclusive of FIRs letters to the municipal bodies. Cooperate with your advocate to put much weight behind your locus standi and to provide proof of infringements when in a hearing. Emphasize the fact that the agreement is fraudulent in the sale deed or in the clearances for construction especially the letter which shows that the Chief Electrical Inspector has indicated that no licence was given for the erection of the lift. If your interests are at large, public concern on aspects such as human rights and equity, you may decide to start a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) case. Seek KMC for clarification on the next processes of accountability of enforcement actions on unauthorized construction.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Lost original sale deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I want to let you know that,in Indian law, in particular under the Registration Act, 1908, original sale deeds are primarily needed to be produced in case of trial. The original copy of the sale deed issued between the builder and the landowner has been lost; hence, a certified copy of the sale deed may be deemed valid in appropriate circumstances along with the police report and newspaper advertisements declaring its loss. Although a registered FIR is preferred, a lost report accompanied by a public notice should be sufficient to prove the existence of such a document to be absent, unless objection is raised within the period indicated in the notice. The fact that the bank has approved your loan and the search report has come clean adds strength to the transaction.In that respect, if you want to save yourself from legal tussles in the near future, you have to make certain that the certified copy is registered and duly noted in your sale deed, and no other claims exist on the property. You may then consider asking the builder to get a court order declaring the original sale deed lost, which adds another layer of legal security.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Hence for claiming the maintenance for her &child, she should file a petition under section125 CrPc.- Her husband is under legal obligation to provide the same to her at any cost, even he is working or not.2. Law entitles wives a basic right to reside in the matrimonial/ home, whether the house owned by her husband or his parents, a rented property or officially provided to him.- Hence, for claiming her residential right, medical expenses etc, and also for teaching a lesson to the family members of her husband, who subjected her torture &harassment, she should file a petition under the provisions ofDomestic ViolenceAct.3.  As per the Supreme Court, A wife has complete ownership rights over all her Streedhan, the gifts and money given to her before and after marriage. The denial of Streedhan to the wife makes the husband and in-laws liable for criminal charges.- And further, if the husband or his family members subjected a woman to cruelty for the dowry demand, then they can be booked under Section 498-A.- Your sister should lodge a written complaint against her husband & his family members, in the Women cell/Mahila Police, after mentioning all the details of torture &harassment.- The women cell firstly will try to reconcile between them, otherwise, they will lodge an FIR against her husband  who subjected your sister cruelty.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

Its indeed a inhumane behaviour, your sister under section 84 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (previously,Section 498Aof theIndian Penal Code), can register a complaint against her husband for physical and other forms of abuse and then get a restraining order that bars him from communicating with her as provided by the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct of 2005. It is necessary to record all incidences of violence without being violated through the use of pictures and videos in case of threats. She should report abuse to the police since it is her legal requirement in accordance to section 84 of BNS on cruelty. Moreover, she can inform local NGOs or women’s helplines including the National Women’s Helpline 181. She has to visit a lawyer who prosecutesdomestic violencecases, and maybe find out how she could deal well with the case.Hope you find this answer helpful in resolving your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queries.1.If a senior citizen has very serious health concerns and is unable to attend in court, he or she may award a child the power of attorney. The PoA registration time must be precise and legitimate.2.The petition was filed after the case was filed, which is likely why the case was dismissed. This, however, can be contested on the grounds that it was carried out because of her deteriorating condition. There is merit to this case; in instances like this, procedural formalities have no place.3.In certain situations where the dismissal orders are purely procedural and will cause injustice, an individual may file an appeal under Article 227 to the High Court in addition to the Sessions Court appeal, which must be filed within 30 days of the judgment's announcement.4.Submit a writ petition or an appeal with the following focus: Mother's health and the pressing nature of the matter. The PoA's validity in light of disease. -Showing off all the evidence, which establishes her ownership prima facie.

    "answer": "1. The gift deed of the property subsequent to institution of the suit will not automatically entitle the beneficiary to replace the plaintiff to conduct the case.The plaintiff either has to withdraw the case or to authorise the beneficiary to continue the case by giving power of attorney deed for some valid reasons2. It is not advisable to transfer or alienate the suit property during pending litigation, if the defendant is objecting to it and seeks to dismiss the case for this reason then it will be an embarrassing situation to the plaintiff.Hence don't try to use such fancy ideas which may become fatal to your case.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

The documents in possession to establish her medical conditions are sufficient to prove that she will not be able to appear in person before court on all regular hearings hence she can be permitted to be represented by her power agent.2. The decision of judge in dismissing the application seeking permission to be represented through the power agent is not justified hence a civil revision petition before high court can be filed seeking relief.3. There's no legal infirmity to represent your ailing mother by a power of attorney deed in your favour.4.

    "question": "Case dismissed on the basis of Power of Attorney !!!",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queriesYou still have the option to appeal in the High Court even if the 30-day deadline has passed by requesting condonation of delay through Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963. This can be done by citing the medical reasons for your mother’s illness as the cause for the delay, not her absence.According to theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, a gift deed from your mother to you is considered lawful. Ownership of the property might be contested or forcefully taken, but you can challenge the situation under your name once the gift is finalized.The mother’s health issues fall under Section 32 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908, where a power of attorney has been given due to her current incapacity to act and someone is authorized to act on her behalf. If the dismissal was based on procedural reasons, an appeal would be possible because Indian law does not require the power of attorney to be executed during the filing of the case.Your lawyer’s procedural mistake can be used as a reason for appeal, as procedural errors should not result in the unfair dismissal of the plaintiff’s substantive rights. You can dispute this based on the belief that legal technicalities should not supersede fairness, as indicated by past rulings from the Supreme Court of India.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In continuation of the DEPT's letter of 36012/22/93- Estt./SCT) dated 15th November, 1993, I am directed to say that it has been represented to this Department that persons belonging to OBCS who have migrated from one State to another for the purpose of employment, education etc. experience great difficulty in obtaining caste certificates from the States from which they have migrated, in order to remove this difficulty it has been decided that the prescribed authority of a State/UT Administration in terms of the DEPT letter aNo.16012/22/93-Estt. (SCT) dated 15th November, 1993 may issue the OBCS certificates to a person who has migrated from another States on the production of a genuine certificate issued to his father by the prescribed authority of the State his father's origin except where the prescribed authority feels that a detailed enquiry is necessary through the state of origin before the issue of the certificate.2. The certificates will be issued irrespectively of whether the OBC candidate in question is included in the list of OBC pertaining to the State/U.T. to which the person has migrated. The facility does not alter the OBC status of the person in relation to the one at the other State/U.T. The OBC person on migration from the State/U.T. of his origin in another State/U.T. where his caste is not in the OBC list is entitled to the concession/benefits admissible to the OBCS from the state of his origin and Union Government but not from the State where he has migrated.\"3) rely upon said circular for issue of OBC NL certificateAjay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98567 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,I  understand what you are going through. I want to make it clear thatThe 1993 National Commission for Backward Classes Act has made state-by-state recognition of OBCs possible. Only if the caste is included in the Central List of OBCs of the state where the applicant resides is it permissible to issue an OBC Non-Creamy Layer certificate. Therefore, the caste must be acknowledged in the state where migrants are residing. The Maharashtra authorities are justified in rejecting the certificate, as the Ezhava caste is not included in the Central OBC list. Since the applicant does not typically dwell in Kerala, the authorities there are also justified in accordance with the domicile requirements. Following that, either the restoration of regular residency in Kerala or the satisfaction of the OBC requirements in accordance with Maharashtra's Central List of OBCs.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Laws include the MC Act concerning the building permissions and any disciplinary actions that in regard to constructions that has been done without permission and BNS concerning criminal trespass and creating jeopardy. Besides, if construction has impacts on the environment the Environment Protection Act may also be imposed.Hence that is why in an effort to support the community’s perception of you as someone with authority, assemble all proofs and documents that are relevant to the unauthorized construction inclusive of FIRs letters to the municipal bodies. Cooperate with your advocate to put much weight behind your locus standi and to provide proof of infringements when in a hearing. Emphasize the fact that the agreement is fraudulent in the sale deed or in the clearances for construction especially the letter which shows that the Chief Electrical Inspector has indicated that no licence was given for the erection of the lift. If your interests are at large, public concern on aspects such as human rights and equity, you may decide to start a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) case. Seek KMC for clarification on the next processes of accountability of enforcement actions on unauthorized construction.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Lost original sale deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I want to let you know that,in Indian law, in particular under the Registration Act, 1908, original sale deeds are primarily needed to be produced in case of trial. The original copy of the sale deed issued between the builder and the landowner has been lost; hence, a certified copy of the sale deed may be deemed valid in appropriate circumstances along with the police report and newspaper advertisements declaring its loss. Although a registered FIR is preferred, a lost report accompanied by a public notice should be sufficient to prove the existence of such a document to be absent, unless objection is raised within the period indicated in the notice. The fact that the bank has approved your loan and the search report has come clean adds strength to the transaction.In that respect, if you want to save yourself from legal tussles in the near future, you have to make certain that the certified copy is registered and duly noted in your sale deed, and no other claims exist on the property. You may then consider asking the builder to get a court order declaring the original sale deed lost, which adds another layer of legal security.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "- Your sister can file a complaint as information before the police and higher official after giving details of his cruelty towards her- She can also approach the Women cell against him on the said ground , however she has following right:-As per law, A wife has the right to claim decent living standards and basic comforts of life from her husband. Hence for claiming the maintenance for her &child, she should file a petition under section125 CrPc.- Her husband is under legal obligation to provide the same to her at any cost, even he is working or not.2. Law entitles wives a basic right to reside in the matrimonial/ home, whether the house owned by her husband or his parents, a rented property or officially provided to him.- Hence, for claiming her residential right, medical expenses etc, and also for teaching a lesson to the family members of her husband, who subjected her torture &harassment, she should file a petition under the provisions ofDomestic ViolenceAct.3.  As per the Supreme Court, A wife has complete ownership rights over all her Streedhan, the gifts and money given to her before and after marriage. The denial of Streedhan to the wife makes the husband and in-laws liable for criminal charges.- And further, if the husband or his family members subjected a woman to cruelty for the dowry demand, then they can be booked under Section 498-A.- Your sister should lodge a written complaint against her husband & his family members, in the Women cell/Mahila Police, after mentioning all the details of torture &harassment.- The women cell firstly will try to reconcile between them, otherwise, they will lodge an FIR against her husband  who subjected your sister cruelty.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "Dear Client,It is so bad that your sister is trapped with her abusive husband and she needs to do so much to protect her and her child especially at this times. Its indeed a inhumane behaviour, your sister under section 84 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (previously,Section 498Aof theIndian Penal Code), can register a complaint against her husband for physical and other forms of abuse and then get a restraining order that bars him from communicating with her as provided by the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct of 2005. It is necessary to record all incidences of violence without being violated through the use of pictures and videos in case of threats. She should report abuse to the police since it is her legal requirement in accordance to section 84 of BNS on cruelty. Moreover, she can inform local NGOs or women’s helplines including the National Women’s Helpline 181. She has to visit a lawyer who prosecutesdomestic violencecases, and maybe find out how she could deal well with the case.Hope you find this answer helpful in resolving your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queries.1.If a senior citizen has very serious health concerns and is unable to attend in court, he or she may award a child the power of attorney. The PoA registration time must be precise and legitimate.2.The petition was filed after the case was filed, which is likely why the case was dismissed. This, however, can be contested on the grounds that it was carried out because of her deteriorating condition. There is merit to this case; in instances like this, procedural formalities have no place.3.In certain situations where the dismissal orders are purely procedural and will cause injustice, an individual may file an appeal under Article 227 to the High Court in addition to the Sessions Court appeal, which must be filed within 30 days of the judgment's announcement.4.Submit a writ petition or an appeal with the following focus: Mother's health and the pressing nature of the matter. The PoA's validity in light of disease. -Showing off all the evidence, which establishes her ownership prima facie.

    "question": "Case dismissed on the basis of Power of Attorney !!!",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queriesYou still have the option to appeal in the High Court even if the 30-day deadline has passed by requesting condonation of delay through Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963. This can be done by citing the medical reasons for your mother’s illness as the cause for the delay, not her absence.According to theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, a gift deed from your mother to you is considered lawful. Ownership of the property might be contested or forcefully taken, but you can challenge the situation under your name once the gift is finalized.The mother’s health issues fall under Section 32 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908, where a power of attorney has been given due to her current incapacity to act and someone is authorized to act on her behalf. If the dismissal was based on procedural reasons, an appeal would be possible because Indian law does not require the power of attorney to be executed during the filing of the case.Your lawyer’s procedural mistake can be used as a reason for appeal, as procedural errors should not result in the unfair dismissal of the plaintiff’s substantive rights. You can dispute this based on the belief that legal technicalities should not supersede fairness, as indicated by past rulings from the Supreme Court of India.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Laws include the MC Act concerning the building permissions and any disciplinary actions that in regard to constructions that has been done without permission and BNS concerning criminal trespass and creating jeopardy. Besides, if construction has impacts on the environment the Environment Protection Act may also be imposed.Hence that is why in an effort to support the community’s perception of you as someone with authority, assemble all proofs and documents that are relevant to the unauthorized construction inclusive of FIRs letters to the municipal bodies. Cooperate with your advocate to put much weight behind your locus standi and to provide proof of infringements when in a hearing. Emphasize the fact that the agreement is fraudulent in the sale deed or in the clearances for construction especially the letter which shows that the Chief Electrical Inspector has indicated that no licence was given for the erection of the lift. If your interests are at large, public concern on aspects such as human rights and equity, you may decide to start a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) case. Seek KMC for clarification on the next processes of accountability of enforcement actions on unauthorized construction.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Lost original sale deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I want to let you know that,in Indian law, in particular under the Registration Act, 1908, original sale deeds are primarily needed to be produced in case of trial. The original copy of the sale deed issued between the builder and the landowner has been lost; hence, a certified copy of the sale deed may be deemed valid in appropriate circumstances along with the police report and newspaper advertisements declaring its loss. Although a registered FIR is preferred, a lost report accompanied by a public notice should be sufficient to prove the existence of such a document to be absent, unless objection is raised within the period indicated in the notice. The fact that the bank has approved your loan and the search report has come clean adds strength to the transaction.In that respect, if you want to save yourself from legal tussles in the near future, you have to make certain that the certified copy is registered and duly noted in your sale deed, and no other claims exist on the property. You may then consider asking the builder to get a court order declaring the original sale deed lost, which adds another layer of legal security.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "- Your sister can file a complaint as information before the police and higher official after giving details of his cruelty towards her- She can also approach the Women cell against him on the said ground , however she has following right:-As per law, A wife has the right to claim decent living standards and basic comforts of life from her husband. Hence for claiming the maintenance for her &child, she should file a petition under section125 CrPc.- Her husband is under legal obligation to provide the same to her at any cost, even he is working or not.2. Law entitles wives a basic right to reside in the matrimonial/ home, whether the house owned by her husband or his parents, a rented property or officially provided to him.- Hence, for claiming her residential right, medical expenses etc, and also for teaching a lesson to the family members of her husband, who subjected her torture &harassment, she should file a petition under the provisions ofDomestic ViolenceAct.3.  As per the Supreme Court, A wife has complete ownership rights over all her Streedhan, the gifts and money given to her before and after marriage. The denial of Streedhan to the wife makes the husband and in-laws liable for criminal charges.- And further, if the husband or his family members subjected a woman to cruelty for the dowry demand, then they can be booked under Section 498-A.- Your sister should lodge a written complaint against her husband & his family members, in the Women cell/Mahila Police, after mentioning all the details of torture &harassment.- The women cell firstly will try to reconcile between them, otherwise, they will lodge an FIR against her husband  who subjected your sister cruelty.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "Dear Client,It is so bad that your sister is trapped with her abusive husband and she needs to do so much to protect her and her child especially at this times. Its indeed a inhumane behaviour, your sister under section 84 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (previously,Section 498Aof theIndian Penal Code), can register a complaint against her husband for physical and other forms of abuse and then get a restraining order that bars him from communicating with her as provided by the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct of 2005. It is necessary to record all incidences of violence without being violated through the use of pictures and videos in case of threats. She should report abuse to the police since it is her legal requirement in accordance to section 84 of BNS on cruelty. Moreover, she can inform local NGOs or women’s helplines including the National Women’s Helpline 181. She has to visit a lawyer who prosecutesdomestic violencecases, and maybe find out how she could deal well with the case.Hope you find this answer helpful in resolving your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Lost original sale deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I want to let you know that,in Indian law, in particular under the Registration Act, 1908, original sale deeds are primarily needed to be produced in case of trial. The original copy of the sale deed issued between the builder and the landowner has been lost; hence, a certified copy of the sale deed may be deemed valid in appropriate circumstances along with the police report and newspaper advertisements declaring its loss. Although a registered FIR is preferred, a lost report accompanied by a public notice should be sufficient to prove the existence of such a document to be absent, unless objection is raised within the period indicated in the notice. The fact that the bank has approved your loan and the search report has come clean adds strength to the transaction.In that respect, if you want to save yourself from legal tussles in the near future, you have to make certain that the certified copy is registered and duly noted in your sale deed, and no other claims exist on the property. You may then consider asking the builder to get a court order declaring the original sale deed lost, which adds another layer of legal security.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

I think it is wise to file a complaint at both Bangalore and at your village in Andhra Pradesh since the theft may have taken place at either of these two places.It is usually accepted by the police especially bearing in mind that a lot of times one can give health issues as the cause of a delay in reporting the incident.

As your father received the property through a partition suit, it has its ancestral nature. This means the property is not his self-acquired property. Also, the Mitakehara school of Hindi law is applicable in ancestral property, as you and your sister being born before the partition  in 1997, are considered coparceners by birth. According to Hindu law, all coparceners have equal and automatic rights to their ancestral property, which cannot be taken away by a will or gift. Hence,Your father cannot dispose of the whole property without your permission. The property is subject to your equal rights, and any step to transfer it without your approval would be legally challengeable.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "When does ancestral property become self acquired?",
    "answer": "Dear Client,If your father got a portion of the ancestral property through a court division, then the that part of property is regarded as his self-acquired property and he can do whatever he wants with it. In the case of Uttam vs. Subagh Singh, it was held by the Supreme court that where the ancestral property has been divided, the share which has been allotted to each of the parties becomes his separate property. Hence, you and your sister cannot lay your hands on your father’s share of the property without his consent either by gifting or inheriting. TheHindu Succession Act, 1956 makes it clear that the children have rights in the ancestral property by birth but the rights are excluded for the joints which are partitioned. You and your sister do not have the authority to give your father consent in order for him to sell, transfer or manage the share. For any further actions that you may wish to take concerning your father’s decisions it is advisable to engage an advocate expert in property law so that he or she can clarify you more.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,I want to let you know that,in Indian law, in particular under the Registration Act, 1908, original sale deeds are primarily needed to be produced in case of trial. The original copy of the sale deed issued between the builder and the landowner has been lost; hence, a certified copy of the sale deed may be deemed valid in appropriate circumstances along with the police report and newspaper advertisements declaring its loss. Although a registered FIR is preferred, a lost report accompanied by a public notice should be sufficient to prove the existence of such a document to be absent, unless objection is raised within the period indicated in the notice. The fact that the bank has approved your loan and the search report has come clean adds strength to the transaction.In that respect, if you want to save yourself from legal tussles in the near future, you have to make certain that the certified copy is registered and duly noted in your sale deed, and no other claims exist on the property. You may then consider asking the builder to get a court order declaring the original sale deed lost, which adds another layer of legal security.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Family Non-Responsiveness:Even when it touches on matters of the family, it is not rare to find a family ceasing to be communicative on such issues, and this could be as a result of several reasons, such as feeling uncomfortable or just avoiding the issue.3. Jurisdiction: It should be noted that one can file for divorce under the specified grounds in Delhi, Faridabad, or Hyderabad as per the places where the couple has resided or the marriage has been solemnized.4. Counter Blast Cases: If you initiated the divorce by filing for one and then she files false cases, you could claim that they are in response to your action, but each and every case will be tried on its merit.5. False Complaints: Ordinary arrest is not called immediate arrest; rather, false complaints are followed by investigation most of the time.6. Proving Cohabitation: To support your statement on the basis that she lives with an ex, you want to produce hard evidence in the form of a witness statement or interaction history.7. Hotel Proof:Records of hotel stays that have been gotten legally can be used in court, and this is very important.

    "question": "When does ancestral property become self acquired?",
    "answer": "Dear Client,According to Indian law, specifically theHindu Succession Act, of 1956, a property that is inherited from a common ancestor is considered as ancestral property. As your father received the property through a partition suit, it has its ancestral nature. This means the property is not his self-acquired property. Also, the Mitakehara school of Hindi law is applicable in ancestral property, as you and your sister being born before the partition  in 1997, are considered coparceners by birth. According to Hindu law, all coparceners have equal and automatic rights to their ancestral property, which cannot be taken away by a will or gift. Hence,Your father cannot dispose of the whole property without your permission. The property is subject to your equal rights, and any step to transfer it without your approval would be legally challengeable.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "- The Supreme Court of India , in the matter of Maktul Versus Manbhari & Others held that “ the only property that can be called ancestral property is property inherited by person from father, grandfather and great-grandfather. This implies that only that property which has flown undivided across four generations is called ancestral property.- Further, once an ancestral property is partitioned amongst the coparceners it loses the characteristic of ancestral property and become Self acquired property.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "When does ancestral property become self acquired?",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Based on the legal principles which is established in Rohit Chauhan vs Surinder Singh &Ors(2013),the property which your father received through the 1997 partition cannot be termed as his self-acquired property.At the time of partition,as you and your sister were already born,so the property assumed the nature of coparcenary property upon partition.In Hindu law, as affirmed by the Supreme Court in the Rohit Chauhan case if any property received by any father in a partition is termed as separate property only if no coparceners exist at the time of partition.However,when coparceners are already born,they automatically receive an interest in the property by birth.Therefore,as you and your sister both were born before the partition ,both of you hold equal rights in the property as coparceners.Your father cannot take it as self-acquired property, it means he cannot transfer the property to someone without your consent.Any such transfer would be subject to challenge before the court since you and your sister both are entitled to your shares by birth under Hindu law.Thank you.Hope this answers your query .Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "When does ancestral property become self acquired?",
    "answer": "Dear Client,If your father got a portion of the ancestral property through a court division, then the that part of property is regarded as his self-acquired property and he can do whatever he wants with it. In the case of Uttam vs. Subagh Singh, it was held by the Supreme court that where the ancestral property has been divided, the share which has been allotted to each of the parties becomes his separate property. Hence, you and your sister cannot lay your hands on your father’s share of the property without his consent either by gifting or inheriting. TheHindu Succession Act, 1956 makes it clear that the children have rights in the ancestral property by birth but the rights are excluded for the joints which are partitioned. You and your sister do not have the authority to give your father consent in order for him to sell, transfer or manage the share. For any further actions that you may wish to take concerning your father’s decisions it is advisable to engage an advocate expert in property law so that he or she can clarify you more.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Unregistered and unstamped forged MOU challenging",
    "answer": "Dear Client,There are several legal grounds that can be used to counter the MOU that your father-in-law’s siblings have formulated. First, the MOU is signed without stamp and registration hence cannot be invocated under the Indian Stamp Act. Thus the MOU may be held to come under Section 14(d) of the Specific Relief Act and therefore cannot be specifically enforced. If there were omission of consideration or if the MOU was prepared and signed with fraudulent intention (for example, using letterhead with prior consent) than such considerations would make the MOU legally void under the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Your lawyer should file an application to dismiss the suit based on these argument and further rebut the admissibility of the MOU as evidence. Similarly, relevant case laws like Royal Orchids vs. Kulbir Singh Kohli & Anr. where the court stated that the effect of such agreements cannot be achieved where the agreement fails to meet the basic legal formalities.Hope this answer solves your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,While it is legally possible for a Pakistani citizen to marry an Indian citizen under theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, while on a tourist visa, this is generally discouraged. Marrying on a tourist visa might create complications, including issues with visa extension and legal status in India. After marriage, your husband would need to apply for an extension of his stay in India. He can apply for an X Visa (Entry Visa) based on marriage to an Indian citizen. This visa is initially granted for a year but can be extended annually.The documents required for a continuous stay include valid passport and visa, marriage certificate, proof of residence in India, application for X visa, a letter of recommendation from the Indian spouse and so on. After marriage, apply for the X Visa. Each year, apply for an extension of the X Visa through the Foreigners Regional Registration Office. Maintain proper documentation of your husband's legal stay and marriage for each extension.Under Section 5(1)(c) of the Citizenship Act, 1955, your husband can apply for Indian citizenship by naturalization after residing in India for at least 7 years. The stay must be continuous and on a valid visa. The process involves proving good character, intent to reside in India, and fulfilling other criteria set by the Ministry of Home Affairs.An X Visa does not grant work rights. To work legally, your husband would need to obtain an Employment Visa, which can be difficult for Pakistani citizens due to stringent security checks. You may explore the possibility of converting the X Visa to an Employment Visa if your husband secures a job offer.Foreigners on an X Visa are not eligible for an Aadhar card. However, your husband can use his passport and visa documents to obtain a Permanent Account Number (PAN) card, which can help in opening a bank account. He can open an NRO (Non-Resident Ordinary) account in India using his visa and passport as identification, along with proof of address in India.During the 7- year period, your husband can visit Pakistan, but re-entry into India will require re-application for a visa. Each visit outside India could affect his eligibility for citizenship, as continuous residence is required. After 7- years, travel restrictions may still apply due to existing Indo- Pak relations.You and your husband can decide the religion of your children. There is no legal obligation for children to follow the religion of either parent. Children from interfaith marriages are typically free to choose their religion upon reaching adulthood.Your ownership of immovable property in India remains unchanged after marriage. Indian property laws do not discriminate based on the nationality or religion of the spouse. Your ownership of immovable property in India remains unchanged after marriage. Indian property laws do not discriminate based on the nationality or religion of the spouse.As a couple, you can adopt under the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 (if you choose to follow Hindu law) or the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.

    "question": "Sale deed and 7/12",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The case discussed here contains profound legal perspectives specifically concerning the ownership of land as well as legalities of transactions in the farming community of Karjat, Maharashtra. According to the Indian law particularly the Indian Stamp Act and Registration Act the sale and purchase of property are unenforceable unless it is registered and stamp duty is paid. The 7/12 extract also shows that the certificate of title shows that the land is owned by the society and not individual members without it being stated in the bylaws. Even in instances where share certificates are issued to shareholders, the shareholders do not own the land. Members should consult the lawyers on their rights and try to negotiate with the society’s managing committee to assist in registration of the plots. Besides, they may consider paying stamp duty later and if required also, can complain to the Registrar of Societies or even go to the court to claim their rights. There is a need to follow legal provisions in an effort to pursue the interests of the individuals that are involved in property transactions.Hope you find this answer suitable for resolving you query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The action taken by the housing society wherein the plots have been auctioned and the payments collected without proper registration and payment of stamp duty is unlawful as per the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 as well as the Registration Act, 1908. Unregistered transactions do not convey the legal title therefore, notarized agreement to sell is invalid. The society has a responsibility in the enforcement of these laws and cannot set by-laws that negate legal provisions. As members, you can force the society to register documents by approaching the managing committee, or even report the society to the authorities in the event that the managing committee does not act as expected. Members who do not register may be subject to litigation and the possibility of the entire land being sold without consideration of their rights. It is recommended to seek consultation from a real estate lawyer to safeguard your own interests and to make sure that the society complies with the legal requirements.Hope you find this answer suitable for resolving you query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In order not to face wrongful expulsion remember your rights and the reasons for expulsion like- failure in payment of dues or engaging in detrimental activities. If expelled without such procedures, you can appeal it to the Registrar of Cooperative Societies or sue it in civil court. On compensation, you will probably be paid for the shares you have in the society within three months if expelled, but this will only happen if the society does not forfeit it.Hope you find this advice beneficial.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Secondly, revisions against older orders are not normally sustainable. Thirdly, Person B has no standing to sue since the property was sold to Person C in July 2021 and therefore doesn’t have any legal interest in the property.

Let meexplained a straightforward technique to address this issue pursuant to the Indian laws.First, as the builder has not returned your money and the cheque which you presented to him has been dishonoured this is considered a breach of contract.Nonetheless, you should first write a legal notice to the builder for due payment and interest towards the delayed amount.There is usually a response from the builder to this notice.On failure to grant the payment after receiving the said notice, the builder can be reported to the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum.Such messages of this forum can assist you to recover your lost money and in addition, claim for compensation for the inconvenience.Also, you can seek civil remedy under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, for the bounced cheque so as to claim the amount along with the criminal sections of the bounced cheque.Despite the fact that the project is not yet registered under RERA you can report the builder to RERA if he has deceived you or if he has not followed the proper channel.It is advisable that one should seek service of a property lawyer who may assist one in undertaking these steps and he or she protects you in the process.These are measures that should assist you to get your money back and reduce stress that you are undergoing.I hope this information brings clarity to your situation.

    "answer": "-  There is no law to forfeit the booking amount for the cancellation, and the deduction is done at the builder’s discretion.- Hence, legally, the builder cannot deduct any money out of the advance payment you have made for the booking till the time; a builder-buyer agreement is made and registered with the sub-registrar.- Further, A builder-buyer agreement is not created until the buyer pays at least 10 per cent of the property value.- Further, as per RERA, home-buyers can cancel allotment of the apartment booked with a builder at any stage even if there is no default on the part of the developer. The builder is bound by law to return the money collected from buyers within 45 days.- Hence, if you have already paid 10 percent of the flat value, and the said agreement signed by you , is not registered in the office of the Registrar , then you are liable to get full amount refund paid by you ,even there is a clause present in the agreement for not refunding  , and if the said agreement is registered , then builder has right to deduct booking amount from the paid amount.- If, builder not refunding the same ,then you should lodge your complaint before the Consumer court , and thereby prayed for the refund of paid amount with interest.- However , before filing the complaint you can send a legal demand notice to the builder.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "Gifts permitted by HUF to its members satisfying to the conditions of Section 10(2) are exempt from Income Tax in the hands of recipients.The remuneration paid by the HUF to the karta or any member is deductible if it meets certain criteria, like genuineness, reasonability, and is paid under a valid agreement.If the karta does not have a high income, the HUF can pay him a salary for his services.A member of the HUF is treated as relative of the HUF hence there is no tax implication at the time of the receipt of the money for HUF.It can be treated as a gift if the money is not intended to be repaid. As per Section 56(2), any gift received from specified relatives is tax-free in the hands of the recipient. A member of the HUF is treated as a relative of the HUF; hence, there is no tax implication when receiving money from the HUF.The karta is generally entitled to operate the bank transactions for an HUF. But check the deed executed or agreement prepared on stamp paper while setting up the HUF to know the exact terms and conditions for handling bank account/s by the karta or member.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "HUF Income Tax - Withdrawal   of  funds   by  Karta  from  HUF",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I  want to let you know that, in accordance with Section 10(2) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, any money received by a member of a Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) is completely free from income tax, even if the HUF has already been assessed tax on the income. Thus, no further taxes are due on the amount that the Karta withdraws from the HUF. Therefore, there is no legal requirement for the requisite distribution of calculated income in a ratio between the coparceners when the HUF is still in existence and has not experienced total division under Section 171 of Income Tax Act,1961. Instead, the Act's specific provisions address this scenario. With the support of all co-workers, an equitable distribution of the funds could then be decided upon.Still, these tendencies are typically pertinent to the partition, as the Supreme Court pointed out in N. S. Getti Chettiar Vs. CIT 82 ITR 599.In fact, as the Karta, you have the power to withdraw funds from the HUF without needing to divide them equally—as long as you do so in a transparent manner and, if required, obtain consent from the other coparceners to ensure the family's well-being. Income tax laws do not forbid withdrawals connected to HUFs during their existence.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If she does not respond, you can go about a unilateral divorce after establishing the fact that the marriage has irretrievably broken down.2. Family Non-Responsiveness:Even when it touches on matters of the family, it is not rare to find a family ceasing to be communicative on such issues, and this could be as a result of several reasons, such as feeling uncomfortable or just avoiding the issue.3. Jurisdiction: It should be noted that one can file for divorce under the specified grounds in Delhi, Faridabad, or Hyderabad as per the places where the couple has resided or the marriage has been solemnized.4. Counter Blast Cases: If you initiated the divorce by filing for one and then she files false cases, you could claim that they are in response to your action, but each and every case will be tried on its merit.5. False Complaints: Ordinary arrest is not called immediate arrest; rather, false complaints are followed by investigation most of the time.6. Proving Cohabitation: To support your statement on the basis that she lives with an ex, you want to produce hard evidence in the form of a witness statement or interaction history.7. Hotel Proof:Records of hotel stays that have been gotten legally can be used in court, and this is very important. It is also important to be certain that they were acquired legally so as to avoid a violation of privacy.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Because the gift-deed and sale-deed expect the recipient to be a farmer and none of the heirs are farmers, other ways need to be used. Despite the operating of theHindu Succession Actof 1956 an individual can in any way he wishes deal with the self-acquired property as he or she wants without reference to any legal heirs except where such actions would be prejudicial to the legal heirs. But to prevent any future complications, it is always safer to seek written consent of all the legal heirs before effecting any distribution or transfer of the property. It is wise to seek an attorney who is well versed in property laws in Gujarat to ensure that he or she provides specific advice on any complications that may be come up in the course of this process.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "HUF Income Tax - Withdrawal   of  funds   by  Karta  from  HUF",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I  want to let you know that, in accordance with Section 10(2) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, any money received by a member of a Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) is completely free from income tax, even if the HUF has already been assessed tax on the income. Thus, no further taxes are due on the amount that the Karta withdraws from the HUF. Therefore, there is no legal requirement for the requisite distribution of calculated income in a ratio between the coparceners when the HUF is still in existence and has not experienced total division under Section 171 of Income Tax Act,1961. Instead, the Act's specific provisions address this scenario. With the support of all co-workers, an equitable distribution of the funds could then be decided upon.Still, these tendencies are typically pertinent to the partition, as the Supreme Court pointed out in N. S. Getti Chettiar Vs. CIT 82 ITR 599.In fact, as the Karta, you have the power to withdraw funds from the HUF without needing to divide them equally—as long as you do so in a transparent manner and, if required, obtain consent from the other coparceners to ensure the family's well-being. Income tax laws do not forbid withdrawals connected to HUFs during their existence.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Jurisdiction: It should be noted that one can file for divorce under the specified grounds in Delhi, Faridabad, or Hyderabad as per the places where the couple has resided or the marriage has been solemnized.4. Counter Blast Cases: If you initiated the divorce by filing for one and then she files false cases, you could claim that they are in response to your action, but each and every case will be tried on its merit.5. False Complaints: Ordinary arrest is not called immediate arrest; rather, false complaints are followed by investigation most of the time.6.

In Indian law there is a provision which allows the person to complain to the police even after so much delay.For theft, you should file an FIR under Section 303 of BNS Act. I think it is wise to file a complaint at both Bangalore and at your village in Andhra Pradesh since the theft may have taken place at either of these two places.It is usually accepted by the police especially bearing in mind that a lot of times one can give health issues as the cause of a delay in reporting the incident. Also, be sure to give information regarding the people who had access to the house, such as, the maids, the driver among others.You will get the police involved depending on the information you pass to them. Despite the fact that it has been five months now, it is vital to make the report at the earliest stage possible in order to increase the possibility of the recovery or else investigation.I hope this explanation meets your needs precisely.

    "question": "Agricultural land Uttar Pradesh",
    "answer": "Dear Client,As per your concerns regarding the agricultural land in Uttar Pradesh and your married sister’s actions, let me clarify your legal standing under Indian laws.Firstly, according to theHindu Succession Actof 1956 with amendment in year 2005, the rights of the married as well as unmarried daughter regarding their father’s property including the agricultural one are identical.Due to UP Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950, in Uttar Pradesh married daughters were not allowed to take agriculture land but Supreme Court of India in recent judgments has clarified that daughters also are co-heirs and thus entitled to equal share in ancestral property.Thus your married sister does have your right to the agricultural land.As for your mother’s share, since she died intestate, this share of the property will now go to legal heirs which are you and your sister.However, as far as the existing legislation which governs the property rights in the country concerns, your sister has the legal right to also stake a claim over the share of your mother’s portion.The same can be said for the other assets like the flat and fixed deposits, for nomination in your sisters favor legally entitles her unless of course a civil lawsuit is filed against the nomination.In my opinion, you should object to mutation proceedings and if needed file a partition suit in the civil court to protect your share in the said property.In light of these issues, it is essential to contact a competent lawyer immediately to protect your inheritance from your sister and manage with any unjustified misuse.Please seek further legal advice from a property lawyer as regards to the actions that should be taken especially in compiling evidence, filing for claims among other matters.I hope this perspective adds value to your considerations.

    "answer": "Dear Client,I appreciate your worries towards the transfer of self-acquired property that belong to your father and as to your sister’s influence and coercion. According to Indian laws, since the property belongs to your father and it is self-acquired, he has every right to transfer it.However, if you think that your sister influenced this decision while your father was ill mentally, you can object to this transfer on the grounds of ‘undue influence’ or ‘fraud’ under Section 16 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Receipt of medical records that will further support this claim will be vital for this claim.In case your father was of unsound mind at the time of transfer you may approach the court to appoint a guardian under Mental Health Care Act, 2017 to nullify the transactions made during this period.If the property has been transferred, the process is slightly different: you can file civil trial on the grounds of transferring deed and provide such proofs as, for example, medical records or testimonies of witnesses. To deal with such a case, I would advise to consult with a lawyer, especially since legal action should be taken as soon as possible to defend your rights.I hope this response is in line with your expectations.

    "answer": "First of all, I'm assuming it's women's cell of police. See, the police hasn't lodged any complaint against you, nor are you summoned for questioning. You can refuse the counselling and refuse to go & I would advice you to refuse to go for any counselling at police station (women's cell). You' must go only if you are summoned for questioning.My advice is based on fact that the police isn't professional trained for counselling. What happens is they pressurize both parties not to complain whatsoever and settle the matter amongst themselves. So it's just a waste of time. You go to professional marriage counsellors for counselling.As to the legalities of the situation,  well you are well within your rights to prohibit disagreeable individuals, the threatening rowdy types from entering your home, be it your wife's relatives and/or parents. Be rest assured, it doesn't amount to any cruelty and hence, you can be defended before any court of law on this count.Rather it's you, who suffers from mental cruelty and harassment on the count of your wife allowing such elements to interfere in your sacrosanct matrimonial relationship. Hence,  I would suggest you encourage your wife to seek assistance of a professional marriage counsellor along with you so that both of you can enjoy matrimonial bliss.As to your wife not yielding to 4, and then your legal remedies,  there are quite a few options involving litigation. You could opt for judicial separation, or petition restraining your wife to entertain such elements at your home without your consent. Divorce would be last resort.Which remedy would best suit your purpose and handling that litigation ---- for that I require an exhaustive consultation session with you first. You need to visit me for that. I'm based in Mumbai /navimumbai just as you are, so it shouldn't be much of an issue for you to visit me.९८२०८९७८८४ (nine eight two zero eight nine seven eight eight four)Netra Mohanchandra PantAdvocate, Navi Mumbai1591 Answers5 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Netra Mohanchandra Pant"

    "question": "How can I prevent my wife's troublesome parents/siblings from visiting my home?",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I recognize the difficulties you are facing due to the repeated disruptive actions of your wife’s parents and siblings, and your intent to prevent them from entering your home. According to Indian laws, the following is a formal legal approach to address this matter.Since you are the owner or the lawful possessor of your residence, you have every right to control who should gain access to your home or not. The previous placement, providing your wife an option to visit her parents without the interference of relatives you consider as problematic, yet denying them access to your home, was logical. Since your wife is now going to complain that you are harassing her mentally by preventing her family from visiting, I want to reiterate to you that you have never locked her out of your house from seeing her family and the restrictions are placed to ensure that you are not disturbed in your home. When counseling, it should be illustrated why certain past incidents of harassment and misconduct had to occur from her family members, and how the previous agreement made by both families was an attempt of good will. Your wife has rights to visit her family members, that you as a husband cannot refuse, but that does not mean the people who have been causing disturbances are free to enter into your home. You may ask the women’s cell or court to allow you to not have disturbance in your home while at the same time still allow your wife to visit her family as she wishes.Thus, you should stick to your decision to let your wife visit her family without limitation while explaining the legitimate grounds for limiting access of those causing disturbances to your home. In the meantime, it is also recommended to consult a lawyer about filing an injunction or any other kind of protection from further harassment.I hope this response is helpful in addressing your challenges.

Also, this difference in treatment may encourage her brothers to desire that their sister marry at the earliest possible opportunity, so that she will not compete with them for inheritance.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Agricultural land Uttar Pradesh",
    "answer": "Dear Client,As per your concerns regarding the agricultural land in Uttar Pradesh and your married sister’s actions, let me clarify your legal standing under Indian laws.Firstly, according to theHindu Succession Actof 1956 with amendment in year 2005, the rights of the married as well as unmarried daughter regarding their father’s property including the agricultural one are identical.Due to UP Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950, in Uttar Pradesh married daughters were not allowed to take agriculture land but Supreme Court of India in recent judgments has clarified that daughters also are co-heirs and thus entitled to equal share in ancestral property.Thus your married sister does have your right to the agricultural land.As for your mother’s share, since she died intestate, this share of the property will now go to legal heirs which are you and your sister.However, as far as the existing legislation which governs the property rights in the country concerns, your sister has the legal right to also stake a claim over the share of your mother’s portion.The same can be said for the other assets like the flat and fixed deposits, for nomination in your sisters favor legally entitles her unless of course a civil lawsuit is filed against the nomination.In my opinion, you should object to mutation proceedings and if needed file a partition suit in the civil court to protect your share in the said property.In light of these issues, it is essential to contact a competent lawyer immediately to protect your inheritance from your sister and manage with any unjustified misuse.Please seek further legal advice from a property lawyer as regards to the actions that should be taken especially in compiling evidence, filing for claims among other matters.I hope this perspective adds value to your considerations.

    "answer": "Dear Client,On the question of the Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950 Supreme Court decisions shall override the Act where there is conflict. The Supreme Court has the power to explain the meaning of the laws and provide guidelines that all other courts must follow. For example, there are decisions like Mithlesh Kumari v. Fateh Bahadur Singh defines some aspects of Zamindari Act, thus proving the power of Supreme Court. Hence, although the Zamindari Act and Supreme Court decisions are relevant, where there is a clash, the Supreme Court ruling takes precedence.

    "question": "My sister has influenced my father to give her everything",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I appreciate your worries towards the transfer of self-acquired property that belong to your father and as to your sister’s influence and coercion. According to Indian laws, since the property belongs to your father and it is self-acquired, he has every right to transfer it.However, if you think that your sister influenced this decision while your father was ill mentally, you can object to this transfer on the grounds of ‘undue influence’ or ‘fraud’ under Section 16 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Receipt of medical records that will further support this claim will be vital for this claim.In case your father was of unsound mind at the time of transfer you may approach the court to appoint a guardian under Mental Health Care Act, 2017 to nullify the transactions made during this period.If the property has been transferred, the process is slightly different: you can file civil trial on the grounds of transferring deed and provide such proofs as, for example, medical records or testimonies of witnesses. To deal with such a case, I would advise to consult with a lawyer, especially since legal action should be taken as soon as possible to defend your rights.I hope this response is in line with your expectations.

    "answer": "First of all, I'm assuming it's women's cell of police. See, the police hasn't lodged any complaint against you, nor are you summoned for questioning. You can refuse the counselling and refuse to go & I would advice you to refuse to go for any counselling at police station (women's cell). You' must go only if you are summoned for questioning.My advice is based on fact that the police isn't professional trained for counselling. What happens is they pressurize both parties not to complain whatsoever and settle the matter amongst themselves. So it's just a waste of time. You go to professional marriage counsellors for counselling.As to the legalities of the situation,  well you are well within your rights to prohibit disagreeable individuals, the threatening rowdy types from entering your home, be it your wife's relatives and/or parents. Be rest assured, it doesn't amount to any cruelty and hence, you can be defended before any court of law on this count.Rather it's you, who suffers from mental cruelty and harassment on the count of your wife allowing such elements to interfere in your sacrosanct matrimonial relationship. Hence,  I would suggest you encourage your wife to seek assistance of a professional marriage counsellor along with you so that both of you can enjoy matrimonial bliss.As to your wife not yielding to 4, and then your legal remedies,  there are quite a few options involving litigation. You could opt for judicial separation, or petition restraining your wife to entertain such elements at your home without your consent. Divorce would be last resort.Which remedy would best suit your purpose and handling that litigation ---- for that I require an exhaustive consultation session with you first. You need to visit me for that. I'm based in Mumbai /navimumbai just as you are, so it shouldn't be much of an issue for you to visit me.९८२०८९७८८४ (nine eight two zero eight nine seven eight eight four)Netra Mohanchandra PantAdvocate, Navi Mumbai1591 Answers5 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Netra Mohanchandra Pant"

    "question": "How can I prevent my wife's troublesome parents/siblings from visiting my home?",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I recognize the difficulties you are facing due to the repeated disruptive actions of your wife’s parents and siblings, and your intent to prevent them from entering your home. According to Indian laws, the following is a formal legal approach to address this matter.Since you are the owner or the lawful possessor of your residence, you have every right to control who should gain access to your home or not. The previous placement, providing your wife an option to visit her parents without the interference of relatives you consider as problematic, yet denying them access to your home, was logical. Since your wife is now going to complain that you are harassing her mentally by preventing her family from visiting, I want to reiterate to you that you have never locked her out of your house from seeing her family and the restrictions are placed to ensure that you are not disturbed in your home. When counseling, it should be illustrated why certain past incidents of harassment and misconduct had to occur from her family members, and how the previous agreement made by both families was an attempt of good will. Your wife has rights to visit her family members, that you as a husband cannot refuse, but that does not mean the people who have been causing disturbances are free to enter into your home. You may ask the women’s cell or court to allow you to not have disturbance in your home while at the same time still allow your wife to visit her family as she wishes.Thus, you should stick to your decision to let your wife visit her family without limitation while explaining the legitimate grounds for limiting access of those causing disturbances to your home. In the meantime, it is also recommended to consult a lawyer about filing an injunction or any other kind of protection from further harassment.I hope this response is helpful in addressing your challenges.
