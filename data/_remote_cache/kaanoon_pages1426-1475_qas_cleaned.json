    "question": "Unregistered partnership firm",
    "answer": "Dear client,In general, the legal status of a partnership firm in India, whether registered or unregistered, can have implications on the resolution of disputes. Unregistered partnership firms may face limitations in enforcing their rights and claiming reliefs in court. In many cases, registered firms enjoy certain benefits and have a better legal standing. If one of the unregistered firms has subsequently registered itself before filing a suit, this registration might influence the legal proceedings. Registration may confer certain rights and benefits that unregistered firms may not have. The time of the dispute may be relevant in determining which laws and regulations apply. Changes in the legal status of the firms over time, such as registration, can impact the legal framework under which the dispute is resolved. The Partnership Act, 1932, governs the operation of partnership firms in India. However, the legal landscape may have evolved, and court decisions may influence the interpretation of the law.

    "question": "Adjudication process and lawyer need for POA",
    "answer": "Dear client,A Power of Attorney (PoA) must be registered and decided upon in India through a series of stages. First, the Indian Consulate outside needs to attest the PoA. It must be registered with the Sub-Registrar of Assurances in the jurisdiction where the property is located as soon as it arrives in India. The Registration Act of 1908, Section 32, requires that PoA be registered. The adjudication process includes figuring out how much stamp duty the document needs to pay in accordance with the Indian Stamp Act of 1899. The adjudicating officer at the District Registrar's Office often handles this. Although it is feasible to complete the process on your own, hiring a lawyer can guarantee that all legal requirements are met, particularly the computation of stamp duty, which is essential for legitimacy.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,It seems you're dealing with a complex legal situation regarding ancestral property and a series of legal proceedings in India.1. Notice of Plaintiff's Death: Your advocate should bring the death of the plaintiff to the attention of the appeal court. Usually, the LRs (Legal Representatives) of the deceased plaintiff would need to be impleaded in the appeal suit.2. Challenge to Condonation of Delay and Revocation Order: Yes, the LRs of the deceased plaintiff can challenge the condonation of delay and the exparte revocation order in the appeal court (District Court). They can argue that proper notice wasn't served due to the change in your address and the plaintiff's death.3. Filing an Appeal: The LRs of the deceased plaintiff can file an appeal in the same court (District Court) against the orders obtained by hiding the plaintiff's death. If they believe there was a lack of due process due to the plaintiff's death not being acknowledged, they can address this in the appeal.4. Effect of Release Deed: The fact that the deceased plaintiff and their LRs released their share in the property through a registered Release Deed might limit their rights to challenge certain aspects. However, it doesn’t necessarily preclude them from contesting procedural irregularities or lack of due process in subsequent legal proceedings.5. LRs Contesting the Appeal Suit: The LRs of the deceased plaintiff can contest the appeal suit and also aim to set aside the exparte orders. They have the opportunity to present their case and argue that they were not duly informed or involved in the proceedings due to the plaintiff's death.Under Indian law, the process can vary based on specific circumstances, and the court will generally aim to provide fair opportunities for all parties involved. It’s crucial to gather all relevant documents, evidence of communication attempts regarding address changes, and any legal documents (such as the Release Deed) to support your case.

    "answer": "1. The release deed executed by the legal heirs cannot be a reason to seek for estoppel.The appeal suit will proceed as per law and the circumstances.2.  The release deed is a matter of an arrangement within the family members, however the suit cannot be said to be affected by such release deed because the suit  is for partition.3. The legal heirs can release their rights in the property towards their share if at all they are entitled to a share in the property.as coparceners provided the property is ancestral in nature.4.

    "question": "Is  appeal suit valid after release deed with one of the coparcener?",
    "answer": "Dear client,1. Effect of Release Deed: The Release Deed can act as a form of estoppel, especially if it clearly states that the lands being released are ancestral property and acknowledges the plaintiff's entitlement to a 1/5th share. This document might limit the appellants' arguments regarding the plaintiff's share if presented properly before the court.2. Plaintiff Not Included in Release Deed: The legal reasons for not including the plaintiff as a releasor in the deed could vary. It's possible that the plaintiff might not have been included due to his willingness to relinquish his share and might not have considered himself a party to the deed. However, this would need careful legal scrutiny based on the specific circumstances surrounding the creation of the Release Deed.3. Legal Capacity of Plaintiff's Legal Heirs to Sign the Release Deed: Generally, the legal heirs of a living person may not have the authority or capacity to release a share in ancestral property without the involvement or consent of the person who holds that share, i.e., the plaintiff. If the plaintiff was alive and mentally competent, their direct involvement or consent in the release would typically be required.4. Recording the Release Deed in Court: To amend shares and pass a fresh preliminary decree, especially considering the changes brought about by the Release Deed, it would be prudent to present the Release Deed before the court. This document can be used as evidence to petition for an amendment to the preliminary decree, specifying the changes in ownership as per the deed.In essence, the Release Deed holds weight as a legal document, especially if it clearly outlines the relinquishment of the plaintiff's share in the ancestral property. However, the circumstances surrounding its creation and the absence of the plaintiff's inclusion might need further examination by a legal expert. Bringing this document to the attention of the court during the appeal proceedings could significantly impact the case's outcome.

    "answer": "Dear client,The Release Deed appears to explicitly acknowledge and accept the preliminary decree issued by the court, confirming the entitlement of the plaintiff (XXX) to a 1/5th share of the ancestral property. It mentions the court's decision and explicitly states the intention of the releasors (the legal heirs of the plaintiff) to release their inherited share in favor of the releasees for a monetary consideration.Effect on the Appeal: The language used in the Release Deed seems to acknowledge the plaintiff's entitlement as per the preliminary decree. This document could significantly impact the appeal proceedings, potentially limiting the scope for the appellants to contest the plaintiff's share. It strengthens the acknowledgment of the plaintiff's entitlement to the 1/5th share as decreed by the court.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "25 Transfer of Property Act conditional transfers is made subject to a condition satements are made",
    "answer": "Dear client,It seems like the sale deed you've shared has some elements that raise concerns about the transfer of absolute ownership. Your deed does seem to have certain conditional elements. For instance, the clause \"subject to the actual measurement\" could imply that the final sale is contingent upon a measurement that hasn't been conducted yet. Rectification might involve an addendum or amendment to the deed clarifying this condition or conducting the agreed-upon measurement. This clause introduces uncertainty about the property's precise size or boundaries. It's advisable to rectify this by conducting the measurement as agreed upon or by modifying the deed to remove this condition.As per the deed, the sellers seem to transfer ownership upon receiving the full payment. However, the clauses related to the Khatha transfer and signing documents to perfect the title hint that there might be some steps pending for full transfer. It's essential to clarify these points for complete ownership transfer. The clause indicates the seller's commitment to facilitating the transfer of title after the registration. It doesn't necessarily mean the title hasn't transferred but implies an assurance that any additional steps required for a clean title will be completed post-registration.The absence of explicit language regarding title transfer in the deed could lead to confusion or disputes. Ensure that the deed explicitly states the transfer of title from the seller to the purchaser to avoid any future complications. If you suspect that the drafted deed might cause legal issues or isn't in your best interest, it's crucial to seek legal advice from a trusted lawyer specializing in property transactions. They can review the deed thoroughly and provide guidance on necessary amendments or actions to safeguard your interests.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "25 Transfer of Property Act conditional transfers is made subject to a condition satements are made",
    "answer": "Dear client,Let's break down your concerns:The discrepancy in the measured size might cause issues later. If the deed explicitly mentions that the sale is subject to the actual measurement, and the measured area exceeds what was initially agreed upon, it might affect the terms of the sale. Failure to rectify the difference in measurement could potentially lead to disputes or legal issues in the future, especially if the discrepancy becomes a point of contention between you and the sellers. It's essential to try and resolve this matter even if the sellers are currently abroad. If the deed specifies the sale as subject to actual measurement, a change in the measured area might affect the sale consideration. Depending on the agreed-upon price per square foot, the difference in area could impact the total sale amount. Rectification becomes crucial to ensure that the sale deed accurately reflects the property's dimensions and terms agreed upon by both parties. However, rectification might not be mandatory if both parties agree to the new dimensions and are willing to proceed without altering the deed.Regarding the statement: \"The SELLERS hereby grants/transfers... as normally be conveyed under the sale\":This phrase typically refers to the standard transfer of ownership rights and interests that occur in a property sale, subject to the conditions agreed upon in the sale deed. It means the transfer of ownership is in line with the usual procedures of a property sale, subject to the conditions mentioned in the sale deed. If any conditions outlined in the deed aren't met, it might impact the completeness or legality of the transfer. The sale might not become invalid per se, but discrepancies or unfulfilled conditions could create complications in proving absolute ownership or defending against potential disputes in the future. As per the deed's language, it seems that ownership is intended to transfer to you upon meeting all the conditions outlined in the deed. However, the discrepancies in measurements and other conditions might affect the completeness of this transfer.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,In general, the legal status of a partnership firm in India, whether registered or unregistered, can have implications on the resolution of disputes. Unregistered partnership firms may face limitations in enforcing their rights and claiming reliefs in court. In many cases, registered firms enjoy certain benefits and have a better legal standing. If one of the unregistered firms has subsequently registered itself before filing a suit, this registration might influence the legal proceedings. Registration may confer certain rights and benefits that unregistered firms may not have. The time of the dispute may be relevant in determining which laws and regulations apply. Changes in the legal status of the firms over time, such as registration, can impact the legal framework under which the dispute is resolved. The Partnership Act, 1932, governs the operation of partnership firms in India. However, the legal landscape may have evolved, and court decisions may influence the interpretation of the law.

    "question": "Adjudication process and lawyer need for POA",
    "answer": "Dear client,A Power of Attorney (PoA) must be registered and decided upon in India through a series of stages. First, the Indian Consulate outside needs to attest the PoA. It must be registered with the Sub-Registrar of Assurances in the jurisdiction where the property is located as soon as it arrives in India. The Registration Act of 1908, Section 32, requires that PoA be registered. The adjudication process includes figuring out how much stamp duty the document needs to pay in accordance with the Indian Stamp Act of 1899. The adjudicating officer at the District Registrar's Office often handles this. Although it is feasible to complete the process on your own, hiring a lawyer can guarantee that all legal requirements are met, particularly the computation of stamp duty, which is essential for legitimacy.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,In accordance with Section 20 of the Indian Registration Act, 1908, the District Registrar is required by Indian law to decide the Power of Attorney (PoA) within three months of its creation. To maintain the validity of the PoA, adherence to this deadline is essential. Adjudication is not necessarily hampered by the certified PoA's lack of a sealed envelope from the Indian Consulate. To allow for processing, submit the Power of Attorney to the District Registrar at least one day before the property sale. Make sure you have the required supporting documentation on hand. The success of the PoA in real estate transactions depends on adherence to legal deadlines.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "It is imperative to obtain the status quo order on the HUDA file, since this could have a substantial impact on the property dispute. The Code of Civil Procedure (CPC), in particular, gives the court the authority to make orders that are required to further the goals of justice (Section 94). Any attempts by the owner to sell or begin development in defiance of the court order could result in legal ramifications due to the status quo order on the HUDA file. The order that is currently on file supports your position and could result in the permits that were issued in violation of the initial order being rejected. Furthermore, the Specific Relief Act, which aims to stop actions that disobey court orders, may address the demolition and reconstruction without permission.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "If a court orders maintain the status quo on the property it means that two components of the property that comes under the purview of status quo one is the possession and other is the title. When status quo is ordered when a suit is instituted then the person who is holding the possession and title shall retain such possession and title until the suit is disposed of. Basically status quo is ordered to prevent the third party interests in the property that is with respect to leasing, selling, mortgaging, gifting, willing or any acts which is done to transfer the interest in the property under theTransfer of property act.Therefore it would be better to maintain the same status till the status quo order is vacated to avoid for being booked for contempt of courtT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Status Quo Order - Effect of",
    "answer": "Dear client,The court order you mentioned, directing the parties to maintain the status quo regarding the alienation of the suit property, typically means that none of the involved parties should alter the state of the property or its ownership while the case is ongoing. Violation of this order could constitute contempt of court.Regarding the benefits of having the application and Status Quo order on the HUDA file:Having the court order on the HUDA file means that any further actions or permissions sought regarding the property should be considered in light of the court's directive to maintain the status quo. This could potentially prevent the issuance of further permits or certificates until the legal case is resolved.Regarding the owner's actions:Demolishing the original building might be seen as a violation of the court order to maintain the status quo if the order specifically mentioned preserving the property in its existing state. However, this might also depend on the exact wording of the court order and its interpretation by the court. If the court order prohibited any alteration to the property, obtaining permission from HUDA to construct a larger property might also be seen as a violation of the court order. The completion of the new house might pose a challenge in terms of enforcing the court order. However, having the court order on the HUDA file could prevent the owner from obtaining necessary certificates or paperwork related to the new construction until the legal matter is resolved.Regarding Contempt of Court:Whether the owner or HUDA is in contempt of the court order would depend on the specific language and scope of the court order and the actions taken. Violating a court order can be considered contempt, but it would ultimately be determined by the court. You may want to bring this to the attention of the court by filing a contempt petition if you believe that the owner's actions or HUDA's involvement are in violation of the court order. Consult with your legal counsel to understand the best course of action and the specific steps to take under Indian laws.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Status Quo Order - Effect of",
    "answer": "In law, the phrase \"status quo\" describes the current state of affairs.To prevent any of the parties to a dispute from acting while the matter is still being adjudicated, a judge may issue a status quo order.Under Property Law, Status quo refers to upholding the status or condition of the thing/property in question. You cannot sell, sublet, lease, or do anything with the property if a property lawsuit has resulted in an order to maintain the status quo. The property must remain in the same condition as it did on the day the order was passed.However as per The doctrine of Lis Pendence, envisioned under Section 52 of theTransfer of Property Act, will, however, automatically govern actions related to selling, buying, or transferring title in the property if a lawsuit is pending against it. Status quo does not bar any of the rights of the property holder; only the right to transfer the property gets put on hold while the matter is pending. The person who is currently enjoying the property would continue to do so, and if he encounters any interference with this right, he or she may sue the person who is causing dispute.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Status Quo Order - Effect of",
    "answer": "Dear client,Based on the specific wording of the court order you provided, which instructs the parties to maintain the status quo \"qua alienation of the suit property,\" it appears to primarily address the aspect of transferring or disposing of the property rather than construction per se. Your advocate's interpretation seems aligned with this wording, suggesting that the order restricts actions related to selling, mortgaging, or leasing the property but does not explicitly prohibit construction.Regarding the owner's construction activities and their interaction with HUDA:The owner's construction activities might not directly violate the court order, as long as they aren't attempting to alienate (sell, lease, mortgage, etc.) the property. Therefore, the completion of the construction itself might not cause immediate legal problems for the owner based on the court order.Having the court order on the HUDA file means that any paperwork or certificates related to the property, particularly those that might involve the transfer or change of ownership rights, could face scrutiny or possible delay due to the existence of the court order. This could hinder the owner's attempts to finalize paperwork or certificates related to the property until the legal matter is resolved.It's essential to monitor the situation closely, especially as the construction nears completion, to see if the owner attempts any actions that could be interpreted as an attempt to alienate the property.

It must be registered with the Sub-Registrar of Assurances in the jurisdiction where the property is located as soon as it arrives in India. The Registration Act of 1908, Section 32, requires that PoA be registered. The adjudication process includes figuring out how much stamp duty the document needs to pay in accordance with the Indian Stamp Act of 1899. The adjudicating officer at the District Registrar's Office often handles this.

    "answer": "Dear client,In accordance with Section 20 of the Indian Registration Act, 1908, the District Registrar is required by Indian law to decide the Power of Attorney (PoA) within three months of its creation. To maintain the validity of the PoA, adherence to this deadline is essential. Adjudication is not necessarily hampered by the certified PoA's lack of a sealed envelope from the Indian Consulate. To allow for processing, submit the Power of Attorney to the District Registrar at least one day before the property sale. Make sure you have the required supporting documentation on hand. The success of the PoA in real estate transactions depends on adherence to legal deadlines.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Unregistered partnership firm",
    "answer": "Dear client,In general, the legal status of a partnership firm in India, whether registered or unregistered, can have implications on the resolution of disputes. Unregistered partnership firms may face limitations in enforcing their rights and claiming reliefs in court. In many cases, registered firms enjoy certain benefits and have a better legal standing. If one of the unregistered firms has subsequently registered itself before filing a suit, this registration might influence the legal proceedings. Registration may confer certain rights and benefits that unregistered firms may not have. The time of the dispute may be relevant in determining which laws and regulations apply. Changes in the legal status of the firms over time, such as registration, can impact the legal framework under which the dispute is resolved. The Partnership Act, 1932, governs the operation of partnership firms in India. However, the legal landscape may have evolved, and court decisions may influence the interpretation of the law.

    "answer": "Dear client,The credit note of 31 lakhs from the previous builder, as well as the payment receipt issued by Migsun for the same amount, signify an agreement to transfer the credit. However, it appears there's a dispute about the materialization of the credit note deal between Ansal and Migsun. These clauses seem to indicate that if the deal between Ansal and Migsun regarding the credit note doesn't materialize, Migsun can demand the amount from you as the allottee. It's essential to understand the exact wording and implications of these clauses in the legal context of your agreement.In real estate transactions, the Allotment Letter is a preliminary agreement that precedes the Builder-Buyer Agreement (BBA). However, the legal validity of an Allotment Letter as a BBA might vary from state to state. Specifically for UP RERA, you might need to consult a legal expert or check the regulations. The legality of clauses and agreements, as well as the interpretation of these documents, falls under legal jurisdiction. The UP RERA or Indian laws regarding real estate contracts, consumer rights, and dispute resolution might influence the validity of these clauses and agreements.If needed, you can approach UP RERA for guidance or resolution regarding the dispute, especially if it involves non-compliance with regulations. You may draft and send a legal notice to Migsun outlining your grievances and the desired resolution. If the issue remains unresolved, you might need to file a complaint with UP RERA. They handle disputes between buyers and builders and can provide resolution through their prescribed procedures. Maintain copies of all communications, agreements, payment receipts, and legal correspondence for your records and as evidence if the case goes to legal proceedings.

    "answer": "Dear client,A Power of Attorney (PoA) must be registered and decided upon in India through a series of stages. First, the Indian Consulate outside needs to attest the PoA. It must be registered with the Sub-Registrar of Assurances in the jurisdiction where the property is located as soon as it arrives in India. The Registration Act of 1908, Section 32, requires that PoA be registered. The adjudication process includes figuring out how much stamp duty the document needs to pay in accordance with the Indian Stamp Act of 1899. The adjudicating officer at the District Registrar's Office often handles this. Although it is feasible to complete the process on your own, hiring a lawyer can guarantee that all legal requirements are met, particularly the computation of stamp duty, which is essential for legitimacy.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Some leases might have restrictions or conditions regarding transfers. If the lease agreement requires it, seek consent from the lessor (the entity or individual who granted the lease) before transferring the lease or selling the property.Process for Transfer or Sale:Prepare all necessary documents including the original lease agreement, property documents, identification proofs, and any other required paperwork. If you’re selling the property, negotiate the terms of sale with the potential buyer. Ensure all terms are agreed upon and put in writing. Prepare a transfer deed or sale deed, depending on whether you’re transferring the lease or selling the property outright. This document should outline the details of the transaction. Execute the transfer deed and get it registered at the Sub-Registrar's office within the jurisdiction where the property is located. This step is crucial for legal validity. Once the documentation is in place, seek approval from the lessor or relevant authority if required by the lease terms.Tips:Conduct thorough due diligence on the property and lease terms before initiating the transfer or sale process. This includes checking for any outstanding dues, liabilities, or legal issues related to the property. Engage professionals like lawyers, real estate agents, or property consultants to guide you through the process. They can help ensure a smooth transaction and protect your interests. Maintain clear communication with all parties involved, including the buyer, lessor, legal representatives, and any other relevant stakeholders. Adhere to all legal and regulatory requirements throughout the process to avoid any complications or legal issues later on. If selling the property, hone your negotiation skills to secure a favorable deal while being fair and transparent.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,The X visa, also known as the Entry Visa, is typically for individuals intending to stay in India for an extended period, often for purposes such as research, work, or joining a spouse who is an Indian citizen or a person of Indian origin (PIO). It allows a longer stay compared to other visas.Regarding your husband's situation:X Visa and Remote Work: While the X visa permits a longer stay in India, it doesn't inherently allow for work within India. However, it might allow remote work for a foreign company. Specifics on this matter might require consultation with an immigration lawyer or contacting the Indian consulate/embassy for clarity on the permissibility of remote work while on an X visa.Duration of Stay on X Visa: The duration for which one can stay continuously on an X visa varies and is usually determined by the Indian government. Extensions might be possible through the FRRO (Foreigners Regional Registration Office) if necessary.Remote Work for Canadian Company: Given his business is registered and based in Canada and he's the sole owner/director, remote work for his Canadian company might be possible while he stays in India. It's crucial to ensure compliance with Indian tax and immigration laws.Duration of Remote Work from India: As for the duration he can work remotely from India, there might not be a strict limitation if he's on a valid visa. However, tax implications and adherence to Indian regulations (like filing taxes as a non-resident or paying taxes for income earned while in India) would apply.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "It is imperative to obtain the status quo order on the HUDA file, since this could have a substantial impact on the property dispute. The Code of Civil Procedure (CPC), in particular, gives the court the authority to make orders that are required to further the goals of justice (Section 94). Any attempts by the owner to sell or begin development in defiance of the court order could result in legal ramifications due to the status quo order on the HUDA file. The order that is currently on file supports your position and could result in the permits that were issued in violation of the initial order being rejected. Furthermore, the Specific Relief Act, which aims to stop actions that disobey court orders, may address the demolition and reconstruction without permission.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Status Quo Order - Effect of",
    "answer": "If a court orders maintain the status quo on the property it means that two components of the property that comes under the purview of status quo one is the possession and other is the title. When status quo is ordered when a suit is instituted then the person who is holding the possession and title shall retain such possession and title until the suit is disposed of. Basically status quo is ordered to prevent the third party interests in the property that is with respect to leasing, selling, mortgaging, gifting, willing or any acts which is done to transfer the interest in the property under theTransfer of property act.Therefore it would be better to maintain the same status till the status quo order is vacated to avoid for being booked for contempt of courtT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Status Quo Order - Effect of",
    "answer": "Dear client,The court order you mentioned, directing the parties to maintain the status quo regarding the alienation of the suit property, typically means that none of the involved parties should alter the state of the property or its ownership while the case is ongoing. Violation of this order could constitute contempt of court.Regarding the benefits of having the application and Status Quo order on the HUDA file:Having the court order on the HUDA file means that any further actions or permissions sought regarding the property should be considered in light of the court's directive to maintain the status quo. This could potentially prevent the issuance of further permits or certificates until the legal case is resolved.Regarding the owner's actions:Demolishing the original building might be seen as a violation of the court order to maintain the status quo if the order specifically mentioned preserving the property in its existing state. However, this might also depend on the exact wording of the court order and its interpretation by the court. If the court order prohibited any alteration to the property, obtaining permission from HUDA to construct a larger property might also be seen as a violation of the court order. The completion of the new house might pose a challenge in terms of enforcing the court order. However, having the court order on the HUDA file could prevent the owner from obtaining necessary certificates or paperwork related to the new construction until the legal matter is resolved.Regarding Contempt of Court:Whether the owner or HUDA is in contempt of the court order would depend on the specific language and scope of the court order and the actions taken. Violating a court order can be considered contempt, but it would ultimately be determined by the court. You may want to bring this to the attention of the court by filing a contempt petition if you believe that the owner's actions or HUDA's involvement are in violation of the court order.

    "question": "Status Quo Order - Effect of",
    "answer": "In law, the phrase \"status quo\" describes the current state of affairs.To prevent any of the parties to a dispute from acting while the matter is still being adjudicated, a judge may issue a status quo order.Under Property Law, Status quo refers to upholding the status or condition of the thing/property in question. You cannot sell, sublet, lease, or do anything with the property if a property lawsuit has resulted in an order to maintain the status quo. The property must remain in the same condition as it did on the day the order was passed.However as per The doctrine of Lis Pendence, envisioned under Section 52 of theTransfer of Property Act, will, however, automatically govern actions related to selling, buying, or transferring title in the property if a lawsuit is pending against it. Status quo does not bar any of the rights of the property holder; only the right to transfer the property gets put on hold while the matter is pending. The person who is currently enjoying the property would continue to do so, and if he encounters any interference with this right, he or she may sue the person who is causing dispute.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Status Quo Order - Effect of",
    "answer": "Dear client,Based on the specific wording of the court order you provided, which instructs the parties to maintain the status quo \"qua alienation of the suit property,\" it appears to primarily address the aspect of transferring or disposing of the property rather than construction per se. Your advocate's interpretation seems aligned with this wording, suggesting that the order restricts actions related to selling, mortgaging, or leasing the property but does not explicitly prohibit construction.Regarding the owner's construction activities and their interaction with HUDA:The owner's construction activities might not directly violate the court order, as long as they aren't attempting to alienate (sell, lease, mortgage, etc.) the property. Therefore, the completion of the construction itself might not cause immediate legal problems for the owner based on the court order.Having the court order on the HUDA file means that any paperwork or certificates related to the property, particularly those that might involve the transfer or change of ownership rights, could face scrutiny or possible delay due to the existence of the court order. This could hinder the owner's attempts to finalize paperwork or certificates related to the property until the legal matter is resolved.It's essential to monitor the situation closely, especially as the construction nears completion, to see if the owner attempts any actions that could be interpreted as an attempt to alienate the property.

However, it appears there's a dispute about the materialization of the credit note deal between Ansal and Migsun. These clauses seem to indicate that if the deal between Ansal and Migsun regarding the credit note doesn't materialize, Migsun can demand the amount from you as the allottee. It's essential to understand the exact wording and implications of these clauses in the legal context of your agreement.In real estate transactions, the Allotment Letter is a preliminary agreement that precedes the Builder-Buyer Agreement (BBA). However, the legal validity of an Allotment Letter as a BBA might vary from state to state. Specifically for UP RERA, you might need to consult a legal expert or check the regulations. The legality of clauses and agreements, as well as the interpretation of these documents, falls under legal jurisdiction. The UP RERA or Indian laws regarding real estate contracts, consumer rights, and dispute resolution might influence the validity of these clauses and agreements.If needed, you can approach UP RERA for guidance or resolution regarding the dispute, especially if it involves non-compliance with regulations. You may draft and send a legal notice to Migsun outlining your grievances and the desired resolution. If the issue remains unresolved, you might need to file a complaint with UP RERA. They handle disputes between buyers and builders and can provide resolution through their prescribed procedures. Maintain copies of all communications, agreements, payment receipts, and legal correspondence for your records and as evidence if the case goes to legal proceedings.

    "question": "Wakf Board Property",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, the process for selling or transferring a property with a lease involves several steps and considerations, especially when it comes to leasehold properties.Understanding Leasehold Property Transfer:Start by thoroughly reviewing the lease agreement to understand any clauses related to transfer or sale. Some leases might have restrictions or conditions regarding transfers. If the lease agreement requires it, seek consent from the lessor (the entity or individual who granted the lease) before transferring the lease or selling the property.Process for Transfer or Sale:Prepare all necessary documents including the original lease agreement, property documents, identification proofs, and any other required paperwork. If you’re selling the property, negotiate the terms of sale with the potential buyer. Ensure all terms are agreed upon and put in writing. Prepare a transfer deed or sale deed, depending on whether you’re transferring the lease or selling the property outright. This document should outline the details of the transaction. Execute the transfer deed and get it registered at the Sub-Registrar's office within the jurisdiction where the property is located. This step is crucial for legal validity. Once the documentation is in place, seek approval from the lessor or relevant authority if required by the lease terms.Tips:Conduct thorough due diligence on the property and lease terms before initiating the transfer or sale process. This includes checking for any outstanding dues, liabilities, or legal issues related to the property. Engage professionals like lawyers, real estate agents, or property consultants to guide you through the process. They can help ensure a smooth transaction and protect your interests. Maintain clear communication with all parties involved, including the buyer, lessor, legal representatives, and any other relevant stakeholders. Adhere to all legal and regulatory requirements throughout the process to avoid any complications or legal issues later on. If selling the property, hone your negotiation skills to secure a favorable deal while being fair and transparent.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It allows a longer stay compared to other visas.Regarding your husband's situation:X Visa and Remote Work: While the X visa permits a longer stay in India, it doesn't inherently allow for work within India. However, it might allow remote work for a foreign company. Specifics on this matter might require consultation with an immigration lawyer or contacting the Indian consulate/embassy for clarity on the permissibility of remote work while on an X visa.Duration of Stay on X Visa: The duration for which one can stay continuously on an X visa varies and is usually determined by the Indian government. Extensions might be possible through the FRRO (Foreigners Regional Registration Office) if necessary.Remote Work for Canadian Company: Given his business is registered and based in Canada and he's the sole owner/director, remote work for his Canadian company might be possible while he stays in India. It's crucial to ensure compliance with Indian tax and immigration laws.Duration of Remote Work from India: As for the duration he can work remotely from India, there might not be a strict limitation if he's on a valid visa. However, tax implications and adherence to Indian regulations (like filing taxes as a non-resident or paying taxes for income earned while in India) would apply.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The Code of Civil Procedure (CPC), in particular, gives the court the authority to make orders that are required to further the goals of justice (Section 94).

    "answer": "If a court orders maintain the status quo on the property it means that two components of the property that comes under the purview of status quo one is the possession and other is the title. When status quo is ordered when a suit is instituted then the person who is holding the possession and title shall retain such possession and title until the suit is disposed of. Basically status quo is ordered to prevent the third party interests in the property that is with respect to leasing, selling, mortgaging, gifting, willing or any acts which is done to transfer the interest in the property under theTransfer of property act.Therefore it would be better to maintain the same status till the status quo order is vacated to avoid for being booked for contempt of courtT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Status Quo Order - Effect of",
    "answer": "Dear client,The court order you mentioned, directing the parties to maintain the status quo regarding the alienation of the suit property, typically means that none of the involved parties should alter the state of the property or its ownership while the case is ongoing. Violation of this order could constitute contempt of court.Regarding the benefits of having the application and Status Quo order on the HUDA file:Having the court order on the HUDA file means that any further actions or permissions sought regarding the property should be considered in light of the court's directive to maintain the status quo. This could potentially prevent the issuance of further permits or certificates until the legal case is resolved.Regarding the owner's actions:Demolishing the original building might be seen as a violation of the court order to maintain the status quo if the order specifically mentioned preserving the property in its existing state. However, this might also depend on the exact wording of the court order and its interpretation by the court. If the court order prohibited any alteration to the property, obtaining permission from HUDA to construct a larger property might also be seen as a violation of the court order. The completion of the new house might pose a challenge in terms of enforcing the court order. However, having the court order on the HUDA file could prevent the owner from obtaining necessary certificates or paperwork related to the new construction until the legal matter is resolved.Regarding Contempt of Court:Whether the owner or HUDA is in contempt of the court order would depend on the specific language and scope of the court order and the actions taken. Violating a court order can be considered contempt, but it would ultimately be determined by the court. You may want to bring this to the attention of the court by filing a contempt petition if you believe that the owner's actions or HUDA's involvement are in violation of the court order.

    "question": "Status Quo Order - Effect of",
    "answer": "In law, the phrase \"status quo\" describes the current state of affairs.To prevent any of the parties to a dispute from acting while the matter is still being adjudicated, a judge may issue a status quo order.Under Property Law, Status quo refers to upholding the status or condition of the thing/property in question. You cannot sell, sublet, lease, or do anything with the property if a property lawsuit has resulted in an order to maintain the status quo. The property must remain in the same condition as it did on the day the order was passed.However as per The doctrine of Lis Pendence, envisioned under Section 52 of theTransfer of Property Act, will, however, automatically govern actions related to selling, buying, or transferring title in the property if a lawsuit is pending against it. Status quo does not bar any of the rights of the property holder; only the right to transfer the property gets put on hold while the matter is pending. The person who is currently enjoying the property would continue to do so, and if he encounters any interference with this right, he or she may sue the person who is causing dispute.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Status Quo Order - Effect of",
    "answer": "Dear client,Based on the specific wording of the court order you provided, which instructs the parties to maintain the status quo \"qua alienation of the suit property,\" it appears to primarily address the aspect of transferring or disposing of the property rather than construction per se. Your advocate's interpretation seems aligned with this wording, suggesting that the order restricts actions related to selling, mortgaging, or leasing the property but does not explicitly prohibit construction.Regarding the owner's construction activities and their interaction with HUDA:The owner's construction activities might not directly violate the court order, as long as they aren't attempting to alienate (sell, lease, mortgage, etc.) the property. Therefore, the completion of the construction itself might not cause immediate legal problems for the owner based on the court order.Having the court order on the HUDA file means that any paperwork or certificates related to the property, particularly those that might involve the transfer or change of ownership rights, could face scrutiny or possible delay due to the existence of the court order. This could hinder the owner's attempts to finalize paperwork or certificates related to the property until the legal matter is resolved.It's essential to monitor the situation closely, especially as the construction nears completion, to see if the owner attempts any actions that could be interpreted as an attempt to alienate the property.

    "question": "Does having name in Jamabandi as Kashatkaar means ownership of the property?",
    "answer": "Dear client,In Indian land records, the term \"Kashatkaar\" typically refers to a cultivator or someone who cultivates the land. However, being listed as a cultivator in Jamabandi records doesn’t necessarily confer ownership rights to the land. The Supreme Court of India has addressed the issue of rights based on land records in several cases, but it's essential to note that court rulings can vary based on specific circumstances and regional laws. Generally, ownership of land is determined by various factors, including sale deeds, inheritance, possession, and title documents, rather than solely relying on being listed as a cultivator in records.The Jamabandi records can serve as evidence of possession or cultivation, which may strengthen one's claim of ownership, especially if there's a long history of such cultivation. However, mere mention as a cultivator may not guarantee ownership rights, especially if there are conflicting claims or if the nature of the land has changed, such as from 'mumkin' (cultivable) to 'gairmumkin' (uncultivable). The process of claiming ownership based on Jamabandi records might involve legal procedures like adverse possession or claiming rights through continuous and undisturbed possession for a statutory period. Each case is unique, and it's advisable to consult a lawyer specialized in property and land laws in India for specific guidance.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,In Indian revenue records like Jamabandi, \"Gair Marusi\" refers to land that is uncultivated or non-cultivable by the recorded cultivator. It signifies that the land mentioned under this term is not currently under cultivation by the person listed in the Khashatkaar (cultivator) column of the record. \"Gair Marusi\" indicates land that may be non-arable due to various reasons such as rocky terrain, barren land, waterlogged areas, or any other condition that makes it unsuitable for cultivation. In the revenue records, this term helps in distinguishing between the cultivable and uncultivable portions of land.

Legal Options for Leela and Chandrashekhar's Children: If Gouramma's property is self-acquired and she has made a will excluding them, their legal options might be limited. If there are irregularities or discrepancies in the property transactions that have taken place, legal recourse might be available to challenge these.4.

    "question": "Status Quo Order - Effect of",
    "answer": "Dear client,The court order you mentioned, directing the parties to maintain the status quo regarding the alienation of the suit property, typically means that none of the involved parties should alter the state of the property or its ownership while the case is ongoing. Violation of this order could constitute contempt of court.Regarding the benefits of having the application and Status Quo order on the HUDA file:Having the court order on the HUDA file means that any further actions or permissions sought regarding the property should be considered in light of the court's directive to maintain the status quo. This could potentially prevent the issuance of further permits or certificates until the legal case is resolved.Regarding the owner's actions:Demolishing the original building might be seen as a violation of the court order to maintain the status quo if the order specifically mentioned preserving the property in its existing state. However, this might also depend on the exact wording of the court order and its interpretation by the court. If the court order prohibited any alteration to the property, obtaining permission from HUDA to construct a larger property might also be seen as a violation of the court order. The completion of the new house might pose a challenge in terms of enforcing the court order. However, having the court order on the HUDA file could prevent the owner from obtaining necessary certificates or paperwork related to the new construction until the legal matter is resolved.Regarding Contempt of Court:Whether the owner or HUDA is in contempt of the court order would depend on the specific language and scope of the court order and the actions taken. Violating a court order can be considered contempt, but it would ultimately be determined by the court. You may want to bring this to the attention of the court by filing a contempt petition if you believe that the owner's actions or HUDA's involvement are in violation of the court order.

    "question": "Status Quo Order - Effect of",
    "answer": "In law, the phrase \"status quo\" describes the current state of affairs.To prevent any of the parties to a dispute from acting while the matter is still being adjudicated, a judge may issue a status quo order.Under Property Law, Status quo refers to upholding the status or condition of the thing/property in question. You cannot sell, sublet, lease, or do anything with the property if a property lawsuit has resulted in an order to maintain the status quo. The property must remain in the same condition as it did on the day the order was passed.However as per The doctrine of Lis Pendence, envisioned under Section 52 of theTransfer of Property Act, will, however, automatically govern actions related to selling, buying, or transferring title in the property if a lawsuit is pending against it. Status quo does not bar any of the rights of the property holder; only the right to transfer the property gets put on hold while the matter is pending. The person who is currently enjoying the property would continue to do so, and if he encounters any interference with this right, he or she may sue the person who is causing dispute.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Status Quo Order - Effect of",
    "answer": "Dear client,Based on the specific wording of the court order you provided, which instructs the parties to maintain the status quo \"qua alienation of the suit property,\" it appears to primarily address the aspect of transferring or disposing of the property rather than construction per se. Your advocate's interpretation seems aligned with this wording, suggesting that the order restricts actions related to selling, mortgaging, or leasing the property but does not explicitly prohibit construction.Regarding the owner's construction activities and their interaction with HUDA:The owner's construction activities might not directly violate the court order, as long as they aren't attempting to alienate (sell, lease, mortgage, etc.) the property. Therefore, the completion of the construction itself might not cause immediate legal problems for the owner based on the court order.Having the court order on the HUDA file means that any paperwork or certificates related to the property, particularly those that might involve the transfer or change of ownership rights, could face scrutiny or possible delay due to the existence of the court order. This could hinder the owner's attempts to finalize paperwork or certificates related to the property until the legal matter is resolved.It's essential to monitor the situation closely, especially as the construction nears completion, to see if the owner attempts any actions that could be interpreted as an attempt to alienate the property.

    "question": "Partition suit and property disputes",
    "answer": "Dear client,1. If the properties were mutated into the names of the children before the demise of the parents, as per the will executed in 1984, the transfer could be considered valid. However, the validity of such transfers might depend on various factors, including the nature of the properties and any subsequent legal challenges raised.2. \"X\" receiving a property from \"D\" through an unregistered document might not hold legal ground in the long run. If \"D\" holds ownership rights to the property and the transfer was not supported by a valid registered deed or relinquishment, \"D\" might have a case to reclaim or assert rights over the property.3. \"X\" admitting to the registered will of 1984 and participating in the compromise case that specifically delineated the distribution of properties, including \"Y's\" share after her demise, could establish a precedent or a form of estoppel (preventing a person from asserting a right) in the current case. This might be used as a basis to reject or challenge \"X's\" claim regarding the properties being joint family assets.Res judicata prevents the same parties from re-litigating the same issues that have already been conclusively decided by a competent court. If the matters were settled in the compromise case and \"X\" was a party to that agreement, this could be raised as a ground for rejection of the new claim by \"X\" regarding the properties being joint family assets. However, the applicability of this principle would depend on the specifics of the compromise agreement and the claims made in the current lawsuit. Courts may require full proceedings to determine the claims made, despite potential grounds for rejection based on previous legal decisions or principles like res judicata. The court will assess all evidence and arguments presented before making a final decision on the matter.

    "question": "Does having name in Jamabandi as Kashatkaar means ownership of the property?",
    "answer": "Dear client,In Indian land records, the term \"Kashatkaar\" typically refers to a cultivator or someone who cultivates the land. However, being listed as a cultivator in Jamabandi records doesn’t necessarily confer ownership rights to the land. The Supreme Court of India has addressed the issue of rights based on land records in several cases, but it's essential to note that court rulings can vary based on specific circumstances and regional laws. Generally, ownership of land is determined by various factors, including sale deeds, inheritance, possession, and title documents, rather than solely relying on being listed as a cultivator in records.The Jamabandi records can serve as evidence of possession or cultivation, which may strengthen one's claim of ownership, especially if there's a long history of such cultivation. However, mere mention as a cultivator may not guarantee ownership rights, especially if there are conflicting claims or if the nature of the land has changed, such as from 'mumkin' (cultivable) to 'gairmumkin' (uncultivable). The process of claiming ownership based on Jamabandi records might involve legal procedures like adverse possession or claiming rights through continuous and undisturbed possession for a statutory period. Each case is unique, and it's advisable to consult a lawyer specialized in property and land laws in India for specific guidance.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Therefore, it is your duty as a responsible parent to give your kids a suitable atmosphere.To pique your child's curiosity about learning. It's important that you pay attention to their hobbies.

    "question": "Alimony",
    "answer": "Dear client,1) In cases of divorce, the division of property can depend on various factors, including the type of property (inherited or acquired during the marriage), contributions made by both parties, and local laws. In some instances, inherited properties may be considered separate assets and not subject to division in a divorce, but this can vary based on the circumstances and the laws of the specific region.2) The determination of alimony or maintenance can depend on several factors, including the income disparity between the spouses, their respective financial situations, earning potential, duration of marriage, and individual needs. Courts may consider the financial independence of the spouses before awarding alimony. There might not be a fixed percentage (such as 25% of the husband's salary) universally applicable in all cases.3) When deciding alimony or maintenance, courts typically consider the financial obligations of both parties, including any new family responsibilities the husband might have. However, the primary consideration is usually the financial situation and needs of the divorced spouse rather than the husband's new family.Regarding property ownership, the inclusion of a spouse's name on a property document may not necessarily entitle them to an equal share in the property. Courts might consider various factors such as financial contributions, intentions behind adding the spouse's name, and other circumstances when determining property division. Courts usually aim for equitable distribution rather than equal division, taking into account the specific circumstances of each case.

    "question": "Does having name in Jamabandi as Kashatkaar means ownership of the property?",
    "answer": "Dear client,In Indian land records, the term \"Kashatkaar\" typically refers to a cultivator or someone who cultivates the land. However, being listed as a cultivator in Jamabandi records doesn’t necessarily confer ownership rights to the land. The Supreme Court of India has addressed the issue of rights based on land records in several cases, but it's essential to note that court rulings can vary based on specific circumstances and regional laws. Generally, ownership of land is determined by various factors, including sale deeds, inheritance, possession, and title documents, rather than solely relying on being listed as a cultivator in records.The Jamabandi records can serve as evidence of possession or cultivation, which may strengthen one's claim of ownership, especially if there's a long history of such cultivation. However, mere mention as a cultivator may not guarantee ownership rights, especially if there are conflicting claims or if the nature of the land has changed, such as from 'mumkin' (cultivable) to 'gairmumkin' (uncultivable). The process of claiming ownership based on Jamabandi records might involve legal procedures like adverse possession or claiming rights through continuous and undisturbed possession for a statutory period. Each case is unique, and it's advisable to consult a lawyer specialized in property and land laws in India for specific guidance.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,In Uttar Pradesh has anything to do with NCLT proceedings, you might have to contact the relevant courts. Force majeure clauses usually protect against unanticipated occurrences, therefore the penalty may vary depending on the details of your agreement. Talk to the builder about changing the penalties and stressing the specific situations. Consider delivering a legal notice outlining the conditions of the agreement and possible legal action if the builder refuses to cooperate. After the NCLT situation is settled, you can file a complaint with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) if the problem continues. The RERA Act's Section 18 addresses complaint filing. Seek legal counsel to learn about your rights under the agreement and applicable provisions, such as RERA Section 18(1)(a), in order to pursue redress.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Anticipatory bail is a precautionary measure to secure your release if you anticipate arrest.2) Look Out Circular (LOC): To ascertain if an LOC has been issued against you, your lawyer or legal representative can make inquiries with the police or relevant authorities. They might communicate with the police department or use legal channels to obtain this information discreetly.3) Arrest of Family Members: Unless your brother is explicitly named or involved in the FIR, he might not face immediate arrest. However, if there's any suspicion or concern, your brother should consult with his lawyer to safeguard his legal rights. Regarding the illegal entry into his house, filing a complaint against the police officers involved might be an option.4) Legal Action for Defense: Your lawyer can explore several legal options for your defense:If there's evidence of harassment or false claims, your legal counsel might advise filing counter-complaints against your ex-wife and ex-girlfriend for defamation or false accusations. Gathering evidence to disprove the allegations made against you is crucial. Any communication, records, or witnesses that can corroborate your innocence might be instrumental in your defense. Quashing the FIR or seeking the dismissal of charges based on lack of evidence or false accusations could be pursued legally.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Alimony",
    "answer": "Dear client,1) In cases of divorce, the division of property can depend on various factors, including the type of property (inherited or acquired during the marriage), contributions made by both parties, and local laws. In some instances, inherited properties may be considered separate assets and not subject to division in a divorce, but this can vary based on the circumstances and the laws of the specific region.2) The determination of alimony or maintenance can depend on several factors, including the income disparity between the spouses, their respective financial situations, earning potential, duration of marriage, and individual needs. Courts may consider the financial independence of the spouses before awarding alimony. There might not be a fixed percentage (such as 25% of the husband's salary) universally applicable in all cases.3) When deciding alimony or maintenance, courts typically consider the financial obligations of both parties, including any new family responsibilities the husband might have. However, the primary consideration is usually the financial situation and needs of the divorced spouse rather than the husband's new family.Regarding property ownership, the inclusion of a spouse's name on a property document may not necessarily entitle them to an equal share in the property. Courts might consider various factors such as financial contributions, intentions behind adding the spouse's name, and other circumstances when determining property division. Courts usually aim for equitable distribution rather than equal division, taking into account the specific circumstances of each case.

    "question": "Does having name in Jamabandi as Kashatkaar means ownership of the property?",
    "answer": "Dear client,In Indian land records, the term \"Kashatkaar\" typically refers to a cultivator or someone who cultivates the land. However, being listed as a cultivator in Jamabandi records doesn’t necessarily confer ownership rights to the land. The Supreme Court of India has addressed the issue of rights based on land records in several cases, but it's essential to note that court rulings can vary based on specific circumstances and regional laws. Generally, ownership of land is determined by various factors, including sale deeds, inheritance, possession, and title documents, rather than solely relying on being listed as a cultivator in records.The Jamabandi records can serve as evidence of possession or cultivation, which may strengthen one's claim of ownership, especially if there's a long history of such cultivation. However, mere mention as a cultivator may not guarantee ownership rights, especially if there are conflicting claims or if the nature of the land has changed, such as from 'mumkin' (cultivable) to 'gairmumkin' (uncultivable). The process of claiming ownership based on Jamabandi records might involve legal procedures like adverse possession or claiming rights through continuous and undisturbed possession for a statutory period. Each case is unique, and it's advisable to consult a lawyer specialized in property and land laws in India for specific guidance.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,When agricultural land is converted for non-agricultural purposes, there are specific legal procedures that need to be followed. This conversion usually involves obtaining permission from the relevant authorities or government departments. If the status of the land has changed, such as the northern boundary being converted into a house with a designated number, it's possible to update the boundaries in the new sale deed to reflect the accurate and current status of the property. To update the boundaries in the new sale deed, you'll need to provide evidence or documentation supporting the current status of the land. This might include updated survey reports, clearance certificates from local authorities, and any other relevant paperwork showing the change in status. It's crucial to verify the title deeds and ownership documents of the property to ensure there are no disputes or legal issues associated with the changes in boundaries. This verification helps safeguard against future complications or disputes.

    "answer": "Dear client,In Uttar Pradesh has anything to do with NCLT proceedings, you might have to contact the relevant courts. Force majeure clauses usually protect against unanticipated occurrences, therefore the penalty may vary depending on the details of your agreement. Talk to the builder about changing the penalties and stressing the specific situations. Consider delivering a legal notice outlining the conditions of the agreement and possible legal action if the builder refuses to cooperate. After the NCLT situation is settled, you can file a complaint with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) if the problem continues. The RERA Act's Section 18 addresses complaint filing. Seek legal counsel to learn about your rights under the agreement and applicable provisions, such as RERA Section 18(1)(a), in order to pursue redress.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Alimony",
    "answer": "Dear client,1) In cases of divorce, the division of property can depend on various factors, including the type of property (inherited or acquired during the marriage), contributions made by both parties, and local laws. In some instances, inherited properties may be considered separate assets and not subject to division in a divorce, but this can vary based on the circumstances and the laws of the specific region.2) The determination of alimony or maintenance can depend on several factors, including the income disparity between the spouses, their respective financial situations, earning potential, duration of marriage, and individual needs. Courts may consider the financial independence of the spouses before awarding alimony. There might not be a fixed percentage (such as 25% of the husband's salary) universally applicable in all cases.3) When deciding alimony or maintenance, courts typically consider the financial obligations of both parties, including any new family responsibilities the husband might have. However, the primary consideration is usually the financial situation and needs of the divorced spouse rather than the husband's new family.Regarding property ownership, the inclusion of a spouse's name on a property document may not necessarily entitle them to an equal share in the property. Courts might consider various factors such as financial contributions, intentions behind adding the spouse's name, and other circumstances when determining property division. Courts usually aim for equitable distribution rather than equal division, taking into account the specific circumstances of each case.

    "question": "Does having name in Jamabandi as Kashatkaar means ownership of the property?",
    "answer": "Dear client,In Indian land records, the term \"Kashatkaar\" typically refers to a cultivator or someone who cultivates the land. However, being listed as a cultivator in Jamabandi records doesn’t necessarily confer ownership rights to the land. The Supreme Court of India has addressed the issue of rights based on land records in several cases, but it's essential to note that court rulings can vary based on specific circumstances and regional laws. Generally, ownership of land is determined by various factors, including sale deeds, inheritance, possession, and title documents, rather than solely relying on being listed as a cultivator in records.The Jamabandi records can serve as evidence of possession or cultivation, which may strengthen one's claim of ownership, especially if there's a long history of such cultivation. However, mere mention as a cultivator may not guarantee ownership rights, especially if there are conflicting claims or if the nature of the land has changed, such as from 'mumkin' (cultivable) to 'gairmumkin' (uncultivable). The process of claiming ownership based on Jamabandi records might involve legal procedures like adverse possession or claiming rights through continuous and undisturbed possession for a statutory period. Each case is unique, and it's advisable to consult a lawyer specialized in property and land laws in India for specific guidance.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,1. If there is no provision in the agreement allowing for termination or cancellation by the lessor (you), it could be challenging to end the agreement prematurely without the lessee's (tower company's) consent.2. An unregistered agreement might pose certain limitations on its enforceability and might affect its legal standing. However, unregistered agreements can still be valid to some extent, especially if they fulfill other legal requirements.3. The fact that the agreement was signed by your mother, who may not have understood the terms due to a language barrier or other reasons, could potentially be a point in favor of contesting the validity of the agreement. It might raise questions about the validity of consent and understanding.Under Indian law:Indian Contract Act: Provisions of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, deal with contracts, including the capacity to contract, free consent, and understanding the terms of the contract. The lack of understanding due to language barriers might be relevant in this case.Transfer of Property Act: TheTransfer of Property Act, 1882, contains provisions regarding leases and rights of lessors and lessees. Understanding these sections might provide insights into the rights and obligations of both parties.Registration Act: The Registration Act, 1908, mandates the registration of certain documents to make them legally valid. However, unregistered documents might still be admissible as evidence for collateral purposes.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Is  appeal suit valid after release deed with one of the coparcener?",
    "answer": "Dear client,It seems you're dealing with a complex legal situation regarding ancestral property and a series of legal proceedings in India.1. Notice of Plaintiff's Death: Your advocate should bring the death of the plaintiff to the attention of the appeal court. Usually, the LRs (Legal Representatives) of the deceased plaintiff would need to be impleaded in the appeal suit.2. Challenge to Condonation of Delay and Revocation Order: Yes, the LRs of the deceased plaintiff can challenge the condonation of delay and the exparte revocation order in the appeal court (District Court). They can argue that proper notice wasn't served due to the change in your address and the plaintiff's death.3. Filing an Appeal: The LRs of the deceased plaintiff can file an appeal in the same court (District Court) against the orders obtained by hiding the plaintiff's death. If they believe there was a lack of due process due to the plaintiff's death not being acknowledged, they can address this in the appeal.4. Effect of Release Deed: The fact that the deceased plaintiff and their LRs released their share in the property through a registered Release Deed might limit their rights to challenge certain aspects. However, it doesn’t necessarily preclude them from contesting procedural irregularities or lack of due process in subsequent legal proceedings.5. LRs Contesting the Appeal Suit: The LRs of the deceased plaintiff can contest the appeal suit and also aim to set aside the exparte orders. They have the opportunity to present their case and argue that they were not duly informed or involved in the proceedings due to the plaintiff's death.Under Indian law, the process can vary based on specific circumstances, and the court will generally aim to provide fair opportunities for all parties involved. It’s crucial to gather all relevant documents, evidence of communication attempts regarding address changes, and any legal documents (such as the Release Deed) to support your case.

They first have to get themselves impleaded as parties to the appeal after which they can think about the maintainability of the proposed challenge to the exparte decision of the condone delay petition.3. When the plaintiff was reported to have died, his LRs were very well aware of the pending appeal suit, they could have intimated the court about the death at that time itself without waiting for the court to send summons to the LRs of deceased.The court is not aware of the death of the plaintiff hence it became the duty of the LRs to intimate about the death especially when they came to know about the pending restoration petition.4. If the appeal is against the interest of the LRs then they can very well get impleaded in the appeal.5.

    "question": "Is  appeal suit valid after release deed with one of the coparcener?",
    "answer": "Dear client,1. Effect of Release Deed: The Release Deed can act as a form of estoppel, especially if it clearly states that the lands being released are ancestral property and acknowledges the plaintiff's entitlement to a 1/5th share. This document might limit the appellants' arguments regarding the plaintiff's share if presented properly before the court.2. Plaintiff Not Included in Release Deed: The legal reasons for not including the plaintiff as a releasor in the deed could vary. It's possible that the plaintiff might not have been included due to his willingness to relinquish his share and might not have considered himself a party to the deed. However, this would need careful legal scrutiny based on the specific circumstances surrounding the creation of the Release Deed.3. Legal Capacity of Plaintiff's Legal Heirs to Sign the Release Deed: Generally, the legal heirs of a living person may not have the authority or capacity to release a share in ancestral property without the involvement or consent of the person who holds that share, i.e., the plaintiff. If the plaintiff was alive and mentally competent, their direct involvement or consent in the release would typically be required.4. Recording the Release Deed in Court: To amend shares and pass a fresh preliminary decree, especially considering the changes brought about by the Release Deed, it would be prudent to present the Release Deed before the court. This document can be used as evidence to petition for an amendment to the preliminary decree, specifying the changes in ownership as per the deed.In essence, the Release Deed holds weight as a legal document, especially if it clearly outlines the relinquishment of the plaintiff's share in the ancestral property. However, the circumstances surrounding its creation and the absence of the plaintiff's inclusion might need further examination by a legal expert. Bringing this document to the attention of the court during the appeal proceedings could significantly impact the case's outcome.

    "answer": "Dear client,Proving the utilization of the loan amount for the construction of a building, especially in a legal context, requires documentation and evidence.Documentation:Review the loan agreement or documents related to the loan. It should ideally specify the purpose of the loan. If it explicitly mentions the construction of the building, that serves as evidence. Gather bank statements showing the transactions involving the loan amount. These records should indicate withdrawals or transfers linked to the construction work, such as payments made to contractors, purchase of construction materials, etc. Any invoices, bills, or receipts related to the construction can serve as evidence. These documents should ideally match the timeline and amount of the loan disbursement. Any communication (emails, letters, etc.) between your father and relevant parties (builders, contractors, suppliers) discussing the utilization of the loan for construction purposes can be valuable. If there were individuals involved in the construction process who can attest to the fact that the loan was indeed used for building purposes, their statements can support your claim.Survey of Loan Amount:The \"survey of loan amount\" is not a standard legal term in Indian law. However, you might be referring to substantiating the utilization of the loan amount for the intended purpose, which involves providing evidence (as mentioned above) to showcase the correlation between the loan and the construction.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The Will shall come into force only after the lifetime of the testator, therefore the mutation done in the name of the beneficiaries on the basis of a Will during the lifetime of the testator is not a  legally valid transfer as the title to the bequeathed  properties still remained with the testator alone as on the date of the mutation.  Therefore the mutation of revenue records on the name of the beneficiaries is not valid as per law.2.

    "question": "Partition suit and property disputes",
    "answer": "Dear client,1. If the properties were mutated into the names of the children before the demise of the parents, as per the will executed in 1984, the transfer could be considered valid. However, the validity of such transfers might depend on various factors, including the nature of the properties and any subsequent legal challenges raised.2. \"X\" receiving a property from \"D\" through an unregistered document might not hold legal ground in the long run. If \"D\" holds ownership rights to the property and the transfer was not supported by a valid registered deed or relinquishment, \"D\" might have a case to reclaim or assert rights over the property.3. \"X\" admitting to the registered will of 1984 and participating in the compromise case that specifically delineated the distribution of properties, including \"Y's\" share after her demise, could establish a precedent or a form of estoppel (preventing a person from asserting a right) in the current case. This might be used as a basis to reject or challenge \"X's\" claim regarding the properties being joint family assets.Res judicata prevents the same parties from re-litigating the same issues that have already been conclusively decided by a competent court. If the matters were settled in the compromise case and \"X\" was a party to that agreement, this could be raised as a ground for rejection of the new claim by \"X\" regarding the properties being joint family assets. However, the applicability of this principle would depend on the specifics of the compromise agreement and the claims made in the current lawsuit. Courts may require full proceedings to determine the claims made, despite potential grounds for rejection based on previous legal decisions or principles like res judicata. The court will assess all evidence and arguments presented before making a final decision on the matter.

    "question": "Time frame for executive the will",
    "answer": "Dear client,Sorry to hear about your situation. Will is generally valid as long as it is properly executed and meets the requirements of Indian Succession Act, 1925. Creating, attesting, and guaranteeing legal conformity are all part of carrying out a will. Start by creating a precise and unambiguous will, and if necessary, seek legal counsel. The testator's signature and the signatures of at least two witnesses are required for the will, as per Section 63 of the Indian Succession Act. Although not required, registration enhances legitimacy (Section 18). Keep the original will safe, and if necessary, take Section 213 probate into consideration for validation. In the will, name an executor who will supervise the division of assets. After the testator's death, the executor may, pursuant to Section 301, begin the distribution procedure in line with the testator's wishes.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Which district has the power to issue Sindhutva Certificate to me?",
    "answer": "Dear client,The issuance of caste certificates and other related certificates in India is governed by specific rules and regulations that vary from state to state. Generally, the authority responsible for issuing caste certificates is the Revenue Department or the Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) in the concerned district. The jurisdiction typically lies with the district where an individual resides permanently. In your case, it seems you've resided in District B for the past 7 years and also obtained a new caste certificate from there. Usually, an individual's domicile or residency for a certain period in a specific district is a prerequisite for obtaining certificates from that district.The requirement for a residency certificate or Vasasthala Drudikarana patra might be a criterion set by District A, where you initially applied for the caste certificate. This requirement might necessitate you to prove your residency in that district. As per your description, District A appears to have constraints issuing certificates to individuals who are residents of other districts. This aligns with the common practice where one district's authorities do not usually issue certificates to residents of another district. Each district has its own jurisdiction and authority in these matters. The rules regarding the issuance of caste certificates, residency certificates, and related documents can vary significantly across states and may have specific local government circulars or orders governing them. These can usually be found in the state government's official websites, Revenue Department notifications, or directives issued by the concerned administrative bodies.Given these considerations, if you wish to obtain a caste certificate (Sindhutva certificate) from District A where you initially applied but face constraints due to residency requirements, it might be beneficial to consult with legal experts or authorities in District A for guidance on meeting their criteria, or to explore the possibility of applying for the certificate in District B, where you have been a resident for the past 7 years.

The incorrect mention of the name 'ABC' in the north boundary could be considered an error, especially if it does not correspond to any actual entity or reference in the location. Additionally, the transformation of the land from agricultural to non-agricultural use and the subsequent division for road construction further complicates the issue.For Z, who purchased the house with the same boundaries mentioned in the flawed sale deed, rectification may indeed be necessary to ensure clarity and accuracy in the property description. In India, rectification of documents can be pursued through legal channels.Z can file a rectification suit in the appropriate civil court. This suit aims to rectify the error in the boundary description and correct the inaccuracies in the sale deed. Z should provide evidence to support the claim of the incorrect description. Any documents, surveys, or records that prove the actual boundaries of the property should be gathered and presented as evidence in court to support the claim for rectification. Sometimes, parties involved may opt for negotiation or mediation to resolve such issues without going through lengthy court proceedings. If the previous owner (Y) acknowledges the mistake and is willing to rectify it, a mutually agreed-upon rectification deed can be drawn up.

This conversion usually involves obtaining permission from the relevant authorities or government departments. If the status of the land has changed, such as the northern boundary being converted into a house with a designated number, it's possible to update the boundaries in the new sale deed to reflect the accurate and current status of the property. To update the boundaries in the new sale deed, you'll need to provide evidence or documentation supporting the current status of the land. This might include updated survey reports, clearance certificates from local authorities, and any other relevant paperwork showing the change in status.

Usually, the LRs (Legal Representatives) of the deceased plaintiff would need to be impleaded in the appeal suit.2. Challenge to Condonation of Delay and Revocation Order: Yes, the LRs of the deceased plaintiff can challenge the condonation of delay and the exparte revocation order in the appeal court (District Court). They can argue that proper notice wasn't served due to the change in your address and the plaintiff's death.3. Filing an Appeal: The LRs of the deceased plaintiff can file an appeal in the same court (District Court) against the orders obtained by hiding the plaintiff's death. If they believe there was a lack of due process due to the plaintiff's death not being acknowledged, they can address this in the appeal.4. Effect of Release Deed: The fact that the deceased plaintiff and their LRs released their share in the property through a registered Release Deed might limit their rights to challenge certain aspects. However, it doesn’t necessarily preclude them from contesting procedural irregularities or lack of due process in subsequent legal proceedings.5. LRs Contesting the Appeal Suit: The LRs of the deceased plaintiff can contest the appeal suit and also aim to set aside the exparte orders. They have the opportunity to present their case and argue that they were not duly informed or involved in the proceedings due to the plaintiff's death.Under Indian law, the process can vary based on specific circumstances, and the court will generally aim to provide fair opportunities for all parties involved. It’s crucial to gather all relevant documents, evidence of communication attempts regarding address changes, and any legal documents (such as the Release Deed) to support your case.

    "answer": "1. The LRs of the deceased can file a petition before the appellate court intimating the death of the plaintiff and to implead the LRs in the appeal suit.2. They first have to get themselves impleaded as parties to the appeal after which they can think about the maintainability of the proposed challenge to the exparte decision of the condone delay petition.3. When the plaintiff was reported to have died, his LRs were very well aware of the pending appeal suit, they could have intimated the court about the death at that time itself without waiting for the court to send summons to the LRs of deceased.The court is not aware of the death of the plaintiff hence it became the duty of the LRs to intimate about the death especially when they came to know about the pending restoration petition.4. If the appeal is against the interest of the LRs then they can very well get impleaded in the appeal.5. The court will implead the LRs but the challenge against the decision to condone the delay may not be entertained by court.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Is  appeal suit valid after release deed with one of the coparcener?",
    "answer": "Dear client,1. Effect of Release Deed: The Release Deed can act as a form of estoppel, especially if it clearly states that the lands being released are ancestral property and acknowledges the plaintiff's entitlement to a 1/5th share. This document might limit the appellants' arguments regarding the plaintiff's share if presented properly before the court.2. Plaintiff Not Included in Release Deed: The legal reasons for not including the plaintiff as a releasor in the deed could vary. It's possible that the plaintiff might not have been included due to his willingness to relinquish his share and might not have considered himself a party to the deed. However, this would need careful legal scrutiny based on the specific circumstances surrounding the creation of the Release Deed.3. Legal Capacity of Plaintiff's Legal Heirs to Sign the Release Deed: Generally, the legal heirs of a living person may not have the authority or capacity to release a share in ancestral property without the involvement or consent of the person who holds that share, i.e., the plaintiff. If the plaintiff was alive and mentally competent, their direct involvement or consent in the release would typically be required.4. Recording the Release Deed in Court: To amend shares and pass a fresh preliminary decree, especially considering the changes brought about by the Release Deed, it would be prudent to present the Release Deed before the court. This document can be used as evidence to petition for an amendment to the preliminary decree, specifying the changes in ownership as per the deed.In essence, the Release Deed holds weight as a legal document, especially if it clearly outlines the relinquishment of the plaintiff's share in the ancestral property. However, the circumstances surrounding its creation and the absence of the plaintiff's inclusion might need further examination by a legal expert. Bringing this document to the attention of the court during the appeal proceedings could significantly impact the case's outcome.

    "answer": "Dear client,The Release Deed appears to explicitly acknowledge and accept the preliminary decree issued by the court, confirming the entitlement of the plaintiff (XXX) to a 1/5th share of the ancestral property. It mentions the court's decision and explicitly states the intention of the releasors (the legal heirs of the plaintiff) to release their inherited share in favor of the releasees for a monetary consideration.Effect on the Appeal: The language used in the Release Deed seems to acknowledge the plaintiff's entitlement as per the preliminary decree. This document could significantly impact the appeal proceedings, potentially limiting the scope for the appellants to contest the plaintiff's share. It strengthens the acknowledgment of the plaintiff's entitlement to the 1/5th share as decreed by the court.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The evidence of the wife's contradictory behavior and communication, like the WhatsApp messages where she's kissing the husband and seeking help for her friend's marriage, can be used to challenge her claims of forced actions or distress, potentially undermining her credibility in court.4. The call detail records, especially those indicating odd-hour communications before and after marriage, can be used as circumstantial evidence to support claims of ongoing relationships or activities. The court may consider these records to establish patterns or relationships relevant to the case.5. The gift declaration signed by witnesses, if contested as forced, might require these witnesses to testify or provide further evidence to establish its authenticity.

    "question": "Partition suit and property disputes",
    "answer": "Dear client,1. If the properties were mutated into the names of the children before the demise of the parents, as per the will executed in 1984, the transfer could be considered valid. However, the validity of such transfers might depend on various factors, including the nature of the properties and any subsequent legal challenges raised.2. \"X\" receiving a property from \"D\" through an unregistered document might not hold legal ground in the long run. If \"D\" holds ownership rights to the property and the transfer was not supported by a valid registered deed or relinquishment, \"D\" might have a case to reclaim or assert rights over the property.3. \"X\" admitting to the registered will of 1984 and participating in the compromise case that specifically delineated the distribution of properties, including \"Y's\" share after her demise, could establish a precedent or a form of estoppel (preventing a person from asserting a right) in the current case. This might be used as a basis to reject or challenge \"X's\" claim regarding the properties being joint family assets.Res judicata prevents the same parties from re-litigating the same issues that have already been conclusively decided by a competent court. If the matters were settled in the compromise case and \"X\" was a party to that agreement, this could be raised as a ground for rejection of the new claim by \"X\" regarding the properties being joint family assets. However, the applicability of this principle would depend on the specifics of the compromise agreement and the claims made in the current lawsuit. Courts may require full proceedings to determine the claims made, despite potential grounds for rejection based on previous legal decisions or principles like res judicata. The court will assess all evidence and arguments presented before making a final decision on the matter.

    "answer": "Dear client,The issuance of caste certificates and other related certificates in India is governed by specific rules and regulations that vary from state to state. Generally, the authority responsible for issuing caste certificates is the Revenue Department or the Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) in the concerned district. The jurisdiction typically lies with the district where an individual resides permanently. In your case, it seems you've resided in District B for the past 7 years and also obtained a new caste certificate from there. Usually, an individual's domicile or residency for a certain period in a specific district is a prerequisite for obtaining certificates from that district.The requirement for a residency certificate or Vasasthala Drudikarana patra might be a criterion set by District A, where you initially applied for the caste certificate. This requirement might necessitate you to prove your residency in that district. As per your description, District A appears to have constraints issuing certificates to individuals who are residents of other districts. This aligns with the common practice where one district's authorities do not usually issue certificates to residents of another district. Each district has its own jurisdiction and authority in these matters. The rules regarding the issuance of caste certificates, residency certificates, and related documents can vary significantly across states and may have specific local government circulars or orders governing them. These can usually be found in the state government's official websites, Revenue Department notifications, or directives issued by the concerned administrative bodies.Given these considerations, if you wish to obtain a caste certificate (Sindhutva certificate) from District A where you initially applied but face constraints due to residency requirements, it might be beneficial to consult with legal experts or authorities in District A for guidance on meeting their criteria, or to explore the possibility of applying for the certificate in District B, where you have been a resident for the past 7 years.

    "answer": "Dear client,Yes, there seems to be a discrepancy in the description of the land boundaries in the sale deed. The incorrect mention of the name 'ABC' in the north boundary could be considered an error, especially if it does not correspond to any actual entity or reference in the location. Additionally, the transformation of the land from agricultural to non-agricultural use and the subsequent division for road construction further complicates the issue.For Z, who purchased the house with the same boundaries mentioned in the flawed sale deed, rectification may indeed be necessary to ensure clarity and accuracy in the property description. In India, rectification of documents can be pursued through legal channels.Z can file a rectification suit in the appropriate civil court. This suit aims to rectify the error in the boundary description and correct the inaccuracies in the sale deed. Z should provide evidence to support the claim of the incorrect description. Any documents, surveys, or records that prove the actual boundaries of the property should be gathered and presented as evidence in court to support the claim for rectification. Sometimes, parties involved may opt for negotiation or mediation to resolve such issues without going through lengthy court proceedings. If the previous owner (Y) acknowledges the mistake and is willing to rectify it, a mutually agreed-upon rectification deed can be drawn up.

    "question": "Can we improvise boundaries of a land in new sale deed?",
    "answer": "Dear client,When agricultural land is converted for non-agricultural purposes, there are specific legal procedures that need to be followed. This conversion usually involves obtaining permission from the relevant authorities or government departments. If the status of the land has changed, such as the northern boundary being converted into a house with a designated number, it's possible to update the boundaries in the new sale deed to reflect the accurate and current status of the property. To update the boundaries in the new sale deed, you'll need to provide evidence or documentation supporting the current status of the land. This might include updated survey reports, clearance certificates from local authorities, and any other relevant paperwork showing the change in status. It's crucial to verify the title deeds and ownership documents of the property to ensure there are no disputes or legal issues associated with the changes in boundaries. This verification helps safeguard against future complications or disputes.

    "answer": "Dear client,In India, correcting the name on a marriage certificate can be a complex process and might vary depending on the specific circumstances and local regulations. Generally, it is possible to rectify errors or update names on official documents, including a marriage certificate, by following the legal procedures set by the government.Gather all the necessary documents that support your name change, such as your corrected ID proofs, educational certificates, and any other relevant documents. In some cases, if the registrar refuses to make the correction, you might need to approach a court to get an order to rectify the name on the marriage certificate. This process typically involves filing a petition and presenting your case to the court. In certain states, it might be necessary to publish a notice in local newspapers regarding the name change. This step aims to inform the public about the change and can be a legal requirement in some jurisdictions.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "JVPD Juhu Scheme - Parking rights for flat owners",
    "answer": "Dear client,The situation you're facing with the lack of parking rights in your co-ownership flat in the JVPD Scheme falls under the purview of property and cooperative housing laws in India. Given the unique structure of the scheme and the restrictions placed on individual building plots within the cooperative housing societies, resolving this issue might involve legal recourse and navigating through cooperative housing regulations.Review the Cooperative Housing Society Bye-Laws and Lease Deed: Understand the rules, regulations, and by-laws governing the cooperative housing societies in the JVPD Scheme. Scrutinize the lease deed to ascertain if there are any provisions related to parking rights or if it stipulates any obligations for the plot owners to provide parking spaces to the flat owners.Explore Negotiation or Mediation: Attempt to negotiate or mediate with the plot owner or the cooperative housing society to formalize the parking rights in writing. Highlight the verbal agreement and the impact on the property's marketability due to the absence of clear parking rights.File a Complaint or Legal Action: If negotiations fail, consider legal action through the appropriate channels, such as filing a complaint with the cooperative housing authority or pursuing legal remedies in court. Seek redressal for the breach of verbal agreement or any clauses in the cooperative housing laws that support your entitlement to parking rights.Document Everything: Maintain a record of all communication, agreements, and relevant documents related to the property, especially those concerning the promised parking rights. Document instances where the plot owner or cooperative housing society denied or restricted parking access.Potential Outcomes: If legal proceedings favor your claim and establish your entitlement to parking rights, it may influence the saleability of your property positively. However, it's essential to weigh the costs, time, and potential outcomes against the benefits before pursuing legal action.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Husband wife alimony dispute",
    "answer": "Dear client,1. Demand for Mother's Property: Under Indian law, generally, property owned by a mother or any individual cannot be claimed in divorce proceedings unless it was acquired jointly during the marriage. If the property is solely in your mother's name and was acquired before or independently of the marriage, it usually wouldn't be subject to division in divorce proceedings.2. Alimony and Brother's Income: In determining alimony, the court considers various factors, including the earning capacity of both spouses, assets, liabilities, financial needs, and standard of living. If your brother's income from the stationary shop is low due to it being a new venture, the court might take this into account. They may also consider family support or other available resources, including the mother's savings or siblings' contributions, while determining alimony.3. Court Proceedings Duration: The duration of court proceedings can vary significantly. Divorce cases in India can take several months to years to reach a conclusion. Factors such as the complexity of the case, backlog in the court, and willingness of both parties to negotiate can affect the duration.4. Favorability of Laws: The perception that laws are not favorable to husbands in divorce cases in India is common. However, the laws are meant to ensure fair treatment for both parties based on the specific circumstances of the case. It's not advisable for anyone to give up without seeking legal advice and exploring available options. Sometimes, out-of-court settlements through mediation or negotiation might be more beneficial for both parties.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "25 Transfer of Property Act conditional transfers is made subject to a condition satements are made",
    "answer": "Dear client,It seems like the sale deed you've shared has some elements that raise concerns about the transfer of absolute ownership. Your deed does seem to have certain conditional elements. For instance, the clause \"subject to the actual measurement\" could imply that the final sale is contingent upon a measurement that hasn't been conducted yet. Rectification might involve an addendum or amendment to the deed clarifying this condition or conducting the agreed-upon measurement. This clause introduces uncertainty about the property's precise size or boundaries. It's advisable to rectify this by conducting the measurement as agreed upon or by modifying the deed to remove this condition.As per the deed, the sellers seem to transfer ownership upon receiving the full payment. However, the clauses related to the Khatha transfer and signing documents to perfect the title hint that there might be some steps pending for full transfer. It's essential to clarify these points for complete ownership transfer. The clause indicates the seller's commitment to facilitating the transfer of title after the registration. It doesn't necessarily mean the title hasn't transferred but implies an assurance that any additional steps required for a clean title will be completed post-registration.The absence of explicit language regarding title transfer in the deed could lead to confusion or disputes. Ensure that the deed explicitly states the transfer of title from the seller to the purchaser to avoid any future complications. If you suspect that the drafted deed might cause legal issues or isn't in your best interest, it's crucial to seek legal advice from a trusted lawyer specializing in property transactions. They can review the deed thoroughly and provide guidance on necessary amendments or actions to safeguard your interests.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "25 Transfer of Property Act conditional transfers is made subject to a condition satements are made",
    "answer": "Dear client,Let's break down your concerns:The discrepancy in the measured size might cause issues later. If the deed explicitly mentions that the sale is subject to the actual measurement, and the measured area exceeds what was initially agreed upon, it might affect the terms of the sale. Failure to rectify the difference in measurement could potentially lead to disputes or legal issues in the future, especially if the discrepancy becomes a point of contention between you and the sellers. It's essential to try and resolve this matter even if the sellers are currently abroad. If the deed specifies the sale as subject to actual measurement, a change in the measured area might affect the sale consideration. Depending on the agreed-upon price per square foot, the difference in area could impact the total sale amount. Rectification becomes crucial to ensure that the sale deed accurately reflects the property's dimensions and terms agreed upon by both parties. However, rectification might not be mandatory if both parties agree to the new dimensions and are willing to proceed without altering the deed.Regarding the statement: \"The SELLERS hereby grants/transfers... as normally be conveyed under the sale\":This phrase typically refers to the standard transfer of ownership rights and interests that occur in a property sale, subject to the conditions agreed upon in the sale deed. It means the transfer of ownership is in line with the usual procedures of a property sale, subject to the conditions mentioned in the sale deed. If any conditions outlined in the deed aren't met, it might impact the completeness or legality of the transfer. The sale might not become invalid per se, but discrepancies or unfulfilled conditions could create complications in proving absolute ownership or defending against potential disputes in the future. As per the deed's language, it seems that ownership is intended to transfer to you upon meeting all the conditions outlined in the deed. However, the discrepancies in measurements and other conditions might affect the completeness of this transfer.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The misrepresentation or  concealment necessarily presupposes that the respondent was aware of the facts and circumstances which were misrepresented or concealed.Every fact and circumstance cannot be materials. Therefore,concealment of misrepresentation of every fact and circumstances cannot be said to be fraud sufficient for annulment. It is difficult to define with any certainty what can be said to be material fact or circumstance but it may be safely said that the fact or circumstance which is of such nature as would materially interfere with the marital life and pleasure including sexual pleasure will be a material fact or circumstance. The only limitation is that the material fact, or circumstance must be concerning the respondent, meaning thereby that it must be in respect of the person or character of the respondentT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

Generally, it is possible to rectify errors or update names on official documents, including a marriage certificate, by following the legal procedures set by the government.Gather all the necessary documents that support your name change, such as your corrected ID proofs, educational certificates, and any other relevant documents.

This process typically involves filing a petition and presenting your case to the court. In certain states, it might be necessary to publish a notice in local newspapers regarding the name change.

If that fails, put the debt in writing with a legal agreement that outlines the terms and conditions.

As an alternative, a lawsuit to recoup the obligation may be filed under the Indian Contract Act of 1872. For a speedier settlement, consider looking into mediation or arbitration.

    "question": "JVPD Juhu Scheme - Parking rights for flat owners",
    "answer": "Dear client,The situation you're facing with the lack of parking rights in your co-ownership flat in the JVPD Scheme falls under the purview of property and cooperative housing laws in India. Given the unique structure of the scheme and the restrictions placed on individual building plots within the cooperative housing societies, resolving this issue might involve legal recourse and navigating through cooperative housing regulations.Review the Cooperative Housing Society Bye-Laws and Lease Deed: Understand the rules, regulations, and by-laws governing the cooperative housing societies in the JVPD Scheme. Scrutinize the lease deed to ascertain if there are any provisions related to parking rights or if it stipulates any obligations for the plot owners to provide parking spaces to the flat owners.Explore Negotiation or Mediation: Attempt to negotiate or mediate with the plot owner or the cooperative housing society to formalize the parking rights in writing. Highlight the verbal agreement and the impact on the property's marketability due to the absence of clear parking rights.File a Complaint or Legal Action: If negotiations fail, consider legal action through the appropriate channels, such as filing a complaint with the cooperative housing authority or pursuing legal remedies in court. Seek redressal for the breach of verbal agreement or any clauses in the cooperative housing laws that support your entitlement to parking rights.Document Everything: Maintain a record of all communication, agreements, and relevant documents related to the property, especially those concerning the promised parking rights. Document instances where the plot owner or cooperative housing society denied or restricted parking access.Potential Outcomes: If legal proceedings favor your claim and establish your entitlement to parking rights, it may influence the saleability of your property positively. However, it's essential to weigh the costs, time, and potential outcomes against the benefits before pursuing legal action.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "context": "Asked 2 years ago in Family Law Religion: Muslim",
    "question": "Husband wife alimony dispute",
    "answer": "Dear client,1. Demand for Mother's Property: Under Indian law, generally, property owned by a mother or any individual cannot be claimed in divorce proceedings unless it was acquired jointly during the marriage. If the property is solely in your mother's name and was acquired before or independently of the marriage, it usually wouldn't be subject to division in divorce proceedings.2. Alimony and Brother's Income: In determining alimony, the court considers various factors, including the earning capacity of both spouses, assets, liabilities, financial needs, and standard of living. If your brother's income from the stationary shop is low due to it being a new venture, the court might take this into account. They may also consider family support or other available resources, including the mother's savings or siblings' contributions, while determining alimony.3. Court Proceedings Duration: The duration of court proceedings can vary significantly. Divorce cases in India can take several months to years to reach a conclusion. Factors such as the complexity of the case, backlog in the court, and willingness of both parties to negotiate can affect the duration.4. Favorability of Laws: The perception that laws are not favorable to husbands in divorce cases in India is common. However, the laws are meant to ensure fair treatment for both parties based on the specific circumstances of the case. It's not advisable for anyone to give up without seeking legal advice and exploring available options. Sometimes, out-of-court settlements through mediation or negotiation might be more beneficial for both parties.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "25 Transfer of Property Act conditional transfers is made subject to a condition satements are made",
    "answer": "Dear client,It seems like the sale deed you've shared has some elements that raise concerns about the transfer of absolute ownership. Your deed does seem to have certain conditional elements. For instance, the clause \"subject to the actual measurement\" could imply that the final sale is contingent upon a measurement that hasn't been conducted yet. Rectification might involve an addendum or amendment to the deed clarifying this condition or conducting the agreed-upon measurement. This clause introduces uncertainty about the property's precise size or boundaries. It's advisable to rectify this by conducting the measurement as agreed upon or by modifying the deed to remove this condition.As per the deed, the sellers seem to transfer ownership upon receiving the full payment. However, the clauses related to the Khatha transfer and signing documents to perfect the title hint that there might be some steps pending for full transfer. It's essential to clarify these points for complete ownership transfer. The clause indicates the seller's commitment to facilitating the transfer of title after the registration.

    "question": "25 Transfer of Property Act conditional transfers is made subject to a condition satements are made",
    "answer": "Dear client,Let's break down your concerns:The discrepancy in the measured size might cause issues later. If the deed explicitly mentions that the sale is subject to the actual measurement, and the measured area exceeds what was initially agreed upon, it might affect the terms of the sale. Failure to rectify the difference in measurement could potentially lead to disputes or legal issues in the future, especially if the discrepancy becomes a point of contention between you and the sellers. It's essential to try and resolve this matter even if the sellers are currently abroad. If the deed specifies the sale as subject to actual measurement, a change in the measured area might affect the sale consideration. Depending on the agreed-upon price per square foot, the difference in area could impact the total sale amount. Rectification becomes crucial to ensure that the sale deed accurately reflects the property's dimensions and terms agreed upon by both parties. However, rectification might not be mandatory if both parties agree to the new dimensions and are willing to proceed without altering the deed.Regarding the statement: \"The SELLERS hereby grants/transfers... as normally be conveyed under the sale\":This phrase typically refers to the standard transfer of ownership rights and interests that occur in a property sale, subject to the conditions agreed upon in the sale deed. It means the transfer of ownership is in line with the usual procedures of a property sale, subject to the conditions mentioned in the sale deed. If any conditions outlined in the deed aren't met, it might impact the completeness or legality of the transfer. The sale might not become invalid per se, but discrepancies or unfulfilled conditions could create complications in proving absolute ownership or defending against potential disputes in the future. As per the deed's language, it seems that ownership is intended to transfer to you upon meeting all the conditions outlined in the deed. However, the discrepancies in measurements and other conditions might affect the completeness of this transfer.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,The situation you're facing with the lack of parking rights in your co-ownership flat in the JVPD Scheme falls under the purview of property and cooperative housing laws in India. Given the unique structure of the scheme and the restrictions placed on individual building plots within the cooperative housing societies, resolving this issue might involve legal recourse and navigating through cooperative housing regulations.Review the Cooperative Housing Society Bye-Laws and Lease Deed: Understand the rules, regulations, and by-laws governing the cooperative housing societies in the JVPD Scheme. Scrutinize the lease deed to ascertain if there are any provisions related to parking rights or if it stipulates any obligations for the plot owners to provide parking spaces to the flat owners.Explore Negotiation or Mediation: Attempt to negotiate or mediate with the plot owner or the cooperative housing society to formalize the parking rights in writing. Highlight the verbal agreement and the impact on the property's marketability due to the absence of clear parking rights.File a Complaint or Legal Action: If negotiations fail, consider legal action through the appropriate channels, such as filing a complaint with the cooperative housing authority or pursuing legal remedies in court. Seek redressal for the breach of verbal agreement or any clauses in the cooperative housing laws that support your entitlement to parking rights.Document Everything: Maintain a record of all communication, agreements, and relevant documents related to the property, especially those concerning the promised parking rights. Document instances where the plot owner or cooperative housing society denied or restricted parking access.Potential Outcomes: If legal proceedings favor your claim and establish your entitlement to parking rights, it may influence the saleability of your property positively. However, it's essential to weigh the costs, time, and potential outcomes against the benefits before pursuing legal action.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Husband wife alimony dispute",
    "answer": "Dear client,1. Demand for Mother's Property: Under Indian law, generally, property owned by a mother or any individual cannot be claimed in divorce proceedings unless it was acquired jointly during the marriage. If the property is solely in your mother's name and was acquired before or independently of the marriage, it usually wouldn't be subject to division in divorce proceedings.2. Alimony and Brother's Income: In determining alimony, the court considers various factors, including the earning capacity of both spouses, assets, liabilities, financial needs, and standard of living. If your brother's income from the stationary shop is low due to it being a new venture, the court might take this into account. They may also consider family support or other available resources, including the mother's savings or siblings' contributions, while determining alimony.3. Court Proceedings Duration: The duration of court proceedings can vary significantly. Divorce cases in India can take several months to years to reach a conclusion. Factors such as the complexity of the case, backlog in the court, and willingness of both parties to negotiate can affect the duration.4. Favorability of Laws: The perception that laws are not favorable to husbands in divorce cases in India is common. However, the laws are meant to ensure fair treatment for both parties based on the specific circumstances of the case. It's not advisable for anyone to give up without seeking legal advice and exploring available options. Sometimes, out-of-court settlements through mediation or negotiation might be more beneficial for both parties.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,It seems like the sale deed you've shared has some elements that raise concerns about the transfer of absolute ownership. Your deed does seem to have certain conditional elements. For instance, the clause \"subject to the actual measurement\" could imply that the final sale is contingent upon a measurement that hasn't been conducted yet. Rectification might involve an addendum or amendment to the deed clarifying this condition or conducting the agreed-upon measurement. This clause introduces uncertainty about the property's precise size or boundaries. It's advisable to rectify this by conducting the measurement as agreed upon or by modifying the deed to remove this condition.As per the deed, the sellers seem to transfer ownership upon receiving the full payment. However, the clauses related to the Khatha transfer and signing documents to perfect the title hint that there might be some steps pending for full transfer.

    "question": "25 Transfer of Property Act conditional transfers is made subject to a condition satements are made",
    "answer": "Dear client,Let's break down your concerns:The discrepancy in the measured size might cause issues later. If the deed explicitly mentions that the sale is subject to the actual measurement, and the measured area exceeds what was initially agreed upon, it might affect the terms of the sale. Failure to rectify the difference in measurement could potentially lead to disputes or legal issues in the future, especially if the discrepancy becomes a point of contention between you and the sellers. It's essential to try and resolve this matter even if the sellers are currently abroad. If the deed specifies the sale as subject to actual measurement, a change in the measured area might affect the sale consideration. Depending on the agreed-upon price per square foot, the difference in area could impact the total sale amount. Rectification becomes crucial to ensure that the sale deed accurately reflects the property's dimensions and terms agreed upon by both parties. However, rectification might not be mandatory if both parties agree to the new dimensions and are willing to proceed without altering the deed.Regarding the statement: \"The SELLERS hereby grants/transfers... as normally be conveyed under the sale\":This phrase typically refers to the standard transfer of ownership rights and interests that occur in a property sale, subject to the conditions agreed upon in the sale deed. It means the transfer of ownership is in line with the usual procedures of a property sale, subject to the conditions mentioned in the sale deed. If any conditions outlined in the deed aren't met, it might impact the completeness or legality of the transfer. The sale might not become invalid per se, but discrepancies or unfulfilled conditions could create complications in proving absolute ownership or defending against potential disputes in the future. As per the deed's language, it seems that ownership is intended to transfer to you upon meeting all the conditions outlined in the deed. However, the discrepancies in measurements and other conditions might affect the completeness of this transfer.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,The situation you're facing with the lack of parking rights in your co-ownership flat in the JVPD Scheme falls under the purview of property and cooperative housing laws in India. Given the unique structure of the scheme and the restrictions placed on individual building plots within the cooperative housing societies, resolving this issue might involve legal recourse and navigating through cooperative housing regulations.Review the Cooperative Housing Society Bye-Laws and Lease Deed: Understand the rules, regulations, and by-laws governing the cooperative housing societies in the JVPD Scheme. Scrutinize the lease deed to ascertain if there are any provisions related to parking rights or if it stipulates any obligations for the plot owners to provide parking spaces to the flat owners.Explore Negotiation or Mediation: Attempt to negotiate or mediate with the plot owner or the cooperative housing society to formalize the parking rights in writing. Highlight the verbal agreement and the impact on the property's marketability due to the absence of clear parking rights.File a Complaint or Legal Action: If negotiations fail, consider legal action through the appropriate channels, such as filing a complaint with the cooperative housing authority or pursuing legal remedies in court. Seek redressal for the breach of verbal agreement or any clauses in the cooperative housing laws that support your entitlement to parking rights.Document Everything: Maintain a record of all communication, agreements, and relevant documents related to the property, especially those concerning the promised parking rights. Document instances where the plot owner or cooperative housing society denied or restricted parking access.Potential Outcomes: If legal proceedings favor your claim and establish your entitlement to parking rights, it may influence the saleability of your property positively. However, it's essential to weigh the costs, time, and potential outcomes against the benefits before pursuing legal action.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Husband wife alimony dispute",
    "answer": "Dear client,1. Demand for Mother's Property: Under Indian law, generally, property owned by a mother or any individual cannot be claimed in divorce proceedings unless it was acquired jointly during the marriage. If the property is solely in your mother's name and was acquired before or independently of the marriage, it usually wouldn't be subject to division in divorce proceedings.2. Alimony and Brother's Income: In determining alimony, the court considers various factors, including the earning capacity of both spouses, assets, liabilities, financial needs, and standard of living. If your brother's income from the stationary shop is low due to it being a new venture, the court might take this into account. They may also consider family support or other available resources, including the mother's savings or siblings' contributions, while determining alimony.3. Court Proceedings Duration: The duration of court proceedings can vary significantly. Divorce cases in India can take several months to years to reach a conclusion. Factors such as the complexity of the case, backlog in the court, and willingness of both parties to negotiate can affect the duration.4. Favorability of Laws: The perception that laws are not favorable to husbands in divorce cases in India is common. However, the laws are meant to ensure fair treatment for both parties based on the specific circumstances of the case. It's not advisable for anyone to give up without seeking legal advice and exploring available options. Sometimes, out-of-court settlements through mediation or negotiation might be more beneficial for both parties.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "25 Transfer of Property Act conditional transfers is made subject to a condition satements are made",
    "answer": "Dear client,It seems like the sale deed you've shared has some elements that raise concerns about the transfer of absolute ownership. Your deed does seem to have certain conditional elements. For instance, the clause \"subject to the actual measurement\" could imply that the final sale is contingent upon a measurement that hasn't been conducted yet. Rectification might involve an addendum or amendment to the deed clarifying this condition or conducting the agreed-upon measurement. This clause introduces uncertainty about the property's precise size or boundaries. It's advisable to rectify this by conducting the measurement as agreed upon or by modifying the deed to remove this condition.As per the deed, the sellers seem to transfer ownership upon receiving the full payment. However, the clauses related to the Khatha transfer and signing documents to perfect the title hint that there might be some steps pending for full transfer. It's essential to clarify these points for complete ownership transfer. The clause indicates the seller's commitment to facilitating the transfer of title after the registration. It doesn't necessarily mean the title hasn't transferred but implies an assurance that any additional steps required for a clean title will be completed post-registration.The absence of explicit language regarding title transfer in the deed could lead to confusion or disputes. Ensure that the deed explicitly states the transfer of title from the seller to the purchaser to avoid any future complications. If you suspect that the drafted deed might cause legal issues or isn't in your best interest, it's crucial to seek legal advice from a trusted lawyer specializing in property transactions.

    "question": "25 Transfer of Property Act conditional transfers is made subject to a condition satements are made",
    "answer": "Dear client,Let's break down your concerns:The discrepancy in the measured size might cause issues later. If the deed explicitly mentions that the sale is subject to the actual measurement, and the measured area exceeds what was initially agreed upon, it might affect the terms of the sale. Failure to rectify the difference in measurement could potentially lead to disputes or legal issues in the future, especially if the discrepancy becomes a point of contention between you and the sellers. It's essential to try and resolve this matter even if the sellers are currently abroad. If the deed specifies the sale as subject to actual measurement, a change in the measured area might affect the sale consideration. Depending on the agreed-upon price per square foot, the difference in area could impact the total sale amount. Rectification becomes crucial to ensure that the sale deed accurately reflects the property's dimensions and terms agreed upon by both parties. However, rectification might not be mandatory if both parties agree to the new dimensions and are willing to proceed without altering the deed.Regarding the statement: \"The SELLERS hereby grants/transfers... as normally be conveyed under the sale\":This phrase typically refers to the standard transfer of ownership rights and interests that occur in a property sale, subject to the conditions agreed upon in the sale deed. It means the transfer of ownership is in line with the usual procedures of a property sale, subject to the conditions mentioned in the sale deed. If any conditions outlined in the deed aren't met, it might impact the completeness or legality of the transfer. The sale might not become invalid per se, but discrepancies or unfulfilled conditions could create complications in proving absolute ownership or defending against potential disputes in the future. As per the deed's language, it seems that ownership is intended to transfer to you upon meeting all the conditions outlined in the deed. However, the discrepancies in measurements and other conditions might affect the completeness of this transfer.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,While a partition suit is ongoing, it is generally advisable for co-owners to seek court permission before selling their share. Without court permission or without withdrawing the pending suit, selling their share may not be legally permissible.Sending a registered post to the registrar informing them about the attempted sale is a step to document the situation and raise awareness, but it may not automatically prevent the co-owners from selling their share.If the co-owners sell their share to a third party, and if that third party poses a threat or attempts to disturb your father's management of the property, it may be necessary to take legal action to protect your father's rights and interests. Your father may need to consult with a lawyer to explore available legal remedies.If your uncles are unwilling to sell their share to your father and insist on selling it to a third party, your father's options may be limited. However, he can consult with a lawyer to discuss the specifics of the case and explore any potential legal avenues or arguments that may be available to protect his interests.The rights and obligations of the parties involved, including your father's management of the property, would depend on the specific terms and conditions outlined in any existing agreements or court orders, as well as applicable property laws. A lawyer can provide advice on the rights and responsibilities of all parties involved and help protect your father's interests.To obtain an order of injunction to prevent your uncles from selling their share, your father would need to file a legal application in the court where the partition suit is pending. The application would need to outline the reasons and grounds for seeking the injunction. A lawyer can assist in preparing and filing the necessary application and presenting the case before the court.It is essential for your father to consult with an experienced lawyer who specializes in property and civil litigation. The lawyer can review the specific details of the case, provide tailored advice, and guide your father on the best course of action to protect his interests in the ongoing partition suit.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,After a case settles, the court might take some administrative steps. These may include drafting a final decree based on the terms of the settlement, ensuring all necessary documentation is in order, and recording the agreement officially. It's generally safe to get a vakalat from your current advocate and involve a new lawyer to obtain the final decree. However, to avoid any issues, it's crucial to clearly communicate with both the current and new lawyer about your intentions and ensure a smooth transition. Your previous advocate should not cause harm to the decree, but having a new lawyer involved can ensure the process moves forward smoothly. If your current advocate refuses to cooperate or provide the necessary documents, you have the right to engage a new lawyer to assist in obtaining the final decree. Your new lawyer can represent you in this matter without the need for the previous advocate's vakalatnama. The final decree might have been drafted or is in the process of being prepared by the court after the settlement. However, access to the draft decree might require specific procedures or permission from the court. Normally, once the stamp duty is paid, the final decree can be issued. In some cases, individuals can directly request copies of court orders or decrees by applying to the court clerk's office or the relevant court authority. This might involve formal procedures and potentially some fees, but it's usually possible to obtain copies of court documents, including the final decree, by following the correct protocol.

    "question": "Supreme Court stay order on execution",
    "answer": "Dear client,The Supreme Court has issued a stay order on further proceedings regarding the execution of the judgment by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC). This stay is conditional upon the appellant (the party appealing to the Supreme Court) depositing the entire principal amount to be refunded to the respondent within a specified timeframe (three weeks in this case). If the appellant fails to deposit this amount within the given period, the interim stay order will be automatically vacated. Typically, the deposited principal amount would need to be submitted to the court or an escrow account specified by the court. Usually, the Supreme Court would provide instructions regarding the specific procedure for depositing this amount. If the Supreme Court has issued a judgment, generally, there might be limited options for further appeal. However, in certain circumstances, if there are legal grounds (such as constitutional questions or exceptional circumstances), a review petition might be filed in the Supreme Court itself. Beyond that, very few options exist and would require a highly specialized legal approach.While awaiting an official communication from the Supreme Court regarding the stay order, it's sensible to consult a lawyer sooner rather than later. Waiting for the official letter might not be the best strategy, especially given the critical time frame mentioned in the stay order. Lawyers can track developments in the case and guide you on the necessary steps to be taken. If the appellant fails to deposit the principal amount within the specified period, as mentioned in the stay order, the interim order will be vacated automatically. In such a scenario, you might be able to proceed with further actions in the lower court.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In an jointly owned property, if one of the shareholders is relinquishing his or her rights in the property, then that particular share shall devolve equally on all the other shareholders, therefore the purpose of one person executing a relinquishment deed will be defeated, hence you better follow the advise of your advocate in this regard.4. If only one of the shareholders is transferring his rights then it would be better that he transfers his share in the property by a registered settlement deed in favor of the other shareholder  properly in order to avoid future legal complications.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Ways to Partition Co-ownership property between Brothers",
    "answer": "Dear client,While a partition suit is ongoing, it is generally advisable for co-owners to seek court permission before selling their share. Without court permission or without withdrawing the pending suit, selling their share may not be legally permissible.Sending a registered post to the registrar informing them about the attempted sale is a step to document the situation and raise awareness, but it may not automatically prevent the co-owners from selling their share.If the co-owners sell their share to a third party, and if that third party poses a threat or attempts to disturb your father's management of the property, it may be necessary to take legal action to protect your father's rights and interests. Your father may need to consult with a lawyer to explore available legal remedies.If your uncles are unwilling to sell their share to your father and insist on selling it to a third party, your father's options may be limited. However, he can consult with a lawyer to discuss the specifics of the case and explore any potential legal avenues or arguments that may be available to protect his interests.The rights and obligations of the parties involved, including your father's management of the property, would depend on the specific terms and conditions outlined in any existing agreements or court orders, as well as applicable property laws. A lawyer can provide advice on the rights and responsibilities of all parties involved and help protect your father's interests.To obtain an order of injunction to prevent your uncles from selling their share, your father would need to file a legal application in the court where the partition suit is pending. The application would need to outline the reasons and grounds for seeking the injunction. A lawyer can assist in preparing and filing the necessary application and presenting the case before the court.It is essential for your father to consult with an experienced lawyer who specializes in property and civil litigation. The lawyer can review the specific details of the case, provide tailored advice, and guide your father on the best course of action to protect his interests in the ongoing partition suit.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,After a case settles, the court might take some administrative steps. These may include drafting a final decree based on the terms of the settlement, ensuring all necessary documentation is in order, and recording the agreement officially. It's generally safe to get a vakalat from your current advocate and involve a new lawyer to obtain the final decree. However, to avoid any issues, it's crucial to clearly communicate with both the current and new lawyer about your intentions and ensure a smooth transition. Your previous advocate should not cause harm to the decree, but having a new lawyer involved can ensure the process moves forward smoothly. If your current advocate refuses to cooperate or provide the necessary documents, you have the right to engage a new lawyer to assist in obtaining the final decree. Your new lawyer can represent you in this matter without the need for the previous advocate's vakalatnama. The final decree might have been drafted or is in the process of being prepared by the court after the settlement. However, access to the draft decree might require specific procedures or permission from the court. Normally, once the stamp duty is paid, the final decree can be issued. In some cases, individuals can directly request copies of court orders or decrees by applying to the court clerk's office or the relevant court authority. This might involve formal procedures and potentially some fees, but it's usually possible to obtain copies of court documents, including the final decree, by following the correct protocol.

    "question": "How to prepare for maintainence",
    "answer": "Dear client,I understand your concerns. In the context of an arranged marriage in India, there are legal implications regarding financial matters, especially in the unfortunate event of a divorce.In India, the court may order maintenance or alimony to be paid to the spouse who lacks sufficient income to sustain themselves post-divorce. The amount is typically determined based on various factors, including the standard of living during the marriage, the earning capacity of both spouses, assets, etc. The disparity in income and assets between you and your potential spouse may influence the court's decision. A prenuptial agreement could be an option to protect your assets. While not very common in India, it's gaining recognition. It's crucial to draft it carefully and have legal assistance to ensure its validity. A prenup can specify how assets and income are to be divided in case of divorce. During divorce proceedings, both present salaries and assets (including savings) can be considered when determining maintenance. The court may take into account the financial standing of both individuals to decide on alimony.It's natural to feel anxious, especially considering the stories you might have read online. However, every relationship is unique, and legal precautions can be taken to safeguard your interests. Open communication with your potential spouse about your concerns and the possibility of a prenuptial agreement can also help address worries.

If that fails, put the debt in writing with a legal agreement that outlines the terms and conditions. The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, may be used to collect dishonored checks if the relative defaults. As an alternative, a lawsuit to recoup the obligation may be filed under the Indian Contract Act of 1872. For a speedier settlement, consider looking into mediation or arbitration. Speak with an attorney to determine the best course of action given the facts of your case and the applicable laws.

    "answer": "Dear client,In your situation, when applying for an Indian e-visa, honesty is crucial. However, you may not need to disclose the incident if the FIR was quashed by the high court.1. Arrested: If you were never formally arrested by the police, you can answer \"No\" to this question.2. Prosecuted: If no chargesheet was filed, and there was no trial due to the FIR being quashed by the high court, you could reasonably answer \"No\" to this question. Since the FIR was under investigation and ultimately quashed, there was no prosecution that went through the legal process.3. Convicted: Since the FIR was quashed by the high court and no charges were brought against you or resulted in a conviction, you can also answer \"No\" to this question.Under Indian law, the quashing of an FIR by the high court essentially means that the allegations against you were dismissed and legally nullified. However, it's crucial to accurately understand the terminology used in the e-visa application and how it aligns with your specific legal situation.When answering these questions, make sure to be precise and truthful. If the e-visa application specifically asks for details regarding the quashed FIR or provides a section for explanations or additional information, you might consider explaining the situation briefly and transparently. Providing context might help clarify any potential misunderstandings about your case. However, if the application doesn't have a provision to explain further and the questions are straightforward, answering \"No\" based on the legal resolution of the FIR might be appropriate.YOu can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Supreme Court stay order on execution",
    "answer": "Dear client,The Supreme Court has issued a stay order on further proceedings regarding the execution of the judgment by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC). This stay is conditional upon the appellant (the party appealing to the Supreme Court) depositing the entire principal amount to be refunded to the respondent within a specified timeframe (three weeks in this case). If the appellant fails to deposit this amount within the given period, the interim stay order will be automatically vacated. Typically, the deposited principal amount would need to be submitted to the court or an escrow account specified by the court. Usually, the Supreme Court would provide instructions regarding the specific procedure for depositing this amount. If the Supreme Court has issued a judgment, generally, there might be limited options for further appeal. However, in certain circumstances, if there are legal grounds (such as constitutional questions or exceptional circumstances), a review petition might be filed in the Supreme Court itself. Beyond that, very few options exist and would require a highly specialized legal approach.While awaiting an official communication from the Supreme Court regarding the stay order, it's sensible to consult a lawyer sooner rather than later. Waiting for the official letter might not be the best strategy, especially given the critical time frame mentioned in the stay order. Lawyers can track developments in the case and guide you on the necessary steps to be taken. If the appellant fails to deposit the principal amount within the specified period, as mentioned in the stay order, the interim order will be vacated automatically. In such a scenario, you might be able to proceed with further actions in the lower court.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "How much alimony can my sister receive every month after being divorced for 10 years.",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, maintenance following a divorce is determined based on various factors, including the income and financial liabilities of both parties. If your sister believes that the maintenance awarded to her is insufficient for her basic needs and livelihood, she could consider seeking a revision of the maintenance amount through legal means.Under Indian law, she can file for an enhancement of maintenance under Section 127 of theCode of Criminal Procedure(CrPC) or Section 25 of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, depending on the specifics of her case.Here's what she can consider doing:1. File for a Revision of Maintenance: She can file a petition in the court requesting an increase in the maintenance amount. She'll need to provide evidence and details about her financial situation, expenses, and the income disparity between her and her ex-husband. The court will reexamine the circumstances and may increase the maintenance amount based on the changed circumstances.2. Demonstrate Changed Circumstances: Since her ex-husband's income has increased significantly and he now has additional responsibilities (a new family), this could be used as evidence to support her case for increased maintenance.3. Mediation: Sometimes, mediation between the parties can lead to an agreement on revised maintenance without going through lengthy court procedures. This can be facilitated by legal professionals.It's important for her to gather evidence, such as bank statements, income proofs, her expenses, and any other relevant documents to support her claim for an increase in maintenance. Ultimately, the court will consider all aspects before deciding on the revised maintenance amount, including her previous lifestyle during marriage and her current financial situation.

It is in fact, what ownership is in right enforceable at law to or over the thing.2)There must exist some physical contact or control of the possessor with the thing so as to give rise to a reasonable assumption that other people will not interfere with, or simply, with the possessor’s right of use, enjoyment of that thing.This non-interference can be secured in the following ways:Physical power of the possessor- the person in possession generally uses walls, gates, doors, etc. to prevent others from interfering in his possession.3) Personal presence of the possessor- the physical power of the possessor and his personal presence though commonly present together, but it is not necessary that they must coincide.Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

As an alternative, a lawsuit to recoup the obligation may be filed under the Indian Contract Act of 1872. For a speedier settlement, consider looking into mediation or arbitration.

    "question": "Indian evisa application after 498 FIR quashed by high court",
    "answer": "Dear client,In your situation, when applying for an Indian e-visa, honesty is crucial. However, you may not need to disclose the incident if the FIR was quashed by the high court.1. Arrested: If you were never formally arrested by the police, you can answer \"No\" to this question.2. Prosecuted: If no chargesheet was filed, and there was no trial due to the FIR being quashed by the high court, you could reasonably answer \"No\" to this question. Since the FIR was under investigation and ultimately quashed, there was no prosecution that went through the legal process.3. Convicted: Since the FIR was quashed by the high court and no charges were brought against you or resulted in a conviction, you can also answer \"No\" to this question.Under Indian law, the quashing of an FIR by the high court essentially means that the allegations against you were dismissed and legally nullified. However, it's crucial to accurately understand the terminology used in the e-visa application and how it aligns with your specific legal situation.When answering these questions, make sure to be precise and truthful. If the e-visa application specifically asks for details regarding the quashed FIR or provides a section for explanations or additional information, you might consider explaining the situation briefly and transparently. Providing context might help clarify any potential misunderstandings about your case. However, if the application doesn't have a provision to explain further and the questions are straightforward, answering \"No\" based on the legal resolution of the FIR might be appropriate.YOu can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Explaining the relation between possession and ownership the Supreme Court of India in the case of B. Gangadhar v. B.R. Rajalingam stated, possession is the external form in which claims normally manifest themselves. It is in fact, what ownership is in right enforceable at law to or over the thing.2)There must exist some physical contact or control of the possessor with the thing so as to give rise to a reasonable assumption that other people will not interfere with, or simply, with the possessor’s right of use, enjoyment of that thing.This non-interference can be secured in the following ways:Physical power of the possessor- the person in possession generally uses walls, gates, doors, etc. to prevent others from interfering in his possession.3) Personal presence of the possessor- the physical power of the possessor and his personal presence though commonly present together, but it is not necessary that they must coincide.Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "answer": "this is like answering a question asked in a law paperthe question is too generic and bereft of any material particularsthis forum is not for taking exams of advocates but to put legal queries for possible replies from/legal solutions by the advocatesanyway coming to the exam question -possession is of 2 types - DEJURE possession and DEFACTO possessionthere is also 'actual' and 'constructive' possessiondejure possession - take for example a building which is fully occupied by tenants. In this case the owner , though not in actual physical possession, he can said to have constructive or dejure possessiondefacto possession - eg. an open plot of land which is unoccupied. here the person who comes in possession of such open plot of land can be said to be in 'actual' or 'defacto' possession [i.e. possession in fact]purchasing a property and obtaining title [without having the actual physical possession] cannot be equated to taking possession. there are many incidents of a sale , one of them being transfer of possession of the property by the vendor to the sellernow if the property purchased is land with building fully occupied by tenants, then in such a case it can be said that the possession is transferred to the buyer by the vendor since actual physical possession of such property to the seller is not possiblehowever if the property purchased is an open plot of land, then in that case the sale, in absence of transfer of actual physical possession, can be said to be incomplete and the buyer will have to sue the vendor or the person in possession to recover the vacant possession from such personthe incidents of ownership and possession have been explained by the Supreme Court in certain judgments, however i dont have them handy. will share if i find.hope i passed the exam. thanksYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

If that fails, put the debt in writing with a legal agreement that outlines the terms and conditions. The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, may be used to collect dishonored checks if the relative defaults. As an alternative, a lawsuit to recoup the obligation may be filed under the Indian Contract Act of 1872. For a speedier settlement, consider looking into mediation or arbitration. Speak with an attorney to determine the best course of action given the facts of your case and the applicable laws. This will ensure that the laws are followed while you pursue a just and legitimate settlement.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Firstly when your father and his brother had title on their names due to partition or inheritance, the property lost the nature of ancestral property, therefore neither your cousin or now you have any rights over the proeprty since it became self acquired property of your father and his brothers.Secondly the agreement is reported to have been entered into with the buyer in the year 1991 but it was not converted onto sale deed despite passing of 32 years, and also it is not known whether the full sale consideration amount was received by sellers and handed over possession thereon.If it is presumed that the buyer did not pay full sale consideration amount neither the possession of the property was handed over to him then it can be deemed as barred by limitation.The limitation period is just three years.If it was an unregistered sale agreement then in the absence of any attempt made by the buyer now for purchase and the same was not acknowledged by the sellers stating that the agreement is barred by limitation, then the buyer cannot institute any suit seeking for specific relief too.In this regard there is no necessity even to cancel an infructuous sale agreement afresh.The title holders of the property can ignore the sale agreement and proceed to alienate the property in any manner as per their desire.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

If the e-visa application specifically asks for details regarding the quashed FIR or provides a section for explanations or additional information, you might consider explaining the situation briefly and transparently. Providing context might help clarify any potential misunderstandings about your case. However, if the application doesn't have a provision to explain further and the questions are straightforward, answering \"No\" based on the legal resolution of the FIR might be appropriate.YOu can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "HiIn general , for abetment of suicide, there should be instigation which may be inferred from a series of acts on the part of accused that led to creation of such circumstances where the deceased had no other option left with him or her than committing suicide .  This overt act has to necessarily coupled with a concomitant element called themens reato encourage the deceased to commit suicide.In your case, it appears that there is no proximate link  between your dispute with prithi and her death given the fact that prithi filed for divorce in Jan 2013 and committed suicide in November 2014.So, legally you will win the case in the trial court given that there is NO proximate link between your dispute and hear death.Now coming to quash of proceedings under 482 cr.p.c in the high court, given that there is no mens rea and also no proximate link, you have a decent  chance to get your case quashed in the high court.  However we need to see the contents of the suicide note, her petition for divorce, Charge sheet  etc to know the full back ground.Also, discharge in your case means acquittal. Courts cannot discharge the accused without trial in 306B case.Also, the case is between state of telangana and you. so the complainant has no right whatsoever to either compromise or withdraw the case.Hope this helps.Rajgopalan SripathiAdvocate, Hyderabad2173 Answers394 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Rajgopalan Sripathi"

It is not advisable to approach high court to remove thesection 498aIPC because the charge sheet has been filed along with the other charges too, hence may wait for the trial to begin.3.

    "question": "How much alimony can my sister receive every month after being divorced for 10 years.",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, maintenance following a divorce is determined based on various factors, including the income and financial liabilities of both parties. If your sister believes that the maintenance awarded to her is insufficient for her basic needs and livelihood, she could consider seeking a revision of the maintenance amount through legal means.Under Indian law, she can file for an enhancement of maintenance under Section 127 of theCode of Criminal Procedure(CrPC) or Section 25 of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, depending on the specifics of her case.Here's what she can consider doing:1. File for a Revision of Maintenance: She can file a petition in the court requesting an increase in the maintenance amount. She'll need to provide evidence and details about her financial situation, expenses, and the income disparity between her and her ex-husband. The court will reexamine the circumstances and may increase the maintenance amount based on the changed circumstances.2. Demonstrate Changed Circumstances: Since her ex-husband's income has increased significantly and he now has additional responsibilities (a new family), this could be used as evidence to support her case for increased maintenance.3. Mediation: Sometimes, mediation between the parties can lead to an agreement on revised maintenance without going through lengthy court procedures. This can be facilitated by legal professionals.It's important for her to gather evidence, such as bank statements, income proofs, her expenses, and any other relevant documents to support her claim for an increase in maintenance. Ultimately, the court will consider all aspects before deciding on the revised maintenance amount, including her previous lifestyle during marriage and her current financial situation.

In this case the owner , though not in actual physical possession, he can said to have constructive or dejure possessiondefacto possession - eg. an open plot of land which is unoccupied. here the person who comes in possession of such open plot of land can be said to be in 'actual' or 'defacto' possession [i.e. possession in fact]purchasing a property and obtaining title [without having the actual physical possession] cannot be equated to taking possession. there are many incidents of a sale , one of them being transfer of possession of the property by the vendor to the sellernow if the property purchased is land with building fully occupied by tenants, then in such a case it can be said that the possession is transferred to the buyer by the vendor since actual physical possession of such property to the seller is not possiblehowever if the property purchased is an open plot of land, then in that case the sale, in absence of transfer of actual physical possession, can be said to be incomplete and the buyer will have to sue the vendor or the person in possession to recover the vacant possession from such personthe incidents of ownership and possession have been explained by the Supreme Court in certain judgments, however i dont have them handy. will share if i find.hope i passed the exam. thanksYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Indian evisa application after 498 FIR quashed by high court",
    "answer": "Dear client,In your situation, when applying for an Indian e-visa, honesty is crucial. However, you may not need to disclose the incident if the FIR was quashed by the high court.1. Arrested: If you were never formally arrested by the police, you can answer \"No\" to this question.2. Prosecuted: If no chargesheet was filed, and there was no trial due to the FIR being quashed by the high court, you could reasonably answer \"No\" to this question. Since the FIR was under investigation and ultimately quashed, there was no prosecution that went through the legal process.3. Convicted: Since the FIR was quashed by the high court and no charges were brought against you or resulted in a conviction, you can also answer \"No\" to this question.Under Indian law, the quashing of an FIR by the high court essentially means that the allegations against you were dismissed and legally nullified. However, it's crucial to accurately understand the terminology used in the e-visa application and how it aligns with your specific legal situation.When answering these questions, make sure to be precise and truthful. If the e-visa application specifically asks for details regarding the quashed FIR or provides a section for explanations or additional information, you might consider explaining the situation briefly and transparently. Providing context might help clarify any potential misunderstandings about your case. However, if the application doesn't have a provision to explain further and the questions are straightforward, answering \"No\" based on the legal resolution of the FIR might be appropriate.YOu can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "How much alimony can my sister receive every month after being divorced for 10 years.",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, maintenance following a divorce is determined based on various factors, including the income and financial liabilities of both parties. If your sister believes that the maintenance awarded to her is insufficient for her basic needs and livelihood, she could consider seeking a revision of the maintenance amount through legal means.Under Indian law, she can file for an enhancement of maintenance under Section 127 of theCode of Criminal Procedure(CrPC) or Section 25 of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, depending on the specifics of her case.Here's what she can consider doing:1. File for a Revision of Maintenance: She can file a petition in the court requesting an increase in the maintenance amount. She'll need to provide evidence and details about her financial situation, expenses, and the income disparity between her and her ex-husband. The court will reexamine the circumstances and may increase the maintenance amount based on the changed circumstances.2. Demonstrate Changed Circumstances: Since her ex-husband's income has increased significantly and he now has additional responsibilities (a new family), this could be used as evidence to support her case for increased maintenance.3. Mediation: Sometimes, mediation between the parties can lead to an agreement on revised maintenance without going through lengthy court procedures. This can be facilitated by legal professionals.It's important for her to gather evidence, such as bank statements, income proofs, her expenses, and any other relevant documents to support her claim for an increase in maintenance. Ultimately, the court will consider all aspects before deciding on the revised maintenance amount, including her previous lifestyle during marriage and her current financial situation.

In this case the owner , though not in actual physical possession, he can said to have constructive or dejure possessiondefacto possession - eg. an open plot of land which is unoccupied. here the person who comes in possession of such open plot of land can be said to be in 'actual' or 'defacto' possession [i.e. possession in fact]purchasing a property and obtaining title [without having the actual physical possession] cannot be equated to taking possession. there are many incidents of a sale , one of them being transfer of possession of the property by the vendor to the sellernow if the property purchased is land with building fully occupied by tenants, then in such a case it can be said that the possession is transferred to the buyer by the vendor since actual physical possession of such property to the seller is not possiblehowever if the property purchased is an open plot of land, then in that case the sale, in absence of transfer of actual physical possession, can be said to be incomplete and the buyer will have to sue the vendor or the person in possession to recover the vacant possession from such personthe incidents of ownership and possession have been explained by the Supreme Court in certain judgments, however i dont have them handy. will share if i find.hope i passed the exam. thanksYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "HiIn general , for abetment of suicide, there should be instigation which may be inferred from a series of acts on the part of accused that led to creation of such circumstances where the deceased had no other option left with him or her than committing suicide .  This overt act has to necessarily coupled with a concomitant element called themens reato encourage the deceased to commit suicide.In your case, it appears that there is no proximate link  between your dispute with prithi and her death given the fact that prithi filed for divorce in Jan 2013 and committed suicide in November 2014.So, legally you will win the case in the trial court given that there is NO proximate link between your dispute and hear death.Now coming to quash of proceedings under 482 cr.p.c in the high court, given that there is no mens rea and also no proximate link, you have a decent  chance to get your case quashed in the high court.  However we need to see the contents of the suicide note, her petition for divorce, Charge sheet  etc to know the full back ground.Also, discharge in your case means acquittal. Courts cannot discharge the accused without trial in 306B case.Also, the case is between state of telangana and you. so the complainant has no right whatsoever to either compromise or withdraw the case.Hope this helps.Rajgopalan SripathiAdvocate, Hyderabad2173 Answers394 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Rajgopalan Sripathi"

    "question": "What is considered as possession of property?",
    "answer": "this is like answering a question asked in a law paperthe question is too generic and bereft of any material particularsthis forum is not for taking exams of advocates but to put legal queries for possible replies from/legal solutions by the advocatesanyway coming to the exam question -possession is of 2 types - DEJURE possession and DEFACTO possessionthere is also 'actual' and 'constructive' possessiondejure possession - take for example a building which is fully occupied by tenants. In this case the owner , though not in actual physical possession, he can said to have constructive or dejure possessiondefacto possession - eg. an open plot of land which is unoccupied. here the person who comes in possession of such open plot of land can be said to be in 'actual' or 'defacto' possession [i.e. possession in fact]purchasing a property and obtaining title [without having the actual physical possession] cannot be equated to taking possession. there are many incidents of a sale , one of them being transfer of possession of the property by the vendor to the sellernow if the property purchased is land with building fully occupied by tenants, then in such a case it can be said that the possession is transferred to the buyer by the vendor since actual physical possession of such property to the seller is not possiblehowever if the property purchased is an open plot of land, then in that case the sale, in absence of transfer of actual physical possession, can be said to be incomplete and the buyer will have to sue the vendor or the person in possession to recover the vacant possession from such personthe incidents of ownership and possession have been explained by the Supreme Court in certain judgments, however i dont have them handy. will share if i find.hope i passed the exam. thanksYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Right of son",
    "answer": "Firstly when your father and his brother had title on their names due to partition or inheritance, the property lost the nature of ancestral property, therefore neither your cousin or now you have any rights over the proeprty since it became self acquired property of your father and his brothers.Secondly the agreement is reported to have been entered into with the buyer in the year 1991 but it was not converted onto sale deed despite passing of 32 years, and also it is not known whether the full sale consideration amount was received by sellers and handed over possession thereon.If it is presumed that the buyer did not pay full sale consideration amount neither the possession of the property was handed over to him then it can be deemed as barred by limitation.The limitation period is just three years.If it was an unregistered sale agreement then in the absence of any attempt made by the buyer now for purchase and the same was not acknowledged by the sellers stating that the agreement is barred by limitation, then the buyer cannot institute any suit seeking for specific relief too.In this regard there is no necessity even to cancel an infructuous sale agreement afresh.The title holders of the property can ignore the sale agreement and proceed to alienate the property in any manner as per their desire.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "HiIn general , for abetment of suicide, there should be instigation which may be inferred from a series of acts on the part of accused that led to creation of such circumstances where the deceased had no other option left with him or her than committing suicide .  This overt act has to necessarily coupled with a concomitant element called themens reato encourage the deceased to commit suicide.In your case, it appears that there is no proximate link  between your dispute with prithi and her death given the fact that prithi filed for divorce in Jan 2013 and committed suicide in November 2014.So, legally you will win the case in the trial court given that there is NO proximate link between your dispute and hear death.Now coming to quash of proceedings under 482 cr.p.c in the high court, given that there is no mens rea and also no proximate link, you have a decent  chance to get your case quashed in the high court.  However we need to see the contents of the suicide note, her petition for divorce, Charge sheet  etc to know the full back ground.Also, discharge in your case means acquittal. Courts cannot discharge the accused without trial in 306B case.Also, the case is between state of telangana and you. so the complainant has no right whatsoever to either compromise or withdraw the case.Hope this helps.Rajgopalan SripathiAdvocate, Hyderabad2173 Answers394 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Rajgopalan Sripathi"

    "question": "Supreme Court stay order on execution",
    "answer": "Dear client,The Supreme Court has issued a stay order on further proceedings regarding the execution of the judgment by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC). This stay is conditional upon the appellant (the party appealing to the Supreme Court) depositing the entire principal amount to be refunded to the respondent within a specified timeframe (three weeks in this case). If the appellant fails to deposit this amount within the given period, the interim stay order will be automatically vacated. Typically, the deposited principal amount would need to be submitted to the court or an escrow account specified by the court. Usually, the Supreme Court would provide instructions regarding the specific procedure for depositing this amount. If the Supreme Court has issued a judgment, generally, there might be limited options for further appeal. However, in certain circumstances, if there are legal grounds (such as constitutional questions or exceptional circumstances), a review petition might be filed in the Supreme Court itself. Beyond that, very few options exist and would require a highly specialized legal approach.While awaiting an official communication from the Supreme Court regarding the stay order, it's sensible to consult a lawyer sooner rather than later. Waiting for the official letter might not be the best strategy, especially given the critical time frame mentioned in the stay order. Lawyers can track developments in the case and guide you on the necessary steps to be taken. If the appellant fails to deposit the principal amount within the specified period, as mentioned in the stay order, the interim order will be vacated automatically. In such a scenario, you might be able to proceed with further actions in the lower court.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In this case the owner , though not in actual physical possession, he can said to have constructive or dejure possessiondefacto possession - eg. an open plot of land which is unoccupied. here the person who comes in possession of such open plot of land can be said to be in 'actual' or 'defacto' possession [i.e. possession in fact]purchasing a property and obtaining title [without having the actual physical possession] cannot be equated to taking possession. there are many incidents of a sale , one of them being transfer of possession of the property by the vendor to the sellernow if the property purchased is land with building fully occupied by tenants, then in such a case it can be said that the possession is transferred to the buyer by the vendor since actual physical possession of such property to the seller is not possiblehowever if the property purchased is an open plot of land, then in that case the sale, in absence of transfer of actual physical possession, can be said to be incomplete and the buyer will have to sue the vendor or the person in possession to recover the vacant possession from such personthe incidents of ownership and possession have been explained by the Supreme Court in certain judgments, however i dont have them handy. will share if i find.hope i passed the exam. thanksYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Even though she is highly qualified but if she is not employed and has ascertained that she has no sources of income to meet her expenses, she would be eligible for monthly maintenance.Her demand for one time settlement is not a legal provision, it is a matter of compromise settlement in the divorce proceedings if at all a situation arise.For child custody you have to file a petition under the provisions of guardians and wards act, getting custody will depend on how strongly you present your arguments and convince the court.If you have decided to give her divorce, then you can better choosemutual consent divorceand it is again your decision whether to accept her terms or reject it in respect of the one time settlement amount, and other aspects.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Supreme Court stay order on execution",
    "answer": "Dear client,The Supreme Court has issued a stay order on further proceedings regarding the execution of the judgment by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC). This stay is conditional upon the appellant (the party appealing to the Supreme Court) depositing the entire principal amount to be refunded to the respondent within a specified timeframe (three weeks in this case). If the appellant fails to deposit this amount within the given period, the interim stay order will be automatically vacated. Typically, the deposited principal amount would need to be submitted to the court or an escrow account specified by the court. Usually, the Supreme Court would provide instructions regarding the specific procedure for depositing this amount. If the Supreme Court has issued a judgment, generally, there might be limited options for further appeal. However, in certain circumstances, if there are legal grounds (such as constitutional questions or exceptional circumstances), a review petition might be filed in the Supreme Court itself. Beyond that, very few options exist and would require a highly specialized legal approach.While awaiting an official communication from the Supreme Court regarding the stay order, it's sensible to consult a lawyer sooner rather than later. Waiting for the official letter might not be the best strategy, especially given the critical time frame mentioned in the stay order. Lawyers can track developments in the case and guide you on the necessary steps to be taken. If the appellant fails to deposit the principal amount within the specified period, as mentioned in the stay order, the interim order will be vacated automatically. In such a scenario, you might be able to proceed with further actions in the lower court.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,In India, legal recourse for matrimonial issues like this falls under several provisions. Here's an overview of potential legal options available to your daughter:1.Restitution of Conjugal Rights: This legal provision allows either spouse to request the other to resume cohabitation. If the husband continues to refuse, it can be used as a ground for divorce.2.Domestic ViolenceAct: If your daughter has faced any form of mental or physical abuse, she can file a case under the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, seeking protection, maintenance, and compensation.3. Mental Cruelty: This is a ground for divorce under theHindu Marriage Act. If the husband's behavior has been consistently cruel, causing mental trauma, it could be used as a legal ground.4. Desertion: If the husband has abandoned your daughter for a continuous period of two years or more, she may have a case for divorce under the ground of desertion.5. Seeking Compensation: Your daughter may request reimbursement of marriage expenses and compensation for the trauma faced due to the failed marriage. However, this might be harder to establish unless there's specific legal precedent or grounds for it.Additionally, documentation of all events, communications, and evidence of attempts to reconcile or communicate with the husband could be crucial in building her case.

    "question": "Supreme Court stay order on execution",
    "answer": "Dear client,The Supreme Court has issued a stay order on further proceedings regarding the execution of the judgment by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC). This stay is conditional upon the appellant (the party appealing to the Supreme Court) depositing the entire principal amount to be refunded to the respondent within a specified timeframe (three weeks in this case). If the appellant fails to deposit this amount within the given period, the interim stay order will be automatically vacated. Typically, the deposited principal amount would need to be submitted to the court or an escrow account specified by the court. Usually, the Supreme Court would provide instructions regarding the specific procedure for depositing this amount. If the Supreme Court has issued a judgment, generally, there might be limited options for further appeal. However, in certain circumstances, if there are legal grounds (such as constitutional questions or exceptional circumstances), a review petition might be filed in the Supreme Court itself. Beyond that, very few options exist and would require a highly specialized legal approach.While awaiting an official communication from the Supreme Court regarding the stay order, it's sensible to consult a lawyer sooner rather than later. Waiting for the official letter might not be the best strategy, especially given the critical time frame mentioned in the stay order. Lawyers can track developments in the case and guide you on the necessary steps to be taken. If the appellant fails to deposit the principal amount within the specified period, as mentioned in the stay order, the interim order will be vacated automatically. In such a scenario, you might be able to proceed with further actions in the lower court.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,In India, if a person is facing challenges with police inaction or delay in investigating a case, they can approach the judiciary for relief. A can file a Writ of Mandamus in the High Court, seeking a direction from the court to compel the police to perform their duty and conduct a proper investigation within a specified time frame. Mandamus is a legal remedy used to enforce the performance of a public duty by a public authority—in this case, the duty of the police to investigate.A can file a Criminal Miscellaneous Petition before the High Court under Section 482 of theCode of Criminal Procedure(CrPC). This petition can request the court to quash the FIR or direct the police to conduct a thorough and time-bound investigation.A can request the court to issue directions to the police, directing them to file a status report or chargesheet within a stipulated period. The court can monitor the progress of the investigation and ensure timely action.A can also seek interim relief, such as directions to the police to refrain from taking coercive action against A until the investigation is completed or specific orders from the court regarding the handling of the case.In each of these approaches, it's essential to present compelling arguments supported by legal precedents and evidence to demonstrate the urgency and necessity for the court's intervention.

Seeking legal advice is a wise step.In many cases, you have the right to bring an advocate or a lawyer with you to ensure your interests are protected. Discuss this with your lawyer, and if they agree, it's a good idea to have legal representation when you visit the workshop. Insist on inspecting the furniture at the workshop before making any further payments. Ensure that the furniture matches the agreed-upon measurements and quality. If the merchandise is not as agreed, document the discrepancies and discuss them with your lawyer before making any payments. If the furniture doesn't meet the agreed specifications, negotiate with the merchant regarding rectification or a refund. Your lawyer can guide you through this process and advocate on your behalf. Act promptly but cautiously. Don't feel pressured to make a decision on the spot. Take your time to evaluate the situation with your lawyer's guidance.As for finding a lawyer, consider searching online legal directories or contacting local legal aid services for recommendations.

Wife cannot be entitled to maintenance by the husband when she is highly qualified and has been earning even after her marriage, though she does not truthfully disclose her true income.In case of Kusum Bhatia Vs.Sagar Sethi S.L.P.(C) No.16051/2017 by order dated 16.09.2019 Hon'ble Supreme Court has declined to award any maintenance u/s 24 of H.M.A to wife who was working and getting sufficient salary, however it awarded maintenance to the Daughter.In case of Bhushan Kumar Meen Vs. Mansi Meen SLP (Crl) 7924 of 2008 Hon'ble Supreme Court while reducing the maintenance amount from Rs.10,000/- to Rs.5,000/- granted by the lower court to the wife, the Supreme Court observed that \"we cannot also shut our eyes to the fact that at present the respondent wife is not employed or at least there is nothing on record to indicate that she is employed in any gainful work. However having regard to the qualifications that she possesses, there is no reason why she ought not to be in a position to also maintain herself in the future.\"Therefore, there are various cases in which it has been reduced or denied from Hon'ble Supreme Court.You'll to file the Vakalatnama through AOR and file the reply accordingly. Generally, 4 weeks time is given to the respondent to file the Vakalatnama and reply i.e. the counter affidavit. In case, no one appears from respondent's side in 2-3 hearings, Court will pass appropriate order without any further notice. Therefore, defending the case in timely manner is essential.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.RegardsMr. Gopal VermaAdvocate on Record & Amicus CuriaeSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, Delhi418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma"

    "answer": "Dear client,In India, legal recourse for matrimonial issues like this falls under several provisions. Here's an overview of potential legal options available to your daughter:1.Restitution of Conjugal Rights: This legal provision allows either spouse to request the other to resume cohabitation. If the husband continues to refuse, it can be used as a ground for divorce.2.Domestic ViolenceAct: If your daughter has faced any form of mental or physical abuse, she can file a case under the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, seeking protection, maintenance, and compensation.3. Mental Cruelty: This is a ground for divorce under theHindu Marriage Act. If the husband's behavior has been consistently cruel, causing mental trauma, it could be used as a legal ground.4. Desertion: If the husband has abandoned your daughter for a continuous period of two years or more, she may have a case for divorce under the ground of desertion.5. Seeking Compensation: Your daughter may request reimbursement of marriage expenses and compensation for the trauma faced due to the failed marriage. However, this might be harder to establish unless there's specific legal precedent or grounds for it.Additionally, documentation of all events, communications, and evidence of attempts to reconcile or communicate with the husband could be crucial in building her case.

    "answer": "Dear client,In India, if a person is facing challenges with police inaction or delay in investigating a case, they can approach the judiciary for relief. A can file a Writ of Mandamus in the High Court, seeking a direction from the court to compel the police to perform their duty and conduct a proper investigation within a specified time frame. Mandamus is a legal remedy used to enforce the performance of a public duty by a public authority—in this case, the duty of the police to investigate.A can file a Criminal Miscellaneous Petition before the High Court under Section 482 of theCode of Criminal Procedure(CrPC). This petition can request the court to quash the FIR or direct the police to conduct a thorough and time-bound investigation.A can request the court to issue directions to the police, directing them to file a status report or chargesheet within a stipulated period. The court can monitor the progress of the investigation and ensure timely action.A can also seek interim relief, such as directions to the police to refrain from taking coercive action against A until the investigation is completed or specific orders from the court regarding the handling of the case.In each of these approaches, it's essential to present compelling arguments supported by legal precedents and evidence to demonstrate the urgency and necessity for the court's intervention. The court's decision will depend on the merits of the case and the prevailing legal principles.

Seeking legal advice is a wise step.In many cases, you have the right to bring an advocate or a lawyer with you to ensure your interests are protected. Discuss this with your lawyer, and if they agree, it's a good idea to have legal representation when you visit the workshop. Insist on inspecting the furniture at the workshop before making any further payments. Ensure that the furniture matches the agreed-upon measurements and quality. If the merchandise is not as agreed, document the discrepancies and discuss them with your lawyer before making any payments. If the furniture doesn't meet the agreed specifications, negotiate with the merchant regarding rectification or a refund. Your lawyer can guide you through this process and advocate on your behalf. Act promptly but cautiously. Don't feel pressured to make a decision on the spot. Take your time to evaluate the situation with your lawyer's guidance.As for finding a lawyer, consider searching online legal directories or contacting local legal aid services for recommendations. Additionally, you can try using platforms like legal services apps or websites that connect you with lawyers in your area.

    "answer": "Dear client,In India, if a person is facing challenges with police inaction or delay in investigating a case, they can approach the judiciary for relief. A can file a Writ of Mandamus in the High Court, seeking a direction from the court to compel the police to perform their duty and conduct a proper investigation within a specified time frame. Mandamus is a legal remedy used to enforce the performance of a public duty by a public authority—in this case, the duty of the police to investigate.A can file a Criminal Miscellaneous Petition before the High Court under Section 482 of theCode of Criminal Procedure(CrPC). This petition can request the court to quash the FIR or direct the police to conduct a thorough and time-bound investigation.A can request the court to issue directions to the police, directing them to file a status report or chargesheet within a stipulated period. The court can monitor the progress of the investigation and ensure timely action.A can also seek interim relief, such as directions to the police to refrain from taking coercive action against A until the investigation is completed or specific orders from the court regarding the handling of the case.In each of these approaches, it's essential to present compelling arguments supported by legal precedents and evidence to demonstrate the urgency and necessity for the court's intervention. The court's decision will depend on the merits of the case and the prevailing legal principles.

Seeking legal advice is a wise step.In many cases, you have the right to bring an advocate or a lawyer with you to ensure your interests are protected. Discuss this with your lawyer, and if they agree, it's a good idea to have legal representation when you visit the workshop. Insist on inspecting the furniture at the workshop before making any further payments. Ensure that the furniture matches the agreed-upon measurements and quality. If the merchandise is not as agreed, document the discrepancies and discuss them with your lawyer before making any payments. If the furniture doesn't meet the agreed specifications, negotiate with the merchant regarding rectification or a refund. Your lawyer can guide you through this process and advocate on your behalf. Act promptly but cautiously. Don't feel pressured to make a decision on the spot. Take your time to evaluate the situation with your lawyer's guidance.As for finding a lawyer, consider searching online legal directories or contacting local legal aid services for recommendations.

    "question": "Capital gain under mother's name bought a new house under triple ownership",
    "answer": "Dear client,Under Section 54 of the Income Tax Act in India, if an individual or HUF (Hindu Undivided Family) sells a residential property and reinvests the capital gains in purchasing or constructing another residential property, they can claim an exemption on the capital gains tax. The exemption is available if the property sold and the property purchased are residential houses. The new property must be purchased either one year before the sale of the property or within two years after the sale. In the case of construction, the property should be completed within three years after the sale.  The entire capital gains amount needs to be reinvested to claim 100% exemption. If only a portion of the gains is reinvested, the exemption is restricted to the proportionate amount.From your description, it appears that the tax authorities have reduced the benefit because the property was jointly purchased by your mother, yourself, and your sister, while the initial property was solely owned by your mother. The capital gain benefit might have been adjusted to reflect the proportionate ownership in the new property.

Mansi Meen SLP (Crl) 7924 of 2008 Hon'ble Supreme Court while reducing the maintenance amount from Rs.10,000/- to Rs.5,000/- granted by the lower court to the wife, the Supreme Court observed that \"we cannot also shut our eyes to the fact that at present the respondent wife is not employed or at least there is nothing on record to indicate that she is employed in any gainful work. However having regard to the qualifications that she possesses, there is no reason why she ought not to be in a position to also maintain herself in the future.\"Therefore, there are various cases in which it has been reduced or denied from Hon'ble Supreme Court.You'll to file the Vakalatnama through AOR and file the reply accordingly. Generally, 4 weeks time is given to the respondent to file the Vakalatnama and reply i.e. the counter affidavit. In case, no one appears from respondent's side in 2-3 hearings, Court will pass appropriate order without any further notice.

    "context": "Asked 1 year ago in Property Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Supreme Court stay order on execution",
    "answer": "Dear client,The Supreme Court has issued a stay order on further proceedings regarding the execution of the judgment by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC). This stay is conditional upon the appellant (the party appealing to the Supreme Court) depositing the entire principal amount to be refunded to the respondent within a specified timeframe (three weeks in this case). If the appellant fails to deposit this amount within the given period, the interim stay order will be automatically vacated. Typically, the deposited principal amount would need to be submitted to the court or an escrow account specified by the court. Usually, the Supreme Court would provide instructions regarding the specific procedure for depositing this amount. If the Supreme Court has issued a judgment, generally, there might be limited options for further appeal. However, in certain circumstances, if there are legal grounds (such as constitutional questions or exceptional circumstances), a review petition might be filed in the Supreme Court itself. Beyond that, very few options exist and would require a highly specialized legal approach.While awaiting an official communication from the Supreme Court regarding the stay order, it's sensible to consult a lawyer sooner rather than later. Waiting for the official letter might not be the best strategy, especially given the critical time frame mentioned in the stay order.

The most commonly used method is Area Wise maintenance charge, A rate is fixed for one square feet and then multiplied by the total square feet area of your flat in this method. It means that if you have a larger home, you will end up paying more.- Further, the common areas are divided equally using a fixed rate while flats are calculated depending on the size of the apartment.3. Partially Equal Fee i.e. A particular amount of money is charged on the area up to a predetermined square feet value, and beyond that, any increment in area is charged according to a unit decided by the apartment association.4.Hybrid Charges , i.e. Splitting the charges into two with the first part including all the common expenses incurred on lifts, security staff salary, stationary, property taxes, conveyance, audit fees, meeting charges, common electricity etc. , and the second part includes the area based charges that are specific to the apartments such as water charge and electricity usage.- Hence, you can decide and make rule after forming the society /residents association.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Maintenance charges",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, the rules and regulations regarding apartment maintenance charges can vary based on state laws and the terms laid out in the Apartment Owners' Association or Resident Welfare Association (RWA) bylaws. In Rajasthan, the RWA usually frames its bylaws based on the Rajasthan Apartment Ownership Act, 1983. As per this Act, maintenance charges are usually calculated based on the unit's size or the square footage area. However, the specific method for calculating these charges can be decided by the RWA, as long as it is reasonable, fair, and in accordance with the law. In many cases, RWAs might opt for a 'per square foot' method for calculating maintenance charges. This method considers the size of the unit and charges accordingly. However, it's essential that this method is applied consistently and fairly across all units.If you believe that the maintenance charges for your 3 BHK unit are disproportionately higher compared to the amenities and services being provided compared to the 1 BHK units, you can check the bylaws of the RWA or apartment association to understand how maintenance charges are calculated. It should be clearly mentioned in these documents. Initiate a conversation with the RWA office-bearers or management committee to understand how they arrived at the maintenance charges. They might provide clarity on the rationale behind the charges. Participate actively in RWA meetings where such matters are discussed. Voice your concerns and try to build a consensus among the residents for a fairer maintenance charge system.

    "question": "Capital gain under mother's name bought a new house under triple ownership",
    "answer": "Dear client,Under Section 54 of the Income Tax Act in India, if an individual or HUF (Hindu Undivided Family) sells a residential property and reinvests the capital gains in purchasing or constructing another residential property, they can claim an exemption on the capital gains tax. The exemption is available if the property sold and the property purchased are residential houses. The new property must be purchased either one year before the sale of the property or within two years after the sale. In the case of construction, the property should be completed within three years after the sale.  The entire capital gains amount needs to be reinvested to claim 100% exemption. If only a portion of the gains is reinvested, the exemption is restricted to the proportionate amount.From your description, it appears that the tax authorities have reduced the benefit because the property was jointly purchased by your mother, yourself, and your sister, while the initial property was solely owned by your mother. The capital gain benefit might have been adjusted to reflect the proportionate ownership in the new property.

    "question": "How to prepare for maintainence",
    "answer": "Dear client,I understand your concerns. In the context of an arranged marriage in India, there are legal implications regarding financial matters, especially in the unfortunate event of a divorce.In India, the court may order maintenance or alimony to be paid to the spouse who lacks sufficient income to sustain themselves post-divorce. The amount is typically determined based on various factors, including the standard of living during the marriage, the earning capacity of both spouses, assets, etc. The disparity in income and assets between you and your potential spouse may influence the court's decision. A prenuptial agreement could be an option to protect your assets. While not very common in India, it's gaining recognition. It's crucial to draft it carefully and have legal assistance to ensure its validity. A prenup can specify how assets and income are to be divided in case of divorce. During divorce proceedings, both present salaries and assets (including savings) can be considered when determining maintenance. The court may take into account the financial standing of both individuals to decide on alimony.It's natural to feel anxious, especially considering the stories you might have read online. However, every relationship is unique, and legal precautions can be taken to safeguard your interests. Open communication with your potential spouse about your concerns and the possibility of a prenuptial agreement can also help address worries.

    "question": "Supreme Court stay order on execution",
    "answer": "Dear client,The Supreme Court has issued a stay order on further proceedings regarding the execution of the judgment by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC). This stay is conditional upon the appellant (the party appealing to the Supreme Court) depositing the entire principal amount to be refunded to the respondent within a specified timeframe (three weeks in this case). If the appellant fails to deposit this amount within the given period, the interim stay order will be automatically vacated. Typically, the deposited principal amount would need to be submitted to the court or an escrow account specified by the court. Usually, the Supreme Court would provide instructions regarding the specific procedure for depositing this amount. If the Supreme Court has issued a judgment, generally, there might be limited options for further appeal. However, in certain circumstances, if there are legal grounds (such as constitutional questions or exceptional circumstances), a review petition might be filed in the Supreme Court itself. Beyond that, very few options exist and would require a highly specialized legal approach.While awaiting an official communication from the Supreme Court regarding the stay order, it's sensible to consult a lawyer sooner rather than later. Waiting for the official letter might not be the best strategy, especially given the critical time frame mentioned in the stay order. Lawyers can track developments in the case and guide you on the necessary steps to be taken. If the appellant fails to deposit the principal amount within the specified period, as mentioned in the stay order, the interim order will be vacated automatically. In such a scenario, you might be able to proceed with further actions in the lower court.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The most commonly used method is Area Wise maintenance charge, A rate is fixed for one square feet and then multiplied by the total square feet area of your flat in this method. It means that if you have a larger home, you will end up paying more.- Further, the common areas are divided equally using a fixed rate while flats are calculated depending on the size of the apartment.3. Partially Equal Fee i.e. A particular amount of money is charged on the area up to a predetermined square feet value, and beyond that, any increment in area is charged according to a unit decided by the apartment association.4.Hybrid Charges , i.e. Splitting the charges into two with the first part including all the common expenses incurred on lifts, security staff salary, stationary, property taxes, conveyance, audit fees, meeting charges, common electricity etc. , and the second part includes the area based charges that are specific to the apartments such as water charge and electricity usage.- Hence, you can decide and make rule after forming the society /residents association.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Maintenance charges",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, the rules and regulations regarding apartment maintenance charges can vary based on state laws and the terms laid out in the Apartment Owners' Association or Resident Welfare Association (RWA) bylaws. In Rajasthan, the RWA usually frames its bylaws based on the Rajasthan Apartment Ownership Act, 1983. As per this Act, maintenance charges are usually calculated based on the unit's size or the square footage area. However, the specific method for calculating these charges can be decided by the RWA, as long as it is reasonable, fair, and in accordance with the law. In many cases, RWAs might opt for a 'per square foot' method for calculating maintenance charges. This method considers the size of the unit and charges accordingly. However, it's essential that this method is applied consistently and fairly across all units.If you believe that the maintenance charges for your 3 BHK unit are disproportionately higher compared to the amenities and services being provided compared to the 1 BHK units, you can check the bylaws of the RWA or apartment association to understand how maintenance charges are calculated. It should be clearly mentioned in these documents. Initiate a conversation with the RWA office-bearers or management committee to understand how they arrived at the maintenance charges. They might provide clarity on the rationale behind the charges. Participate actively in RWA meetings where such matters are discussed. Voice your concerns and try to build a consensus among the residents for a fairer maintenance charge system.

    "answer": "Dear client,Under Section 54 of the Income Tax Act in India, if an individual or HUF (Hindu Undivided Family) sells a residential property and reinvests the capital gains in purchasing or constructing another residential property, they can claim an exemption on the capital gains tax. The exemption is available if the property sold and the property purchased are residential houses. The new property must be purchased either one year before the sale of the property or within two years after the sale. In the case of construction, the property should be completed within three years after the sale.  The entire capital gains amount needs to be reinvested to claim 100% exemption. If only a portion of the gains is reinvested, the exemption is restricted to the proportionate amount.From your description, it appears that the tax authorities have reduced the benefit because the property was jointly purchased by your mother, yourself, and your sister, while the initial property was solely owned by your mother.

If you're concerned about potential threats or blackmail from this person, it might be a good idea to document everything and keep evidence. However, if this person genuinely helped you out of a difficult situation without any ulterior motives, it's less likely they would take action against you or your family. Nevertheless, if you're worried about any potential repercussions, consulting with a lawyer with specific details of y case and evidence of the same could provide clarity on how to handle this situation while protecting yourself and your family. Maintaining occasional contact out of gratitude or as a sibling-like relationship is understandable, but if it's causing you distress or worry, it might be worth reevaluating the nature and frequency of your interactions. Trust your instincts, but also consider seeking professional guidance to ensure your peace of mind.If someone threatens you with false accusations or blackmail, it's crucial to take specific steps to protect yourself and your family. Keep records of any communications or interactions that could be relevant. Save messages, emails, or any evidence that might refute false claims or show the nature of your relationship. Share your concerns with people you trust, such as family members or close friends. Having support and advice from those who care about you can be invaluable. If the relationship makes you uncomfortable or if you fear potential manipulation, consider distancing yourself gradually. This doesn’t necessarily mean abrupt cessation but gradually reducing interactions and establishing boundaries. If you receive explicit threats or feel unsafe, consider reporting the issue to the authorities. Blackmail and threats are serious offenses, and the police can provide assistance and guidance.

    "answer": "Dear client,1. \"Maan Hani\" cases or defamation cases can be complex and depend on the laws of your country or state. If the person you're in contact with were to do something that harms your reputation or causes damage, your husband might potentially explore legal options. However, mere contact or communication may not necessarily lead to such a case.2. If you feel threatened or concerned about your safety due to this ongoing contact, it might be helpful to seek legal advice or support from local authorities. You could also discuss your concerns with your husband and try to find a mutual understanding regarding the situation.3. Regarding your ability to file a defamation case against the person, it typically requires evidence of defamation or harm caused by false statements made publicly. WhatsApp conversations, especially if they depict a brother-sister relationship, might not be substantial proof for a defamation case, but it's advisable to consult a lawyer to understand the legal options available to you.However, it's important to prioritize your safety and well-being in any situation.

Wife cannot be entitled to maintenance by the husband when she is highly qualified and has been earning even after her marriage, though she does not truthfully disclose her true income.In case of Kusum Bhatia Vs.Sagar Sethi S.L.P.(C) No.16051/2017 by order dated 16.09.2019 Hon'ble Supreme Court has declined to award any maintenance u/s 24 of H.M.A to wife who was working and getting sufficient salary, however it awarded maintenance to the Daughter.In case of Bhushan Kumar Meen Vs. Mansi Meen SLP (Crl) 7924 of 2008 Hon'ble Supreme Court while reducing the maintenance amount from Rs.10,000/- to Rs.5,000/- granted by the lower court to the wife, the Supreme Court observed that \"we cannot also shut our eyes to the fact that at present the respondent wife is not employed or at least there is nothing on record to indicate that she is employed in any gainful work. However having regard to the qualifications that she possesses, there is no reason why she ought not to be in a position to also maintain herself in the future.\"Therefore, there are various cases in which it has been reduced or denied from Hon'ble Supreme Court.You'll to file the Vakalatnama through AOR and file the reply accordingly. Generally, 4 weeks time is given to the respondent to file the Vakalatnama and reply i.e. the counter affidavit. In case, no one appears from respondent's side in 2-3 hearings, Court will pass appropriate order without any further notice.

    "question": "How to prepare for maintainence",
    "answer": "Dear client,I understand your concerns. In the context of an arranged marriage in India, there are legal implications regarding financial matters, especially in the unfortunate event of a divorce.In India, the court may order maintenance or alimony to be paid to the spouse who lacks sufficient income to sustain themselves post-divorce. The amount is typically determined based on various factors, including the standard of living during the marriage, the earning capacity of both spouses, assets, etc. The disparity in income and assets between you and your potential spouse may influence the court's decision. A prenuptial agreement could be an option to protect your assets. While not very common in India, it's gaining recognition. It's crucial to draft it carefully and have legal assistance to ensure its validity. A prenup can specify how assets and income are to be divided in case of divorce. During divorce proceedings, both present salaries and assets (including savings) can be considered when determining maintenance. The court may take into account the financial standing of both individuals to decide on alimony.It's natural to feel anxious, especially considering the stories you might have read online. However, every relationship is unique, and legal precautions can be taken to safeguard your interests. Open communication with your potential spouse about your concerns and the possibility of a prenuptial agreement can also help address worries.

    "question": "Potential tenant requesting to make aadhaar & passport etc on our property address",
    "answer": "Dear client,Allowing a tenant to use the rented premises for obtaining official documents like Aadhar card and passport is not uncommon. However, there are some considerations and precautions you should take before agreeing to such a request. Ensure that the leave and license agreement clearly specifies the terms and conditions regarding the tenant's use of the premises for official document purposes. It should include clauses regarding the duration and purpose for which the premises can be used for these activities. Have a conversation with the potential tenant to understand their intentions behind using the rented premises for obtaining official documents. This could help gauge whether they plan to use it as a permanent residence or as a temporary address.  Using the rented premises as a permanent address for Aadhar and other legal documents might have legal implications, especially if the tenant doesn’t actually reside there permanently. This could potentially affect taxation, legal notices, etc.You can include clauses in the agreement that allow you to conduct periodic checks to ensure the property is being used responsibly and as agreed upon. Consider taking a higher security deposit or specific insurance coverage to safeguard your interests in case of any damages or legal issues arising due to the tenant using the property for official document purposes. Conduct a thorough background check on the potential tenant to ensure they have a credible history and are trustworthy.Regarding the tenant using the rented premises as a permanent address for official documents like Aadhar and passport, it's usually advised that the tenant has a permanent residence where they actually reside. Insisting on using the rented premises as a temporary address might be a safer option to avoid potential legal complications and misrepresentations. However, if you do agree to allow the tenant to use the premises for these purposes, make sure it's clearly outlined in the agreement and that you've taken necessary precautions to protect your interests.

    "question": "My tenant is staying continuously for 13 years on leave and license agreement",
    "answer": "Dear client,Eviction laws can vary significantly by region, and in this case, since the tenant is in Karnataka, Indian tenancy laws apply. Generally, even without a registered agreement, tenants still have rights and legal protections. In Karnataka, the Rent Control Act governs tenancy matters. If there's no registered agreement, it's more challenging but not impossible to evict the tenant. Usually, verbal agreements or unregistered agreements also hold some legal standing, though it might be more challenging to prove the terms. To evict a tenant without a registered agreement, you'll need to follow legal procedures outlined by the Rent Control Act. You might need to issue a legal notice, citing reasons for eviction, and then file for eviction through the appropriate legal channels if the tenant doesn’t comply.In Karnataka, for a lease agreement to be legally enforceable, it typically needs to be executed on a stamp paper and registered as per the Karnataka Stamp Act, 1957. A lease agreement with a value of Rs. 2000 on a stamp paper might not be sufficient for the terms you've mentioned - a 5-year lease with an advance payment of Rs. 8,00,000 and a monthly rent of Rs. 15,000. The lack of registration might weaken the enforceability of the agreement in case of disputes or legal proceedings. Notarization alone may not suffice in place of registration for the agreement to hold up in court. Given the significant advance and monthly rent, it's strongly recommended to have a legally registered lease agreement in Karnataka. Without proper registration, enforcing the terms of the agreement, especially regarding eviction or dispute resolution, might be challenging.In India, the Limitation Act specifies the time limits within which legal actions can be taken for various matters. Regarding tenancy or leave and license agreements, the Limitation Act can apply. For unregistered leave and license agreements, while they might lack the same legal standing as registered agreements, they might still have some legal recognition and might be used to establish a tenancy or licensee status. The continuous stay of a licensee for 13 years on such an agreement could potentially create an implied tenancy, and the licensee might be protected under tenancy laws.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Seeking advice to take loan against misplaced/lost deed",
    "answer": "Dear client,This sounds like a complex situation. Since the original deed of your portion of the land is missing, the certified copy you have should serve as a valid document for most legal and financial transactions, including applying for a home loan. However, some institutions may have specific requirements or preferences regarding original documents, especially for significant transactions like a home loan. Provide a detailed explanation to LIC Housing Finance about the situation regarding the missing original deed and present the certified copy that you have. Explain the circumstances surrounding the loss of the original and highlight that you have a certified copy as an alternative. Some lenders might accept title insurance as an alternative. Title insurance indemnifies lenders against financial loss from defects in title to real property and might serve as a substitute for the missing original deed in some cases. If the finance company remains hesitant, offering additional collateral or personal guarantees might help secure the loan.

The most commonly used method is Area Wise maintenance charge, A rate is fixed for one square feet and then multiplied by the total square feet area of your flat in this method. It means that if you have a larger home, you will end up paying more.- Further, the common areas are divided equally using a fixed rate while flats are calculated depending on the size of the apartment.3. Partially Equal Fee i.e. A particular amount of money is charged on the area up to a predetermined square feet value, and beyond that, any increment in area is charged according to a unit decided by the apartment association.4.Hybrid Charges , i.e. Splitting the charges into two with the first part including all the common expenses incurred on lifts, security staff salary, stationary, property taxes, conveyance, audit fees, meeting charges, common electricity etc. , and the second part includes the area based charges that are specific to the apartments such as water charge and electricity usage.- Hence, you can decide and make rule after forming the society /residents association.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Maintenance charges",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, the rules and regulations regarding apartment maintenance charges can vary based on state laws and the terms laid out in the Apartment Owners' Association or Resident Welfare Association (RWA) bylaws. In Rajasthan, the RWA usually frames its bylaws based on the Rajasthan Apartment Ownership Act, 1983. As per this Act, maintenance charges are usually calculated based on the unit's size or the square footage area. However, the specific method for calculating these charges can be decided by the RWA, as long as it is reasonable, fair, and in accordance with the law. In many cases, RWAs might opt for a 'per square foot' method for calculating maintenance charges. This method considers the size of the unit and charges accordingly. However, it's essential that this method is applied consistently and fairly across all units.If you believe that the maintenance charges for your 3 BHK unit are disproportionately higher compared to the amenities and services being provided compared to the 1 BHK units, you can check the bylaws of the RWA or apartment association to understand how maintenance charges are calculated. It should be clearly mentioned in these documents. Initiate a conversation with the RWA office-bearers or management committee to understand how they arrived at the maintenance charges. They might provide clarity on the rationale behind the charges. Participate actively in RWA meetings where such matters are discussed. Voice your concerns and try to build a consensus among the residents for a fairer maintenance charge system.

    "question": "A person returning a loan amount that was loaned by my father",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, receiving a repayment of a loan doesn't typically have direct tax implications, especially if the loan was given without interest. Receiving the principal amount back shouldn't attract tax implications under normal circumstances. It's not considered income; it's the return of the money that was lent. While it's beneficial to have documentation of the loan, such as a written agreement or acknowledgment, not having explicit proof doesn't necessarily mean the transaction didn't occur. Testimony from witnesses or the borrower's acknowledgment could serve as evidence. India doesn't have wealth tax as of my last update, so receiving a lump sum of money (like the loan repayment) wouldn't trigger a wealth tax liability. There might be considerations if the money is considered a gift, but as this is a repayment of a loan given years ago, it's less likely to be categorized as a gift.

    "question": "Transfer of property from Private Limited company to Directors",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, the division of assets among directors when closing a company involves several legal considerations, including company law and property laws. The Companies Act, 2013, governs the closure of companies in India. When a company is winding up, the assets are generally liquidated, and the proceeds are used to settle the company's debts and liabilities. After settling debts, the remaining assets, if any, are distributed among the shareholders. If you and your co-founder wish to divide specific assets, such as land or property, among yourselves before winding up the company, you may need to follow legal procedures to ensure a transparent and lawful process. This might involve obtaining the consent of other shareholders, compliance with company law, and adherence to any relevant provisions in the company's Articles of Association.If you're not planning to close the company but still want to distribute or share specific assets among the directors, there are several approaches you could consider.1. Declaration of Dividends: If the company is financially stable and has accumulated profits, you can declare dividends. This method involves distributing profits among shareholders in proportion to their shareholdings. As directors, you and your co-founder could receive dividends in this manner.2. Share Transfers: Depending on the company's structure and the rights associated with different classes of shares, you may be able to transfer shares or issue new shares to allocate ownership of specific assets. This could be done by issuing new shares to specific directors or by transferring existing shares.3. Asset Distribution within the Company: If the assets are not essential for the company's operations and there's a mutual agreement among all stakeholders, the company could transfer ownership or usage rights of specific assets to individual directors. However, this needs to be documented and executed according to legal procedures.4. Trusts or Agreements: You might establish a trust or enter into agreements that outline the ownership or usage rights of particular assets among the directors while keeping them under the company's umbrella.5. Leasing or Licensing: Instead of transferring ownership, the company could lease or license specific assets to directors, allowing them to use or benefit from those assets without transferring ownership outright.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "How to prepare for maintainence",
    "answer": "Dear client,I understand your concerns. In the context of an arranged marriage in India, there are legal implications regarding financial matters, especially in the unfortunate event of a divorce.In India, the court may order maintenance or alimony to be paid to the spouse who lacks sufficient income to sustain themselves post-divorce. The amount is typically determined based on various factors, including the standard of living during the marriage, the earning capacity of both spouses, assets, etc. The disparity in income and assets between you and your potential spouse may influence the court's decision. A prenuptial agreement could be an option to protect your assets. While not very common in India, it's gaining recognition. It's crucial to draft it carefully and have legal assistance to ensure its validity. A prenup can specify how assets and income are to be divided in case of divorce. During divorce proceedings, both present salaries and assets (including savings) can be considered when determining maintenance. The court may take into account the financial standing of both individuals to decide on alimony.It's natural to feel anxious, especially considering the stories you might have read online. However, every relationship is unique, and legal precautions can be taken to safeguard your interests. Open communication with your potential spouse about your concerns and the possibility of a prenuptial agreement can also help address worries.

    "question": "Filing cheating and other criminal cases",
    "answer": "Dear client,I'm sorry to hear about the situation you're facing with the delayed possession of your flat in Bangalore. Legal recourse in such matters involves various actions that can be taken against the builder based on the contractual agreements and theConsumer Protection Act. You've mentioned that a consumer case is already filed, which is a good step. Pursuing this avenue can help in seeking compensation for the delay in possession and breach of agreement. Based on the clauses in the Agreement of Sale where the builder provided an undertaking that the property is free from encumbrances, you might consider filing a criminal complaint against the builder for offenses such as:-Cheating: If the builder knowingly provided false information regarding the encroachments or the status of the property.-Breach of Contract: If the builder has violated the terms of the agreement by failing to deliver possession as promised.You can file a complaint with the police against the builder for fraudulent activities or cheating. Ensure that you have all the necessary documents and evidence to support your case.Filing a criminal case against the builder directly in your home state's High Court or in a sub-ordinate/district court in Agra without approaching the police might not be the typical route for criminal cases. Usually, criminal cases are initiated through the police, who investigate the matter and then file a charge sheet in the appropriate court. However, in some exceptional circumstances, especially when there's a clear and direct case of fraud or other criminal offenses, it might be possible to approach the court directly.To file a criminal case directly in court without involving the police, you'll need to:1. Prepare a Complaint: Draft a comprehensive complaint outlining the criminal offenses committed by the builder, supported by all relevant documents and evidence.2. Approach the Court: You can approach the High Court or a sub-ordinate/district court in Agra directly to file a private criminal complaint. This complaint should detail the offenses committed by the builder and why you're seeking legal action directly through the court.3. Court's Discretion: Whether the court accepts your complaint and initiates proceedings directly or requires police intervention might vary based on the specifics of your case and the court's discretion.This approach involves a different legal procedure and might have its own complexities. It's crucial to have strong evidence and legal guidance when pursuing this route.Filing an FIR (First Information Report) with the police station regarding the delayed possession of your property doesn't necessarily require an immediate incident or a physical place involved. In cases of alleged fraud, breach of contract, or other criminal offenses related to property matters, an FIR can be filed based on the documents and evidence supporting your complaint. The police will record the details provided in your complaint, which includes the allegations against the builder, the documents supporting your claim, and any other relevant information you provide. After the FIR is lodged, the police are responsible for conducting an investigation. They may visit the site, gather further evidence, and interview relevant parties to verify the claims made in the complaint. Based on their investigation, the police will compile a report detailing their findings. This report will be submitted to the appropriate authorities for further action. Depending on the findings of their investigation, the police may take legal action against the accused, which could involve arrests, further questioning, or filing a charge sheet in court. Even if the case primarily involves documents and financial matters without an immediate physical incident, the police are obligated to investigate the matter based on the information provided in the FIR.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The situation you've described involves legal intricacies and might vary based on the specific laws and regulations of your region. A \"Letter of Administration\" is typically granted by a court to an individual (the administrator) to manage and distribute the estate of a deceased person who did not leave a will. It empowers the administrator to handle the affairs of the deceased, including property matters.Regarding the transfer of ownership of the flat from the mentally retarded son to the guardian/administrator, several factors might come into play. The Letter of Administration grants legal authority to manage the deceased person's estate. However, it might not automatically authorize the transfer of property ownership. The administrator must follow legal procedures to transfer ownership as per the laws in your region. Depending on the severity of the son's mental condition, there might be legal considerations regarding his capacity to own or transfer property. If he lacks the mental capacity to make decisions, the court might have appointed the guardian to act in his best interest. The society might have its own set of rules and regulations governing property transfers. They may require specific documentation or legal processes to transfer ownership.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "1. Once the police report is submitted under section 178(2) of thecode of criminal procedure,further investigation by police is allowed but fresh investigation or re-investigation is not allowed.2. The Supreme Court in a case has said that there can't be reinvestigation of an offence by a different investigating agency without prior approval or permission of the Magistrate concerned.Therefore the reinvestigation by police on their own without a specific order by court in this case will not be maintainable.3. There cannot be any dispute that even after the chargesheet is filed, it is the right of the investigating officer to further investigate in respect of offence even after a report under sub-section (2) of Section 173 ofCriminal Procedure Codeforwarded to a Magistrate, the prior approval of the Magistrate is not required,\" a bench of Justices M R Shah and C T Ravikumar said. \"However, as per the settled position of law, so far as the reinvestigation is concerned, the prior permission/approval of the Magistrate is required,\" the bench added.Hence if a quash petition is filed before high court for the same reasons, there are chances for quashing the charge sheet.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

HANSARIA, J.- Special leave granted.2.A complaint was filed in the Court of Munsif and Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Bilara, against the respondents under various sections of the Penal Code. The gravamen of the allegation was that the respondents had, in pursuance of a conspiracy, transferred some land on the strength of a special power of attorney bearing forged signature. The Magistrate, after perusal of the complaint, directed an investigation to be made as contemplated by Section 156(3) of theCode of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (the Code). A case + From the Judgment and Order dated [deleted] of the Rajasthan High Court in S.B. Crl. Misc. P. No. 233 of 1988 was registered thereafter by police and a final report was submitted on 18-7-1981 stating that complaint was false. The report came to be accepted by the Magistrate on [deleted]. It, however, so happened that the Superintendent of Police had independently ordered further investigation on 24-9-1981 and a challan came to be filed by police against the respondents, inter alia, under Sections 420 and 467 IPC. The Magistrate took cognizance on 25-6-1984. A challenge was made to this act of the Magistrate before Sessions Judge, Jodhpur, who dismissed the revision. On further approach to the High Court, the revision was allowed and the order of cognizance was set aside. The State has come in appeal under Article 136 of the Constitution.3. A perusal of the impugned judgment of the High Court shows that it took the view that the Magistrate had no jurisdiction to take cognizance after the final report submitted by police had been once accepted. Shri Gupta, appearing for the appellant, contends that this view is erroneous in law inasmuch as Section 173(8) of the Code permits further investigation in respect of an offence after a report under sub-section (2) has been submitted. Sub- section (8) also visualises forwarding of another report to the Magistrate. Further investigation had thus legal sanction and if after such further investigation a report is submitted that an offence was committed, it would be open to the Magistrate to take cognizance of the same on his being satisfied in this regard.4. Shri Francis for the respondents, however, contends that the order of the Magistrate taking cognizance pursuant to filing of further report amounted to entertaining second complaint which is not permissible in law. To substantiate the legal submission, we have been first referred to Pramatha Nath Taluqdar v. Saro Ranjan Sarkar1, in which a three-Judge Bench of this Court dealt with this aspect. A perusal of the judgment of the majority shows that it took the view that dismissal of a complaint under Section 203 of the Code is no bar to the entertainment of a second complaint on the same facts; but the same could be done only in exceptional circumstances some of which have been illustrated in the judgment. Further observation in this regard is that a fresh complaint can be entertained, inter alia, when fresh evidence comes forward. In the present case, this is precisely what had happened, as on further investigation being made, fresh materials came to light which led to the filing of further report stating that a case had been made out.Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "question": "Is it permissible for the police to conduct a reinvestigation when further investigation was asked?",
    "answer": "1. In the scenario you've described, it seems the police, instead of conducting further investigation as directed by the magistrate, went ahead with a complete reinvestigation. The legality of this action might vary based on the jurisdiction and the specific orders given by the magistrate. In general, if the magistrate's directive was for further investigation and not a complete reinvestigation, the police might have overstepped their bounds by conducting a fresh probe.2. If the charge sheet filed during the reinvestigation didn't introduce any new evidence or facts but relied solely on information from the previous investigation, particularly from the cancellation report, it raises questions about the purpose and validity of the reinvestigation. If the intention was to only gather additional evidence or facts as per the magistrate's order, the absence of new information in the charge sheet might call into question the necessity of the reinvestigation.3. Whether the High Court can quash the charge sheet due to it being a result of a reinvestigation instead of further investigation depends on the specifics of the case, the orders issued by the magistrate, and the legal provisions in the jurisdiction. If the police exceeded the scope of their mandate by conducting a complete reinvestigation instead of further investigation as instructed, the High Court might consider this as a violation of the magistrate's orders and could potentially quash the charge sheet.In this situation, the claim that the police conducted a reinvestigation instead of further investigation can be supported by examining specific details and documentation related to the case. Analyze the contents of the challan thoroughly. Look for any explicit mention or indications that the evidence or facts presented are entirely derived from the previous investigations. Any reference to reports, findings, or evidence from the initial investigation without any new or supplementary information could strengthen the argument that a proper reinvestigation didn't occur. If there is an application submitted by the complainant for a fresh or reinvestigation, this document could be vital. If this application specifically outlines areas or aspects that needed to be reinvestigated and if the subsequent investigation fails to address these or simply reiterates previous findings, it can support the claim of inadequate reinvestigation. Look for any correspondence or communication between the Commissioner of Police, Investigating Officer, and the court regarding the directions given for further investigation. Any discrepancies between what was directed by the court and what was executed in terms of the investigation can be crucial evidence to showcase the deviation from the court's orders. Retrieve the magistrate's instructions or order directing further investigation. Compare these orders with the content of the challan. If the content of the challan does not align with the specific directives given by the magistrate, it could support the argument that a reinvestigation was carried out rather than the mandated further investigation.If the reinvestigation doesn't yield any new evidence or facts but merely reiterates findings from the initial investigation, courts have sometimes considered this as insufficient grounds for filing a charge sheet. Courts have emphasized the need for substantial new evidence or facts to justify a fresh prosecution. When different investigating officers submit conflicting reports based on the same set of evidence, it might raise doubts about the objectivity or thoroughness of the investigation. Courts have, in some instances, quashed charge sheets due to inconsistent opinions without new substantial evidence. If the police conduct a reinvestigation explicitly against the court's direction of further investigation, courts might consider it a violation of the judicial order. In such cases, courts have intervened and quashed charge sheets or directed a proper adherence to the initial directives. Several cases have been dealt with on the basis of police overreach, improper reinvestigation, or non-compliance with court orders. Researching cases such as State of Bihar v. P. P. Sharma, State of Rajasthan v. Chhatu Ram, or State of Maharashtra v. Vithal Rao might provide insights into similar scenarios where courts have intervened due to improper reinvestigation or lack of new evidence. In your case, the fact that two investigating officers submitted different opinions based on the same set of evidence might be a crucial point to argue before the court.You've raised a critical point regarding the terminology used in the challan - while it mentions \"further investigation,\" the substance of the investigation might indeed resemble a reinvestigation based on the lack of new evidence and the repetition of facts from the previous closure report. The absence of new facts or evidence in the new charge sheet, along with the repetition of information previously deemed insufficient to hold the accused liable, can indeed raise questions about the nature of the investigation conducted. It's a substantial argument to challenge the veracity and legitimacy of the \"further investigation\" mentioned in the charge sheet. In essence, if the new investigating officer merely repeats the contents of the previous closure report but arrives at a different conclusion regarding the accused's liability without introducing any fresh evidence or facts, it can indeed be considered more of a reinvestigation rather than a genuine further investigation as directed by the court. The fact that the senior IPS officer's investigation was prompted by the complainant's request for fresh or reinvestigation adds weight to the argument that the intention behind the investigation was more aligned with a reinvestigation, especially considering the lack of new findings. These arguments could potentially form strong points for a petition seeking the quashing of the charge sheet at the High Court. Highlighting the discrepancy between the label of \"further investigation\" and the actual substance of the investigation, supported by the absence of new evidence and the circumstances surrounding the initiation of the investigation, could strengthen the case for quashment.The situation you've described involves a nuanced intersection of roles and responsibilities between investigating officers, the magistrate, and the issues raised in the protest petition. When a case is sent back for further investigation, the new investigating officer typically has the authority to explore all aspects related to the case, including issues previously addressed by the former IO. The purpose of further investigation is to delve deeper into the matter, gather additional evidence if necessary, and address any concerns or gaps highlighted by the court or the complainant. The new investigating officer possesses the right and responsibility to re-examine the issues previously discussed by the former IO. The former IO's rejoinder addressing why certain points didn't constitute criminal acts doesn't prohibit the new IO from re-evaluating those aspects. The new IO has the authority to form their own opinion based on the evidence gathered during the further investigation. The magistrate's decision to send the case back for further investigation doesn't necessarily imply that the issues raised were immediately deemed criminal. It suggests that the magistrate found grounds for dissatisfaction in the previous investigation and sought additional information or clarification. This doesn't preclude the new investigating officer from re-examining those aspects and potentially uncovering new evidence or angles that might influence the case. In essence, while the issues were previously addressed by the former IO and were deemed insufficient for criminal proceedings, the concept of further investigation allows the new IO to revisit these points, gather additional evidence, and reassess their relevance to the case. This doesn't necessarily constitute a re-investigation in the strictest sense, as it aligns with the court's directive for further exploration rather than a complete overhaul of the prior investigation. However, if the new investigation merely repeats the same conclusions without introducing substantial new evidence or analysis, it might be perceived as reiterating the previous investigation rather than genuinely furthering the inquiry. The crux lies in whether the new investigation brings forth new perspectives, evidence, or considerations that weren't addressed adequately in the previous inquiry.1. Reinvestigation vs. Further InvestigationReinvestigation: This involves a fresh, comprehensive review of the entire case from the beginning. It may occur due to significant errors, omissions, or inadequacies in the previous investigation. It often implies starting anew or re-examining previously explored aspects to correct deficiencies.Further Investigation: This refers to delving deeper into specific aspects highlighted by the court or parties involved. It doesn't necessarily imply starting over but entails exploring areas that might have been insufficiently addressed or require additional scrutiny.Furthermore,1. Investigating Previous Investigation Loopholes: Yes, the new IO scrutinizing the previous investigation for any gaps, errors, or loopholes could be considered a part of further investigation. If the purpose is to identify inadequacies or areas requiring further attention rather than starting the investigation afresh, it aligns more with a further investigation than a complete reinvestigation.2. Handling Previous Incidents and Reports: The new IO addressing incidents reported in the complaint and handling the previous report made by the predecessor isn't inherently a reinvestigation. It falls more within the scope of a thorough further investigation, where the focus is on ensuring completeness and addressing any deficiencies in the prior investigation.3. Defining Reinvesigation: Reinvesigation involves conducting a fresh, comprehensive examination of the entire case, often starting from scratch, to correct flaws, gather new evidence, or rectify inadequacies in the prior investigation. It typically implies a more fundamental revisit of the case rather than just addressing specific issues or gaps.In summary, while the new IO may revisit aspects of the previous investigation or reports, the determination between further investigation and reinvestigation hinges on the nature and depth of this revisit. If it involves a comprehensive re-examination from the beginning, aiming to rectify major flaws or gather substantial new evidence, it leans towards reinvestigation. Conversely, a focus on specific areas, without an overhaul of the entire investigation, aligns more with further investigation.

    "question": "Supreme Court stay order on execution",
    "answer": "Dear client,The Supreme Court has issued a stay order on further proceedings regarding the execution of the judgment by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC). This stay is conditional upon the appellant (the party appealing to the Supreme Court) depositing the entire principal amount to be refunded to the respondent within a specified timeframe (three weeks in this case). If the appellant fails to deposit this amount within the given period, the interim stay order will be automatically vacated. Typically, the deposited principal amount would need to be submitted to the court or an escrow account specified by the court. Usually, the Supreme Court would provide instructions regarding the specific procedure for depositing this amount. If the Supreme Court has issued a judgment, generally, there might be limited options for further appeal. However, in certain circumstances, if there are legal grounds (such as constitutional questions or exceptional circumstances), a review petition might be filed in the Supreme Court itself. Beyond that, very few options exist and would require a highly specialized legal approach.While awaiting an official communication from the Supreme Court regarding the stay order, it's sensible to consult a lawyer sooner rather than later. Waiting for the official letter might not be the best strategy, especially given the critical time frame mentioned in the stay order. Lawyers can track developments in the case and guide you on the necessary steps to be taken. If the appellant fails to deposit the principal amount within the specified period, as mentioned in the stay order, the interim order will be vacated automatically. In such a scenario, you might be able to proceed with further actions in the lower court.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Small Layout - South Bangalore - Basic Facilities like Electricty not Provided by the Land Developer",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. My office regularly receives various emails/phone calls regarding such similar issues.You can send a legal notice through Advocate to the developer. A Legal Notice is a legal intimation sent to the opponent indicating that the aggrieved is preparing to file a lawsuit against the concern in case the demand mentioned in the relevant notice is not fulfilled. Therefore, in a nutshell a legal notice can be defined as a formal communication to any person or a legal entity, informing the other party of your intention to undertake legal proceedings against them. This notice, when sent, conveys your intention prior to the legal proceedings and thus, makes the party aware of your grievance. My office can help you in this regard.In fact please note that without registration with the RERA administration, no project can even be initiated. Before commencing the project, the developer had to provide specifics about it and provide frequent updates via RERA on its website. As a result, both purchasing and selling such property are prohibited.Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) is a regulatory body that was formed to protect the rights of homebuyers. If your builder fails to register his project with RERA, it is his fault. Now, if you buy a property in his project and reach out to RERA for redressal of any grievance, then you’d be asked why you bought an unregistered project in the first case. This makes your case weak.Plus, developers are required to quote the registration number in every promotion, meaning they can’t advertise a project unless it’s registered with RERA. So, you should always check whether the project you are looking to buy has been advertised in the media or not.On the RERA authority official websites, the details of residential and commercial projects are specified. A developer is required to list all the details as well as the updates about the project, floors, number of units, and how many are unsold or sold every 3 months. Residential or Commercial projects with 8 units and more come under the RERA’s ambit.Every under construction or new project comes under the RERA’s ambit. The authority makes sure that a developer is delivering what he promised to buyers as specified in the sale agreement.Detailed discussion is required in such cases.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.RegardsMr. Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, Delhi418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma"

    "question": "Small Layout - South Bangalore - Basic Facilities like Electricty not Provided by the Land Developer",
    "answer": "Dear client,I understand the frustration you and other site owners are facing due to the unfulfilled promises from the developer. Consider forming a collective group of affected site owners. Strength in numbers can sometimes compel the developer to take action more seriously. Gather all the documents, contracts, and communications related to the promises made by the developer. This documentation will be crucial if legal action is required. If verbal discussions have not yielded results, communicate with the developer in writing (emails or formal letters) outlining the promises made, the delay in fulfilling them, and the impact it's having on the site owners. Consider reaching out to local authorities or regulatory bodies overseeing real estate development. They might intervene or provide guidance on how to proceed. Request a concrete timeline for the completion of pending work from the developer. Put this in writing and ensure it's acknowledged. Contact the bank where the construction loans were availed. Explain the situation and seek clarification on the impact of any public messaging on the loan disbursement. They might have insights or conditions regarding this matter. While it may be tempting to put up banners or paint messages, hold off for now as it might impact ongoing processes like loan disbursement. It could also escalate tensions with the developer. If both parties are open to it, mediation with a neutral third party could help in reaching a resolution without going through a lengthy legal battle.RERA (Real Estate Regulatory Authority) is a regulatory body established to govern the real estate sector and protect the interests of buyers. The registration of a property under RERA provides transparency and ensures certain standards and obligations are met by the developers. If a property is not registered with RERA, it could have several implications. In many jurisdictions where RERA is active, it's mandatory for real estate developers to register their projects with RERA before marketing or selling them. Failure to do so might be a violation of the law. RERA registration ensures that the developer complies with certain standards regarding project completion timelines, quality of construction, and other amenities promised to buyers. Without this registration, buyers might not have the same level of protection and recourse in case of disputes. RERA registration often signifies credibility and transparency. A project not registered might raise doubts among potential buyers regarding the legitimacy and adherence to regulatory standards.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In India, a Magistrate can order further investigation if they believe it's necessary for a fair inquiry. If the Magistrate has requested further investigation, the police are obligated to conduct it. However, this doesn't necessarily mean conducting an entirely new investigation. It could involve re-examining certain aspects or gathering additional evidence if available. The police can file a charge sheet if they believe there's sufficient evidence to proceed with a criminal case. However, if the subsequent investigation doesn't reveal new substantial evidence or facts that contradict the earlier closure report, it might raise questions about the basis of the charge sheet. Once the charge sheet is filed, the case proceeds to the court. The court will examine the evidence presented by both parties—the complainant and the accused. The accused will have the opportunity to contest the charge sheet and present their defense. The court will make a decision based on the evidence and arguments presented.

    "question": "How to prepare for maintainence",
    "answer": "Dear client,I understand your concerns. In the context of an arranged marriage in India, there are legal implications regarding financial matters, especially in the unfortunate event of a divorce.In India, the court may order maintenance or alimony to be paid to the spouse who lacks sufficient income to sustain themselves post-divorce. The amount is typically determined based on various factors, including the standard of living during the marriage, the earning capacity of both spouses, assets, etc. The disparity in income and assets between you and your potential spouse may influence the court's decision. A prenuptial agreement could be an option to protect your assets. While not very common in India, it's gaining recognition. It's crucial to draft it carefully and have legal assistance to ensure its validity. A prenup can specify how assets and income are to be divided in case of divorce. During divorce proceedings, both present salaries and assets (including savings) can be considered when determining maintenance. The court may take into account the financial standing of both individuals to decide on alimony.It's natural to feel anxious, especially considering the stories you might have read online. However, every relationship is unique, and legal precautions can be taken to safeguard your interests. Open communication with your potential spouse about your concerns and the possibility of a prenuptial agreement can also help address worries.

    "question": "Divorce case. Filling divor from another state",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, where both Karnal and Dehradun are located, the laws allow for filing divorce anddomestic violencecases in the appropriate jurisdiction. For divorce, jurisdiction is typically based on where the couple last resided together or where the marriage was solemnized. If both of you have been living together in Karnal, it might be the appropriate jurisdiction for filing a divorce case. Regarding thedomestic violencecase undersection 498Aof theIndian Penal Code(IPC) and theDomestic ViolenceAct (DVA), the victim can file a complaint in the area where the offense took place or where she's currently residing. If she's experiencingdomestic violencein Karnal, she can file a complaint there.To file adomestic violencecase (under theDomestic ViolenceAct) or a case underSection 498Aof theIndian Penal Codefrom a different location (such as Dehradun), she doesn't necessarily need to permanently leave the house in Karnal. However, she might need to provide evidence or documentation to support her case and show that she is currently residing or facing the issues in Dehradun. It's essential to understand that legal proceedings require evidence to substantiate claims. If she claimsdomestic violenceor harassment in Dehradun, she might need to provide proof or documentation to support her case, such as medical reports, witness statements, photographs, or any other relevant evidence. As for filing the case itself, it can be done from the place where the offense occurred or where the victim currently resides.Section 107 of theIndian Penal Code(IPC) deals with the offense of abetment of a thing. It involves instigating, engaging, or aiding someone to do something illegal. It is often used in cases where someone is alleged to have instigated another person to commit an offense. If your wife is planning to file a case under Section 107 IPC against you in Karnal, it's crucial to understand the specific allegations she might make and gather evidence to defend yourself.

    "answer": "As per rule, the popular methods to calculate the maintenance fee for your apartment is1. Equal Fee for All, but it is common in the apartment, where all the flats are of same sized.2. The most commonly used method is Area Wise maintenance charge, A rate is fixed for one square feet and then multiplied by the total square feet area of your flat in this method. It means that if you have a larger home, you will end up paying more.- Further, the common areas are divided equally using a fixed rate while flats are calculated depending on the size of the apartment.3. Partially Equal Fee i.e. A particular amount of money is charged on the area up to a predetermined square feet value, and beyond that, any increment in area is charged according to a unit decided by the apartment association.4.Hybrid Charges , i.e. Splitting the charges into two with the first part including all the common expenses incurred on lifts, security staff salary, stationary, property taxes, conveyance, audit fees, meeting charges, common electricity etc. , and the second part includes the area based charges that are specific to the apartments such as water charge and electricity usage.- Hence, you can decide and make rule after forming the society /residents association.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Maintenance charges",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, the rules and regulations regarding apartment maintenance charges can vary based on state laws and the terms laid out in the Apartment Owners' Association or Resident Welfare Association (RWA) bylaws. In Rajasthan, the RWA usually frames its bylaws based on the Rajasthan Apartment Ownership Act, 1983. As per this Act, maintenance charges are usually calculated based on the unit's size or the square footage area. However, the specific method for calculating these charges can be decided by the RWA, as long as it is reasonable, fair, and in accordance with the law. In many cases, RWAs might opt for a 'per square foot' method for calculating maintenance charges. This method considers the size of the unit and charges accordingly. However, it's essential that this method is applied consistently and fairly across all units.If you believe that the maintenance charges for your 3 BHK unit are disproportionately higher compared to the amenities and services being provided compared to the 1 BHK units, you can check the bylaws of the RWA or apartment association to understand how maintenance charges are calculated. It should be clearly mentioned in these documents. Initiate a conversation with the RWA office-bearers or management committee to understand how they arrived at the maintenance charges. They might provide clarity on the rationale behind the charges. Participate actively in RWA meetings where such matters are discussed. Voice your concerns and try to build a consensus among the residents for a fairer maintenance charge system.

    "question": "Supreme Court stay order on execution",
    "answer": "Dear client,The Supreme Court has issued a stay order on further proceedings regarding the execution of the judgment by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC). This stay is conditional upon the appellant (the party appealing to the Supreme Court) depositing the entire principal amount to be refunded to the respondent within a specified timeframe (three weeks in this case). If the appellant fails to deposit this amount within the given period, the interim stay order will be automatically vacated. Typically, the deposited principal amount would need to be submitted to the court or an escrow account specified by the court. Usually, the Supreme Court would provide instructions regarding the specific procedure for depositing this amount. If the Supreme Court has issued a judgment, generally, there might be limited options for further appeal. However, in certain circumstances, if there are legal grounds (such as constitutional questions or exceptional circumstances), a review petition might be filed in the Supreme Court itself. Beyond that, very few options exist and would require a highly specialized legal approach.While awaiting an official communication from the Supreme Court regarding the stay order, it's sensible to consult a lawyer sooner rather than later. Waiting for the official letter might not be the best strategy, especially given the critical time frame mentioned in the stay order. Lawyers can track developments in the case and guide you on the necessary steps to be taken. If the appellant fails to deposit the principal amount within the specified period, as mentioned in the stay order, the interim order will be vacated automatically. In such a scenario, you might be able to proceed with further actions in the lower court.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,In India, your husband may consider applying for an Employment Visa or an Entry Visa, depending on the purpose of his stay. However, as he intends to conduct business activities for his Canadian corporation while in India, an Employment Visa might not be suitable since it is generally issued for employment with an Indian entity. An Entry Visa for business purposes could be more appropriate for conducting business on behalf of a foreign entity while in India. Given your situation, your husband, as a Canadian citizen, can apply for an Indian Employment Visa based on his marriage to an OCI cardholder. This would allow him to live in India and work for his Canadian corporation. An Employment Visa typically requires a letter from the Canadian corporation stating the nature of his work and duration of his stay in India. However, this visa doesn't permit him to take up employment in India with any Indian entity. While residing in India on an Employment Visa, he can work remotely for his Canadian corporation and continue managing his business. It's crucial to ensure that the work he undertakes for the Canadian corporation is solely outside of India's jurisdiction to comply with Indian visa regulations. As for taxation, working on his Canadian corporation's business while in India may have tax implications both in Canada and India. India follows a system of residency-based taxation, so if your husband stays in India for a certain duration, he might be considered a tax resident and liable to pay taxes in India on his global income. However, India has double taxation avoidance agreements with many countries, including Canada, to prevent double taxation on the same income.

In the context of an arranged marriage in India, there are legal implications regarding financial matters, especially in the unfortunate event of a divorce.In India, the court may order maintenance or alimony to be paid to the spouse who lacks sufficient income to sustain themselves post-divorce. The amount is typically determined based on various factors, including the standard of living during the marriage, the earning capacity of both spouses, assets, etc. The disparity in income and assets between you and your potential spouse may influence the court's decision. A prenuptial agreement could be an option to protect your assets. While not very common in India, it's gaining recognition. It's crucial to draft it carefully and have legal assistance to ensure its validity. A prenup can specify how assets and income are to be divided in case of divorce.

The absence of registration by the first and second buyers could complicate matters, especially if their names are not on the property documents or if you don't have any contact information for them. If the property was not registered in the names of the first and second buyers, it might create a challenge in transferring ownership directly to you. In some cases, there might be legal provisions or procedures available for rectifying the lack of registration by the previous buyers. This could involve legal steps such as obtaining declarations or affidavits from the sellers, or seeking a court order to validate the transfer despite the missing registrations. If locating the first and second buyers is not feasible, legal remedies might be pursued to establish the transfer of ownership from them to your father and subsequently to you.

    "answer": "Dear client,It's likely that the increased regular deposits into your bank account, especially if they're substantial and frequent, triggered the re-KYC request. Financial institutions are required to periodically update their customers' KYC details to ensure compliance with regulatory standards, so increased or irregular transactions might prompt such requests. Regarding your occupation in the new KYC, the options provided might not perfectly match your situation, but selecting the closest match would be advisable. In your case, considering your full-time engagement in online poker and your accountant filing your income under \"income from other sources,\" you could consider \"professional\" as a suitable occupation. This category often covers individuals engaged in various professions or activities not specifically categorized. If you're currently pursuing an online course, you can mention that as an additional detail under the occupation of \"professional\" or \"others\" if there's space to provide additional information. Regarding the annual gross income, it's essential to accurately report your income to the best of your knowledge, especially when it comes to tax-related matters. It might be a good idea to discuss these options and their implications with your accountant or a financial advisor to ensure that your KYC details align with your tax filings and don't cause any discrepancies or issues in the future.

    "question": "Can my spouse work in India if he is employed remotely",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, your husband may consider applying for an Employment Visa or an Entry Visa, depending on the purpose of his stay. However, as he intends to conduct business activities for his Canadian corporation while in India, an Employment Visa might not be suitable since it is generally issued for employment with an Indian entity. An Entry Visa for business purposes could be more appropriate for conducting business on behalf of a foreign entity while in India. Given your situation, your husband, as a Canadian citizen, can apply for an Indian Employment Visa based on his marriage to an OCI cardholder. This would allow him to live in India and work for his Canadian corporation. An Employment Visa typically requires a letter from the Canadian corporation stating the nature of his work and duration of his stay in India. However, this visa doesn't permit him to take up employment in India with any Indian entity. While residing in India on an Employment Visa, he can work remotely for his Canadian corporation and continue managing his business. It's crucial to ensure that the work he undertakes for the Canadian corporation is solely outside of India's jurisdiction to comply with Indian visa regulations. As for taxation, working on his Canadian corporation's business while in India may have tax implications both in Canada and India. India follows a system of residency-based taxation, so if your husband stays in India for a certain duration, he might be considered a tax resident and liable to pay taxes in India on his global income. However, India has double taxation avoidance agreements with many countries, including Canada, to prevent double taxation on the same income.

    "question": "How to prepare for maintainence",
    "answer": "Dear client,I understand your concerns. In the context of an arranged marriage in India, there are legal implications regarding financial matters, especially in the unfortunate event of a divorce.In India, the court may order maintenance or alimony to be paid to the spouse who lacks sufficient income to sustain themselves post-divorce. The amount is typically determined based on various factors, including the standard of living during the marriage, the earning capacity of both spouses, assets, etc. The disparity in income and assets between you and your potential spouse may influence the court's decision. A prenuptial agreement could be an option to protect your assets. While not very common in India, it's gaining recognition. It's crucial to draft it carefully and have legal assistance to ensure its validity. A prenup can specify how assets and income are to be divided in case of divorce. During divorce proceedings, both present salaries and assets (including savings) can be considered when determining maintenance. The court may take into account the financial standing of both individuals to decide on alimony.It's natural to feel anxious, especially considering the stories you might have read online. However, every relationship is unique, and legal precautions can be taken to safeguard your interests. Open communication with your potential spouse about your concerns and the possibility of a prenuptial agreement can also help address worries.

    "answer": "- As per law, both the parties are under obligation to comply the terms of agreement- Since, the buyer has taken much time to make payment , then you can produce the proofs of the same before the court.- Further, if the remaining portion of the land was a part of the agreement, then why the buyer agree for the registration of the registration , and if the buyer accept the registration of the land then there is no ground for specific performance suit on the ground of that agreement.-  You can challenge the said order passed by the High Court.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Default of the petitioner in specific performance suit but verdict in his favour",
    "answer": "Dear client,Based on the details you've provided, it seems you have a strong case. Your argument revolves around the Buyer/Plaintiff's failure to honor the commitment of paying the sale consideration in full on the deadline date, despite multiple extensions. Additionally, you've pointed out the delay in payment and the escalation of rates in the area, which might have caused losses to you. Your presentation of six Supreme Court judgments to support your case, highlighting the absence of 'readiness and willingness' on the Plaintiff's part, strengthens your stance. However, legal matters can be complex, and the outcome of a lawsuit can be influenced by various factors including the interpretation of the law, the evidence presented, and the specific circumstances of the case. Your appeal (AS 158 OF 2014) in the High Court of Andhra Pradesh presents an opportunity for a thorough review of the case. It might offer a chance to present your arguments more comprehensively and for the court to reevaluate the facts and evidence.

    "question": "Can my spouse work in India if he is employed remotely",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, your husband may consider applying for an Employment Visa or an Entry Visa, depending on the purpose of his stay. However, as he intends to conduct business activities for his Canadian corporation while in India, an Employment Visa might not be suitable since it is generally issued for employment with an Indian entity. An Entry Visa for business purposes could be more appropriate for conducting business on behalf of a foreign entity while in India. Given your situation, your husband, as a Canadian citizen, can apply for an Indian Employment Visa based on his marriage to an OCI cardholder. This would allow him to live in India and work for his Canadian corporation. An Employment Visa typically requires a letter from the Canadian corporation stating the nature of his work and duration of his stay in India. However, this visa doesn't permit him to take up employment in India with any Indian entity. While residing in India on an Employment Visa, he can work remotely for his Canadian corporation and continue managing his business. It's crucial to ensure that the work he undertakes for the Canadian corporation is solely outside of India's jurisdiction to comply with Indian visa regulations. As for taxation, working on his Canadian corporation's business while in India may have tax implications both in Canada and India. India follows a system of residency-based taxation, so if your husband stays in India for a certain duration, he might be considered a tax resident and liable to pay taxes in India on his global income. However, India has double taxation avoidance agreements with many countries, including Canada, to prevent double taxation on the same income.
