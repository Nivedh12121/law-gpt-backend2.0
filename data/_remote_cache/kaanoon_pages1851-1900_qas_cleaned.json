    "question": "What documents can I inspect under MCS Act and Cooperative Housing Society bye-laws",
    "answer": "1. As per the Society Model Bye Law No 22 to 24, a member has the right to inspect free of cost books, registers, documents etc. as provided in Section 32 (1) of the Act and get copies of the documents as provided under Section 32 (2) of the Act, on payment of the fees prescribed under the bye-law No. 172. This suggests that you should be able to access documents from before you became a member.2. If your society has not been sharing documents for the last 3 months, you could consider taking legal action. If documents are not made available to a member, the committee could be made to pay a fine. You may also file an appeal before the registrar of society or send a legal notice to the society.3. Regarding access to documents for different wings in your society, I couldn’t find specific information. However, if your society’s registration is common for both wings, it would seem logical that you should have access to documents for both wings.I hope this answer helpsy you!Sukumar JadhavAdvocate, Mumbai35 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sukumar Jadhav"

    "question": "What documents can I inspect under MCS Act and Cooperative Housing Society bye-laws",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Inspection of Documents:The members of cooperative housing societies have the right to inspect certain documents related to the society's affairs. The exact documents you're entitled to inspect and the time frame for which you can request them might be outlined in the Cooperative Housing Society's Bylaws and the relevant Cooperative Society Acts. It's common for members to be allowed to inspect documents for a certain period of time, often the last 3-5 years.Non-Sharing of Documents:If the society is not providing you with the documents you have the right to inspect, you should follow these general steps:Check Bylaws and Laws: Verify what the Cooperative Housing Society's Bylaws and the applicable cooperative society legislation say about members' rights to inspect documents and the process for obtaining them.Written Request:Send a formal written request to the management committee, specifying the documents you are requesting and the reasons for your request. This creates a record of your attempt to access the documents.Access to Documents for B-Wing vs. A-Wing:Whether you have the right to access documents for the entire cooperative housing society, including both A-Wing and B-Wing, depends on the rules and regulations of the society .. In some cases, there might be restrictions on accessing documents specific to your wing only. However, if the registration of the cooperative housing society is common, you might have grounds to request access to documents related to the entire society.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Status of an earlier Indian marriage after one spouse becomes US citizen and implications on divorce",
    "answer": "1. Even if one of the spouses later becomes a US citizen, the marriage of two Indian nationals that took place and registered in India is often considered as valid. The marriage is still legitimate notwithstanding the wife's change of citizenship.2. If the husband wants to divorce, he can file for divorce in India where the marriage took place. However, he needs to fulfill the residency requirements. Even though the wife is now a US citizen, it’s still possible to file for divorce in the US. But according to the latest Supreme Court of India ruling, the grounds for divorce should be recognized by Indian law.3. In terms of alimony, it’s generally the husband who is ordered by the court to pay to the wife for sustenance, while and after undergoing a divorce. The court considers various parameters to decide on the amount to be given as alimony, including: income of the spouse(s), their standard of living and financial status. If the wife is working and drawing a salary that covers her living expenses, the court will certainly take that into consideration along with the husband’s income.Sukumar JadhavAdvocate, Mumbai35 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sukumar Jadhav"

This could involve lodging a complaint underSection 420(Cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) orSection 406(Punishment for criminal breach of trust) of theIndian Penal Code.3. Power of Attorney (PoA) Issue: If your elder brother has executed a fresh PoA in his name without proper authorization, this could potentially be challenged in court. The Supreme Court of India has held that a person given power of attorney over a property cannot sell the asset unless there is a specific provision giving him the power.4. Non-Registrable Property: If the property is non-registrable, it might be more challenging to retrieve documents and determine the status of the property.

    "question": "Will Sec 8 of HSA 1956 applies or reg partition deed is protected by Article 110 of Limitation Act",
    "answer": "Purchase of Property: Before purchasing any property, it’s crucial to conduct a thorough due diligence process. This includes verifying the title deeds, checking for any encumbrances, and ensuring that all property taxes have been paid up to date. It’s also advisable to consult with a legal expert before proceeding with the purchase.Claim by Daughters: As per theHindu Succession Act, when a father dies intestate, his self-acquired property must be shared equally among his class 1 heirs including daughters. However, in your case, it appears that some of the daughters and sons have already relinquished their rights to the property through the registered sale deed of 1999. This could potentially act as a relinquishment of right by these 5 children.Protection for Sons: The sons could potentially be protected by Article 110 of the Limitation Act if the remaining 2 daughters had knowledge of the said sale in 1999 and registered partition in 2000, and 23 years have passed. The Limitation Act stipulates that any person who has been in possession of a property for an uninterrupted period of 12 years can claim ownership through adverse possession.Sukumar JadhavAdvocate, Mumbai35 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sukumar Jadhav"

    "answer": "In the case of A. Sivagnana Pandian v. M. Ravichandran, as documented in (2011) 2 MLJ (Crl) 595 and 596, the Madras High Court has emphasized the significance of employing various scientific techniques to ascertain the age of ink in a document. The court has proposed subjecting the document in question to tests recommended by experts in the field. This approach aligns with the court's adoption of the principles established in the cases of Kalyani Baskar v. M.S. Sampoornam (2007) 1 MLJ (Crl) 1020 and T. Nagappa v. Y.R. Mudaliar (2008) 2 MLJ (Crl) 956. The court's direction in this matter is to have the disputed document undergo examination through non-destructive methods, thereby affording the accused the opportunity to challenge any presumptions of law using credible evidence. Consequently, it is mandated that the contested document be referred to a government forensic laboratory for the application of such testing procedures. This measure ensures that a fair and well-founded assessment of the document's authenticity is carried out."

    "question": "Status of an earlier Indian marriage after one spouse becomes US citizen and implications on divorce",
    "answer": "1. Even if one of the spouses later becomes a US citizen, the marriage of two Indian nationals that took place and registered in India is often considered as valid. The marriage is still legitimate notwithstanding the wife's change of citizenship.2. If the husband wants to divorce, he can file for divorce in India where the marriage took place. However, he needs to fulfill the residency requirements. Even though the wife is now a US citizen, it’s still possible to file for divorce in the US. But according to the latest Supreme Court of India ruling, the grounds for divorce should be recognized by Indian law.3. In terms of alimony, it’s generally the husband who is ordered by the court to pay to the wife for sustenance, while and after undergoing a divorce. The court considers various parameters to decide on the amount to be given as alimony, including: income of the spouse(s), their standard of living and financial status. If the wife is working and drawing a salary that covers her living expenses, the court will certainly take that into consideration along with the husband’s income.Sukumar JadhavAdvocate, Mumbai35 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sukumar Jadhav"

The marriage is still valid regardless of the wife obtaining US citizenship, unless there is a legal process such as divorce that has ended the marriage.Jurisdiction for Divorce:The jurisdiction where a divorce case should be filed can be complex, especially when the parties are residing in different countries. In many cases, divorce cases are filed in the country where one or both parties are residents, citizens, or have significant connections. The husband might file for divorce in India, and the wife may need to consult with an attorney in the US to understand any potential legal implications there.Alimony and Compensation:Alimony (also known as spousal support) and compensation can be complex issues and are often subject to the laws of the jurisdiction where the divorce is filed.

It's important to note that divorce is no longer solely under the control of one spouse, as either party can initiate the process. In cases where one partner commits adultery, this act can be considered a form of cruelty and serve as grounds for filing a divorce case.

Civil Action: You can file a civil suit in court for the recovery of property. This could involve filing a suit for declaration and possession, which is a legal remedy used to declare the rights of a party over a particular property. You could also consider filing a suit for partition if the property is jointly owned.2. Criminal Action: If you believe that your elder brother has fraudulently grabbed the property, you could consider filing a criminal complaint. This could involve lodging a complaint underSection 420(Cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) orSection 406(Punishment for criminal breach of trust) of theIndian Penal Code.3. Power of Attorney (PoA) Issue: If your elder brother has executed a fresh PoA in his name without proper authorization, this could potentially be challenged in court. The Supreme Court of India has held that a person given power of attorney over a property cannot sell the asset unless there is a specific provision giving him the power.4. Non-Registrable Property: If the property is non-registrable, it might be more challenging to retrieve documents and determine the status of the property.

However, in your case, it appears that some of the daughters and sons have already relinquished their rights to the property through the registered sale deed of 1999. This could potentially act as a relinquishment of right by these 5 children.Protection for Sons: The sons could potentially be protected by Article 110 of the Limitation Act if the remaining 2 daughters had knowledge of the said sale in 1999 and registered partition in 2000, and 23 years have passed.

    "answer": "In the case of A. Sivagnana Pandian v. M. Ravichandran, as documented in (2011) 2 MLJ (Crl) 595 and 596, the Madras High Court has emphasized the significance of employing various scientific techniques to ascertain the age of ink in a document. The court has proposed subjecting the document in question to tests recommended by experts in the field. This approach aligns with the court's adoption of the principles established in the cases of Kalyani Baskar v. M.S. Sampoornam (2007) 1 MLJ (Crl) 1020 and T. Nagappa v. Y.R. Mudaliar (2008) 2 MLJ (Crl) 956. The court's direction in this matter is to have the disputed document undergo examination through non-destructive methods, thereby affording the accused the opportunity to challenge any presumptions of law using credible evidence. Consequently, it is mandated that the contested document be referred to a government forensic laboratory for the application of such testing procedures. This measure ensures that a fair and well-founded assessment of the document's authenticity is carried out."

    "answer": "Dear Client,Forensic Analysis of Ink:Forensic laboratories can analyze ink to determine certain characteristics such as its composition, color, chemical properties, and aging patterns. Techniques like Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC), Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) can be used to analyze ink samples.Aging of Ink:The aging of ink on paper can be influenced by factors like exposure to light, humidity, temperature, and chemical interactions. However, accurately determining the exact age of ink, especially over long periods, can be challenging.Availability of Techniques:Forensic analysis of ink is available in both government and private forensic laboratories in many countries, including India. However, the extent of capabilities can vary between labs.Legal Proceedings and Forensic Evidence:In legal proceedings, forensic evidence, including ink analysis, can be presented to the court to support a case. However, it's important to note that forensic analysis is not always definitive and might provide only probabilities or indications. The court considers all available evidence, including expert opinions, when making decisions.Consult with Forensic Experts:If you have concerns about the authenticity of a document or signature, you should consult with a forensic expert who specializes in ink analysis. They can provide insights into the feasibility of analyzing the ink's age and the potential significance of such analysis in your specific case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Owner has asked me to vacate flat before the agreement period",
    "answer": "In this situation, you have a registered Leave and License agreement with the owner for a period of 33 months. The rights and obligations of both parties are governed by the terms mentioned in the agreement. Firstly, it is important to note that the owner cannot unilaterally ask you to vacate the premises before the expiry of the agreement unless there is a specific provision in the agreement allowing for early termination under certain circumstances. Generally, the agreement will lay down the procedure for termination and the notice period required. If the owner has not served you with a written notice to vacate the premises, her oral communication or phone conversation does not hold legal value. A written notice is typically required as evidence of termination. In case the owner has given you a reason for asking you to vacate the premises (e.g., the complaint about AC leakage), you have the right to rectify the issue within a reasonable period of time, as stated in the agreement. If the owner insists on asking you to vacate the property without following the legal procedure mentioned in the agreement, you have the right to challenge her eviction. You can approach the concerned Rent Control Authority or Civil Court having jurisdiction over the area where the property is located. The applicable Act for the jurisdiction of the Rent Control Authority or Civil Court will depend on the state in which the property is situated. Regarding the issue of the rent increase, unless there is a specific clause in the agreement allowing for periodic rent hikes, the owner cannot unilaterally demand an increase in rent during the term of the agreement. If you have been paying the rent as per the agreed terms and conditions, you are not obligated to pay the increased rent.Sukumar JadhavAdvocate, Mumbai35 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sukumar Jadhav"

    "question": "Owner has asked me to vacate flat before the agreement period",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You have the right to remain on the premises until the current rental agreement expires, and no one can force you out before then. If the situation becomes more intense, you have the option to take legal action by filing a permanent injunction against the other party. This legal measure would prevent them from attempting to evict you without following the proper legal procedures. Such a lawsuit could extend over several years, giving you time to find alternative rental accommodations. During this legal process, they would not be able to increase your rent. Even if you fall behind on monthly rent payments, they can only approach the court to request payment while the injunction case is ongoing, which itself could take around six months or more. In the meantime, you can explore new rental options. It's important to note that they cannot evict you without providing the one-month notice period stipulated in the rental agreement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Civil Action: You can file a civil suit in court for the recovery of property. This could involve filing a suit for declaration and possession, which is a legal remedy used to declare the rights of a party over a particular property. You could also consider filing a suit for partition if the property is jointly owned.2. Criminal Action: If you believe that your elder brother has fraudulently grabbed the property, you could consider filing a criminal complaint. This could involve lodging a complaint underSection 420(Cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) orSection 406(Punishment for criminal breach of trust) of theIndian Penal Code.3. Power of Attorney (PoA) Issue: If your elder brother has executed a fresh PoA in his name without proper authorization, this could potentially be challenged in court. The Supreme Court of India has held that a person given power of attorney over a property cannot sell the asset unless there is a specific provision giving him the power.4. Non-Registrable Property: If the property is non-registrable, it might be more challenging to retrieve documents and determine the status of the property.

    "question": "Will Sec 8 of HSA 1956 applies or reg partition deed is protected by Article 110 of Limitation Act",
    "answer": "Purchase of Property: Before purchasing any property, it’s crucial to conduct a thorough due diligence process. This includes verifying the title deeds, checking for any encumbrances, and ensuring that all property taxes have been paid up to date. It’s also advisable to consult with a legal expert before proceeding with the purchase.Claim by Daughters: As per theHindu Succession Act, when a father dies intestate, his self-acquired property must be shared equally among his class 1 heirs including daughters. However, in your case, it appears that some of the daughters and sons have already relinquished their rights to the property through the registered sale deed of 1999. This could potentially act as a relinquishment of right by these 5 children.Protection for Sons: The sons could potentially be protected by Article 110 of the Limitation Act if the remaining 2 daughters had knowledge of the said sale in 1999 and registered partition in 2000, and 23 years have passed. The Limitation Act stipulates that any person who has been in possession of a property for an uninterrupted period of 12 years can claim ownership through adverse possession.Sukumar JadhavAdvocate, Mumbai35 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sukumar Jadhav"

    "question": "Owner has asked me to vacate flat before the agreement period",
    "answer": "In this situation, you have a registered Leave and License agreement with the owner for a period of 33 months. The rights and obligations of both parties are governed by the terms mentioned in the agreement. Firstly, it is important to note that the owner cannot unilaterally ask you to vacate the premises before the expiry of the agreement unless there is a specific provision in the agreement allowing for early termination under certain circumstances. Generally, the agreement will lay down the procedure for termination and the notice period required. If the owner has not served you with a written notice to vacate the premises, her oral communication or phone conversation does not hold legal value. A written notice is typically required as evidence of termination. In case the owner has given you a reason for asking you to vacate the premises (e.g., the complaint about AC leakage), you have the right to rectify the issue within a reasonable period of time, as stated in the agreement. If the owner insists on asking you to vacate the property without following the legal procedure mentioned in the agreement, you have the right to challenge her eviction. You can approach the concerned Rent Control Authority or Civil Court having jurisdiction over the area where the property is located. The applicable Act for the jurisdiction of the Rent Control Authority or Civil Court will depend on the state in which the property is situated. Regarding the issue of the rent increase, unless there is a specific clause in the agreement allowing for periodic rent hikes, the owner cannot unilaterally demand an increase in rent during the term of the agreement. If you have been paying the rent as per the agreed terms and conditions, you are not obligated to pay the increased rent.Sukumar JadhavAdvocate, Mumbai35 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sukumar Jadhav"

    "question": "Owner has asked me to vacate flat before the agreement period",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You have the right to remain on the premises until the current rental agreement expires, and no one can force you out before then. If the situation becomes more intense, you have the option to take legal action by filing a permanent injunction against the other party. This legal measure would prevent them from attempting to evict you without following the proper legal procedures. Such a lawsuit could extend over several years, giving you time to find alternative rental accommodations. During this legal process, they would not be able to increase your rent. Even if you fall behind on monthly rent payments, they can only approach the court to request payment while the injunction case is ongoing, which itself could take around six months or more. In the meantime, you can explore new rental options. It's important to note that they cannot evict you without providing the one-month notice period stipulated in the rental agreement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Purchase of Property: Before purchasing any property, it’s crucial to conduct a thorough due diligence process. This includes verifying the title deeds, checking for any encumbrances, and ensuring that all property taxes have been paid up to date. It’s also advisable to consult with a legal expert before proceeding with the purchase.Claim by Daughters: As per theHindu Succession Act, when a father dies intestate, his self-acquired property must be shared equally among his class 1 heirs including daughters. However, in your case, it appears that some of the daughters and sons have already relinquished their rights to the property through the registered sale deed of 1999. This could potentially act as a relinquishment of right by these 5 children.Protection for Sons: The sons could potentially be protected by Article 110 of the Limitation Act if the remaining 2 daughters had knowledge of the said sale in 1999 and registered partition in 2000, and 23 years have passed. The Limitation Act stipulates that any person who has been in possession of a property for an uninterrupted period of 12 years can claim ownership through adverse possession.Sukumar JadhavAdvocate, Mumbai35 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sukumar Jadhav"

The court has proposed subjecting the document in question to tests recommended by experts in the field. This approach aligns with the court's adoption of the principles established in the cases of Kalyani Baskar v. M.S. Sampoornam (2007) 1 MLJ (Crl) 1020 and T. Nagappa v. Y.R. Mudaliar (2008) 2 MLJ (Crl) 956. The court's direction in this matter is to have the disputed document undergo examination through non-destructive methods, thereby affording the accused the opportunity to challenge any presumptions of law using credible evidence. Consequently, it is mandated that the contested document be referred to a government forensic laboratory for the application of such testing procedures. This measure ensures that a fair and well-founded assessment of the document's authenticity is carried out."

Techniques like Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC), Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) can be used to analyze ink samples.Aging of Ink:The aging of ink on paper can be influenced by factors like exposure to light, humidity, temperature, and chemical interactions. However, accurately determining the exact age of ink, especially over long periods, can be challenging.Availability of Techniques:Forensic analysis of ink is available in both government and private forensic laboratories in many countries, including India. However, the extent of capabilities can vary between labs.Legal Proceedings and Forensic Evidence:In legal proceedings, forensic evidence, including ink analysis, can be presented to the court to support a case. However, it's important to note that forensic analysis is not always definitive and might provide only probabilities or indications. The court considers all available evidence, including expert opinions, when making decisions.Consult with Forensic Experts:If you have concerns about the authenticity of a document or signature, you should consult with a forensic expert who specializes in ink analysis.

    "question": "Owner has asked me to vacate flat before the agreement period",
    "answer": "In this situation, you have a registered Leave and License agreement with the owner for a period of 33 months. The rights and obligations of both parties are governed by the terms mentioned in the agreement. Firstly, it is important to note that the owner cannot unilaterally ask you to vacate the premises before the expiry of the agreement unless there is a specific provision in the agreement allowing for early termination under certain circumstances. Generally, the agreement will lay down the procedure for termination and the notice period required. If the owner has not served you with a written notice to vacate the premises, her oral communication or phone conversation does not hold legal value. A written notice is typically required as evidence of termination. In case the owner has given you a reason for asking you to vacate the premises (e.g., the complaint about AC leakage), you have the right to rectify the issue within a reasonable period of time, as stated in the agreement. If the owner insists on asking you to vacate the property without following the legal procedure mentioned in the agreement, you have the right to challenge her eviction. You can approach the concerned Rent Control Authority or Civil Court having jurisdiction over the area where the property is located. The applicable Act for the jurisdiction of the Rent Control Authority or Civil Court will depend on the state in which the property is situated. Regarding the issue of the rent increase, unless there is a specific clause in the agreement allowing for periodic rent hikes, the owner cannot unilaterally demand an increase in rent during the term of the agreement. If you have been paying the rent as per the agreed terms and conditions, you are not obligated to pay the increased rent.Sukumar JadhavAdvocate, Mumbai35 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sukumar Jadhav"

    "question": "Owner has asked me to vacate flat before the agreement period",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You have the right to remain on the premises until the current rental agreement expires, and no one can force you out before then. If the situation becomes more intense, you have the option to take legal action by filing a permanent injunction against the other party. This legal measure would prevent them from attempting to evict you without following the proper legal procedures. Such a lawsuit could extend over several years, giving you time to find alternative rental accommodations. During this legal process, they would not be able to increase your rent. Even if you fall behind on monthly rent payments, they can only approach the court to request payment while the injunction case is ongoing, which itself could take around six months or more. In the meantime, you can explore new rental options. It's important to note that they cannot evict you without providing the one-month notice period stipulated in the rental agreement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The court has proposed subjecting the document in question to tests recommended by experts in the field. This approach aligns with the court's adoption of the principles established in the cases of Kalyani Baskar v. M.S. Sampoornam (2007) 1 MLJ (Crl) 1020 and T. Nagappa v. Y.R. Mudaliar (2008) 2 MLJ (Crl) 956. The court's direction in this matter is to have the disputed document undergo examination through non-destructive methods, thereby affording the accused the opportunity to challenge any presumptions of law using credible evidence. Consequently, it is mandated that the contested document be referred to a government forensic laboratory for the application of such testing procedures. This measure ensures that a fair and well-founded assessment of the document's authenticity is carried out."

    "answer": "Dear Client,Forensic Analysis of Ink:Forensic laboratories can analyze ink to determine certain characteristics such as its composition, color, chemical properties, and aging patterns. Techniques like Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC), Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) can be used to analyze ink samples.Aging of Ink:The aging of ink on paper can be influenced by factors like exposure to light, humidity, temperature, and chemical interactions. However, accurately determining the exact age of ink, especially over long periods, can be challenging.Availability of Techniques:Forensic analysis of ink is available in both government and private forensic laboratories in many countries, including India. However, the extent of capabilities can vary between labs.Legal Proceedings and Forensic Evidence:In legal proceedings, forensic evidence, including ink analysis, can be presented to the court to support a case. However, it's important to note that forensic analysis is not always definitive and might provide only probabilities or indications. The court considers all available evidence, including expert opinions, when making decisions.Consult with Forensic Experts:If you have concerns about the authenticity of a document or signature, you should consult with a forensic expert who specializes in ink analysis. They can provide insights into the feasibility of analyzing the ink's age and the potential significance of such analysis in your specific case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The property is reported to have been purchased in the name of your mother hence she will be considered as the absolute owner of the property, therefore legally she can distribute the property in any manner to her children or even can sell the property without the consent of anyone.  Please note thatMuslims do not follow or recognise the joint family system in matters of inheritance, hence even though your father funded for the purchase of the property and you might have invested in the property development, it cannot be treated as benami transaction hence any attempt to get the property through a partition or invoking any provision of law through court, may not fetch you the desired result.2. Since this is your mother's own and absolute property, it is her own decision to allot any share and in any ratio to her children, she cannot be compelled to distribute the property as per your wish or even through court of law.3. Until and unless there is any agreement in writing between you and your mother towards the reported investment, you cannot claim anything in it as a right, however based on the evidence for your investment, you can ask your mother either to allot a share in the property or to return your invested amount, though this may not be legally enforceable.4.

    "answer": "In the event of having an \"either or Survivor\" account, following your sister's passing, your mother would be able to operate the account individually. No name changes or alterations would be required in this scenario.If, for any reason, your mother is unavailable or unable to manage the account, you might need to acquire separate succession certificates for both your mother and sister.Considering your sister's marital status, her husband and children would be considered as her successors. To initiate the process, you can submit a succession petition with her former name mentioned as an alias. This will enable you to obtain the necessary certificate.Please note that the specifics of legal procedures can vary by jurisdiction, and it's advisable to consult with legal professionals familiar with the laws in your area to ensure accurate and up-to-date information.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 provides that an employee who has served for at least 5 years is eligible to receive gratuity, even if they resign. This is because the term \"termination of employment\" in Section 4(1)(b) of the Act includes resignation.The Supreme Court recently upheld this interpretation of the Act in a case involving the Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation (RSRTC). The widow of a deceased RSRTC employee had filed a claim for gratuity, arguing that her husband had been eligible for it because he had served for more than 5 years before resigning. The RSRTC argued that gratuity was not payable in cases of resignation.The Supreme Court rejected the RSRTC's argument, holding that the term \"termination of employment\" in the Act is broad enough to include resignation. The Court also noted that the purpose of the Act is to provide financial assistance to employees who have served for a long period of time, regardless of the reason for their termination of employment.This decision is a significant victory for employees who resign after serving for at least 5 years. It ensures that they will be able to receive gratuity, which can provide them with much-needed financial support during their retirement or other life eventsAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Gratuity Act - Section 4(1)(c)",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You've done a good job summarizing the legal references. Based on the information you've provided:The Gratuity Act, 1972, does indeed state that gratuity is payable to an employee upon the termination of employment due to death or disablement due to accident or disease, and the requirement for continuous service of five years is waived in such cases.The Supreme Court judgment you referenced (Ref-1) suggests that terminating an employee solely because they have acquired a disability and are not fit for service in a particular department is not valid. This aligns with principles of non-discrimination and protection of disabled individuals.The reference to Section 20 of the Persons with Disabilities (PWD) Act, 2016 (Ref-2) reinforces the idea of non-discrimination in employment for disabled individuals. The PWD Act emphasizes that employees with disabilities should not be terminated solely on the basis of disability. It also highlights the need to provide reasonable accommodations, adjust the employee to a suitable post with the same pay scale and benefits, and even consider supernumerary positions if necessary.Based on these references, your understanding is generally accurate:Termination solely due to an employee's disability, especially if they are not fit for a specific post or department, could be seen as discriminatory and invalid under the PWD Act and related legal principles.If an employee acquires a disability and becomes unfit for their current role, employers are expected to provide reasonable accommodations or find an alternative suitable role within the organization.However, it's important to remember that the specific circumstances of each case can impact how these legal principles are applied.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "1. The property is reported to have been purchased in the name of your mother hence she will be considered as the absolute owner of the property, therefore legally she can distribute the property in any manner to her children or even can sell the property without the consent of anyone.  Please note thatMuslims do not follow or recognise the joint family system in matters of inheritance, hence even though your father funded for the purchase of the property and you might have invested in the property development, it cannot be treated as benami transaction hence any attempt to get the property through a partition or invoking any provision of law through court, may not fetch you the desired result.2. Since this is your mother's own and absolute property, it is her own decision to allot any share and in any ratio to her children, she cannot be compelled to distribute the property as per your wish or even through court of law.3. Until and unless there is any agreement in writing between you and your mother towards the reported investment, you cannot claim anything in it as a right, however based on the evidence for your investment, you can ask your mother either to allot a share in the property or to return your invested amount, though this may not be legally enforceable.4.

    "answer": "The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 provides that an employee who has served for at least 5 years is eligible to receive gratuity, even if they resign. This is because the term \"termination of employment\" in Section 4(1)(b) of the Act includes resignation.The Supreme Court recently upheld this interpretation of the Act in a case involving the Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation (RSRTC). The widow of a deceased RSRTC employee had filed a claim for gratuity, arguing that her husband had been eligible for it because he had served for more than 5 years before resigning. The RSRTC argued that gratuity was not payable in cases of resignation.The Supreme Court rejected the RSRTC's argument, holding that the term \"termination of employment\" in the Act is broad enough to include resignation. The Court also noted that the purpose of the Act is to provide financial assistance to employees who have served for a long period of time, regardless of the reason for their termination of employment.This decision is a significant victory for employees who resign after serving for at least 5 years.

    "question": "Gratuity Act - Section 4(1)(c)",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You've done a good job summarizing the legal references. Based on the information you've provided:The Gratuity Act, 1972, does indeed state that gratuity is payable to an employee upon the termination of employment due to death or disablement due to accident or disease, and the requirement for continuous service of five years is waived in such cases.The Supreme Court judgment you referenced (Ref-1) suggests that terminating an employee solely because they have acquired a disability and are not fit for service in a particular department is not valid. This aligns with principles of non-discrimination and protection of disabled individuals.The reference to Section 20 of the Persons with Disabilities (PWD) Act, 2016 (Ref-2) reinforces the idea of non-discrimination in employment for disabled individuals. The PWD Act emphasizes that employees with disabilities should not be terminated solely on the basis of disability. It also highlights the need to provide reasonable accommodations, adjust the employee to a suitable post with the same pay scale and benefits, and even consider supernumerary positions if necessary.Based on these references, your understanding is generally accurate:Termination solely due to an employee's disability, especially if they are not fit for a specific post or department, could be seen as discriminatory and invalid under the PWD Act and related legal principles.If an employee acquires a disability and becomes unfit for their current role, employers are expected to provide reasonable accommodations or find an alternative suitable role within the organization.However, it's important to remember that the specific circumstances of each case can impact how these legal principles are applied.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Based on the information you've provided:The Gratuity Act, 1972, does indeed state that gratuity is payable to an employee upon the termination of employment due to death or disablement due to accident or disease, and the requirement for continuous service of five years is waived in such cases.The Supreme Court judgment you referenced (Ref-1) suggests that terminating an employee solely because they have acquired a disability and are not fit for service in a particular department is not valid. This aligns with principles of non-discrimination and protection of disabled individuals.The reference to Section 20 of the Persons with Disabilities (PWD) Act, 2016 (Ref-2) reinforces the idea of non-discrimination in employment for disabled individuals. The PWD Act emphasizes that employees with disabilities should not be terminated solely on the basis of disability. It also highlights the need to provide reasonable accommodations, adjust the employee to a suitable post with the same pay scale and benefits, and even consider supernumerary positions if necessary.Based on these references, your understanding is generally accurate:Termination solely due to an employee's disability, especially if they are not fit for a specific post or department, could be seen as discriminatory and invalid under the PWD Act and related legal principles.If an employee acquires a disability and becomes unfit for their current role, employers are expected to provide reasonable accommodations or find an alternative suitable role within the organization.However, it's important to remember that the specific circumstances of each case can impact how these legal principles are applied.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Correct, women often have more legal options available than men in certain situations.In a civil case, you have the option to retain a special attorney to represent you. However, in a criminal case, your personal appearance might be required.The course of action depends on the specific details and nature of the case brought forward by your wife.Certainly, permanent resident (PR) status only signifies permanent residency in a country, not full citizenship. In the context of Canada, a permanent resident is someone who holds this status while maintaining their original citizenship.Your wife has the right to explore all legal avenues available to her. The determination of whether your actions caused the situation or not will be decided during the trial.Possessing a Canadian passport won't exempt you from participating in the trial and addressing any other legal matters that may arise from your wife's case.It's inaccurate to assume that a case initiated by your wife will have no impact on you.Absolutely, this is a plausible approach.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

There are a few legal implications that you should be aware of.First, if you do not join your husband in India, he may file for a Repatriation of Citizen (RC) order against you. This is a legal order that can force you to return to India. However, there are a few exceptions to this rule. For example, if you can show that you have a good reason for not wanting to return to India, such as a job or family obligations, the court may not grant the RC order.Second, if you do not join your husband in India, typically, your passport is your personal identification document and should not be canceled solely due to your decision regarding relocation.Keep a copy of all communications with your husband, including emails, text messages, and letters.Keep a record of all financial transactions between you and your husband.If you have any children, keep a copy of their birth certificates and passportsAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Bike sold to an agent who sells it without ownership transfer a year ago",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard.Firstly, you need to understand the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in this regard.Supreme Court in the case ofNaveen Kumarv.Vijay Kumar, (2018)held that:Firstly, let us see what is the definition of owner in the Motor Vehicles Act. Section 2(30) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, definesowner(of a vehicle) as under:“(30) “owner” means a person in whose name a motor vehicle stands registered, and where such person is a minor, the guardian of such minor, and in relation to a motor vehicle which is the subject of a hire-purchase, agreement, or an agreement of lease or an agreement of hypothecation, the person in possession of the vehicle under that agreement;”Interpreting this clause, the Supreme Court observed that the person in whose name a motor vehicle stands registered is the owner of the vehicle for the purposes of the Act. The use of the expression “means” is a clear indication of the position that it is the registered owner whom Parliament has regarded as the owner of the vehicle.The Court referred to the earlier Motor Vehicles Act of 1939, wherein the expression “owner” was defined in Section 2(19) as follows:“(19)“owner” means, where the person in possession of a motor vehicle is a minor, the guardian of such minor, and in relation to a motor vehicle which is the subject of a hire-purchase agreement, the person in possession of the vehicle under that agreement.”The Supreme Court held that the Parliament while enacting the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 made a specific change by recasting the earlier definition. Section 2(19) of the earlier Act stipulated that where a person in possession of a motor vehicle is a minor, the guardian of the minor would be the owner and where the motor vehicle was subject to a hire-purchase agreement, the person in possession of the vehicle under the agreement would be the owner. The Court observed:“The 1988 Act has provided in the first part of Section 2(30) that the owner would be the person in whose name the motor vehicle stands registered. Where such a person is a minor the guardian of the minor would be the owner. In relation to a motor vehicle which is the subject of an agreement of hire purchase, lease or hypothecation, the person in possession of the vehicle under that agreement would be the owner. The latter part of the definition is in the nature of an exception which applies where the motor vehicle is the subject of a hire-purchase agreement or of an agreement of lease or hypothecation. Otherwise the definition stipulates that for the purposes of the Act, the person in whose name the motor vehicle stands registered is treated as the owner.”The Court took note of Section 50 of the Act which deals with transfer of ownership of a vehicle, and also referred to various previous judgments, in particular, the following cases, which were affirmed:Pushpav.Shakuntala, (2011) 2 SCC 240;T.V. Josev.Chacko P.M., (2001) 8 SCC 748;P.P. Mohammedv.K. Rajappan, (2008) 17 SCC 624.After considering all these aspects, the Supreme Court held:“…in view of the definition of the expression “owner” in Section 2(30), it is the person in whose name the motor vehicle stands registered who, for the purposes of the Act, would be treated as the “owner”. However, where a person is a minor, the guardian of the minor would be treated as the owner. Where a motor vehicle is subject to an agreement of hire purchase, lease or hypothecation, the person in possession of the vehicle under that agreement is treated as the owner. In a situation … where the registered owner has purported to transfer the vehicle but continues to be reflected in the records of the Registering Authority as the owner of the vehicle, he would not stand absolved of liability. Parliament has consciously introduced the definition of the expression “owner” in Section 2(30), making a departure from the provisions of Section 2(19) in the earlier 1939 Act. The principle underlying the provisions of Section 2(30) is that the victim of a motor accident or, in the case of a death, the legal heirs of the deceased victim should not be left in a state of uncertainty. A claimant for compensation ought not to be burdened with following a trail of successive transfers, which are not registered with the Registering Authority. To hold otherwise would be to defeat the salutary object and purpose of the Act. Hence, the interpretation to be placed must facilitate the fulfilment of the object of the law.”Thus, it was clearly held by the Supreme Court that a person continues to be owner of the vehicle, even if he has sold his vehicle to another person, if the transfer of the vehicle is not reflected in the RTO records and if the vehicle continues to be in the name of the original owner despite the sale of vehicle. Accordingly, such original owner would continue to be liable for compensation, if any, to be paid by the owner for any accident, despite he having sold the vehicle.It is therefore in the interest of those who sell their vehicles, to get the vehicles transferred in the name of the buyer by following the procedure laid down for transfer of vehicles, particularly in Section 50 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.Therefore, as per the facts you mentioned you can report the matter to the nearest police station of your area in West Bengal and also the Regional Transport Office. Also, you can issue the legal notice through Advocate in this regard to the concerned person so as to safeguard yourself.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

However, the CPC does allow for service of summons by other means, such as registered post or publication in a newspaper.In the absence of specific provisions in the CPC, it is up to the court to decide whether service of summons through digital media is sufficient. In some cases, courts have allowed service of summons through email or WhatsApp, while in other cases, they have required physical service.If the court decides to allow service of summons through digital media, and the other party does not appear in court, the court may issue a warrant for their arrestProvide the court with evidence that the other party has access to email or WhatsApp, such as a copy of their email address or a screenshot of their WhatsApp profile.

    "answer": "If the accused had received the legal notice and the court summons at least once in the given address but had decided to not to respond then you can seek permission of court to issue bailable warrant in this case under section 138 NI Act.The service of summons through whatsapp or any social media will be proper and satisfy the court in the civil cases, whereas in the criminal cases what will the court do if you were not able to serve the summons to the person's address where he do not live neither you have his correct or current address.If the bailable warrant is to be issued then the court will need to have his correct address in order to pass orders to the concerned police to execute the warrant .Order V Rule 9(2) of CPC empowers the court to deliver summons in such manner as the court deems fit. Moreover, Order 5 Rule 9(3) uses the expression “any other means of transmission” which includes fax message or electronic mail service. Therefore the usage of Whatsapp by the court was not against legal provisions. But this is applicable to the civil cases only and not for the criminal cases.The court may allow the serving of the notice of summons through Whatsapp after normal attempts for serving summons failed.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Bike sold to an agent who sells it without ownership transfer a year ago",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard.Firstly, you need to understand the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in this regard.Supreme Court in the case ofNaveen Kumarv.Vijay Kumar, (2018)held that:Firstly, let us see what is the definition of owner in the Motor Vehicles Act. Section 2(30) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, definesowner(of a vehicle) as under:“(30) “owner” means a person in whose name a motor vehicle stands registered, and where such person is a minor, the guardian of such minor, and in relation to a motor vehicle which is the subject of a hire-purchase, agreement, or an agreement of lease or an agreement of hypothecation, the person in possession of the vehicle under that agreement;”Interpreting this clause, the Supreme Court observed that the person in whose name a motor vehicle stands registered is the owner of the vehicle for the purposes of the Act. The use of the expression “means” is a clear indication of the position that it is the registered owner whom Parliament has regarded as the owner of the vehicle.The Court referred to the earlier Motor Vehicles Act of 1939, wherein the expression “owner” was defined in Section 2(19) as follows:“(19)“owner” means, where the person in possession of a motor vehicle is a minor, the guardian of such minor, and in relation to a motor vehicle which is the subject of a hire-purchase agreement, the person in possession of the vehicle under that agreement.”The Supreme Court held that the Parliament while enacting the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 made a specific change by recasting the earlier definition. Section 2(19) of the earlier Act stipulated that where a person in possession of a motor vehicle is a minor, the guardian of the minor would be the owner and where the motor vehicle was subject to a hire-purchase agreement, the person in possession of the vehicle under the agreement would be the owner. The Court observed:“The 1988 Act has provided in the first part of Section 2(30) that the owner would be the person in whose name the motor vehicle stands registered. Where such a person is a minor the guardian of the minor would be the owner. In relation to a motor vehicle which is the subject of an agreement of hire purchase, lease or hypothecation, the person in possession of the vehicle under that agreement would be the owner. The latter part of the definition is in the nature of an exception which applies where the motor vehicle is the subject of a hire-purchase agreement or of an agreement of lease or hypothecation. Otherwise the definition stipulates that for the purposes of the Act, the person in whose name the motor vehicle stands registered is treated as the owner.”The Court took note of Section 50 of the Act which deals with transfer of ownership of a vehicle, and also referred to various previous judgments, in particular, the following cases, which were affirmed:Pushpav.Shakuntala, (2011) 2 SCC 240;T.V. Josev.Chacko P.M., (2001) 8 SCC 748;P.P. Mohammedv.K. Rajappan, (2008) 17 SCC 624.After considering all these aspects, the Supreme Court held:“…in view of the definition of the expression “owner” in Section 2(30), it is the person in whose name the motor vehicle stands registered who, for the purposes of the Act, would be treated as the “owner”. However, where a person is a minor, the guardian of the minor would be treated as the owner. Where a motor vehicle is subject to an agreement of hire purchase, lease or hypothecation, the person in possession of the vehicle under that agreement is treated as the owner. In a situation … where the registered owner has purported to transfer the vehicle but continues to be reflected in the records of the Registering Authority as the owner of the vehicle, he would not stand absolved of liability. Parliament has consciously introduced the definition of the expression “owner” in Section 2(30), making a departure from the provisions of Section 2(19) in the earlier 1939 Act. The principle underlying the provisions of Section 2(30) is that the victim of a motor accident or, in the case of a death, the legal heirs of the deceased victim should not be left in a state of uncertainty. A claimant for compensation ought not to be burdened with following a trail of successive transfers, which are not registered with the Registering Authority. To hold otherwise would be to defeat the salutary object and purpose of the Act. Hence, the interpretation to be placed must facilitate the fulfilment of the object of the law.”Thus, it was clearly held by the Supreme Court that a person continues to be owner of the vehicle, even if he has sold his vehicle to another person, if the transfer of the vehicle is not reflected in the RTO records and if the vehicle continues to be in the name of the original owner despite the sale of vehicle. Accordingly, such original owner would continue to be liable for compensation, if any, to be paid by the owner for any accident, despite he having sold the vehicle.It is therefore in the interest of those who sell their vehicles, to get the vehicles transferred in the name of the buyer by following the procedure laid down for transfer of vehicles, particularly in Section 50 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.Therefore, as per the facts you mentioned you can report the matter to the nearest police station of your area in West Bengal and also the Regional Transport Office. Also, you can issue the legal notice through Advocate in this regard to the concerned person so as to safeguard yourself.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The Civil Procedure Code (CPC) does not specifically mention digital media as a method of service of summons. However, the CPC does allow for service of summons by other means, such as registered post or publication in a newspaper.In the absence of specific provisions in the CPC, it is up to the court to decide whether service of summons through digital media is sufficient. In some cases, courts have allowed service of summons through email or WhatsApp, while in other cases, they have required physical service.If the court decides to allow service of summons through digital media, and the other party does not appear in court, the court may issue a warrant for their arrestProvide the court with evidence that the other party has access to email or WhatsApp, such as a copy of their email address or a screenshot of their WhatsApp profile.

    "answer": "If the accused had received the legal notice and the court summons at least once in the given address but had decided to not to respond then you can seek permission of court to issue bailable warrant in this case under section 138 NI Act.The service of summons through whatsapp or any social media will be proper and satisfy the court in the civil cases, whereas in the criminal cases what will the court do if you were not able to serve the summons to the person's address where he do not live neither you have his correct or current address.If the bailable warrant is to be issued then the court will need to have his correct address in order to pass orders to the concerned police to execute the warrant .Order V Rule 9(2) of CPC empowers the court to deliver summons in such manner as the court deems fit. Moreover, Order 5 Rule 9(3) uses the expression “any other means of transmission” which includes fax message or electronic mail service. Therefore the usage of Whatsapp by the court was not against legal provisions. But this is applicable to the civil cases only and not for the criminal cases.The court may allow the serving of the notice of summons through Whatsapp after normal attempts for serving summons failed.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

An application under Section 125 Cr.P.C. is predicated on two conditions :the husband has sufficient means; and“neglects” to maintain his wife, who is unable to maintain herself.Under the third proviso to the amended Section 125, the application for grant of interim maintenance must be disposed of as far as possible within sixty days’ from the date of service of notice on the respondent.“While there is a tendency on the part of the wife to exaggerate her needs, there is a corresponding tendency by the husband to conceal his actual income.”If men cannot support themselves financially, they can claim maintenance from their wives who are financially well-off and earning more than them.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Sale Deed for Execution in E.P.:In an execution petition (E.P.), you are seeking enforcement of a court decree. This typically involves taking steps to ensure that the terms of the compromise decree are carried out.Since there is a compromise decree for 10 acres and you are in possession of 9 acres, it's advisable to follow the terms of the decree. If there are specific instructions or terms related to the division of land, you should adhere to those terms.If the compromise decree specifies that you are entitled to 10 acres and the judgment debtor (the other party) holds the remaining 1 acre, you would generally not need to file a separate sale deed for the 1 acre. The terms of the compromise decree should guide the transfer of ownership.Recovery of 1 Acre as per Court Compromise Decree:If the compromise decree specifies that you are entitled to a total of 10 acres, and the judgment debtor has received compensation for the land acquired by the government (1 acre), you might need to enforce the decree through the execution process.The execution process involves the court's assistance in ensuring that the judgment debtor complies with the terms of the compromise decree.

Moreover, Order 5 Rule 9(3) uses the expression “any other means of transmission” which includes fax message or electronic mail service.

    "question": "Owner has asked me to vacate flat before the agreement period",
    "answer": "In this situation, you have a registered Leave and License agreement with the owner for a period of 33 months. The rights and obligations of both parties are governed by the terms mentioned in the agreement. Firstly, it is important to note that the owner cannot unilaterally ask you to vacate the premises before the expiry of the agreement unless there is a specific provision in the agreement allowing for early termination under certain circumstances. Generally, the agreement will lay down the procedure for termination and the notice period required. If the owner has not served you with a written notice to vacate the premises, her oral communication or phone conversation does not hold legal value. A written notice is typically required as evidence of termination. In case the owner has given you a reason for asking you to vacate the premises (e.g., the complaint about AC leakage), you have the right to rectify the issue within a reasonable period of time, as stated in the agreement. If the owner insists on asking you to vacate the property without following the legal procedure mentioned in the agreement, you have the right to challenge her eviction. You can approach the concerned Rent Control Authority or Civil Court having jurisdiction over the area where the property is located. The applicable Act for the jurisdiction of the Rent Control Authority or Civil Court will depend on the state in which the property is situated. Regarding the issue of the rent increase, unless there is a specific clause in the agreement allowing for periodic rent hikes, the owner cannot unilaterally demand an increase in rent during the term of the agreement. If you have been paying the rent as per the agreed terms and conditions, you are not obligated to pay the increased rent.Sukumar JadhavAdvocate, Mumbai35 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sukumar Jadhav"

    "question": "Owner has asked me to vacate flat before the agreement period",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You have the right to remain on the premises until the current rental agreement expires, and no one can force you out before then. If the situation becomes more intense, you have the option to take legal action by filing a permanent injunction against the other party. This legal measure would prevent them from attempting to evict you without following the proper legal procedures. Such a lawsuit could extend over several years, giving you time to find alternative rental accommodations. During this legal process, they would not be able to increase your rent. Even if you fall behind on monthly rent payments, they can only approach the court to request payment while the injunction case is ongoing, which itself could take around six months or more. In the meantime, you can explore new rental options. It's important to note that they cannot evict you without providing the one-month notice period stipulated in the rental agreement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Bike sold to an agent who sells it without ownership transfer a year ago",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard.Firstly, you need to understand the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in this regard.Supreme Court in the case ofNaveen Kumarv.Vijay Kumar, (2018)held that:Firstly, let us see what is the definition of owner in the Motor Vehicles Act. Section 2(30) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, definesowner(of a vehicle) as under:“(30) “owner” means a person in whose name a motor vehicle stands registered, and where such person is a minor, the guardian of such minor, and in relation to a motor vehicle which is the subject of a hire-purchase, agreement, or an agreement of lease or an agreement of hypothecation, the person in possession of the vehicle under that agreement;”Interpreting this clause, the Supreme Court observed that the person in whose name a motor vehicle stands registered is the owner of the vehicle for the purposes of the Act. The use of the expression “means” is a clear indication of the position that it is the registered owner whom Parliament has regarded as the owner of the vehicle.The Court referred to the earlier Motor Vehicles Act of 1939, wherein the expression “owner” was defined in Section 2(19) as follows:“(19)“owner” means, where the person in possession of a motor vehicle is a minor, the guardian of such minor, and in relation to a motor vehicle which is the subject of a hire-purchase agreement, the person in possession of the vehicle under that agreement.”The Supreme Court held that the Parliament while enacting the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 made a specific change by recasting the earlier definition. Section 2(19) of the earlier Act stipulated that where a person in possession of a motor vehicle is a minor, the guardian of the minor would be the owner and where the motor vehicle was subject to a hire-purchase agreement, the person in possession of the vehicle under the agreement would be the owner. The Court observed:“The 1988 Act has provided in the first part of Section 2(30) that the owner would be the person in whose name the motor vehicle stands registered. Where such a person is a minor the guardian of the minor would be the owner. In relation to a motor vehicle which is the subject of an agreement of hire purchase, lease or hypothecation, the person in possession of the vehicle under that agreement would be the owner. The latter part of the definition is in the nature of an exception which applies where the motor vehicle is the subject of a hire-purchase agreement or of an agreement of lease or hypothecation. Otherwise the definition stipulates that for the purposes of the Act, the person in whose name the motor vehicle stands registered is treated as the owner.”The Court took note of Section 50 of the Act which deals with transfer of ownership of a vehicle, and also referred to various previous judgments, in particular, the following cases, which were affirmed:Pushpav.Shakuntala, (2011) 2 SCC 240;T.V. Josev.Chacko P.M., (2001) 8 SCC 748;P.P. Mohammedv.K. Rajappan, (2008) 17 SCC 624.After considering all these aspects, the Supreme Court held:“…in view of the definition of the expression “owner” in Section 2(30), it is the person in whose name the motor vehicle stands registered who, for the purposes of the Act, would be treated as the “owner”. However, where a person is a minor, the guardian of the minor would be treated as the owner. Where a motor vehicle is subject to an agreement of hire purchase, lease or hypothecation, the person in possession of the vehicle under that agreement is treated as the owner. In a situation … where the registered owner has purported to transfer the vehicle but continues to be reflected in the records of the Registering Authority as the owner of the vehicle, he would not stand absolved of liability. Parliament has consciously introduced the definition of the expression “owner” in Section 2(30), making a departure from the provisions of Section 2(19) in the earlier 1939 Act. The principle underlying the provisions of Section 2(30) is that the victim of a motor accident or, in the case of a death, the legal heirs of the deceased victim should not be left in a state of uncertainty. A claimant for compensation ought not to be burdened with following a trail of successive transfers, which are not registered with the Registering Authority. To hold otherwise would be to defeat the salutary object and purpose of the Act. Hence, the interpretation to be placed must facilitate the fulfilment of the object of the law.”Thus, it was clearly held by the Supreme Court that a person continues to be owner of the vehicle, even if he has sold his vehicle to another person, if the transfer of the vehicle is not reflected in the RTO records and if the vehicle continues to be in the name of the original owner despite the sale of vehicle. Accordingly, such original owner would continue to be liable for compensation, if any, to be paid by the owner for any accident, despite he having sold the vehicle.It is therefore in the interest of those who sell their vehicles, to get the vehicles transferred in the name of the buyer by following the procedure laid down for transfer of vehicles, particularly in Section 50 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.Therefore, as per the facts you mentioned you can report the matter to the nearest police station of your area in West Bengal and also the Regional Transport Office. Also, you can issue the legal notice through Advocate in this regard to the concerned person so as to safeguard yourself.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Yes, there are a few things you can do to legally protect yourself from any responsibility that might arise from the unlawful usage of your vehicle which continues to be in your name.File a police complaint against the agent.This will create a paper trail of your complaint and establish that you are not the one responsible for the unlawful usage of the vehicle.Send a legal notice to the agent demanding that he transfer the ownership of the vehicle to you immediately.This will put the agent on notice that you are serious about taking legal action if he does not comply.Contact the RTO and inform them that you are not the current owner of the vehicle and that you have not authorized anyone to use it.This will help to prevent the RTO from issuing any further challans or taking any other action against you.Take out an insurance policy on the vehicle in your name.This will protect you financially in case the vehicle is involved in an accident or other incident while it is still in your name.If you take these steps, you will be in a much stronger position to defend yourself if you are ever held liable for the unlawful usage of your vehicle.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Owner has asked me to vacate flat before the agreement period",
    "answer": "In this situation, you have a registered Leave and License agreement with the owner for a period of 33 months. The rights and obligations of both parties are governed by the terms mentioned in the agreement. Firstly, it is important to note that the owner cannot unilaterally ask you to vacate the premises before the expiry of the agreement unless there is a specific provision in the agreement allowing for early termination under certain circumstances. Generally, the agreement will lay down the procedure for termination and the notice period required. If the owner has not served you with a written notice to vacate the premises, her oral communication or phone conversation does not hold legal value. A written notice is typically required as evidence of termination. In case the owner has given you a reason for asking you to vacate the premises (e.g., the complaint about AC leakage), you have the right to rectify the issue within a reasonable period of time, as stated in the agreement. If the owner insists on asking you to vacate the property without following the legal procedure mentioned in the agreement, you have the right to challenge her eviction. You can approach the concerned Rent Control Authority or Civil Court having jurisdiction over the area where the property is located. The applicable Act for the jurisdiction of the Rent Control Authority or Civil Court will depend on the state in which the property is situated. Regarding the issue of the rent increase, unless there is a specific clause in the agreement allowing for periodic rent hikes, the owner cannot unilaterally demand an increase in rent during the term of the agreement. If you have been paying the rent as per the agreed terms and conditions, you are not obligated to pay the increased rent.Sukumar JadhavAdvocate, Mumbai35 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sukumar Jadhav"

    "question": "Owner has asked me to vacate flat before the agreement period",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You have the right to remain on the premises until the current rental agreement expires, and no one can force you out before then. If the situation becomes more intense, you have the option to take legal action by filing a permanent injunction against the other party. This legal measure would prevent them from attempting to evict you without following the proper legal procedures. Such a lawsuit could extend over several years, giving you time to find alternative rental accommodations. During this legal process, they would not be able to increase your rent. Even if you fall behind on monthly rent payments, they can only approach the court to request payment while the injunction case is ongoing, which itself could take around six months or more. In the meantime, you can explore new rental options. It's important to note that they cannot evict you without providing the one-month notice period stipulated in the rental agreement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "No Pagdi Tenancy renewed since 40+ years? What would be the status under re-development?",
    "answer": "1. you are the legal heir of the original deceased tenant. so you are entitled. no new agreement is required. the legal heirs of the deceased tenant become the joint tenants by operation of law. It does not matter that the rent receipt is still issued in the name of your grandmother who was the original tenant2. there is no need to pay any money to the landlord's son. however if you want the rent receipt to be issued in your sole name, then you can take noc from other heirs and submit that to the landlord and request him to transfer the rent bill in your name, however for that you dont have to pay full 33% since the heirs get tenancy rights by operation of law and there is no transfer of tenancy to a third party as such. in case you wish to buy the remaining rights of the landlord in the unit then for that he may demand the market value of the unit, since by transferring the remaining rights in the unit, you would become the owner of the unit.3. what rubbish! just continue to pay the rent to the heir of the deceased landlord and take proper rent receipts from him. If he is not accepting the rent then do a money order in his favour or make an application to the small causes court to deposit the rent in court since the landlord refuses to accept the rent from you. the builder as and when appointed has to recognise the heirs of the deceased tenant and the new rehab unit will be allotted to them only or to any one of them as per the mutual agreement between the heirsYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Dear client,Addressing Your Pagdi Tenancy ConcernsEligibility for a Unit During RedevelopmentEven though you don’t have a Pagdi tenancy agreement under your name, you may still be eligible for a unit during redevelopment. The key factors are:Proof of Tenancy:You have been paying rent and have a historical agreement between your grandmother and the landlord’s mother. This can serve as proof of your tenancy.Society Membership:Since the building has formed a cooperative society, you should ensure that your tenancy is recognized by the society. This can strengthen your claim during redevelopment.Legal Heir:As the legal heir, you have the right to inherit the tenancy. You may need to provide documentation proving your status as the legal heir.Buying the Unit from the LandlordIf the landlord agrees, you can negotiate to buy the unit based on the current market valuation. Here are the steps:Valuation:Get the property valued by a certified valuer to determine the current market price.Negotiation:Offer to pay 33% of the market value, as per the common practice in Pagdi tenancies. Ensure that this agreement is documented and legally binding.Legal Agreement:Draft a sale agreement with the help of a lawyer to formalize the transaction and protect your interests.Depositing Rent in CourtDepositing rent in court can be a strategic move to demonstrate your willingness to pay rent and maintain your tenancy rights. However, there are some considerations:Court Deposit:You can file an application in the local Rent Control Court to deposit the rent. This shows that you are fulfilling your obligations as a tenant.Legal Protection:By depositing rent in court, you protect yourself from eviction claims based on non-payment of rent.Builder’s Involvement:If the landlord tries to return the money and ask you to vacate, you can contest this in court. The court will consider your long-term tenancy and the fact that you have been paying rent.Practical StepsConsult a Lawyer:Engage a lawyer who specializes in tenancy and property laws. They can guide you through the process and help you draft necessary legal documents.Document Everything:Keep records of all rent payments, communications with the landlord, and any other relevant documents. This will be crucial in case of legal disputes.Communicate with the Society:Ensure that the cooperative society recognizes your tenancy. Attend society meetings and keep them informed about your situation.Public Notice:If you decide to buy the unit, consider publishing a public notice to inform any potential claimants and avoid future disputes.Thank you.

    "question": "Bike sold to an agent who sells it without ownership transfer a year ago",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard.Firstly, you need to understand the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in this regard.Supreme Court in the case ofNaveen Kumarv.Vijay Kumar, (2018)held that:Firstly, let us see what is the definition of owner in the Motor Vehicles Act. Section 2(30) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, definesowner(of a vehicle) as under:“(30) “owner” means a person in whose name a motor vehicle stands registered, and where such person is a minor, the guardian of such minor, and in relation to a motor vehicle which is the subject of a hire-purchase, agreement, or an agreement of lease or an agreement of hypothecation, the person in possession of the vehicle under that agreement;”Interpreting this clause, the Supreme Court observed that the person in whose name a motor vehicle stands registered is the owner of the vehicle for the purposes of the Act. The use of the expression “means” is a clear indication of the position that it is the registered owner whom Parliament has regarded as the owner of the vehicle.The Court referred to the earlier Motor Vehicles Act of 1939, wherein the expression “owner” was defined in Section 2(19) as follows:“(19)“owner” means, where the person in possession of a motor vehicle is a minor, the guardian of such minor, and in relation to a motor vehicle which is the subject of a hire-purchase agreement, the person in possession of the vehicle under that agreement.”The Supreme Court held that the Parliament while enacting the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 made a specific change by recasting the earlier definition. Section 2(19) of the earlier Act stipulated that where a person in possession of a motor vehicle is a minor, the guardian of the minor would be the owner and where the motor vehicle was subject to a hire-purchase agreement, the person in possession of the vehicle under the agreement would be the owner. The Court observed:“The 1988 Act has provided in the first part of Section 2(30) that the owner would be the person in whose name the motor vehicle stands registered. Where such a person is a minor the guardian of the minor would be the owner. In relation to a motor vehicle which is the subject of an agreement of hire purchase, lease or hypothecation, the person in possession of the vehicle under that agreement would be the owner. The latter part of the definition is in the nature of an exception which applies where the motor vehicle is the subject of a hire-purchase agreement or of an agreement of lease or hypothecation. Otherwise the definition stipulates that for the purposes of the Act, the person in whose name the motor vehicle stands registered is treated as the owner.”The Court took note of Section 50 of the Act which deals with transfer of ownership of a vehicle, and also referred to various previous judgments, in particular, the following cases, which were affirmed:Pushpav.Shakuntala, (2011) 2 SCC 240;T.V. Josev.Chacko P.M., (2001) 8 SCC 748;P.P. Mohammedv.K. Rajappan, (2008) 17 SCC 624.After considering all these aspects, the Supreme Court held:“…in view of the definition of the expression “owner” in Section 2(30), it is the person in whose name the motor vehicle stands registered who, for the purposes of the Act, would be treated as the “owner”. However, where a person is a minor, the guardian of the minor would be treated as the owner. Where a motor vehicle is subject to an agreement of hire purchase, lease or hypothecation, the person in possession of the vehicle under that agreement is treated as the owner. In a situation … where the registered owner has purported to transfer the vehicle but continues to be reflected in the records of the Registering Authority as the owner of the vehicle, he would not stand absolved of liability. Parliament has consciously introduced the definition of the expression “owner” in Section 2(30), making a departure from the provisions of Section 2(19) in the earlier 1939 Act. The principle underlying the provisions of Section 2(30) is that the victim of a motor accident or, in the case of a death, the legal heirs of the deceased victim should not be left in a state of uncertainty. A claimant for compensation ought not to be burdened with following a trail of successive transfers, which are not registered with the Registering Authority. To hold otherwise would be to defeat the salutary object and purpose of the Act. Hence, the interpretation to be placed must facilitate the fulfilment of the object of the law.”Thus, it was clearly held by the Supreme Court that a person continues to be owner of the vehicle, even if he has sold his vehicle to another person, if the transfer of the vehicle is not reflected in the RTO records and if the vehicle continues to be in the name of the original owner despite the sale of vehicle. Accordingly, such original owner would continue to be liable for compensation, if any, to be paid by the owner for any accident, despite he having sold the vehicle.It is therefore in the interest of those who sell their vehicles, to get the vehicles transferred in the name of the buyer by following the procedure laid down for transfer of vehicles, particularly in Section 50 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.Therefore, as per the facts you mentioned you can report the matter to the nearest police station of your area in West Bengal and also the Regional Transport Office. Also, you can issue the legal notice through Advocate in this regard to the concerned person so as to safeguard yourself.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "answer": "In India, the trading of other parties' funds is strongly discouraged due to various risks and potential legal issues. Offering guaranteed returns in trading is prohibited, as it is unrealistic and can mislead investors. If trading results in losses, there is a possibility that legal actions could be taken, accusing the trader of fraudulent activities.The regulatory framework for investment advisory services in India is overseen by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). Under the SEBI (Investment Advisers) Regulations of 2013, an investment advisor is defined as an individual or entity providing advice on securities investment or conducting research analysis. All entities falling under this definition are required to register with SEBI, which includes individuals, partnerships, limited liability partnerships (LLPs), companies, and other similar entities offering investment advisory services for a fee. Even employees and representatives of investment advisory firms who engage with clients and provide advice must be registered with SEBI.Regarding Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs), as per Regulation 2(1)(b) of the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations of 2012, an AIF is a fund established within India as a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP), company, trust, or body corporate.

It does not legally verify that you are the rightful owner. On the other hand,an occupancy certificate indicates the completion of the design, as it states the structure is ready for occupancy.You have nothing to do with the dispute between the builder and the land owner.If the OC is obtained and if you feel that this dispute will not be solved in the near future, you may better take possession with an assurance for transfer of title by a registered sale deed is executed within a time stipulated in the undertaking by the builder.After that you can file a suit for specific performance of contract seeking court direction to the builder to execute the registered sale deed.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "1. you are the legal heir of the original deceased tenant. so you are entitled. no new agreement is required. the legal heirs of the deceased tenant become the joint tenants by operation of law. It does not matter that the rent receipt is still issued in the name of your grandmother who was the original tenant2. there is no need to pay any money to the landlord's son. however if you want the rent receipt to be issued in your sole name, then you can take noc from other heirs and submit that to the landlord and request him to transfer the rent bill in your name, however for that you dont have to pay full 33% since the heirs get tenancy rights by operation of law and there is no transfer of tenancy to a third party as such. in case you wish to buy the remaining rights of the landlord in the unit then for that he may demand the market value of the unit, since by transferring the remaining rights in the unit, you would become the owner of the unit.3. what rubbish! just continue to pay the rent to the heir of the deceased landlord and take proper rent receipts from him. If he is not accepting the rent then do a money order in his favour or make an application to the small causes court to deposit the rent in court since the landlord refuses to accept the rent from you. the builder as and when appointed has to recognise the heirs of the deceased tenant and the new rehab unit will be allotted to them only or to any one of them as per the mutual agreement between the heirsYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Dear client,Addressing Your Pagdi Tenancy ConcernsEligibility for a Unit During RedevelopmentEven though you don’t have a Pagdi tenancy agreement under your name, you may still be eligible for a unit during redevelopment. The key factors are:Proof of Tenancy:You have been paying rent and have a historical agreement between your grandmother and the landlord’s mother. This can serve as proof of your tenancy.Society Membership:Since the building has formed a cooperative society, you should ensure that your tenancy is recognized by the society. This can strengthen your claim during redevelopment.Legal Heir:As the legal heir, you have the right to inherit the tenancy. You may need to provide documentation proving your status as the legal heir.Buying the Unit from the LandlordIf the landlord agrees, you can negotiate to buy the unit based on the current market valuation. Here are the steps:Valuation:Get the property valued by a certified valuer to determine the current market price.Negotiation:Offer to pay 33% of the market value, as per the common practice in Pagdi tenancies. Ensure that this agreement is documented and legally binding.Legal Agreement:Draft a sale agreement with the help of a lawyer to formalize the transaction and protect your interests.Depositing Rent in CourtDepositing rent in court can be a strategic move to demonstrate your willingness to pay rent and maintain your tenancy rights. However, there are some considerations:Court Deposit:You can file an application in the local Rent Control Court to deposit the rent. This shows that you are fulfilling your obligations as a tenant.Legal Protection:By depositing rent in court, you protect yourself from eviction claims based on non-payment of rent.Builder’s Involvement:If the landlord tries to return the money and ask you to vacate, you can contest this in court. The court will consider your long-term tenancy and the fact that you have been paying rent.Practical StepsConsult a Lawyer:Engage a lawyer who specializes in tenancy and property laws. They can guide you through the process and help you draft necessary legal documents.Document Everything:Keep records of all rent payments, communications with the landlord, and any other relevant documents. This will be crucial in case of legal disputes.Communicate with the Society:Ensure that the cooperative society recognizes your tenancy. Attend society meetings and keep them informed about your situation.Public Notice:If you decide to buy the unit, consider publishing a public notice to inform any potential claimants and avoid future disputes.Thank you.

    "question": "Bike sold to an agent who sells it without ownership transfer a year ago",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard.Firstly, you need to understand the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in this regard.Supreme Court in the case ofNaveen Kumarv.Vijay Kumar, (2018)held that:Firstly, let us see what is the definition of owner in the Motor Vehicles Act. Section 2(30) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, definesowner(of a vehicle) as under:“(30) “owner” means a person in whose name a motor vehicle stands registered, and where such person is a minor, the guardian of such minor, and in relation to a motor vehicle which is the subject of a hire-purchase, agreement, or an agreement of lease or an agreement of hypothecation, the person in possession of the vehicle under that agreement;”Interpreting this clause, the Supreme Court observed that the person in whose name a motor vehicle stands registered is the owner of the vehicle for the purposes of the Act. The use of the expression “means” is a clear indication of the position that it is the registered owner whom Parliament has regarded as the owner of the vehicle.The Court referred to the earlier Motor Vehicles Act of 1939, wherein the expression “owner” was defined in Section 2(19) as follows:“(19)“owner” means, where the person in possession of a motor vehicle is a minor, the guardian of such minor, and in relation to a motor vehicle which is the subject of a hire-purchase agreement, the person in possession of the vehicle under that agreement.”The Supreme Court held that the Parliament while enacting the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 made a specific change by recasting the earlier definition. Section 2(19) of the earlier Act stipulated that where a person in possession of a motor vehicle is a minor, the guardian of the minor would be the owner and where the motor vehicle was subject to a hire-purchase agreement, the person in possession of the vehicle under the agreement would be the owner. The Court observed:“The 1988 Act has provided in the first part of Section 2(30) that the owner would be the person in whose name the motor vehicle stands registered. Where such a person is a minor the guardian of the minor would be the owner. In relation to a motor vehicle which is the subject of an agreement of hire purchase, lease or hypothecation, the person in possession of the vehicle under that agreement would be the owner. The latter part of the definition is in the nature of an exception which applies where the motor vehicle is the subject of a hire-purchase agreement or of an agreement of lease or hypothecation. Otherwise the definition stipulates that for the purposes of the Act, the person in whose name the motor vehicle stands registered is treated as the owner.”The Court took note of Section 50 of the Act which deals with transfer of ownership of a vehicle, and also referred to various previous judgments, in particular, the following cases, which were affirmed:Pushpav.Shakuntala, (2011) 2 SCC 240;T.V. Josev.Chacko P.M., (2001) 8 SCC 748;P.P. Mohammedv.K. Rajappan, (2008) 17 SCC 624.After considering all these aspects, the Supreme Court held:“…in view of the definition of the expression “owner” in Section 2(30), it is the person in whose name the motor vehicle stands registered who, for the purposes of the Act, would be treated as the “owner”. However, where a person is a minor, the guardian of the minor would be treated as the owner. Where a motor vehicle is subject to an agreement of hire purchase, lease or hypothecation, the person in possession of the vehicle under that agreement is treated as the owner. In a situation … where the registered owner has purported to transfer the vehicle but continues to be reflected in the records of the Registering Authority as the owner of the vehicle, he would not stand absolved of liability. Parliament has consciously introduced the definition of the expression “owner” in Section 2(30), making a departure from the provisions of Section 2(19) in the earlier 1939 Act. The principle underlying the provisions of Section 2(30) is that the victim of a motor accident or, in the case of a death, the legal heirs of the deceased victim should not be left in a state of uncertainty. A claimant for compensation ought not to be burdened with following a trail of successive transfers, which are not registered with the Registering Authority. To hold otherwise would be to defeat the salutary object and purpose of the Act. Hence, the interpretation to be placed must facilitate the fulfilment of the object of the law.”Thus, it was clearly held by the Supreme Court that a person continues to be owner of the vehicle, even if he has sold his vehicle to another person, if the transfer of the vehicle is not reflected in the RTO records and if the vehicle continues to be in the name of the original owner despite the sale of vehicle. Accordingly, such original owner would continue to be liable for compensation, if any, to be paid by the owner for any accident, despite he having sold the vehicle.It is therefore in the interest of those who sell their vehicles, to get the vehicles transferred in the name of the buyer by following the procedure laid down for transfer of vehicles, particularly in Section 50 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.Therefore, as per the facts you mentioned you can report the matter to the nearest police station of your area in West Bengal and also the Regional Transport Office. Also, you can issue the legal notice through Advocate in this regard to the concerned person so as to safeguard yourself.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "question": "Owner has asked me to vacate flat before the agreement period",
    "answer": "In this situation, you have a registered Leave and License agreement with the owner for a period of 33 months. The rights and obligations of both parties are governed by the terms mentioned in the agreement. Firstly, it is important to note that the owner cannot unilaterally ask you to vacate the premises before the expiry of the agreement unless there is a specific provision in the agreement allowing for early termination under certain circumstances. Generally, the agreement will lay down the procedure for termination and the notice period required. If the owner has not served you with a written notice to vacate the premises, her oral communication or phone conversation does not hold legal value. A written notice is typically required as evidence of termination. In case the owner has given you a reason for asking you to vacate the premises (e.g., the complaint about AC leakage), you have the right to rectify the issue within a reasonable period of time, as stated in the agreement. If the owner insists on asking you to vacate the property without following the legal procedure mentioned in the agreement, you have the right to challenge her eviction. You can approach the concerned Rent Control Authority or Civil Court having jurisdiction over the area where the property is located. The applicable Act for the jurisdiction of the Rent Control Authority or Civil Court will depend on the state in which the property is situated. Regarding the issue of the rent increase, unless there is a specific clause in the agreement allowing for periodic rent hikes, the owner cannot unilaterally demand an increase in rent during the term of the agreement. If you have been paying the rent as per the agreed terms and conditions, you are not obligated to pay the increased rent.Sukumar JadhavAdvocate, Mumbai35 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sukumar Jadhav"

    "question": "Owner has asked me to vacate flat before the agreement period",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You have the right to remain on the premises until the current rental agreement expires, and no one can force you out before then. If the situation becomes more intense, you have the option to take legal action by filing a permanent injunction against the other party. This legal measure would prevent them from attempting to evict you without following the proper legal procedures. Such a lawsuit could extend over several years, giving you time to find alternative rental accommodations. During this legal process, they would not be able to increase your rent. Even if you fall behind on monthly rent payments, they can only approach the court to request payment while the injunction case is ongoing, which itself could take around six months or more. In the meantime, you can explore new rental options. It's important to note that they cannot evict you without providing the one-month notice period stipulated in the rental agreement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Fit out possession is basicallya possession given to the owner which still has legal or some civil work left.If the builder is offering you soft possession, which means thatyou can take possession of the flat, but legal ownership has not yet been transferred to you.Typically, a possession letter indicates when a building was completed or that the property is yours. It does not legally verify that you are the rightful owner. On the other hand,an occupancy certificate indicates the completion of the design, as it states the structure is ready for occupancy.You have nothing to do with the dispute between the builder and the land owner.If the OC is obtained and if you feel that this dispute will not be solved in the near future, you may better take possession with an assurance for transfer of title by a registered sale deed is executed within a time stipulated in the undertaking by the builder.After that you can file a suit for specific performance of contract seeking court direction to the builder to execute the registered sale deed.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

If he is not accepting the rent then do a money order in his favour or make an application to the small causes court to deposit the rent in court since the landlord refuses to accept the rent from you. the builder as and when appointed has to recognise the heirs of the deceased tenant and the new rehab unit will be allotted to them only or to any one of them as per the mutual agreement between the heirsYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Dear client,Addressing Your Pagdi Tenancy ConcernsEligibility for a Unit During RedevelopmentEven though you don’t have a Pagdi tenancy agreement under your name, you may still be eligible for a unit during redevelopment. The key factors are:Proof of Tenancy:You have been paying rent and have a historical agreement between your grandmother and the landlord’s mother. This can serve as proof of your tenancy.Society Membership:Since the building has formed a cooperative society, you should ensure that your tenancy is recognized by the society. This can strengthen your claim during redevelopment.Legal Heir:As the legal heir, you have the right to inherit the tenancy. You may need to provide documentation proving your status as the legal heir.Buying the Unit from the LandlordIf the landlord agrees, you can negotiate to buy the unit based on the current market valuation. Here are the steps:Valuation:Get the property valued by a certified valuer to determine the current market price.Negotiation:Offer to pay 33% of the market value, as per the common practice in Pagdi tenancies. Ensure that this agreement is documented and legally binding.Legal Agreement:Draft a sale agreement with the help of a lawyer to formalize the transaction and protect your interests.Depositing Rent in CourtDepositing rent in court can be a strategic move to demonstrate your willingness to pay rent and maintain your tenancy rights. However, there are some considerations:Court Deposit:You can file an application in the local Rent Control Court to deposit the rent. This shows that you are fulfilling your obligations as a tenant.Legal Protection:By depositing rent in court, you protect yourself from eviction claims based on non-payment of rent.Builder’s Involvement:If the landlord tries to return the money and ask you to vacate, you can contest this in court. The court will consider your long-term tenancy and the fact that you have been paying rent.Practical StepsConsult a Lawyer:Engage a lawyer who specializes in tenancy and property laws. They can guide you through the process and help you draft necessary legal documents.Document Everything:Keep records of all rent payments, communications with the landlord, and any other relevant documents. This will be crucial in case of legal disputes.Communicate with the Society:Ensure that the cooperative society recognizes your tenancy. Attend society meetings and keep them informed about your situation.Public Notice:If you decide to buy the unit, consider publishing a public notice to inform any potential claimants and avoid future disputes.Thank you.

Hence, no offence committed by the panchayat president to invite the charge sheeted person2. It not also insult our national flag . Mostly politician having many criminal cases against him , and we prefer to invite him , and hence to honor an ex-army man is not an insult due to his involvement in criminal cases.- The collector cannot suspend the president only on the ground of invitation to a person who has criminal cases against him , and not convicted for the offence till the day of invitation.3.

    "question": "Bike sold to an agent who sells it without ownership transfer a year ago",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard.Firstly, you need to understand the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in this regard.Supreme Court in the case ofNaveen Kumarv.Vijay Kumar, (2018)held that:Firstly, let us see what is the definition of owner in the Motor Vehicles Act. Section 2(30) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, definesowner(of a vehicle) as under:“(30) “owner” means a person in whose name a motor vehicle stands registered, and where such person is a minor, the guardian of such minor, and in relation to a motor vehicle which is the subject of a hire-purchase, agreement, or an agreement of lease or an agreement of hypothecation, the person in possession of the vehicle under that agreement;”Interpreting this clause, the Supreme Court observed that the person in whose name a motor vehicle stands registered is the owner of the vehicle for the purposes of the Act. The use of the expression “means” is a clear indication of the position that it is the registered owner whom Parliament has regarded as the owner of the vehicle.The Court referred to the earlier Motor Vehicles Act of 1939, wherein the expression “owner” was defined in Section 2(19) as follows:“(19)“owner” means, where the person in possession of a motor vehicle is a minor, the guardian of such minor, and in relation to a motor vehicle which is the subject of a hire-purchase agreement, the person in possession of the vehicle under that agreement.”The Supreme Court held that the Parliament while enacting the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 made a specific change by recasting the earlier definition. Section 2(19) of the earlier Act stipulated that where a person in possession of a motor vehicle is a minor, the guardian of the minor would be the owner and where the motor vehicle was subject to a hire-purchase agreement, the person in possession of the vehicle under the agreement would be the owner. The Court observed:“The 1988 Act has provided in the first part of Section 2(30) that the owner would be the person in whose name the motor vehicle stands registered. Where such a person is a minor the guardian of the minor would be the owner. In relation to a motor vehicle which is the subject of an agreement of hire purchase, lease or hypothecation, the person in possession of the vehicle under that agreement would be the owner. The latter part of the definition is in the nature of an exception which applies where the motor vehicle is the subject of a hire-purchase agreement or of an agreement of lease or hypothecation. Otherwise the definition stipulates that for the purposes of the Act, the person in whose name the motor vehicle stands registered is treated as the owner.”The Court took note of Section 50 of the Act which deals with transfer of ownership of a vehicle, and also referred to various previous judgments, in particular, the following cases, which were affirmed:Pushpav.Shakuntala, (2011) 2 SCC 240;T.V. Josev.Chacko P.M., (2001) 8 SCC 748;P.P. Mohammedv.K. Rajappan, (2008) 17 SCC 624.After considering all these aspects, the Supreme Court held:“…in view of the definition of the expression “owner” in Section 2(30), it is the person in whose name the motor vehicle stands registered who, for the purposes of the Act, would be treated as the “owner”. However, where a person is a minor, the guardian of the minor would be treated as the owner. Where a motor vehicle is subject to an agreement of hire purchase, lease or hypothecation, the person in possession of the vehicle under that agreement is treated as the owner. In a situation … where the registered owner has purported to transfer the vehicle but continues to be reflected in the records of the Registering Authority as the owner of the vehicle, he would not stand absolved of liability. Parliament has consciously introduced the definition of the expression “owner” in Section 2(30), making a departure from the provisions of Section 2(19) in the earlier 1939 Act. The principle underlying the provisions of Section 2(30) is that the victim of a motor accident or, in the case of a death, the legal heirs of the deceased victim should not be left in a state of uncertainty. A claimant for compensation ought not to be burdened with following a trail of successive transfers, which are not registered with the Registering Authority. To hold otherwise would be to defeat the salutary object and purpose of the Act. Hence, the interpretation to be placed must facilitate the fulfilment of the object of the law.”Thus, it was clearly held by the Supreme Court that a person continues to be owner of the vehicle, even if he has sold his vehicle to another person, if the transfer of the vehicle is not reflected in the RTO records and if the vehicle continues to be in the name of the original owner despite the sale of vehicle. Accordingly, such original owner would continue to be liable for compensation, if any, to be paid by the owner for any accident, despite he having sold the vehicle.It is therefore in the interest of those who sell their vehicles, to get the vehicles transferred in the name of the buyer by following the procedure laid down for transfer of vehicles, particularly in Section 50 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.Therefore, as per the facts you mentioned you can report the matter to the nearest police station of your area in West Bengal and also the Regional Transport Office. Also, you can issue the legal notice through Advocate in this regard to the concerned person so as to safeguard yourself.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "answer": "Fit out possession is basicallya possession given to the owner which still has legal or some civil work left.If the builder is offering you soft possession, which means thatyou can take possession of the flat, but legal ownership has not yet been transferred to you.Typically, a possession letter indicates when a building was completed or that the property is yours. It does not legally verify that you are the rightful owner. On the other hand,an occupancy certificate indicates the completion of the design, as it states the structure is ready for occupancy.You have nothing to do with the dispute between the builder and the land owner.If the OC is obtained and if you feel that this dispute will not be solved in the near future, you may better take possession with an assurance for transfer of title by a registered sale deed is executed within a time stipulated in the undertaking by the builder.After that you can file a suit for specific performance of contract seeking court direction to the builder to execute the registered sale deed.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "1. you are the legal heir of the original deceased tenant. so you are entitled. no new agreement is required. the legal heirs of the deceased tenant become the joint tenants by operation of law. It does not matter that the rent receipt is still issued in the name of your grandmother who was the original tenant2. there is no need to pay any money to the landlord's son. however if you want the rent receipt to be issued in your sole name, then you can take noc from other heirs and submit that to the landlord and request him to transfer the rent bill in your name, however for that you dont have to pay full 33% since the heirs get tenancy rights by operation of law and there is no transfer of tenancy to a third party as such. in case you wish to buy the remaining rights of the landlord in the unit then for that he may demand the market value of the unit, since by transferring the remaining rights in the unit, you would become the owner of the unit.3. what rubbish! just continue to pay the rent to the heir of the deceased landlord and take proper rent receipts from him. If he is not accepting the rent then do a money order in his favour or make an application to the small causes court to deposit the rent in court since the landlord refuses to accept the rent from you. the builder as and when appointed has to recognise the heirs of the deceased tenant and the new rehab unit will be allotted to them only or to any one of them as per the mutual agreement between the heirsYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Dear client,Addressing Your Pagdi Tenancy ConcernsEligibility for a Unit During RedevelopmentEven though you don’t have a Pagdi tenancy agreement under your name, you may still be eligible for a unit during redevelopment. The key factors are:Proof of Tenancy:You have been paying rent and have a historical agreement between your grandmother and the landlord’s mother. This can serve as proof of your tenancy.Society Membership:Since the building has formed a cooperative society, you should ensure that your tenancy is recognized by the society. This can strengthen your claim during redevelopment.Legal Heir:As the legal heir, you have the right to inherit the tenancy. You may need to provide documentation proving your status as the legal heir.Buying the Unit from the LandlordIf the landlord agrees, you can negotiate to buy the unit based on the current market valuation. Here are the steps:Valuation:Get the property valued by a certified valuer to determine the current market price.Negotiation:Offer to pay 33% of the market value, as per the common practice in Pagdi tenancies. Ensure that this agreement is documented and legally binding.Legal Agreement:Draft a sale agreement with the help of a lawyer to formalize the transaction and protect your interests.Depositing Rent in CourtDepositing rent in court can be a strategic move to demonstrate your willingness to pay rent and maintain your tenancy rights. However, there are some considerations:Court Deposit:You can file an application in the local Rent Control Court to deposit the rent. This shows that you are fulfilling your obligations as a tenant.Legal Protection:By depositing rent in court, you protect yourself from eviction claims based on non-payment of rent.Builder’s Involvement:If the landlord tries to return the money and ask you to vacate, you can contest this in court. The court will consider your long-term tenancy and the fact that you have been paying rent.Practical StepsConsult a Lawyer:Engage a lawyer who specializes in tenancy and property laws. They can guide you through the process and help you draft necessary legal documents.Document Everything:Keep records of all rent payments, communications with the landlord, and any other relevant documents. This will be crucial in case of legal disputes.Communicate with the Society:Ensure that the cooperative society recognizes your tenancy. Attend society meetings and keep them informed about your situation.Public Notice:If you decide to buy the unit, consider publishing a public notice to inform any potential claimants and avoid future disputes.Thank you.

However, initiating any major new work requires approval of majority out of all the members at the AGM. Any such work initiated without such approval is blatantly illegal.The office bearers though honorary are legally bound to respond to any queries by any member, if called during reasonable hours. The society office needs to have some working hours where any member can seek queries. Providing inspection of financial records & copies if demanded, at the cost of the member too is obligatory. However, the MC or any of the office bearers of a housing society aren't subject to RTI.No member whatsoever, be it ground floor or any other floor, can be denied voting rights on any issue whatsoever. Such denial is blatant illegality.By whatever is explained in 1,2 & 3, it should be clear to you that many irregularities and illegalities are going on in your society. You must seek legal remedies. You can either move the cooperative court or consumer forum. Which forum would be most suitable can best be adviced to you, only after exhaustive consultation session with you.I extend by legal services not just for such consultation, but also to take up your litigation to it's logical conclusion.You need to visit me for such consultation.९८२०८९७८८४ (nine eight two zero eight nine seven eight eight four)Netra Mohanchandra PantAdvocate, Navi Mumbai1591 Answers5 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Netra Mohanchandra Pant"

    "question": "Owner has asked me to vacate flat before the agreement period",
    "answer": "In this situation, you have a registered Leave and License agreement with the owner for a period of 33 months. The rights and obligations of both parties are governed by the terms mentioned in the agreement. Firstly, it is important to note that the owner cannot unilaterally ask you to vacate the premises before the expiry of the agreement unless there is a specific provision in the agreement allowing for early termination under certain circumstances. Generally, the agreement will lay down the procedure for termination and the notice period required. If the owner has not served you with a written notice to vacate the premises, her oral communication or phone conversation does not hold legal value. A written notice is typically required as evidence of termination. In case the owner has given you a reason for asking you to vacate the premises (e.g., the complaint about AC leakage), you have the right to rectify the issue within a reasonable period of time, as stated in the agreement. If the owner insists on asking you to vacate the property without following the legal procedure mentioned in the agreement, you have the right to challenge her eviction. You can approach the concerned Rent Control Authority or Civil Court having jurisdiction over the area where the property is located. The applicable Act for the jurisdiction of the Rent Control Authority or Civil Court will depend on the state in which the property is situated. Regarding the issue of the rent increase, unless there is a specific clause in the agreement allowing for periodic rent hikes, the owner cannot unilaterally demand an increase in rent during the term of the agreement. If you have been paying the rent as per the agreed terms and conditions, you are not obligated to pay the increased rent.Sukumar JadhavAdvocate, Mumbai35 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sukumar Jadhav"

    "question": "Owner has asked me to vacate flat before the agreement period",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You have the right to remain on the premises until the current rental agreement expires, and no one can force you out before then. If the situation becomes more intense, you have the option to take legal action by filing a permanent injunction against the other party. This legal measure would prevent them from attempting to evict you without following the proper legal procedures. Such a lawsuit could extend over several years, giving you time to find alternative rental accommodations. During this legal process, they would not be able to increase your rent. Even if you fall behind on monthly rent payments, they can only approach the court to request payment while the injunction case is ongoing, which itself could take around six months or more. In the meantime, you can explore new rental options. It's important to note that they cannot evict you without providing the one-month notice period stipulated in the rental agreement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Owner has asked me to vacate flat before the agreement period",
    "answer": "In this situation, you have a registered Leave and License agreement with the owner for a period of 33 months. The rights and obligations of both parties are governed by the terms mentioned in the agreement. Firstly, it is important to note that the owner cannot unilaterally ask you to vacate the premises before the expiry of the agreement unless there is a specific provision in the agreement allowing for early termination under certain circumstances. Generally, the agreement will lay down the procedure for termination and the notice period required. If the owner has not served you with a written notice to vacate the premises, her oral communication or phone conversation does not hold legal value. A written notice is typically required as evidence of termination. In case the owner has given you a reason for asking you to vacate the premises (e.g., the complaint about AC leakage), you have the right to rectify the issue within a reasonable period of time, as stated in the agreement. If the owner insists on asking you to vacate the property without following the legal procedure mentioned in the agreement, you have the right to challenge her eviction. You can approach the concerned Rent Control Authority or Civil Court having jurisdiction over the area where the property is located. The applicable Act for the jurisdiction of the Rent Control Authority or Civil Court will depend on the state in which the property is situated. Regarding the issue of the rent increase, unless there is a specific clause in the agreement allowing for periodic rent hikes, the owner cannot unilaterally demand an increase in rent during the term of the agreement. If you have been paying the rent as per the agreed terms and conditions, you are not obligated to pay the increased rent.Sukumar JadhavAdvocate, Mumbai35 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sukumar Jadhav"

    "question": "Owner has asked me to vacate flat before the agreement period",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You have the right to remain on the premises until the current rental agreement expires, and no one can force you out before then. If the situation becomes more intense, you have the option to take legal action by filing a permanent injunction against the other party. This legal measure would prevent them from attempting to evict you without following the proper legal procedures. Such a lawsuit could extend over several years, giving you time to find alternative rental accommodations. During this legal process, they would not be able to increase your rent. Even if you fall behind on monthly rent payments, they can only approach the court to request payment while the injunction case is ongoing, which itself could take around six months or more. In the meantime, you can explore new rental options. It's important to note that they cannot evict you without providing the one-month notice period stipulated in the rental agreement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This typically involves taking steps to ensure that the terms of the compromise decree are carried out.Since there is a compromise decree for 10 acres and you are in possession of 9 acres, it's advisable to follow the terms of the decree. If there are specific instructions or terms related to the division of land, you should adhere to those terms.If the compromise decree specifies that you are entitled to 10 acres and the judgment debtor (the other party) holds the remaining 1 acre, you would generally not need to file a separate sale deed for the 1 acre. The terms of the compromise decree should guide the transfer of ownership.Recovery of 1 Acre as per Court Compromise Decree:If the compromise decree specifies that you are entitled to a total of 10 acres, and the judgment debtor has received compensation for the land acquired by the government (1 acre), you might need to enforce the decree through the execution process.The execution process involves the court's assistance in ensuring that the judgment debtor complies with the terms of the compromise decree.

    "question": "Owner has asked me to vacate flat before the agreement period",
    "answer": "In this situation, you have a registered Leave and License agreement with the owner for a period of 33 months. The rights and obligations of both parties are governed by the terms mentioned in the agreement. Firstly, it is important to note that the owner cannot unilaterally ask you to vacate the premises before the expiry of the agreement unless there is a specific provision in the agreement allowing for early termination under certain circumstances. Generally, the agreement will lay down the procedure for termination and the notice period required. If the owner has not served you with a written notice to vacate the premises, her oral communication or phone conversation does not hold legal value. A written notice is typically required as evidence of termination. In case the owner has given you a reason for asking you to vacate the premises (e.g., the complaint about AC leakage), you have the right to rectify the issue within a reasonable period of time, as stated in the agreement. If the owner insists on asking you to vacate the property without following the legal procedure mentioned in the agreement, you have the right to challenge her eviction. You can approach the concerned Rent Control Authority or Civil Court having jurisdiction over the area where the property is located. The applicable Act for the jurisdiction of the Rent Control Authority or Civil Court will depend on the state in which the property is situated. Regarding the issue of the rent increase, unless there is a specific clause in the agreement allowing for periodic rent hikes, the owner cannot unilaterally demand an increase in rent during the term of the agreement. If you have been paying the rent as per the agreed terms and conditions, you are not obligated to pay the increased rent.Sukumar JadhavAdvocate, Mumbai35 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sukumar Jadhav"

    "answer": "Dear Client,You have the right to remain on the premises until the current rental agreement expires, and no one can force you out before then. If the situation becomes more intense, you have the option to take legal action by filing a permanent injunction against the other party. This legal measure would prevent them from attempting to evict you without following the proper legal procedures. Such a lawsuit could extend over several years, giving you time to find alternative rental accommodations. During this legal process, they would not be able to increase your rent. Even if you fall behind on monthly rent payments, they can only approach the court to request payment while the injunction case is ongoing, which itself could take around six months or more. In the meantime, you can explore new rental options.

    "answer": "First, obtain copies of all the documents deposited with the bank from the seller, engage a competent lawyer, ask him/her to scrutinise the vendor's title, and obtain his/her clearance in writing. Request the bank to let your lawyer see the documents, at a mutually convenient date. Obtain an undertaking in writing from the bank they shall release all the documents to you directly, immediately upon your clearing the seller's dues. Ask the bank to lift the encumbrance in the land registry's records immediately thereafter.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Due Diligence:Before proceeding with any transaction, it's crucial to conduct thorough due diligence on the property. This includes verifying the ownership, checking the status of the mortgage, and ensuring that the seller has the legal authority to sell the property.Loan Closure and NOC:If you're planning to close the loan on behalf of the seller, you should ensure that the loan is indeed closed properly and all necessary documentation is obtained, including a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the bank. The NOC indicates that the property is free from the mortgage and that the bank has no objection to the sale.Risk Management:Proceeding without a registered sale agreement could expose you to risks, as the terms and conditions of the sale might not be clearly established in a legally binding manner.

The society office needs to have some working hours where any member can seek queries. Providing inspection of financial records & copies if demanded, at the cost of the member too is obligatory. However, the MC or any of the office bearers of a housing society aren't subject to RTI.No member whatsoever, be it ground floor or any other floor, can be denied voting rights on any issue whatsoever. Such denial is blatant illegality.By whatever is explained in 1,2 & 3, it should be clear to you that many irregularities and illegalities are going on in your society. You must seek legal remedies.

    "answer": "Dear Client,The purpose and object of Section 125 Cr.P.C. is to provide immediate relief to an applicant. An application under Section 125 Cr.P.C. is predicated on two conditions :the husband has sufficient means; and“neglects” to maintain his wife, who is unable to maintain herself.Under the third proviso to the amended Section 125, the application for grant of interim maintenance must be disposed of as far as possible within sixty days’ from the date of service of notice on the respondent.“While there is a tendency on the part of the wife to exaggerate her needs, there is a corresponding tendency by the husband to conceal his actual income.”If men cannot support themselves financially, they can claim maintenance from their wives who are financially well-off and earning more than them. This can be done under Section 24 of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, which mentions both husbands and wives as liable to making such a claim.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Sale Deed for Execution in E.P.:In an execution petition (E.P.), you are seeking enforcement of a court decree. This typically involves taking steps to ensure that the terms of the compromise decree are carried out.Since there is a compromise decree for 10 acres and you are in possession of 9 acres, it's advisable to follow the terms of the decree. If there are specific instructions or terms related to the division of land, you should adhere to those terms.If the compromise decree specifies that you are entitled to 10 acres and the judgment debtor (the other party) holds the remaining 1 acre, you would generally not need to file a separate sale deed for the 1 acre. The terms of the compromise decree should guide the transfer of ownership.Recovery of 1 Acre as per Court Compromise Decree:If the compromise decree specifies that you are entitled to a total of 10 acres, and the judgment debtor has received compensation for the land acquired by the government (1 acre), you might need to enforce the decree through the execution process.The execution process involves the court's assistance in ensuring that the judgment debtor complies with the terms of the compromise decree.

However, initiating any major new work requires approval of majority out of all the members at the AGM. Any such work initiated without such approval is blatantly illegal.The office bearers though honorary are legally bound to respond to any queries by any member, if called during reasonable hours. The society office needs to have some working hours where any member can seek queries. Providing inspection of financial records & copies if demanded, at the cost of the member too is obligatory. However, the MC or any of the office bearers of a housing society aren't subject to RTI.No member whatsoever, be it ground floor or any other floor, can be denied voting rights on any issue whatsoever. Such denial is blatant illegality.By whatever is explained in 1,2 & 3, it should be clear to you that many irregularities and illegalities are going on in your society. You must seek legal remedies. You can either move the cooperative court or consumer forum. Which forum would be most suitable can best be adviced to you, only after exhaustive consultation session with you.I extend by legal services not just for such consultation, but also to take up your litigation to it's logical conclusion.You need to visit me for such consultation.९८२०८९७८८४ (nine eight two zero eight nine seven eight eight four)Netra Mohanchandra PantAdvocate, Navi Mumbai1591 Answers5 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Netra Mohanchandra Pant"

An application under Section 125 Cr.P.C. is predicated on two conditions :the husband has sufficient means; and“neglects” to maintain his wife, who is unable to maintain herself.Under the third proviso to the amended Section 125, the application for grant of interim maintenance must be disposed of as far as possible within sixty days’ from the date of service of notice on the respondent.“While there is a tendency on the part of the wife to exaggerate her needs, there is a corresponding tendency by the husband to conceal his actual income.”If men cannot support themselves financially, they can claim maintenance from their wives who are financially well-off and earning more than them. This can be done under Section 24 of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, which mentions both husbands and wives as liable to making such a claim.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The society office needs to have some working hours where any member can seek queries. Providing inspection of financial records & copies if demanded, at the cost of the member too is obligatory. However, the MC or any of the office bearers of a housing society aren't subject to RTI.No member whatsoever, be it ground floor or any other floor, can be denied voting rights on any issue whatsoever. Such denial is blatant illegality.By whatever is explained in 1,2 & 3, it should be clear to you that many irregularities and illegalities are going on in your society. You must seek legal remedies.

However, initiating any major new work requires approval of majority out of all the members at the AGM. Any such work initiated without such approval is blatantly illegal.The office bearers though honorary are legally bound to respond to any queries by any member, if called during reasonable hours. The society office needs to have some working hours where any member can seek queries. Providing inspection of financial records & copies if demanded, at the cost of the member too is obligatory. However, the MC or any of the office bearers of a housing society aren't subject to RTI.No member whatsoever, be it ground floor or any other floor, can be denied voting rights on any issue whatsoever. Such denial is blatant illegality.By whatever is explained in 1,2 & 3, it should be clear to you that many irregularities and illegalities are going on in your society. You must seek legal remedies. You can either move the cooperative court or consumer forum. Which forum would be most suitable can best be adviced to you, only after exhaustive consultation session with you.I extend by legal services not just for such consultation, but also to take up your litigation to it's logical conclusion.You need to visit me for such consultation.९८२०८९७८८४ (nine eight two zero eight nine seven eight eight four)Netra Mohanchandra PantAdvocate, Navi Mumbai1591 Answers5 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Netra Mohanchandra Pant"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The purpose and object of Section 125 Cr.P.C. is to provide immediate relief to an applicant. An application under Section 125 Cr.P.C. is predicated on two conditions :the husband has sufficient means; and“neglects” to maintain his wife, who is unable to maintain herself.Under the third proviso to the amended Section 125, the application for grant of interim maintenance must be disposed of as far as possible within sixty days’ from the date of service of notice on the respondent.“While there is a tendency on the part of the wife to exaggerate her needs, there is a corresponding tendency by the husband to conceal his actual income.”If men cannot support themselves financially, they can claim maintenance from their wives who are financially well-off and earning more than them. This can be done under Section 24 of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, which mentions both husbands and wives as liable to making such a claim.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "If you challenge the relinquishment then the land in excess of ceiling limit for which the relinquishment was done, may have to be surrendered to governmentThe excess land was to be given to government. Instead it was transferred to bring it out of the purview of being in excess of ceiling limitSo this may go against you as then the land area will reduceEssentially the relinquishment can be taken as a partitionThe share received by a coparcenor on partition of ancestral property is also ancestral property in the hands of such coparcenor as regards his male issueSo the share which your father got became an ancestral property in his hands in which his sons would acquire right on birth, whether such son was present on date of partition or born subsequentlyMeaning if the coparcenor who received a share on partition had no son on date of receipt of the share, then the share will be considered as his own property but the exclusive ownership gets extinct when subsequently a son is born. Thus upon birth of the son and now even daughters, they become entitled to such property as coparcenor membersBut if the coparcenor sells the share at the time when a male issue was not born to him, then such a sale is validSo the sale made by your father is not valid as it was sale of ancestral property only provided you were already in existence at time of saleIf at time of sale you were not born, then you cannot object the alienation done by your father of his share of coparcenary property which he received on partitionSee Supreme Court judgment in CK Prasad v CIT BangaloreYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

Your brother's legal heirs will not have any claim to the property.The legal precedence in support of this view is the case of Ram Gopal v. State of Punjab, (1974) 1 SCC 381. In this case, the Supreme Court held that the beneficial ownership of a property will pass to the legal heirs of the person who paid for the property, even if the property was allotted in the name of another person.The following additional documents may also be helpful in proving that your father paid for the property:Bank statements showing the transfer of funds from your father's account to the HUDA accountLetter from the HUDA authorities acknowledging receipt of the payment from your fatherWitness statements from people who were present when your father paid for the propertyAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Any transfer in excess of 12.5% is invalid in absence of release deeds from the children in mother's favour5. so now the children will have to register release deeds in mother's favour to transfer their shares to the mother and thereby make the mother the full owner of the flat6. the release deed attracts a duty of Rs. 200/- only + registration fee + registration agent charges + lawyer's drafting fee7. in order to complete the title an heirship certificate should also be obtained so that there is no difficulty while selling the flat in future8. application for grant of heirship certificate has to be made to the Bombay High Court and not to the tehsildar, in case the flat is situate in a place which comes within the jurisdiction of the High Court9. release deed + heirship certificate both will be needed to complete the flow of title.

    "question": "Make nominee absolute owner of deceased property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The notion that a nominee is the rightful owner of a property is legally inaccurate. According to the law, a nominee serves as a recipient of the property but is obligated to equitably distribute it among all the legal heirs of the deceased. Therefore, asserting that your mother is the sole owner of the property is factually incorrect and contradicts legal principles. In adherence to Islamic law, a female Muslim heir is entitled to a 50% share, which is half of what a male Muslim successor would inherit.To ensure proper legal procedures, it is crucial to execute a well-registered release deed and to obtain a succession certificate through the court. These steps are necessary to facilitate the official transfer of the property into the mother's name. The concept of a gift deed does not apply in this scenario, as the recorded owners of the property are the legal heirs themselves. By following these steps meticulously, the rightful distribution and ownership of the property can be appropriately established.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Disconnection of electricity",
    "answer": "Dear Client,If the local police are not adequately addressing the situation where the society secretary has disconnected the electric supply, there are steps you can take to address the issue. Initially, you can draft a written complaint to the police detailing the incident and its significance. If the local authorities fail to respond appropriately, you have the option to escalate the matter to higher-ranking police officials for their intervention.Furthermore, you can consider initiating legal actions to safeguard your rights. One possible approach is to file a suit for injunction against the landlord, seeking to prevent them from using unauthorized methods, such as cutting off essential services, to force eviction. This legal action also aims to restrain the landlord from engaging in such activities that violate established legal procedures.It's crucial to note that essential services and basic amenities, regardless of any reasons cited, should not be disconnected by the society. Therefore, in your written complaint to the police, make sure to include all relevant parties, such as the landlord and society members responsible for the disconnection. This comprehensive complaint serves as a fundamental step to put an end to this wrongful practice.In the event that the police exhibit reluctance in taking appropriate action, you have two viable options. You can either approach higher-ranking police authorities for intervention, or alternatively, submit a petition under section 156(3) of theCriminal Procedure Codeto the jurisdictional judicial magistrate court. This petition requests the court to direct the police to initiate actions against those accountable for the offense described in your complaint.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The society will have to be roped in for this arrangement otherwise it shouldn't happen that it raises its hands for the costs once the seepage source is found to be a common area issueIn the event the source is not found then the below flat owner can also file a police complaint for nuisance and annoyanceSo in order to avoid all that drama plz go for thermography by splitting the costs 50:50Another advantage of thermography is that you would not be breaking the wrong portion of your flat.

    "answer": "Dear Client,It is difficult to say for sure whether the society can force you to carry out civil work without proof, without knowing more about the specific bylaws of your society. However, in general, a society cannot force a resident to carry out major civil work without proof that the resident is at fault for the damage. In your case, the society has only provided you with verbal confirmation from their team of workers that the seepage is coming from your home. This is not enough proof to require you to carry out major civil work.You have the right to ask for a proper inspection report from either the society or a third party agency before any kind of civil work is commissioned by you in your unit. The inspection report should be conducted by a qualified professional who can identify the source of the seepage and determine whether you are at fault.If the inspection report finds that the seepage is not coming from your home, then society cannot force you to carry out civil work. However, if the inspection report finds that you are at fault, then the society may be able to enforce its bylaws to require you to carry out the necessary repairs.It is important to note that the bylaws of each society are different, so it is important to consult with an attorney to understand the specific bylaws of your society and your rights as a resident.In addition to the legal considerations, you may also want to consider the practical implications of carrying out major civil work in your home. Major civil work can be disruptive and expensive, and it is important to make sure that it is necessary before you proceed. If the seepage is not coming from your home, then there is no point in carrying out civil work in your unit.Whether you have to bear 100% of the cost of the inspection or if you can legally ask your downstairs neighbor to bear 50% of the cost depends on the specific circumstances of your case. In general, if the seepage is coming from your home, then you will be responsible for the full cost of the inspection and repairs. However, if the seepage is coming from the common areas of the building or from the downstairs neighbor's unit, then you may be able to recover some or all of the cost of the inspection from the other party.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Alternatively, the LOC can be revoked if you are acquitted of the charges or if the First Information Report (FIR) is invalidated. If your name is implicated in a case, it is essential to secure anticipatory bail, surrender either in court or to the police, and subsequently obtain bail. It's important to note that being in hiding doesn't inherently imply guilt.

    "answer": "1. it is not clear from your query as to how many children there are2. the mother was entitled to 12.5% share in the flat after demise of the father and the balance 87.5% would go to the children in such a way that sons would take double share as that of the daughter3. by the gift deed the mother has sought to transfer the entire flat when she was entitled to only 12.5% share in it4. so the gift deed is valid only to the extent of the mother's 12.5 %. Any transfer in excess of 12.5% is invalid in absence of release deeds from the children in mother's favour5. so now the children will have to register release deeds in mother's favour to transfer their shares to the mother and thereby make the mother the full owner of the flat6. the release deed attracts a duty of Rs. 200/- only + registration fee + registration agent charges + lawyer's drafting fee7. in order to complete the title an heirship certificate should also be obtained so that there is no difficulty while selling the flat in future8. application for grant of heirship certificate has to be made to the Bombay High Court and not to the tehsildar, in case the flat is situate in a place which comes within the jurisdiction of the High Court9. release deed + heirship certificate both will be needed to complete the flow of title.

    "context": "Asked 2 years ago in Property Law Religion: Muslim",
    "question": "Make nominee absolute owner of deceased property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The notion that a nominee is the rightful owner of a property is legally inaccurate. According to the law, a nominee serves as a recipient of the property but is obligated to equitably distribute it among all the legal heirs of the deceased. Therefore, asserting that your mother is the sole owner of the property is factually incorrect and contradicts legal principles. In adherence to Islamic law, a female Muslim heir is entitled to a 50% share, which is half of what a male Muslim successor would inherit.To ensure proper legal procedures, it is crucial to execute a well-registered release deed and to obtain a succession certificate through the court. These steps are necessary to facilitate the official transfer of the property into the mother's name. The concept of a gift deed does not apply in this scenario, as the recorded owners of the property are the legal heirs themselves. By following these steps meticulously, the rightful distribution and ownership of the property can be appropriately established.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

You mentioned that the vendor returned a part of the advance payment in cash because the material was not delivered as per your instruction. This situation might not strictly fall under the definition of loans or deposits as intended by Section 269SS.Loan or deposit generally implies a lending or depositing of money for a certain period with an expectation of repayment with or without interest. In your case, the vendor is returning a portion of the advance payment that was intended for raw materials, and it seems more like a refund or adjustment due to the non-delivery of goods rather than a loan or deposit.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Disconnection of electricity",
    "answer": "Dear Client,If the local police are not adequately addressing the situation where the society secretary has disconnected the electric supply, there are steps you can take to address the issue. Initially, you can draft a written complaint to the police detailing the incident and its significance. If the local authorities fail to respond appropriately, you have the option to escalate the matter to higher-ranking police officials for their intervention.Furthermore, you can consider initiating legal actions to safeguard your rights. One possible approach is to file a suit for injunction against the landlord, seeking to prevent them from using unauthorized methods, such as cutting off essential services, to force eviction. This legal action also aims to restrain the landlord from engaging in such activities that violate established legal procedures.It's crucial to note that essential services and basic amenities, regardless of any reasons cited, should not be disconnected by the society. Therefore, in your written complaint to the police, make sure to include all relevant parties, such as the landlord and society members responsible for the disconnection. This comprehensive complaint serves as a fundamental step to put an end to this wrongful practice.In the event that the police exhibit reluctance in taking appropriate action, you have two viable options. You can either approach higher-ranking police authorities for intervention, or alternatively, submit a petition under section 156(3) of theCriminal Procedure Codeto the jurisdictional judicial magistrate court. This petition requests the court to direct the police to initiate actions against those accountable for the offense described in your complaint.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "1. it is not clear from your query as to how many children there are2. the mother was entitled to 12.5% share in the flat after demise of the father and the balance 87.5% would go to the children in such a way that sons would take double share as that of the daughter3. by the gift deed the mother has sought to transfer the entire flat when she was entitled to only 12.5% share in it4. so the gift deed is valid only to the extent of the mother's 12.5 %. Any transfer in excess of 12.5% is invalid in absence of release deeds from the children in mother's favour5. so now the children will have to register release deeds in mother's favour to transfer their shares to the mother and thereby make the mother the full owner of the flat6. the release deed attracts a duty of Rs. 200/- only + registration fee + registration agent charges + lawyer's drafting fee7. in order to complete the title an heirship certificate should also be obtained so that there is no difficulty while selling the flat in future8. application for grant of heirship certificate has to be made to the Bombay High Court and not to the tehsildar, in case the flat is situate in a place which comes within the jurisdiction of the High Court9. release deed + heirship certificate both will be needed to complete the flow of title.

    "answer": "Dear Client,The notion that a nominee is the rightful owner of a property is legally inaccurate. According to the law, a nominee serves as a recipient of the property but is obligated to equitably distribute it among all the legal heirs of the deceased. Therefore, asserting that your mother is the sole owner of the property is factually incorrect and contradicts legal principles. In adherence to Islamic law, a female Muslim heir is entitled to a 50% share, which is half of what a male Muslim successor would inherit.To ensure proper legal procedures, it is crucial to execute a well-registered release deed and to obtain a succession certificate through the court. These steps are necessary to facilitate the official transfer of the property into the mother's name. The concept of a gift deed does not apply in this scenario, as the recorded owners of the property are the legal heirs themselves.

    "question": "Disconnection of electricity",
    "answer": "Dear Client,If the local police are not adequately addressing the situation where the society secretary has disconnected the electric supply, there are steps you can take to address the issue. Initially, you can draft a written complaint to the police detailing the incident and its significance. If the local authorities fail to respond appropriately, you have the option to escalate the matter to higher-ranking police officials for their intervention.Furthermore, you can consider initiating legal actions to safeguard your rights. One possible approach is to file a suit for injunction against the landlord, seeking to prevent them from using unauthorized methods, such as cutting off essential services, to force eviction. This legal action also aims to restrain the landlord from engaging in such activities that violate established legal procedures.It's crucial to note that essential services and basic amenities, regardless of any reasons cited, should not be disconnected by the society. Therefore, in your written complaint to the police, make sure to include all relevant parties, such as the landlord and society members responsible for the disconnection. This comprehensive complaint serves as a fundamental step to put an end to this wrongful practice.In the event that the police exhibit reluctance in taking appropriate action, you have two viable options. You can either approach higher-ranking police authorities for intervention, or alternatively, submit a petition under section 156(3) of theCriminal Procedure Codeto the jurisdictional judicial magistrate court. This petition requests the court to direct the police to initiate actions against those accountable for the offense described in your complaint.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Given your father's joint ownership status according to the registered sale deed, there are two options available. He can either co-sign the sale deed with you to facilitate the property's transfer to the potential buyer, or he can formally release his ownership rights through a registered release deed. This would enable you to proceed with the property's purchase. If he chooses to co-sign the sale deed with you, there's an added benefit. He can also invest in the same property you intend to purchase, allowing him to claim a long-term capital gains tax exemption over time.Your interpretation is accurate in this regard; the situation would indeed qualify as a case of long-term capital gains (LTCG).Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "It's very difficult to find the source of leakage or seepageEven plumbers may not be able find the sourceAnd so the ordeal and bitterness will continue till the time the seepage stopsThe seepage will have to be traced using thermal images or thermographyThat doesn't come cheapAs the source of seepage is not known it would be prudent that both flat owners bear 50:50 nowThe cost that would add up calling for multiple plumbers & technicians would be covered by just one visit by the team who would perform the thermal scanning to trace the seepage sourceIf the seepage is not happening from your flat then you can claim the 50% cost from the society. The society will have to be roped in for this arrangement otherwise it shouldn't happen that it raises its hands for the costs once the seepage source is found to be a common area issueIn the event the source is not found then the below flat owner can also file a police complaint for nuisance and annoyanceSo in order to avoid all that drama plz go for thermography by splitting the costs 50:50Another advantage of thermography is that you would not be breaking the wrong portion of your flat. Many a times plumbers claim that the seepage is from a particular point whereas the seepage occurs altogether from another point.

    "question": "Can the society blame me for down floor seepage without solid proof",
    "answer": "Dear Client,It is difficult to say for sure whether the society can force you to carry out civil work without proof, without knowing more about the specific bylaws of your society. However, in general, a society cannot force a resident to carry out major civil work without proof that the resident is at fault for the damage. In your case, the society has only provided you with verbal confirmation from their team of workers that the seepage is coming from your home. This is not enough proof to require you to carry out major civil work.You have the right to ask for a proper inspection report from either the society or a third party agency before any kind of civil work is commissioned by you in your unit. The inspection report should be conducted by a qualified professional who can identify the source of the seepage and determine whether you are at fault.If the inspection report finds that the seepage is not coming from your home, then society cannot force you to carry out civil work. However, if the inspection report finds that you are at fault, then the society may be able to enforce its bylaws to require you to carry out the necessary repairs.It is important to note that the bylaws of each society are different, so it is important to consult with an attorney to understand the specific bylaws of your society and your rights as a resident.In addition to the legal considerations, you may also want to consider the practical implications of carrying out major civil work in your home. Major civil work can be disruptive and expensive, and it is important to make sure that it is necessary before you proceed. If the seepage is not coming from your home, then there is no point in carrying out civil work in your unit.Whether you have to bear 100% of the cost of the inspection or if you can legally ask your downstairs neighbor to bear 50% of the cost depends on the specific circumstances of your case. In general, if the seepage is coming from your home, then you will be responsible for the full cost of the inspection and repairs. However, if the seepage is coming from the common areas of the building or from the downstairs neighbor's unit, then you may be able to recover some or all of the cost of the inspection from the other party.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,If the local police are not adequately addressing the situation where the society secretary has disconnected the electric supply, there are steps you can take to address the issue. Initially, you can draft a written complaint to the police detailing the incident and its significance. If the local authorities fail to respond appropriately, you have the option to escalate the matter to higher-ranking police officials for their intervention.Furthermore, you can consider initiating legal actions to safeguard your rights. One possible approach is to file a suit for injunction against the landlord, seeking to prevent them from using unauthorized methods, such as cutting off essential services, to force eviction. This legal action also aims to restrain the landlord from engaging in such activities that violate established legal procedures.It's crucial to note that essential services and basic amenities, regardless of any reasons cited, should not be disconnected by the society. Therefore, in your written complaint to the police, make sure to include all relevant parties, such as the landlord and society members responsible for the disconnection. This comprehensive complaint serves as a fundamental step to put an end to this wrongful practice.In the event that the police exhibit reluctance in taking appropriate action, you have two viable options. You can either approach higher-ranking police authorities for intervention, or alternatively, submit a petition under section 156(3) of theCriminal Procedure Codeto the jurisdictional judicial magistrate court.

    "question": "Can the society blame me for down floor seepage without solid proof",
    "answer": "Dear Client,It is difficult to say for sure whether the society can force you to carry out civil work without proof, without knowing more about the specific bylaws of your society. However, in general, a society cannot force a resident to carry out major civil work without proof that the resident is at fault for the damage. In your case, the society has only provided you with verbal confirmation from their team of workers that the seepage is coming from your home. This is not enough proof to require you to carry out major civil work.You have the right to ask for a proper inspection report from either the society or a third party agency before any kind of civil work is commissioned by you in your unit. The inspection report should be conducted by a qualified professional who can identify the source of the seepage and determine whether you are at fault.If the inspection report finds that the seepage is not coming from your home, then society cannot force you to carry out civil work. However, if the inspection report finds that you are at fault, then the society may be able to enforce its bylaws to require you to carry out the necessary repairs.It is important to note that the bylaws of each society are different, so it is important to consult with an attorney to understand the specific bylaws of your society and your rights as a resident.In addition to the legal considerations, you may also want to consider the practical implications of carrying out major civil work in your home. Major civil work can be disruptive and expensive, and it is important to make sure that it is necessary before you proceed. If the seepage is not coming from your home, then there is no point in carrying out civil work in your unit.Whether you have to bear 100% of the cost of the inspection or if you can legally ask your downstairs neighbor to bear 50% of the cost depends on the specific circumstances of your case. In general, if the seepage is coming from your home, then you will be responsible for the full cost of the inspection and repairs. However, if the seepage is coming from the common areas of the building or from the downstairs neighbor's unit, then you may be able to recover some or all of the cost of the inspection from the other party.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Eligibility of Renovation Costs under Section 54F:Section 54F provides for exemption of capital gains if the proceeds from the sale of a capital asset (like land) are invested in purchasing a residential house property. The key requirement is that the new property must be purchased within the specified period, and construction must be completed within the specified period.Generally, under Section 54F, the exemption is available for the cost of the new house property. The renovation costs might not be explicitly covered, but the situation can be complex.Renovation vs. Demolition and Reconstruction:While obtaining a demolition permit and then reconstructing the house as a new construction might provide greater clarity and potentially minimize the risk of tax litigation, it might not always be necessary in every situation.Each case can be unique, and the specific circumstances, and tax laws can influence the approach that should be taken.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

You mentioned that the vendor returned a part of the advance payment in cash because the material was not delivered as per your instruction. This situation might not strictly fall under the definition of loans or deposits as intended by Section 269SS.Loan or deposit generally implies a lending or depositing of money for a certain period with an expectation of repayment with or without interest. In your case, the vendor is returning a portion of the advance payment that was intended for raw materials, and it seems more like a refund or adjustment due to the non-delivery of goods rather than a loan or deposit.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "The Finance Act 2017, took various measures to restrain black money and as an outcome of these measures, a new Section 269ST was inserted in the Income Tax Act. Section 269ST imposed restriction on a cash transaction and limited it to Rs.2 Lakhs per day. Section 269ST states that no person shall receive an amount of Rs 2 Lakh or more:In aggregate from a person in a day; orIn respect of a single transaction; orIn respect of transactions relating to one event or occasion from a person.Section 269SS prohibits a taxpayer from taking/accepting loans or deposits or a sum of more than Rs.20,000 in cash. All loans and deposits of more than Rs.20,000 must always be taken through a banking channel. Section 269SS of the Income Tax Act is however not applicable when accepting/taking loan or deposit from a person or entity mentioned below:Government;Any banking company, post office saving bank or co-operative bank;Any corporation established by a Central, State or Provincial ActAny Government company as defined in clause (45) of section 2 of the Companies Act, 2013An institution, association or body or class of institutions, associations or bodies notified by Central Government in the official gazette.Finally, if the person from whom the loan or deposit is taken and the person by whom the loan or deposit is accepted, are both having agricultural income and neither have any income taxable under Income Tax Act, then the provisions of Section 269SS will not apply.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Section 269SS of the Income Tax Act prohibits any person from taking or accepting loans or deposits exceeding Rs. 20,000 in cash. The provision is aimed at curbing the use of cash transactions and promoting digital payments. The section applies to both individuals and businesses, and violating it can result in penalties.However, in your case, it seems like the situation is a bit different. You mentioned that the vendor returned a part of the advance payment in cash because the material was not delivered as per your instruction. This situation might not strictly fall under the definition of loans or deposits as intended by Section 269SS.Loan or deposit generally implies a lending or depositing of money for a certain period with an expectation of repayment with or without interest. In your case, the vendor is returning a portion of the advance payment that was intended for raw materials, and it seems more like a refund or adjustment due to the non-delivery of goods rather than a loan or deposit.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Section 54F",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Eligibility of Renovation Costs under Section 54F:Section 54F provides for exemption of capital gains if the proceeds from the sale of a capital asset (like land) are invested in purchasing a residential house property. The key requirement is that the new property must be purchased within the specified period, and construction must be completed within the specified period.Generally, under Section 54F, the exemption is available for the cost of the new house property. The renovation costs might not be explicitly covered, but the situation can be complex.Renovation vs. Demolition and Reconstruction:While obtaining a demolition permit and then reconstructing the house as a new construction might provide greater clarity and potentially minimize the risk of tax litigation, it might not always be necessary in every situation.Each case can be unique, and the specific circumstances, and tax laws can influence the approach that should be taken.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The land owner may have defrauded you by accepting money for the purchase of the land and then reselling it without giving you the money back.3. If the magistrate orders an investigation, the police will investigate the matter and file a report. If the report finds that there is sufficient evidence to support your case, the police will file a charge sheet against the land owner.4. Generally, unregistered agreements can be used as evidence of the intent of the parties involved.5. Keep all of your documentation, including the agreement, the cheque, and any correspondence with the land owner.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Navigating property disputes: seeking guidance on partition and court fees",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Calculating Court Fees for Partition Case:Court fees for a partition suit are typically calculated based on the market value of the property. In your case, where the circle rate is Rs 46,000 per square meter, you might need to calculate the total market value of the land (301 sq meters multiplied by Rs 46,000). The court fees would be a percentage of this market value, which can vary depending on the jurisdiction and local fee structure/stamp duty.Your current approach of seeking an injunction was likely recommended to address the immediate harassment issue. If you're considering changing your strategy to a partition suit, discuss this with your lawyer to evaluate the potential benefits and drawbacks.Expediting the Case to High Court: This many not be so easy as the case is already pending before the lower court.Mediation and Settlement:Given the family nature of the dispute, consider exploring mediation or settlement options. Sometimes, reaching a mutually agreeable solution through mediation can be less time-consuming and costly than going through a lengthy court process.

The key requirement is that the new property must be purchased within the specified period, and construction must be completed within the specified period.Generally, under Section 54F, the exemption is available for the cost of the new house property. The renovation costs might not be explicitly covered, but the situation can be complex.Renovation vs. Demolition and Reconstruction:While obtaining a demolition permit and then reconstructing the house as a new construction might provide greater clarity and potentially minimize the risk of tax litigation, it might not always be necessary in every situation.Each case can be unique, and the specific circumstances, and tax laws can influence the approach that should be taken.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Calculating Court Fees for Partition Case:Court fees for a partition suit are typically calculated based on the market value of the property. In your case, where the circle rate is Rs 46,000 per square meter, you might need to calculate the total market value of the land (301 sq meters multiplied by Rs 46,000). The court fees would be a percentage of this market value, which can vary depending on the jurisdiction and local fee structure/stamp duty.Your current approach of seeking an injunction was likely recommended to address the immediate harassment issue. If you're considering changing your strategy to a partition suit, discuss this with your lawyer to evaluate the potential benefits and drawbacks.Expediting the Case to High Court: This many not be so easy as the case is already pending before the lower court.Mediation and Settlement:Given the family nature of the dispute, consider exploring mediation or settlement options.

    "question": "Navigating property disputes: seeking guidance on partition and court fees",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Calculating Court Fees for Partition Case:Court fees for a partition suit are typically calculated based on the market value of the property. In your case, where the circle rate is Rs 46,000 per square meter, you might need to calculate the total market value of the land (301 sq meters multiplied by Rs 46,000). The court fees would be a percentage of this market value, which can vary depending on the jurisdiction and local fee structure/stamp duty.Your current approach of seeking an injunction was likely recommended to address the immediate harassment issue. If you're considering changing your strategy to a partition suit, discuss this with your lawyer to evaluate the potential benefits and drawbacks.Expediting the Case to High Court: This many not be so easy as the case is already pending before the lower court.Mediation and Settlement:Given the family nature of the dispute, consider exploring mediation or settlement options. Sometimes, reaching a mutually agreeable solution through mediation can be less time-consuming and costly than going through a lengthy court process.

In your case, where the circle rate is Rs 46,000 per square meter, you might need to calculate the total market value of the land (301 sq meters multiplied by Rs 46,000). The court fees would be a percentage of this market value, which can vary depending on the jurisdiction and local fee structure/stamp duty.Your current approach of seeking an injunction was likely recommended to address the immediate harassment issue. If you're considering changing your strategy to a partition suit, discuss this with your lawyer to evaluate the potential benefits and drawbacks.Expediting the Case to High Court: This many not be so easy as the case is already pending before the lower court.Mediation and Settlement:Given the family nature of the dispute, consider exploring mediation or settlement options.

Such income is considered to be speculative income and is taxed at 30%.Since binary opinion trading is not legal in India, there is some level of ambiguity in its taxation as well. Like income from futures and opinions trading, many experts believe income from binary trading can also be treated as business income.

However, the court may not consider the issue of your wife's mental health unless it is relevant to the case, and even then, the court may be reluctant to rely on unproven claims.During the cross-examination, you can ask questions that are relevant to the case and that will help you prove your case. However, the court may disallow questions that are irrelevant or are intended to harass or embarrass the witness. If the judge deems a question to be irrelevant or inappropriate, the judge may sustain an objection from the opposing counsel.Annulment is a legal process by which a marriage is declared null and void. In India, annulment is available only in limited circumstances, such as when the marriage was not consummated or was entered into under coercion or fraud. Mental illness is not generally considered grounds for annulment. If you want to seek a medical examination of your wife, you would need to have a valid reason for doing so and obtain a court order.If custody has not yet been decided, you may have the opportunity to ask questions during the hearing or trial. You may also want to consider hiring a lawyer to represent you in the custody proceedings.Whether or not you can get the 498A case quashed will depend on the specific circumstances of the case.

According to the law, the consideration of inheritance by class-2 legal heirs only arises if there are no class-1 legal heirs.

Such income is considered to be speculative income and is taxed at 30%.Since binary opinion trading is not legal in India, there is some level of ambiguity in its taxation as well. Like income from futures and opinions trading, many experts believe income from binary trading can also be treated as business income. However, the widely popular opinion is that it will be treated as speculative income. Therefore, it is better to consult a tax expert in this regard to arrive at a definite solution.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"
