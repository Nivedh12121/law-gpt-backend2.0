    "answer": "Dear client,Congratulations on your marriage and your daughter! I will do my best to answer your questions about registering your marriage in the Philippines.Firstly, it is possible to register your Indian marriage in the Philippines. The process for doing so may vary depending on the city or municipality in which you plan to register your marriage. However, generally speaking, you will need to obtain a Certificate of Legal Capacity to Contract Marriage from the Indian Embassy in Manila, and then apply for a marriage license with the Local Civil Registrar's Office. You may also need to provide additional documents such as your passports, birth certificates, and a certificate of no marriage (CENOMAR).Regarding your question about where to register your marriage, it may be more convenient to do so in the Philippines since you will be there in person. However, it is important to note that your wife will need to be present as well to sign the necessary documents. If she is unable to take time off work to travel to the Philippines, then you may need to consider registering your marriage in India instead.As for the legitimation of your child, you will need to provide a copy of your marriage certificate in order to apply for this. Therefore, registering your marriage is indeed necessary.In terms of the documents you will need to carry with you to the Philippines, you should bring your passports, birth certificates, and your Indian marriage certificate. It is also a good idea to have these documents notarized and apostilled to ensure their authenticity.I hope this information helps you with your plans to register your marriage in the Philippines.

    "question": "Cost lower than reccnor value",
    "answer": "Dear client,If you have purchased a flat in Ghaziabad for a value that is lower than the ready reckoner value, and you are paying stamp duty on the higher value, then the following scenarios could occur:Capital Gains Tax: When you sell the property in the future, the government will consider the ready reckoner value as the actual value of the property. This means that if you sell the property for a higher value than the ready reckoner value, you will have to pay capital gains tax on the difference. So, it is important to keep all the records related to the purchase of the property and the stamp duty paid.Income Tax: The stamp duty paid on the higher value can be claimed as a deduction from your taxable income under section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. However, the deduction can only be claimed up to a maximum of Rs. 1.5 lakh in a financial year. This deduction is available only to the buyer and not to the seller.Scrutiny from Tax Authorities: In case the difference between the ready reckoner value and the purchase price is substantial, the tax authorities may scrutinize the transaction and ask for an explanation. This could lead to further inquiries and legal complications.It is advisable to consult a tax professional or a chartered accountant to understand the tax implications of your specific case and to ensure that you comply with all the legal requirements.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

After registration, the marriage certificate issued by the foreign country will be considered as proof of the marriage in India.Therefore, if your son and his fiancée get their marriage registered with the Indian consulate or embassy in Hong Kong after their registered marriage in Hong Kong, their marriage certificate will be recognized as valid in India under the Foreign Marriage Act, 1969.It is important to note that the specific requirements and procedures for registering a foreign marriage in India may vary depending on the individual circumstances and the particular Indian diplomatic or consular mission involved. Therefore, it is recommended that your son and his fiancée seek the advice of the Indian consulate or embassy in Hong Kong for specific guidance on registering their marriage in India.RegardsVivek Arya (Legalvarta)Retired LawyerAdvocate, Gurgaon767 Answers6 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Retired Lawyer"

    "answer": "Dear client,Congratulations on your marriage and your daughter! I will do my best to answer your questions about registering your marriage in the Philippines.Firstly, it is possible to register your Indian marriage in the Philippines. The process for doing so may vary depending on the city or municipality in which you plan to register your marriage. However, generally speaking, you will need to obtain a Certificate of Legal Capacity to Contract Marriage from the Indian Embassy in Manila, and then apply for a marriage license with the Local Civil Registrar's Office. You may also need to provide additional documents such as your passports, birth certificates, and a certificate of no marriage (CENOMAR).Regarding your question about where to register your marriage, it may be more convenient to do so in the Philippines since you will be there in person. However, it is important to note that your wife will need to be present as well to sign the necessary documents. If she is unable to take time off work to travel to the Philippines, then you may need to consider registering your marriage in India instead.As for the legitimation of your child, you will need to provide a copy of your marriage certificate in order to apply for this. Therefore, registering your marriage is indeed necessary.In terms of the documents you will need to carry with you to the Philippines, you should bring your passports, birth certificates, and your Indian marriage certificate. It is also a good idea to have these documents notarized and apostilled to ensure their authenticity.I hope this information helps you with your plans to register your marriage in the Philippines.

    "answer": "Dear client,If you have purchased a flat in Ghaziabad for a value that is lower than the ready reckoner value, and you are paying stamp duty on the higher value, then the following scenarios could occur:Capital Gains Tax: When you sell the property in the future, the government will consider the ready reckoner value as the actual value of the property. This means that if you sell the property for a higher value than the ready reckoner value, you will have to pay capital gains tax on the difference. So, it is important to keep all the records related to the purchase of the property and the stamp duty paid.Income Tax: The stamp duty paid on the higher value can be claimed as a deduction from your taxable income under section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. However, the deduction can only be claimed up to a maximum of Rs. 1.5 lakh in a financial year. This deduction is available only to the buyer and not to the seller.Scrutiny from Tax Authorities: In case the difference between the ready reckoner value and the purchase price is substantial, the tax authorities may scrutinize the transaction and ask for an explanation. This could lead to further inquiries and legal complications.It is advisable to consult a tax professional or a chartered accountant to understand the tax implications of your specific case and to ensure that you comply with all the legal requirements.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Congratulations on your marriage and your daughter! I will do my best to answer your questions about registering your marriage in the Philippines.Firstly, it is possible to register your Indian marriage in the Philippines. The process for doing so may vary depending on the city or municipality in which you plan to register your marriage. However, generally speaking, you will need to obtain a Certificate of Legal Capacity to Contract Marriage from the Indian Embassy in Manila, and then apply for a marriage license with the Local Civil Registrar's Office. You may also need to provide additional documents such as your passports, birth certificates, and a certificate of no marriage (CENOMAR).Regarding your question about where to register your marriage, it may be more convenient to do so in the Philippines since you will be there in person. However, it is important to note that your wife will need to be present as well to sign the necessary documents. If she is unable to take time off work to travel to the Philippines, then you may need to consider registering your marriage in India instead.As for the legitimation of your child, you will need to provide a copy of your marriage certificate in order to apply for this. Therefore, registering your marriage is indeed necessary.In terms of the documents you will need to carry with you to the Philippines, you should bring your passports, birth certificates, and your Indian marriage certificate. It is also a good idea to have these documents notarized and apostilled to ensure their authenticity.I hope this information helps you with your plans to register your marriage in the Philippines.

There is  no provision under Indian laws for prenuptial agreement.4. It is clarified that if groom and bride belong to different religions or countries, they have to marry underSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 as they are not permitted to marry under personal marital laws.5.In India, such a marriage is governed by the provisions of theSpecial Marriage Act. This act not only deals with marriages between people belonging to different religions but also different caste or backgrounds and hence, marrying a person from another nationality is also governed by theSpecial Marriage Act. It can also be noted that  for an Indian citizen intending to marry outside India; it is the provisions of the Foreign Marriage Act passed in 1969 that apply.6.

    "answer": "Dear client,If you have purchased a flat in Ghaziabad for a value that is lower than the ready reckoner value, and you are paying stamp duty on the higher value, then the following scenarios could occur:Capital Gains Tax: When you sell the property in the future, the government will consider the ready reckoner value as the actual value of the property. This means that if you sell the property for a higher value than the ready reckoner value, you will have to pay capital gains tax on the difference. So, it is important to keep all the records related to the purchase of the property and the stamp duty paid.Income Tax: The stamp duty paid on the higher value can be claimed as a deduction from your taxable income under section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. However, the deduction can only be claimed up to a maximum of Rs. 1.5 lakh in a financial year. This deduction is available only to the buyer and not to the seller.Scrutiny from Tax Authorities: In case the difference between the ready reckoner value and the purchase price is substantial, the tax authorities may scrutinize the transaction and ask for an explanation. This could lead to further inquiries and legal complications.It is advisable to consult a tax professional or a chartered accountant to understand the tax implications of your specific case and to ensure that you comply with all the legal requirements.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

You may also consider hiring a different lawyer who will represent your interests in court, and file the memo for withdrawal on your behalf.In regards to your lawyer not filing the memo for withdrawal as per your instructions, you should discuss this matter with your lawyer and clarify your position. If your lawyer is not acting in your best interests, you have the right to seek a different lawyer to represent you in court.As for non-attendance of the 2nd motion, it is important to attend all court hearings related to your divorce case to avoid any potential negative consequences. If you are unable to attend due to valid reasons such as relocation to another country, you may inform the court in writing and seek an adjournment or postponement of the hearing.However, if you miss court hearings without informing the court, it may be considered as contempt of court, which can lead to penalties and other legal consequences.In conclusion, it is important to stay informed and updated on your divorce case proceedings, and to take necessary actions in consultation with your lawyer to protect your legal rights and interests.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Congratulations on your marriage and your daughter! I will do my best to answer your questions about registering your marriage in the Philippines.Firstly, it is possible to register your Indian marriage in the Philippines. The process for doing so may vary depending on the city or municipality in which you plan to register your marriage. However, generally speaking, you will need to obtain a Certificate of Legal Capacity to Contract Marriage from the Indian Embassy in Manila, and then apply for a marriage license with the Local Civil Registrar's Office. You may also need to provide additional documents such as your passports, birth certificates, and a certificate of no marriage (CENOMAR).Regarding your question about where to register your marriage, it may be more convenient to do so in the Philippines since you will be there in person. However, it is important to note that your wife will need to be present as well to sign the necessary documents. If she is unable to take time off work to travel to the Philippines, then you may need to consider registering your marriage in India instead.As for the legitimation of your child, you will need to provide a copy of your marriage certificate in order to apply for this. Therefore, registering your marriage is indeed necessary.In terms of the documents you will need to carry with you to the Philippines, you should bring your passports, birth certificates, and your Indian marriage certificate. It is also a good idea to have these documents notarized and apostilled to ensure their authenticity.I hope this information helps you with your plans to register your marriage in the Philippines.

    "question": "Cost lower than reccnor value",
    "answer": "Dear client,If you have purchased a flat in Ghaziabad for a value that is lower than the ready reckoner value, and you are paying stamp duty on the higher value, then the following scenarios could occur:Capital Gains Tax: When you sell the property in the future, the government will consider the ready reckoner value as the actual value of the property. This means that if you sell the property for a higher value than the ready reckoner value, you will have to pay capital gains tax on the difference. So, it is important to keep all the records related to the purchase of the property and the stamp duty paid.Income Tax: The stamp duty paid on the higher value can be claimed as a deduction from your taxable income under section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. However, the deduction can only be claimed up to a maximum of Rs. 1.5 lakh in a financial year. This deduction is available only to the buyer and not to the seller.Scrutiny from Tax Authorities: In case the difference between the ready reckoner value and the purchase price is substantial, the tax authorities may scrutinize the transaction and ask for an explanation. This could lead to further inquiries and legal complications.It is advisable to consult a tax professional or a chartered accountant to understand the tax implications of your specific case and to ensure that you comply with all the legal requirements.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Congratulations on your marriage and your daughter! I will do my best to answer your questions about registering your marriage in the Philippines.Firstly, it is possible to register your Indian marriage in the Philippines. The process for doing so may vary depending on the city or municipality in which you plan to register your marriage. However, generally speaking, you will need to obtain a Certificate of Legal Capacity to Contract Marriage from the Indian Embassy in Manila, and then apply for a marriage license with the Local Civil Registrar's Office. You may also need to provide additional documents such as your passports, birth certificates, and a certificate of no marriage (CENOMAR).Regarding your question about where to register your marriage, it may be more convenient to do so in the Philippines since you will be there in person. However, it is important to note that your wife will need to be present as well to sign the necessary documents. If she is unable to take time off work to travel to the Philippines, then you may need to consider registering your marriage in India instead.As for the legitimation of your child, you will need to provide a copy of your marriage certificate in order to apply for this. Therefore, registering your marriage is indeed necessary.In terms of the documents you will need to carry with you to the Philippines, you should bring your passports, birth certificates, and your Indian marriage certificate. It is also a good idea to have these documents notarized and apostilled to ensure their authenticity.I hope this information helps you with your plans to register your marriage in the Philippines.

    "question": "Can property be registered at lesser value than circle rate in gurgaon",
    "answer": "If a property is registered at an amount less than the circle rate, it can raise suspicions of under-reporting or undervaluing the transaction to evade stamp duty or taxes. In such cases, the authorities may initiate an inquiry and assess the actual market value of the property. The buyer may have to pay additional stamp duty and penalties if the actual value is found to be higher than the registered value.If the seller disagrees with the new circle rates, they may challenge it by filing an appeal with the relevant authorities. However, until the appeal is resolved, the circle rate remains applicable. The buyer may also face challenges in the long run if the property is undervalued as they may have to pay a higher capital gains tax if they sell the property in the future. Additionally, the buyer may face difficulties in obtaining loans or selling the property at a fair price if the property is registered at a lower value than the prevailing market rates.Please share further details for comprehensive replyAnilesh TewariAdvocate, New Delhi18095 Answers377 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anilesh Tewari"

    "answer": "1. The property can be registered below the circle rates, provided the buyer pays the Stamp Duty on par with circle rate.2.  Perhaps you mean to say that if the seller demands circle rate what should be your stand. In that case you have to convince the seller not to change his selling price of Rs. 27 Lakhs, which he had earlier agreed while finalising the sale consideration in The Agreement of Sale and later circle rates have increased subsequent to the arrived rate of Rs.27 Lakhs.3.  If you are paying the stamp duty for Rs. 30 Lakhs, even though in the sale deed, the consideration amount would be shown as Rs. 27 Lakhs, it's legally valid.Shashidhar S.

    "question": "Can property be registered at lesser value than circle rate in gurgaon",
    "answer": "Dear client,As per the Indian Stamp Act, the property registration value cannot be lower than the circle rate. Therefore, registering the property at an amount lower than the circle rate is not possible legally. In case the seller does not agree to sell the property at the circle rate, the buyer can negotiate with the seller to reduce the sale price accordingly, keeping in mind the increased circle rate. Alternatively, the buyer can opt to withdraw from the deal, citing the increased circle rate as the reason.Paying stamp duty on the new circle rate while registering the property is the correct thing to do, as per the current rules. However, the registry value of the property mentioned on the stamp paper should match the actual sale value or the new circle rate, whichever is higher. If the registry value on the stamp paper is lower than the circle rate or actual sale value, it could be considered a fraudulent transaction and could have legal implications. Therefore, it is advised to rectify the registry value on the stamp paper to avoid any legal issues in the future. You can consult a legal expert for further guidance on how to rectify the value on the stamp paper.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Registration of marriage",
    "answer": "Dear client,Congratulations on your marriage and your daughter! I will do my best to answer your questions about registering your marriage in the Philippines.Firstly, it is possible to register your Indian marriage in the Philippines. The process for doing so may vary depending on the city or municipality in which you plan to register your marriage. However, generally speaking, you will need to obtain a Certificate of Legal Capacity to Contract Marriage from the Indian Embassy in Manila, and then apply for a marriage license with the Local Civil Registrar's Office. You may also need to provide additional documents such as your passports, birth certificates, and a certificate of no marriage (CENOMAR).Regarding your question about where to register your marriage, it may be more convenient to do so in the Philippines since you will be there in person. However, it is important to note that your wife will need to be present as well to sign the necessary documents. If she is unable to take time off work to travel to the Philippines, then you may need to consider registering your marriage in India instead.As for the legitimation of your child, you will need to provide a copy of your marriage certificate in order to apply for this. Therefore, registering your marriage is indeed necessary.In terms of the documents you will need to carry with you to the Philippines, you should bring your passports, birth certificates, and your Indian marriage certificate. It is also a good idea to have these documents notarized and apostilled to ensure their authenticity.I hope this information helps you with your plans to register your marriage in the Philippines. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If you are unable to attend due to valid reasons such as relocation to another country, you may inform the court in writing and seek an adjournment or postponement of the hearing.However, if you miss court hearings without informing the court, it may be considered as contempt of court, which can lead to penalties and other legal consequences.In conclusion, it is important to stay informed and updated on your divorce case proceedings, and to take necessary actions in consultation with your lawyer to protect your legal rights and interests.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If your lawyer is not acting in your best interests, you have the right to seek a different lawyer to represent you in court.As for non-attendance of the 2nd motion, it is important to attend all court hearings related to your divorce case to avoid any potential negative consequences. If you are unable to attend due to valid reasons such as relocation to another country, you may inform the court in writing and seek an adjournment or postponement of the hearing.However, if you miss court hearings without informing the court, it may be considered as contempt of court, which can lead to penalties and other legal consequences.In conclusion, it is important to stay informed and updated on your divorce case proceedings, and to take necessary actions in consultation with your lawyer to protect your legal rights and interests.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Marriage registration of NRI groom and foreign bride",
    "answer": "Foreign Marriage Act was passed in the year 1969 to provide provisions for marriages of Indian citizens who are outside the territories of India.One of the prerequisites to solemnize a marriage under this Act, one of the parties must be a citizen of India. In Foreign countries, the marriage must be solemnized under a Marriage Officer.It is the foundation of the act of foreign marriage in India. The marriages solemnized under this act require that one party is Indian or other party is a foreigner. The parties can be both Indian but solemnizing their marriage outside India or one party can be a Non-Resident of India (NRI).In this case, the marriage can be solemnized and registered in India or any other country from where the foreigner belongs or is a citizen of.After the marriage is solemnized, parties can get themselves registered under the foreign marriage act, irrespective of the nationality of the other party. The pre-existing marriage must be registered under the act only when it satisfies all the conditions for a valid marriage given in section 4 of the act.The Marriage Officer may refuse to register a marriage under this section on the ground that in his opinion the marriage is inconsistent with international law or the comity of nations.The parties to marriage may get their foreign marriage certified by Indian authorities in the Indian High Commission/Indian Embassy/Indian Consulate of the country where it was solemnised after which it can be registered in India under Foreign marriages act orSpecial marriages act.Apostile means it is a certificate that authenticates the origin of a public document by confirming  the authenticity of the signature and the authority of an official who signed the public document.For getting apostile you may have to approach the authority concerned of that country and comply with the prescribed formalities.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Marriage registration of NRI groom and foreign bride",
    "answer": "If you are married as per the French law in France, then you are legally married in France. However, if you plan to live or work in India, it is advisable to register your marriage with the Indian administration.To register your marriage in India, you need to visit the local Registrar of Marriages office in the area where the marriage took place. The documents required for registration may vary depending on the state where you want to register the marriage. The importance of registering the marriage in both countries is to ensure legal validity of the marriage in both countries, and for easy processing of visa and other legal documents.The certificate of registration issued by the local Registrar of Marriages in India will be considered as the primary document. The date of marriage mentioned in the Indian marriage certificate will be considered as the primary date of marriage.For the OCI card, you will need to provide the French marriage certificate and the Indian marriage certificate if you have registered your marriage in India.Apostille is a verification process done for documents to be recognized in another country. It is a form of authentication that certifies the origin of the document.Apostille can be done remotely through an authorized agency or service. You need to check with the embassy or consulate of the country where you want to get the documents apostilled for the specific requirements and procedures.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Harassment by tenant and producing fake document against the landlord",
    "answer": "Dear client,If the tenant has filed a suit against you, then it is important that you respond to the suit and present your evidence to the court. You should gather all the relevant documents related to the tenancy, such as the original lease agreement, receipts for the rent paid, and any communication between you and the tenant regarding the tenancy.If the tenant has forged your signature on a document, you should report this to the police immediately as it is a serious criminal offense. You may also want to consult with a lawyer to understand your legal options and to defend yourself against the tenant's claims.In general, the tenant has to prove that they have paid the additional deposit and the amount claimed by them. As the owner of the property, you have the right to evict a tenant if they have breached the terms of the lease agreement, such as not paying rent. However, the legal process for eviction can vary depending on the local laws and regulations, so you may want to consult with a lawyer to understand the specific steps you need to take to evict the tenant legally.It is also important to note that in some cases, tenants may have legal rights to stay in a property even if the owner wants to sell it. This may depend on the local laws and regulations, as well as the terms of the lease agreement. So, you may want to consult with a lawyer to understand your legal obligations and options in this regard.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Resigning without Notice period",
    "answer": "Dear client,Leaving without serving the required notice period may lead to legal consequences, and it is essential to understand the terms and conditions of your employment contract before deciding to leave.In your case, as per your contract, the notice period is six months, and there is no provision for paying in lieu of notice period. However, the company has changed the notice period to one year, which is sub judice. If the company has breached the terms and conditions of your employment contract, it might be possible to challenge the notice period's validity in court.If you leave without serving the required notice period, the company may initiate legal action against you for breach of contract. They may seek damages from you for losses they incur due to your early departure, such as the cost of hiring and training a replacement. The company can also choose to withhold your dues, such as salary and other benefits, until you complete the required notice period.To leave legally, you can try to negotiate with the company and explain your reasons for leaving. If they agree, you may be able to work out a mutually acceptable solution, such as reducing the notice period or paying compensation in lieu of notice.If you cannot come to an agreement with the company, you may need to consult with a lawyer to understand your legal options and potential consequences of leaving without serving the notice period.

Application of Act ofHINDU SUCCESSION ACT, 1956 ,This Act applies- (c) to any other person who is not a Muslim, Christian, Parsi or Jew by religion unless it is proved that any such person would not have been governed by the Hindu law or by any custom or usage as part of that law in respect of any of the matters dealt with herein if this Act had not been passed.The person belonging to Schedule tribe also comes under the above exemption.Besides section 2(2) is also very clear in this regard, (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), nothing contained in this Act shall apply to the members of any Scheduled Tribe within the meaning of clause (25) of article 366 of the Constitution unless the Central Government, by notification in the Official Gazette, otherwise directs.As per Section 2(2) of theHindu Succession Act, the statute, which guarantees equal shares for male and female heirs, isnot applicable to Scheduled Tribe members.In a judgment on December 9, 2022, the Supreme Court asked the government to re-examine provisions in theHindu Succession Actwhich deny a tribal woman the right of succession to her father’s property.Therefore it is clear that till now the law is that the schedule tribe woman cannot inherit the Hindu husband's properties even if he is reported to have died intestate.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

If the woman died intestate (i.e., without leaving a valid will), then her legal heirs, as per the HSA, would be her mother, her husband's mother, and her husband's siblings (if he has predeceased her). If her husband is also deceased and she did not have any children, then her legal heirs would be her mother and her husband's mother. The property would devolve upon them in equal shares.However, if the woman had made a valid will before her death, then the distribution of her self-acquired property would be governed by the terms of the will. The beneficiaries named in the will would be entitled to receive the property as per the provisions of the will.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can property be registered at lesser value than circle rate in gurgaon",
    "answer": "If a property is registered at an amount less than the circle rate, it can raise suspicions of under-reporting or undervaluing the transaction to evade stamp duty or taxes. In such cases, the authorities may initiate an inquiry and assess the actual market value of the property. The buyer may have to pay additional stamp duty and penalties if the actual value is found to be higher than the registered value.If the seller disagrees with the new circle rates, they may challenge it by filing an appeal with the relevant authorities. However, until the appeal is resolved, the circle rate remains applicable. The buyer may also face challenges in the long run if the property is undervalued as they may have to pay a higher capital gains tax if they sell the property in the future. Additionally, the buyer may face difficulties in obtaining loans or selling the property at a fair price if the property is registered at a lower value than the prevailing market rates.Please share further details for comprehensive replyAnilesh TewariAdvocate, New Delhi18095 Answers377 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anilesh Tewari"

In that case you have to convince the seller not to change his selling price of Rs. 27 Lakhs, which he had earlier agreed while finalising the sale consideration in The Agreement of Sale and later circle rates have increased subsequent to the arrived rate of Rs.27 Lakhs.3.  If you are paying the stamp duty for Rs. 30 Lakhs, even though in the sale deed, the consideration amount would be shown as Rs. 27 Lakhs, it's legally valid.Shashidhar S.

    "question": "Can property be registered at lesser value than circle rate in gurgaon",
    "answer": "Dear client,As per the Indian Stamp Act, the property registration value cannot be lower than the circle rate. Therefore, registering the property at an amount lower than the circle rate is not possible legally. In case the seller does not agree to sell the property at the circle rate, the buyer can negotiate with the seller to reduce the sale price accordingly, keeping in mind the increased circle rate. Alternatively, the buyer can opt to withdraw from the deal, citing the increased circle rate as the reason.Paying stamp duty on the new circle rate while registering the property is the correct thing to do, as per the current rules. However, the registry value of the property mentioned on the stamp paper should match the actual sale value or the new circle rate, whichever is higher. If the registry value on the stamp paper is lower than the circle rate or actual sale value, it could be considered a fraudulent transaction and could have legal implications. Therefore, it is advised to rectify the registry value on the stamp paper to avoid any legal issues in the future. You can consult a legal expert for further guidance on how to rectify the value on the stamp paper.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Hindu Succession law for deceased tribal woman",
    "answer": "Dear client,Yes, a member of a scheduled tribe who practices Hinduism and does not follow the customs and traditions of the tribe would fall under the purview of theHindu Succession Act(HSA).With regard to the ownership of self-acquired properties of a deceased woman, the legal heirs will be determined in accordance with the provisions of the HSA. If the woman died intestate (i.e., without leaving a valid will), then her legal heirs, as per the HSA, would be her mother, her husband's mother, and her husband's siblings (if he has predeceased her). If her husband is also deceased and she did not have any children, then her legal heirs would be her mother and her husband's mother. The property would devolve upon them in equal shares.However, if the woman had made a valid will before her death, then the distribution of her self-acquired property would be governed by the terms of the will. The beneficiaries named in the will would be entitled to receive the property as per the provisions of the will.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Is Railway Act Section 143 is applicable for E-Tickets too?",
    "answer": "Ther is judgment of Kerala high court that provisions of section 143 of railways act is not applicable to e-tickets from IRCTC2)High Court of Kerala in Mathew Cherian Vs.State of Kerala (Crl M.C 1991 of 2016, dated 22.09.2016), wherein it was held as\"6.The question before this Court arises in this context is whether purchasing of online tickets through the website of IRCTC by a traveller through a facility provided by the petitioner or staff would amounts to procuring and supplying tickets for travelling on a railway. In this regard two aspects have to be noted:- One is that ticket is purchased in the name of traveller. Secondly the ticket is issued by IRCTC. As seen from the counter, the allegation as against the petitioner is that the petitioner misused IRCTC portal by creating fake user ID to procure and supply tickets to travellers. The use of internet medium registered in the name of a person, to issue tickets to a third party is not one contemplated under Section 143 for the purpose of considering it as an offence. As has been noted Section 143 was enacted much before the advent of e-ticket system. The railway's stand is that creating a fake user ID for issuing railway ticket is an illegal act attracting an offence under Section 143 of the Act. I am afraid that this has any merit to constitute an offence. First of all, the registration of the user ID with IRCTC is regulated by the terms and condition of the IRCTC. If there is any violation by use of such facility with the IRCTC, it is open for IRCTC to take appropriate action to de- register such registered users. Misusing a user ID for purchasing a ticket by genuine person is not an offence as contemplated under Section 143 of the Act. There is no sale of ticket by the petitioner as even admitted in the counter, the sale is being conducted by IRCTC. THe use of computer or use of printer for printing ticket purchased by a traveller cannot be deemed as sale effected by the owner of the computer or printer. Procuring tickets has to be understood as providing or giving tickets to the travellers. Admittedly tickets are procured by the genuine travellers. When legislature considered an actionable wrong in a particular manner in a brick and mortar business, it cannot be applied to an online business. The offence is not attracted even if one has to assume that action of the accused would amount to supplying tickets. The Penal Provision clearly mandates that tickets have to be procured by the offender. Admittedly tickets are purchased by the genuine travellers. The dictionary meaning of procure is \"to obtain by some efforts or means or acquire (see Webster's Comprehensive dictionary, encyclopedic edition). To constitute a criminal offence under Section 143 of the Act, the action of the accused must be a kind of act as prescribed in the Penal Provision.\"Ajay SethiAdvocate, Mumbai98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi"

    "answer": "The provision of law is very clear, which is reproduced below to refresh your memory:Section 143(1) in The Railways Act, 1989(1) If any person, not being a railway servant or an agent authorised in this behalf,—(a) carries on the business of procuring and supplying tickets for travel on a railway or from reserved accommodation for journey in a train; or(b) purchases or sells or attempts to purchase or sell tickets with a view to carrying on any such business either by himself or by any other person, he shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine which may extend to ten thousand rupees, or with both, and shall also forfeit the tickets which he so procures, supplies, purchases, sells or attempts to purchase or sell: Provided that in the absence of special and adequate reasons to the contrary to be mentioned in judgment of the court, such punishment shall not be less than imprisonment for a term of one month or a fine of five thousand rupees.From the above provisions it can be found anyone indulges in such activities as mentioned above, then they are liable to be punished as per law.The purchase of e-tickets or online tickets also come under the same provision.You cannot interpret the law as what you have mentioned in your query.It is about illegal selling of railway ticket, hence the latest mode of procuring tickets i.e., e-tickets or online tickets are also automatically included as railway travel ticket, hence there is no necessity to amend the said provision of law, and in my opinion the law stands good for all kinds of railway travel ticket"

Therefore, buying or selling railway e-tickets booked under personal user IDs without authorization is a punishable offence under Section 143 of the Railways Act, 1989.The Indian Railways issued a circular in 2017 to this effect, clarifying that the Railways Act, 1989, is applicable to e-tickets as well.

In case the institute refuses to refund the amount, you may consider approaching the consumer court or seeking legal advice from a qualified lawyer.Regarding the police complaint, you may file it with your local police station. The police may then transfer the complaint to the relevant police station in Jaipur or Delhi for further investigation, depending on the jurisdiction of the case. The chances of getting your money back will depend on the specific facts and circumstances of each case and the legal remedies available. It is recommended to consult with a qualified lawyer to determine the best course of action and to understand the legal options available to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Neighbour claiming land while they dont have document",
    "answer": "Dear client,Yes, you can file a case against your neighbor to claim back your 4 feet land that he has illegally occupied. You can file a civil suit for declaration of title and recovery of possession under Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. In this suit, you can seek a declaration from the court that you are the owner of the land in question, and ask for an order of possession directing your neighbor to vacate the land and hand it over to you.It is important to note that in such cases, the burden of proof lies on the plaintiff (i.e., you) to prove that the land belongs to you and has been illegally occupied by the defendant (i.e., your neighbor). Therefore, you will need to produce all the relevant documents such as the sale deed, link documents, survey plan, etc., to prove your ownership of the land.As far as the chances of success are concerned, it will depend on the strength of your case and the evidence that you are able to produce in support of your claim. If you are able to establish your ownership of the land and that your neighbor has illegally occupied it, then you are likely to get a favorable judgment.Regarding the effect of the case on your current construction, it is possible that the court may order a stay on your construction until the dispute is resolved. Therefore, it is important to consult with a lawyer and take appropriate legal advice before initiating any legal action.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,If you file a case against your neighbor for illegal occupation of your land, it may affect the ongoing construction work, as the court may pass an injunction order to stop the construction until the dispute is resolved. However, it is important to protect your legal rights and interests, and it is better to take legal action than to let someone illegally occupy your property.As an NRI, you can appoint an attorney or a legal representative in India to represent you in court. Your attorney can file the case on your behalf, represent you in court hearings, and carry out legal procedures in your absence. You will need to provide your attorney with the relevant documents and information related to the case, and also authorize them to act on your behalf through a power of attorney.It is important to note that you may be required to appear in court at least once during the proceedings, depending on the nature of the case and the court's discretion. However, your attorney can guide you on this matter and make arrangements accordingly.The procedure for filing a case for illegal occupation of land involves drafting a plaint, paying court fees, and submitting the same to the relevant court. The court will then issue a notice to the respondent (your neighbor), and the case will proceed in accordance with the legal procedures.It is advisable to consult with a local lawyer in India who can guide you on the specific legal procedures and requirements in your case, and also represent you in court if necessary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This evidence can be useful in court to support your claims and help you obtain a favorable outcome.

This may include factors such as the child's age, health, and educational needs, as well as each parent's ability to provide for the child's physical and emotional needs. If you are working full-time, you may need to demonstrate to the court that you have adequate childcare arrangements in place to ensure that the child's needs are being met while you are at work.To start the divorce process in India, you will need to file a petition for divorce in the appropriate court.

    "question": "Divorce in US",
    "answer": "Indian family law and US family laws are different . If you want the benefit of Indian law then follow it .You can file divorce case against the husband as per US law. But all the decree from US is not valid in India .Foreign court decree of divorce or dissolution of marriage can be valid in India provided such decree is according to the provision of law in India as provided under section 13 of the Civil Procedure Code and Principle of law as laid down by the Indian courts. A foreign court divorce decree may be valid in India ONLY if the spouse had lived in that country and had consented to that country's jurisdiction.Under Section 13(e), Civil Procedure Code, the foreign judgment is open to challenge \"where it has been obtained by fraud\". Fraud as to the merits of the respondent's case may be ignored and his allegation that he and his wife \"have lived separate and apart for more than three (3) consecutive years without cohabitation and that there is no possibility of a reconciliation\" may be assumed to be true. But fraud as to the jurisdiction of the foreign court is a vital consideration in the recognition of the decree passed by that court.As per the latest Supreme Court judgment which had held that a decree of divorce granted by a foreign court is not valid in India if the ground is not recognized by Indian law.A foreign judgment shall be conclusive as to any matter thereby directly adjudicated upon between the same parties or between parties under whom they or any of them claim litigating under the same title except-(a) where it has not been pronounced by a Court of competent jurisdiction;(b) where it has not been given on the merits of the case;(c) where it appears on the face of the proceedings to be founded on an incorrect view of international law or a refusal to recognise the law of India in cases in which such law is applicable;(d) where the proceedings in which the judgment was obtained are opposed to natural justice;(e) where it has been obtained by fraud;(f) where it sustains a claim founded on a breach of any law in force in India.So these six conditions are fulfilled by such foreign judgment/decree of divorce then it will be valid for dissolving such Indian marriage as has been held by the Supreme Court of India in several of its judgments.If your husband has accepted the authority of US court, it cannot be open to her to later question the authority of the US court.Decree of Divorce by a foreign Court is also valid in India if there is no challenge by the other party. If both of you go formutual consent divorce, then it is recognised and valid in India.Recognition of decrees and orders passed by foreign courts remains an eternal dilemma in as much as whenever called upon to do so, Courts in this country are bound to determine the validity of such decrees and orders keeping in view the provisions of Section 13 of theCode of Criminal Procedure1908 as amended by the Amendment Act of 1999 and 2002. The duty of a Court exercising its Parens Patraie jurisdiction as in cases involving custody of minor children is all the more onerous. Welfare of the minor in such cases being the paramount consideration; the court has to approach the issue regarding the validity and enforcement of a foreign decree or order carefully.The Supreme Court of India has consistently held that in deciding cases of child custody ‘the first and paramount consideration is the welfare and interest of the child and not the rights of the parents under a statuteAjay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

However, if you plan to live or work in India, it is advisable to register your marriage with the Indian administration.To register your marriage in India, you need to visit the local Registrar of Marriages office in the area where the marriage took place. The documents required for registration may vary depending on the state where you want to register the marriage. The importance of registering the marriage in both countries is to ensure legal validity of the marriage in both countries, and for easy processing of visa and other legal documents.The certificate of registration issued by the local Registrar of Marriages in India will be considered as the primary document. The date of marriage mentioned in the Indian marriage certificate will be considered as the primary date of marriage.For the OCI card, you will need to provide the French marriage certificate and the Indian marriage certificate if you have registered your marriage in India.Apostille is a verification process done for documents to be recognized in another country. It is a form of authentication that certifies the origin of the document.Apostille can be done remotely through an authorized agency or service. You need to check with the embassy or consulate of the country where you want to get the documents apostilled for the specific requirements and procedures.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "According to theHindu Succession Act, 1956, the property of a deceased person is inherited by his legal heirs. In this case, Mr. Z's property would be inherited equally by his two sons, X and Y. However, since both X and Y are deceased, their respective shares in the property would be inherited by their legal heirs. X had one son, A, who is also deceased, but had a son named B. Y had five sons, named C, D, E, F, and G. Therefore, the property would be divided equally among B, C, D, E, F, and G, with each person entitled to a share of 100/6 = 16.67 (rounded off) rupees.Any partition of immovable property must be made by a registered partition deed. The partition deed must be signed by all legal heirs, and each of them must receive their respective share of the property. If any legal heir does not consent to the partition, they can challenge it in court. If the partition does not follow these legal requirements, it may be considered invalid. Therefore, an unregistered partition of property without the consent of all legal heirs would not be considered valid in the eyes of the law. If any legal heir, such as the son or daughter of G, has not signed the partition agreement, it could be challenged in court, and the partition may be considered invalid."

    "answer": "Dear client ,The property of Mr. Z will be inherited by his legal heirs according to the Indian Succession Act, 1925. Since X and Y both died before Mr. Z, their share of the property will pass on to their legal heirs.In this case, X has one son A, who has died, leaving behind his son B. So, B will inherit the share of his father X.Y has 5 sons C, D, E, F, G. Since Y died before Mr. Z, his share of the property will pass on to his legal heirs. In this case, the legal heirs of Y are his sons C, D, E, F, G.Therefore, the property will be divided into 6 equal shares (1 share for each legal heir) and B, C, D, E, F, and G will each inherit 1/6th of the property.Each legal heir will inherit 1/6th of the property. So, in this case, B, C, D, E, F, and G will each inherit Rs. 16.67 (100/6).An unregistered partition of property among legal heirs may be considered valid if it is done with mutual consent and the shares are defined clearly. However, it is always advisable to get the partition deed registered to avoid any future disputes. If any legal heir has not signed the partition deed, their share may not be affected, and they may still be entitled to their share of the property as per the legal inheritance rules. Therefore, it is important to ensure that all legal heirs sign the partition deed to avoid any future disputes.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Civil",
    "answer": "Dear client,If the khata number is wrongly mentioned in the gift deed, it could potentially create confusion and disputes related to the ownership of the property. However, it would depend on how the property is described in the gift deed, and whether it is clear from the document which specific plot was intended to be gifted to your grandfather.Regarding the grandson of X who has taken illegal possession of the property, you can file a case of eviction against him in the appropriate court. You would need to provide evidence to prove your ownership of the property, such as the registered gift deed and any other relevant documents.Regarding the donation made by the son of X to the school, if the plot of land donated was legally owned by him, it would be difficult to demolish the school. However, if the donation was made illegally or if the land was not owned by him, you may be able to take legal action to reclaim the property.

    "answer": "Dear client,Firstly, I'm sorry for your loss. In order to transfer the ownership of the flat to your name or to you and your wife's name, you will need to follow the legal process as per the laws applicable in Hyderabad.Since there was no nomination system in place, and the society has not issued any nomination forms, you will need to obtain a Succession Certificate from the court. This certificate will establish your legal right to the property as the son of the deceased father.Regarding the letter given to the builder for nomination, it is possible that the society may accept it as a valid nomination document. However, it is best to confirm this with the society or seek legal advice.As for the Will, even though it is not registered, it can still be used as evidence of your father's intention to leave the property to you and your wife. However, it is advisable to get it registered at the earliest.To initiate the transfer process, you will need to submit the required documents, such as the Succession Certificate and the Will, to the society or the Registrar office. The society may initiate the transfer process, or you may need to go to the Registrar office and complete the formalities there.Once the ownership is transferred to your name or to both you and your wife's name, it is important to ensure that all the relevant documents, such as the Sale Deed, Khata Certificate, and Property Tax receipts, are updated accordingly. This will help avoid any legal issues in the future, especially when you decide to sell the property.In conclusion, it is advisable to seek legal advice to ensure a smooth and fool-proof transfer process of the property ownership to your name or to you and your wife's name.LAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Firstly, I'm sorry for your loss. In order to transfer the ownership of the flat to your name or to you and your wife's name, you will need to follow the legal process as per the laws applicable in Hyderabad.Since there was no nomination system in place, and the society has not issued any nomination forms, you will need to obtain a Succession Certificate from the court. This certificate will establish your legal right to the property as the son of the deceased father.Regarding the letter given to the builder for nomination, it is possible that the society may accept it as a valid nomination document. However, it is best to confirm this with the society or seek legal advice.As for the Will, even though it is not registered, it can still be used as evidence of your father's intention to leave the property to you and your wife. However, it is advisable to get it registered at the earliest.To initiate the transfer process, you will need to submit the required documents, such as the Succession Certificate and the Will, to the society or the Registrar office. The society may initiate the transfer process, or you may need to go to the Registrar office and complete the formalities there.Once the ownership is transferred to your name or to both you and your wife's name, it is important to ensure that all the relevant documents, such as the Sale Deed, Khata Certificate, and Property Tax receipts, are updated accordingly. This will help avoid any legal issues in the future, especially when you decide to sell the property.In conclusion, it is advisable to seek legal advice to ensure a smooth and fool-proof transfer process of the property ownership to your name or to you and your wife's name.LAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

You have used agricultural income savings to purchase land A and have been farming on it for more than 2 years. However, you have received an order denying exemption under section 54B of the Income Tax Act, which provides for exemption on capital gains arising from the transfer of land used for agricultural purposes, due to a variation of one to two months in the period of two years of farming on land A.In this situation, you may need to file an appeal against the order denying exemption under section 54B. You can approach a tax consultant or a lawyer to help you with the appeal process. However, it is important to note that the success of the appeal may depend on several factors such as the specific facts of the case, the evidence available, and the interpretation of the relevant tax laws.Regarding the Vivad se Vishwas Scheme, it is a scheme introduced by the Government of India to provide relief to taxpayers who have disputes with the income tax department. It allows taxpayers to settle their disputes by paying the disputed tax amount with certain concessions. If you have already opted for this scheme and paid the disputed tax amount, you may have to check with the concerned authorities regarding the status of your case and the applicability of the scheme in your case.Overall, it is advisable to seek professional help from a tax consultant or a lawyer to understand your options and to proceed with the appeal process.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Neighbour claiming land while they dont have document",
    "answer": "Dear client,Yes, you can file a case against your neighbor to claim back your 4 feet land that he has illegally occupied. You can file a civil suit for declaration of title and recovery of possession under Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. In this suit, you can seek a declaration from the court that you are the owner of the land in question, and ask for an order of possession directing your neighbor to vacate the land and hand it over to you.It is important to note that in such cases, the burden of proof lies on the plaintiff (i.e., you) to prove that the land belongs to you and has been illegally occupied by the defendant (i.e., your neighbor). Therefore, you will need to produce all the relevant documents such as the sale deed, link documents, survey plan, etc., to prove your ownership of the land.As far as the chances of success are concerned, it will depend on the strength of your case and the evidence that you are able to produce in support of your claim. If you are able to establish your ownership of the land and that your neighbor has illegally occupied it, then you are likely to get a favorable judgment.Regarding the effect of the case on your current construction, it is possible that the court may order a stay on your construction until the dispute is resolved. Therefore, it is important to consult with a lawyer and take appropriate legal advice before initiating any legal action.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, it is important to protect your legal rights and interests, and it is better to take legal action than to let someone illegally occupy your property.As an NRI, you can appoint an attorney or a legal representative in India to represent you in court. Your attorney can file the case on your behalf, represent you in court hearings, and carry out legal procedures in your absence. You will need to provide your attorney with the relevant documents and information related to the case, and also authorize them to act on your behalf through a power of attorney.It is important to note that you may be required to appear in court at least once during the proceedings, depending on the nature of the case and the court's discretion. However, your attorney can guide you on this matter and make arrangements accordingly.The procedure for filing a case for illegal occupation of land involves drafting a plaint, paying court fees, and submitting the same to the relevant court. The court will then issue a notice to the respondent (your neighbor), and the case will proceed in accordance with the legal procedures.It is advisable to consult with a local lawyer in India who can guide you on the specific legal procedures and requirements in your case, and also represent you in court if necessary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The apartment cannot compel you to stick their society sticker on your vehicle as it is your personal choice. However, it is possible that the apartment has made it mandatory for all vehicles parked in the parking spot to have the society sticker as a part of their security measures. In such a case, you may need to comply with the rules of the apartment or look for alternative parking options.It is not advisable to take the law into your own hands and hire a weldor to cut through the locks as this can result in criminal charges against you. Instead, you can take legal action against the apartment for their actions and seek a remedy through the appropriate legal channels.You can file a complaint with the local police or file a civil suit against the apartment for violation of your rights as a resident. It is advisable to seek legal counsel from a lawyer who specializes in property law to understand your legal options and the appropriate course of action.

Even that may not be effective owing to various reasons, because by expeditious trial means t he cannot avoid the procedural aspects  or seek them to be  dispensed.If necessary your advocate can file an advance hearing petition to hear the case in advance for the reasons stated therein, if the court is satisfied with the reasons stated therein it may allow the case to be advanced for hearing.2. Studying LL.B  cannot be claimed as a right to file petition on your own before high court, however you can file a writ petition as a party in person provided you know the procedures of law as prescribed for high court practice.Speedy trial is a fundamental right implicit in the guarantee of life and personal liberty enshrined inArticle 21 of the Constitutionand any accused who is denied this right of speedy trial is entitled to approach Supreme Court under Article 32 for the purpose of enforcing such right. Hence you can file a petition before high court as a party in person too provided you have sufficient reasons to state that the proceedings are intentionally delayed or protracted.3. If the circumstances of the cited authority suits your own case situation, and the ruling given therein  applies to  your situation, then you can rely upon this to your case but of course you can be able to use this only at the time of final hearing in the proposed writ petition.4.  The procedures of law has to be followed while you are pursuing a case through court.You cannot skip the procedures for the reasons you state.It is pertinent to implead the LRs of the deceased respondent or else your case will be dismissed for not taking proper steps to implead the LRs of the deceased respondents.you can ask your  advocate the reasons, it is not known what your advocate has done on your case, hence without knowing the proper details no opinion can be rendered on your advocate's acts, if you don't trust your advocate anymore, you are at your liberty to change your lawyer at this moment too.You can discuss the details of your case with any lawyer of this forum by getting their contact details from this forum and opt for phone consultation so that you can get more clarity on the subject.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

It's possible that the judge may not be happy about the request, but it's your advocate's duty to represent your interests and seek the best possible outcome for you. However, there is a risk that your advocate's other cases before the judge may be impacted if the judge perceives the request as inappropriate or aggressive.You can file a writ petition in the High Court if the trial court refuses to expedite the case. However, the decision to file a writ petition should be taken only after considering all the relevant factors, such as the merits of the case, the potential costs involved, and the time and effort required. It's also important to note that a writ petition can take several months or even years to be decided, depending on the complexity of the case and the workload of the court. The costs of a writ petition can also vary depending on the nature of the case and the fees charged by the lawyer. If you are representing yourself in the writ petition, you may still need to consult with a lawyer to ensure that you are complying with all the relevant procedures and rules.The \"Rahul Shah case Vs Jitendra Kumar Gandhi\" case and guidelines to dispose of final decree proceedings in 6 months should be followed by the trial court in your case. The Supreme Court has issued these guidelines to ensure that final decree proceedings are disposed of in a timely and efficient manner.Your advocate may be hesitant to use the \"Rahul Shah case Vs Jitendra Kumar Gandhi\" case and guidelines to expedite the case because it's ultimately up to the judge's discretion.

It is a matter of their eligibility or entitlement for a share in the property.As the court has already decided this issue in the preliminary decree, during which neither the adopted son nor his adoptive mother has contested the same so far, any petition to reopen the preliminary decree case may not be maintainable.Besides it is also not known whether it was a valid adoption etc. Hence you can challenge his entry accordingly.2. The answer suits this question too.3. It depends on the developments which cannot be predicted at this stage, hence no proper opinion can be suggested now to your this question.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Can I file a WRIT petition case in High court to expedite final decree proceedings",
    "answer": "Dear client,The adopted son of your father's elder sister cannot ask for a share for her deceased mother in the partition suit which is now in execution phase. This is because your father's elder sister was not made a party to the suit and the decree is passed only for shares between your father and his brothers. The adopted son of your father's elder sister has no legal right to claim a share in the ancestral property.The adopted son cannot implead in the same suit after being silent till the preliminary decree is passed. He cannot file a new suit as well. The reason is that the partition suit has already been decided by a preliminary decree in 2011, and it is now in the execution phase. The adopted son had the opportunity to join the suit during the pendency of the suit, but since he did not join the suit, he has lost his right to claim a share in the ancestral property.If the court allows the petition of the adopted son for his mother's share, the process to send notices to all respondents, trial, witness, arguments all these stages will be there. This is because the partition suit has already been decided by a preliminary decree, and the execution phase is ongoing. If the adopted son files a petition claiming his mother's share, it will be treated as a separate case, and the court will have to follow the usual procedure for deciding the case.In conclusion, the adopted son of your father's elder sister has no legal right to claim a share in the ancestral property, since his mother was not made a party to the suit, and the decree was passed only for shares between your father and his brothers. If he files a petition, it will be treated as a separate case, and the court will have to follow the usual procedure for deciding the case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, the company has changed the notice period to one year, which is sub judice.

They may seek damages from you for losses they incur due to your early departure, such as the cost of hiring and training a replacement. The company can also choose to withhold your dues, such as salary and other benefits, until you complete the required notice period.To leave legally, you can try to negotiate with the company and explain your reasons for leaving. If they agree, you may be able to work out a mutually acceptable solution, such as reducing the notice period or paying compensation in lieu of notice.If you cannot come to an agreement with the company, you may need to consult with a lawyer to understand your legal options and potential consequences of leaving without serving the notice period.

Many of the educated parents also has the same mindset. Many of them due to relatives pressure or in the fear of societal stigma wants their daughters to get marry earlier and thus forces their daughter by the use of coercion , guilt, threats, blackmail harassment, financial pressure, emotional pressure, physical violence, psychological duress or might even be tricked into getting married.A force marriage is illegal it also happens if the daughter is caught or wishes to marry somebody she loves who is not of the same caste ,class , category, religion, even after the rapidly changing society many Indian parents fails to accept the generation growth and wants their daughters to marry in the same caste as they belongs if she wishes to marry somebody she loves and this also violates her right to choose who she wants marry which is guaranteed under Article 21 of the Indian and it is stated under Human Rights Charter within the meaning of the right to start a family.Even the law says the validity of the marriage is only when both the parities gives free consent to marriage otherwise it is treated as nullity of the marriage.

This evidence can be useful in court to support your claims and help you obtain a favorable outcome. However, you should consult with a local family lawyer to determine the specific types of evidence that are admissible in your jurisdiction.In terms of child custody, the court will consider a variety of factors in determining what is in the best interests of the child. This may include factors such as the child's age, health, and educational needs, as well as each parent's ability to provide for the child's physical and emotional needs. If you are working full-time, you may need to demonstrate to the court that you have adequate childcare arrangements in place to ensure that the child's needs are being met while you are at work.To start the divorce process in India, you will need to file a petition for divorce in the appropriate court. The specific requirements for filing for divorce may vary depending on the jurisdiction, so you should consult with a local family lawyer to determine the specific requirements in your area. In some cases, it may be possible to file for divorce online, but this will also depend on the specific procedures in your jurisdiction.If you are unable to appear in person for the court hearings, you may be able to appear by video conference or telephone, depending on the specific procedures in your jurisdiction.

    "question": "Divorce in US",
    "answer": "Indian family law and US family laws are different . If you want the benefit of Indian law then follow it .You can file divorce case against the husband as per US law. But all the decree from US is not valid in India .Foreign court decree of divorce or dissolution of marriage can be valid in India provided such decree is according to the provision of law in India as provided under section 13 of the Civil Procedure Code and Principle of law as laid down by the Indian courts. A foreign court divorce decree may be valid in India ONLY if the spouse had lived in that country and had consented to that country's jurisdiction.Under Section 13(e), Civil Procedure Code, the foreign judgment is open to challenge \"where it has been obtained by fraud\". Fraud as to the merits of the respondent's case may be ignored and his allegation that he and his wife \"have lived separate and apart for more than three (3) consecutive years without cohabitation and that there is no possibility of a reconciliation\" may be assumed to be true. But fraud as to the jurisdiction of the foreign court is a vital consideration in the recognition of the decree passed by that court.As per the latest Supreme Court judgment which had held that a decree of divorce granted by a foreign court is not valid in India if the ground is not recognized by Indian law.A foreign judgment shall be conclusive as to any matter thereby directly adjudicated upon between the same parties or between parties under whom they or any of them claim litigating under the same title except-(a) where it has not been pronounced by a Court of competent jurisdiction;(b) where it has not been given on the merits of the case;(c) where it appears on the face of the proceedings to be founded on an incorrect view of international law or a refusal to recognise the law of India in cases in which such law is applicable;(d) where the proceedings in which the judgment was obtained are opposed to natural justice;(e) where it has been obtained by fraud;(f) where it sustains a claim founded on a breach of any law in force in India.So these six conditions are fulfilled by such foreign judgment/decree of divorce then it will be valid for dissolving such Indian marriage as has been held by the Supreme Court of India in several of its judgments.If your husband has accepted the authority of US court, it cannot be open to her to later question the authority of the US court.Decree of Divorce by a foreign Court is also valid in India if there is no challenge by the other party. If both of you go formutual consent divorce, then it is recognised and valid in India.Recognition of decrees and orders passed by foreign courts remains an eternal dilemma in as much as whenever called upon to do so, Courts in this country are bound to determine the validity of such decrees and orders keeping in view the provisions of Section 13 of theCode of Criminal Procedure1908 as amended by the Amendment Act of 1999 and 2002. The duty of a Court exercising its Parens Patraie jurisdiction as in cases involving custody of minor children is all the more onerous. Welfare of the minor in such cases being the paramount consideration; the court has to approach the issue regarding the validity and enforcement of a foreign decree or order carefully.The Supreme Court of India has consistently held that in deciding cases of child custody ‘the first and paramount consideration is the welfare and interest of the child and not the rights of the parents under a statuteAjay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

However, you have received an order denying exemption under section 54B of the Income Tax Act, which provides for exemption on capital gains arising from the transfer of land used for agricultural purposes, due to a variation of one to two months in the period of two years of farming on land A.In this situation, you may need to file an appeal against the order denying exemption under section 54B. You can approach a tax consultant or a lawyer to help you with the appeal process. However, it is important to note that the success of the appeal may depend on several factors such as the specific facts of the case, the evidence available, and the interpretation of the relevant tax laws.Regarding the Vivad se Vishwas Scheme, it is a scheme introduced by the Government of India to provide relief to taxpayers who have disputes with the income tax department.

    "answer": "Dear client,If you are considering filing for divorce, it is important to collect evidence that supports your case, such as evidence of your spouse's infidelity or neglect of the child. This evidence can be useful in court to support your claims and help you obtain a favorable outcome. However, you should consult with a local family lawyer to determine the specific types of evidence that are admissible in your jurisdiction.In terms of child custody, the court will consider a variety of factors in determining what is in the best interests of the child. This may include factors such as the child's age, health, and educational needs, as well as each parent's ability to provide for the child's physical and emotional needs. If you are working full-time, you may need to demonstrate to the court that you have adequate childcare arrangements in place to ensure that the child's needs are being met while you are at work.To start the divorce process in India, you will need to file a petition for divorce in the appropriate court. The specific requirements for filing for divorce may vary depending on the jurisdiction, so you should consult with a local family lawyer to determine the specific requirements in your area. In some cases, it may be possible to file for divorce online, but this will also depend on the specific procedures in your jurisdiction.If you are unable to appear in person for the court hearings, you may be able to appear by video conference or telephone, depending on the specific procedures in your jurisdiction.

    "question": "Divorce in US",
    "answer": "Indian family law and US family laws are different . If you want the benefit of Indian law then follow it .You can file divorce case against the husband as per US law. But all the decree from US is not valid in India .Foreign court decree of divorce or dissolution of marriage can be valid in India provided such decree is according to the provision of law in India as provided under section 13 of the Civil Procedure Code and Principle of law as laid down by the Indian courts. A foreign court divorce decree may be valid in India ONLY if the spouse had lived in that country and had consented to that country's jurisdiction.Under Section 13(e), Civil Procedure Code, the foreign judgment is open to challenge \"where it has been obtained by fraud\". Fraud as to the merits of the respondent's case may be ignored and his allegation that he and his wife \"have lived separate and apart for more than three (3) consecutive years without cohabitation and that there is no possibility of a reconciliation\" may be assumed to be true. But fraud as to the jurisdiction of the foreign court is a vital consideration in the recognition of the decree passed by that court.As per the latest Supreme Court judgment which had held that a decree of divorce granted by a foreign court is not valid in India if the ground is not recognized by Indian law.A foreign judgment shall be conclusive as to any matter thereby directly adjudicated upon between the same parties or between parties under whom they or any of them claim litigating under the same title except-(a) where it has not been pronounced by a Court of competent jurisdiction;(b) where it has not been given on the merits of the case;(c) where it appears on the face of the proceedings to be founded on an incorrect view of international law or a refusal to recognise the law of India in cases in which such law is applicable;(d) where the proceedings in which the judgment was obtained are opposed to natural justice;(e) where it has been obtained by fraud;(f) where it sustains a claim founded on a breach of any law in force in India.So these six conditions are fulfilled by such foreign judgment/decree of divorce then it will be valid for dissolving such Indian marriage as has been held by the Supreme Court of India in several of its judgments.If your husband has accepted the authority of US court, it cannot be open to her to later question the authority of the US court.Decree of Divorce by a foreign Court is also valid in India if there is no challenge by the other party. If both of you go formutual consent divorce, then it is recognised and valid in India.Recognition of decrees and orders passed by foreign courts remains an eternal dilemma in as much as whenever called upon to do so, Courts in this country are bound to determine the validity of such decrees and orders keeping in view the provisions of Section 13 of theCode of Criminal Procedure1908 as amended by the Amendment Act of 1999 and 2002. The duty of a Court exercising its Parens Patraie jurisdiction as in cases involving custody of minor children is all the more onerous. Welfare of the minor in such cases being the paramount consideration; the court has to approach the issue regarding the validity and enforcement of a foreign decree or order carefully.The Supreme Court of India has consistently held that in deciding cases of child custody ‘the first and paramount consideration is the welfare and interest of the child and not the rights of the parents under a statuteAjay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

Without these approvals, getting an A khata may not be possible, and it could lead to legal complications.With respect to the bank providing loans for the property, it's possible that the bank may not be aware of the deviation from the approved plan. It's important for you to do your own due diligence and verify all information provided by the builder before making any decisions.It's always advisable to consult with a local property lawyer who can help you conduct a thorough due diligence and provide you with the necessary legal advice before purchasing a property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,I'm sorry to hear about your situation. As a nominee and legal heir, you are entitled to receive the Hereditary Renewal Commission, Gratuity, and other benefits that your father was eligible for as an LIC agent.Firstly, you should try to resolve the matter through the LIC branch where your father was associated. You can request a meeting with the Development Officer in charge of your father's agency and present all the necessary documents to support your claim. If the officer is unresponsive or unhelpful, you can escalate the matter to higher authorities within LIC.If you are still unable to receive a satisfactory response from LIC, you may consider filing a legal case against the Development Officer or LIC. You can approach the Consumer Forum or the Civil Court, depending on the amount of money involved in the claim. In case you suspect foul play, you can also file a complaint with the police.As for Public Litigation Interest (PIL), it is a legal mechanism used in India to bring matters of public importance to the attention of the court. While your case may not necessarily qualify as a PIL, you can certainly seek legal assistance to pursue your claim through the appropriate legal channels.It is advisable to seek the guidance of a lawyer who specializes in such matters to understand the legal options available to you and to represent you in court if necessary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Before making any payment, it is important to verify the status of the mortgage with the relevant authority to ensure that the builder is authorized to release the mortgage of the particular flat with the money you pay. Additionally, you should also verify the status of the occupancy certificate (OC) and completion certificate (CC) with the local authorities to confirm that the project is compliant with all the necessary regulations and safety standards.If you are satisfied with the status of the mortgage and the necessary certificates, you can proceed with the purchase. However, it is recommended that you enter into a written agreement with the builder, specifying the payment terms and conditions, timelines for obtaining the necessary certificates, and consequences for delay or non-compliance.If the builder is demanding full payment upfront, you can negotiate to pay a token amount as advance to secure the flat, subject to the necessary certificates being obtained within the agreed timelines. You can also include a clause in the agreement that allows you to cancel the agreement and seek a refund if the certificates are not obtained within the agreed timelines.In case of any dispute or non-compliance, you can seek legal recourse through the appropriate authorities or courts.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In this case, Mr. Z's property would be inherited equally by his two sons, X and Y. However, since both X and Y are deceased, their respective shares in the property would be inherited by their legal heirs. X had one son, A, who is also deceased, but had a son named B. Y had five sons, named C, D, E, F, and G. Therefore, the property would be divided equally among B, C, D, E, F, and G, with each person entitled to a share of 100/6 = 16.67 (rounded off) rupees.Any partition of immovable property must be made by a registered partition deed. The partition deed must be signed by all legal heirs, and each of them must receive their respective share of the property. If any legal heir does not consent to the partition, they can challenge it in court. If the partition does not follow these legal requirements, it may be considered invalid. Therefore, an unregistered partition of property without the consent of all legal heirs would not be considered valid in the eyes of the law. If any legal heir, such as the son or daughter of G, has not signed the partition agreement, it could be challenged in court, and the partition may be considered invalid."

Since X and Y both died before Mr. Z, their share of the property will pass on to their legal heirs.In this case, X has one son A, who has died, leaving behind his son B. So, B will inherit the share of his father X.Y has 5 sons C, D, E, F, G. Since Y died before Mr. Z, his share of the property will pass on to his legal heirs. In this case, the legal heirs of Y are his sons C, D, E, F, G.Therefore, the property will be divided into 6 equal shares (1 share for each legal heir) and B, C, D, E, F, and G will each inherit 1/6th of the property.Each legal heir will inherit 1/6th of the property. So, in this case, B, C, D, E, F, and G will each inherit Rs. 16.67 (100/6).An unregistered partition of property among legal heirs may be considered valid if it is done with mutual consent and the shares are defined clearly. However, it is always advisable to get the partition deed registered to avoid any future disputes. If any legal heir has not signed the partition deed, their share may not be affected, and they may still be entitled to their share of the property as per the legal inheritance rules.

    "answer": "Dear client,It seems that you have sold a land B and used the sale proceeds to purchase land A, both of which were used for agricultural purposes. You have used agricultural income savings to purchase land A and have been farming on it for more than 2 years. However, you have received an order denying exemption under section 54B of the Income Tax Act, which provides for exemption on capital gains arising from the transfer of land used for agricultural purposes, due to a variation of one to two months in the period of two years of farming on land A.In this situation, you may need to file an appeal against the order denying exemption under section 54B. You can approach a tax consultant or a lawyer to help you with the appeal process. However, it is important to note that the success of the appeal may depend on several factors such as the specific facts of the case, the evidence available, and the interpretation of the relevant tax laws.Regarding the Vivad se Vishwas Scheme, it is a scheme introduced by the Government of India to provide relief to taxpayers who have disputes with the income tax department. It allows taxpayers to settle their disputes by paying the disputed tax amount with certain concessions. If you have already opted for this scheme and paid the disputed tax amount, you may have to check with the concerned authorities regarding the status of your case and the applicability of the scheme in your case.Overall, it is advisable to seek professional help from a tax consultant or a lawyer to understand your options and to proceed with the appeal process.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Yes, you can file a case against your neighbor to claim back your 4 feet land that he has illegally occupied. You can file a civil suit for declaration of title and recovery of possession under Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. In this suit, you can seek a declaration from the court that you are the owner of the land in question, and ask for an order of possession directing your neighbor to vacate the land and hand it over to you.It is important to note that in such cases, the burden of proof lies on the plaintiff (i.e., you) to prove that the land belongs to you and has been illegally occupied by the defendant (i.e., your neighbor). Therefore, you will need to produce all the relevant documents such as the sale deed, link documents, survey plan, etc., to prove your ownership of the land.As far as the chances of success are concerned, it will depend on the strength of your case and the evidence that you are able to produce in support of your claim. If you are able to establish your ownership of the land and that your neighbor has illegally occupied it, then you are likely to get a favorable judgment.Regarding the effect of the case on your current construction, it is possible that the court may order a stay on your construction until the dispute is resolved. Therefore, it is important to consult with a lawyer and take appropriate legal advice before initiating any legal action.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "1.  There is no provision in law for the advocate to file a petition for an expeditious trial before the same trial court, however he can file a petition before high court seeking an expeditious trial. Even that may not be effective owing to various reasons, because by expeditious trial means t he cannot avoid the procedural aspects  or seek them to be  dispensed.If necessary your advocate can file an advance hearing petition to hear the case in advance for the reasons stated therein, if the court is satisfied with the reasons stated therein it may allow the case to be advanced for hearing.2. Studying LL.B  cannot be claimed as a right to file petition on your own before high court, however you can file a writ petition as a party in person provided you know the procedures of law as prescribed for high court practice.Speedy trial is a fundamental right implicit in the guarantee of life and personal liberty enshrined inArticle 21 of the Constitutionand any accused who is denied this right of speedy trial is entitled to approach Supreme Court under Article 32 for the purpose of enforcing such right. Hence you can file a petition before high court as a party in person too provided you have sufficient reasons to state that the proceedings are intentionally delayed or protracted.3. If the circumstances of the cited authority suits your own case situation, and the ruling given therein  applies to  your situation, then you can rely upon this to your case but of course you can be able to use this only at the time of final hearing in the proposed writ petition.4.  The procedures of law has to be followed while you are pursuing a case through court.You cannot skip the procedures for the reasons you state.It is pertinent to implead the LRs of the deceased respondent or else your case will be dismissed for not taking proper steps to implead the LRs of the deceased respondents.you can ask your  advocate the reasons, it is not known what your advocate has done on your case, hence without knowing the proper details no opinion can be rendered on your advocate's acts, if you don't trust your advocate anymore, you are at your liberty to change your lawyer at this moment too.You can discuss the details of your case with any lawyer of this forum by getting their contact details from this forum and opt for phone consultation so that you can get more clarity on the subject.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear client,Yes, your advocate can appeal to the court to expedite the case, but it's up to the judge's discretion to grant the request. It's possible that the judge may not be happy about the request, but it's your advocate's duty to represent your interests and seek the best possible outcome for you. However, there is a risk that your advocate's other cases before the judge may be impacted if the judge perceives the request as inappropriate or aggressive.You can file a writ petition in the High Court if the trial court refuses to expedite the case. However, the decision to file a writ petition should be taken only after considering all the relevant factors, such as the merits of the case, the potential costs involved, and the time and effort required. It's also important to note that a writ petition can take several months or even years to be decided, depending on the complexity of the case and the workload of the court. The costs of a writ petition can also vary depending on the nature of the case and the fees charged by the lawyer. If you are representing yourself in the writ petition, you may still need to consult with a lawyer to ensure that you are complying with all the relevant procedures and rules.The \"Rahul Shah case Vs Jitendra Kumar Gandhi\" case and guidelines to dispose of final decree proceedings in 6 months should be followed by the trial court in your case. The Supreme Court has issued these guidelines to ensure that final decree proceedings are disposed of in a timely and efficient manner.Your advocate may be hesitant to use the \"Rahul Shah case Vs Jitendra Kumar Gandhi\" case and guidelines to expedite the case because it's ultimately up to the judge's discretion. It's possible that the judge may feel pressured or perceive the request as inappropriate, which could negatively impact the outcome of the case. Your advocate should use their best judgment and consider all the relevant factors before making any requests to the court..Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It is a matter of their eligibility or entitlement for a share in the property.As the court has already decided this issue in the preliminary decree, during which neither the adopted son nor his adoptive mother has contested the same so far, any petition to reopen the preliminary decree case may not be maintainable.Besides it is also not known whether it was a valid adoption etc. Hence you can challenge his entry accordingly.2. The answer suits this question too.3.

    "question": "Can I file a WRIT petition case in High court to expedite final decree proceedings",
    "answer": "Dear client,The adopted son of your father's elder sister cannot ask for a share for her deceased mother in the partition suit which is now in execution phase. This is because your father's elder sister was not made a party to the suit and the decree is passed only for shares between your father and his brothers. The adopted son of your father's elder sister has no legal right to claim a share in the ancestral property.The adopted son cannot implead in the same suit after being silent till the preliminary decree is passed. He cannot file a new suit as well. The reason is that the partition suit has already been decided by a preliminary decree in 2011, and it is now in the execution phase. The adopted son had the opportunity to join the suit during the pendency of the suit, but since he did not join the suit, he has lost his right to claim a share in the ancestral property.If the court allows the petition of the adopted son for his mother's share, the process to send notices to all respondents, trial, witness, arguments all these stages will be there. This is because the partition suit has already been decided by a preliminary decree, and the execution phase is ongoing. If the adopted son files a petition claiming his mother's share, it will be treated as a separate case, and the court will have to follow the usual procedure for deciding the case.In conclusion, the adopted son of your father's elder sister has no legal right to claim a share in the ancestral property, since his mother was not made a party to the suit, and the decree was passed only for shares between your father and his brothers. If he files a petition, it will be treated as a separate case, and the court will have to follow the usual procedure for deciding the case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,If you are considering filing for divorce, it is important to collect evidence that supports your case, such as evidence of your spouse's infidelity or neglect of the child. This evidence can be useful in court to support your claims and help you obtain a favorable outcome. However, you should consult with a local family lawyer to determine the specific types of evidence that are admissible in your jurisdiction.In terms of child custody, the court will consider a variety of factors in determining what is in the best interests of the child. This may include factors such as the child's age, health, and educational needs, as well as each parent's ability to provide for the child's physical and emotional needs. If you are working full-time, you may need to demonstrate to the court that you have adequate childcare arrangements in place to ensure that the child's needs are being met while you are at work.To start the divorce process in India, you will need to file a petition for divorce in the appropriate court. The specific requirements for filing for divorce may vary depending on the jurisdiction, so you should consult with a local family lawyer to determine the specific requirements in your area.

    "question": "Divorce in US",
    "answer": "Indian family law and US family laws are different . If you want the benefit of Indian law then follow it .You can file divorce case against the husband as per US law. But all the decree from US is not valid in India .Foreign court decree of divorce or dissolution of marriage can be valid in India provided such decree is according to the provision of law in India as provided under section 13 of the Civil Procedure Code and Principle of law as laid down by the Indian courts. A foreign court divorce decree may be valid in India ONLY if the spouse had lived in that country and had consented to that country's jurisdiction.Under Section 13(e), Civil Procedure Code, the foreign judgment is open to challenge \"where it has been obtained by fraud\". Fraud as to the merits of the respondent's case may be ignored and his allegation that he and his wife \"have lived separate and apart for more than three (3) consecutive years without cohabitation and that there is no possibility of a reconciliation\" may be assumed to be true. But fraud as to the jurisdiction of the foreign court is a vital consideration in the recognition of the decree passed by that court.As per the latest Supreme Court judgment which had held that a decree of divorce granted by a foreign court is not valid in India if the ground is not recognized by Indian law.A foreign judgment shall be conclusive as to any matter thereby directly adjudicated upon between the same parties or between parties under whom they or any of them claim litigating under the same title except-(a) where it has not been pronounced by a Court of competent jurisdiction;(b) where it has not been given on the merits of the case;(c) where it appears on the face of the proceedings to be founded on an incorrect view of international law or a refusal to recognise the law of India in cases in which such law is applicable;(d) where the proceedings in which the judgment was obtained are opposed to natural justice;(e) where it has been obtained by fraud;(f) where it sustains a claim founded on a breach of any law in force in India.So these six conditions are fulfilled by such foreign judgment/decree of divorce then it will be valid for dissolving such Indian marriage as has been held by the Supreme Court of India in several of its judgments.If your husband has accepted the authority of US court, it cannot be open to her to later question the authority of the US court.Decree of Divorce by a foreign Court is also valid in India if there is no challenge by the other party. If both of you go formutual consent divorce, then it is recognised and valid in India.Recognition of decrees and orders passed by foreign courts remains an eternal dilemma in as much as whenever called upon to do so, Courts in this country are bound to determine the validity of such decrees and orders keeping in view the provisions of Section 13 of theCode of Criminal Procedure1908 as amended by the Amendment Act of 1999 and 2002. The duty of a Court exercising its Parens Patraie jurisdiction as in cases involving custody of minor children is all the more onerous. Welfare of the minor in such cases being the paramount consideration; the court has to approach the issue regarding the validity and enforcement of a foreign decree or order carefully.The Supreme Court of India has consistently held that in deciding cases of child custody ‘the first and paramount consideration is the welfare and interest of the child and not the rights of the parents under a statuteAjay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

However, if the passage is owned as joint tenants, then the passage cannot be developed without the consent of all joint tenants.In terms of disclosures in the sale deed, it is important to disclose the existence of the common passage and any restrictions on its use or development.

You have used agricultural income savings to purchase land A and have been farming on it for more than 2 years.

You can approach a tax consultant or a lawyer to help you with the appeal process. However, it is important to note that the success of the appeal may depend on several factors such as the specific facts of the case, the evidence available, and the interpretation of the relevant tax laws.Regarding the Vivad se Vishwas Scheme, it is a scheme introduced by the Government of India to provide relief to taxpayers who have disputes with the income tax department.

    "question": "Car parking in gated apartment in Chennai",
    "answer": "Dear client,It is not legal for the apartment to lock your car without any lawful authority or permission. The apartment cannot compel you to stick their society sticker on your vehicle as it is your personal choice. However, it is possible that the apartment has made it mandatory for all vehicles parked in the parking spot to have the society sticker as a part of their security measures. In such a case, you may need to comply with the rules of the apartment or look for alternative parking options.It is not advisable to take the law into your own hands and hire a weldor to cut through the locks as this can result in criminal charges against you. Instead, you can take legal action against the apartment for their actions and seek a remedy through the appropriate legal channels.You can file a complaint with the local police or file a civil suit against the apartment for violation of your rights as a resident. It is advisable to seek legal counsel from a lawyer who specializes in property law to understand your legal options and the appropriate course of action. You may also explore online hearing options, depending on the local rules and regulations governing the conduct of legal proceedings.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This evidence can be useful in court to support your claims and help you obtain a favorable outcome. However, you should consult with a local family lawyer to determine the specific types of evidence that are admissible in your jurisdiction.In terms of child custody, the court will consider a variety of factors in determining what is in the best interests of the child. This may include factors such as the child's age, health, and educational needs, as well as each parent's ability to provide for the child's physical and emotional needs. If you are working full-time, you may need to demonstrate to the court that you have adequate childcare arrangements in place to ensure that the child's needs are being met while you are at work.To start the divorce process in India, you will need to file a petition for divorce in the appropriate court. The specific requirements for filing for divorce may vary depending on the jurisdiction, so you should consult with a local family lawyer to determine the specific requirements in your area. In some cases, it may be possible to file for divorce online, but this will also depend on the specific procedures in your jurisdiction.If you are unable to appear in person for the court hearings, you may be able to appear by video conference or telephone, depending on the specific procedures in your jurisdiction.

    "question": "Divorce in US",
    "answer": "Indian family law and US family laws are different . If you want the benefit of Indian law then follow it .You can file divorce case against the husband as per US law. But all the decree from US is not valid in India .Foreign court decree of divorce or dissolution of marriage can be valid in India provided such decree is according to the provision of law in India as provided under section 13 of the Civil Procedure Code and Principle of law as laid down by the Indian courts. A foreign court divorce decree may be valid in India ONLY if the spouse had lived in that country and had consented to that country's jurisdiction.Under Section 13(e), Civil Procedure Code, the foreign judgment is open to challenge \"where it has been obtained by fraud\". Fraud as to the merits of the respondent's case may be ignored and his allegation that he and his wife \"have lived separate and apart for more than three (3) consecutive years without cohabitation and that there is no possibility of a reconciliation\" may be assumed to be true. But fraud as to the jurisdiction of the foreign court is a vital consideration in the recognition of the decree passed by that court.As per the latest Supreme Court judgment which had held that a decree of divorce granted by a foreign court is not valid in India if the ground is not recognized by Indian law.A foreign judgment shall be conclusive as to any matter thereby directly adjudicated upon between the same parties or between parties under whom they or any of them claim litigating under the same title except-(a) where it has not been pronounced by a Court of competent jurisdiction;(b) where it has not been given on the merits of the case;(c) where it appears on the face of the proceedings to be founded on an incorrect view of international law or a refusal to recognise the law of India in cases in which such law is applicable;(d) where the proceedings in which the judgment was obtained are opposed to natural justice;(e) where it has been obtained by fraud;(f) where it sustains a claim founded on a breach of any law in force in India.So these six conditions are fulfilled by such foreign judgment/decree of divorce then it will be valid for dissolving such Indian marriage as has been held by the Supreme Court of India in several of its judgments.If your husband has accepted the authority of US court, it cannot be open to her to later question the authority of the US court.Decree of Divorce by a foreign Court is also valid in India if there is no challenge by the other party. If both of you go formutual consent divorce, then it is recognised and valid in India.Recognition of decrees and orders passed by foreign courts remains an eternal dilemma in as much as whenever called upon to do so, Courts in this country are bound to determine the validity of such decrees and orders keeping in view the provisions of Section 13 of theCode of Criminal Procedure1908 as amended by the Amendment Act of 1999 and 2002. The duty of a Court exercising its Parens Patraie jurisdiction as in cases involving custody of minor children is all the more onerous. Welfare of the minor in such cases being the paramount consideration; the court has to approach the issue regarding the validity and enforcement of a foreign decree or order carefully.The Supreme Court of India has consistently held that in deciding cases of child custody ‘the first and paramount consideration is the welfare and interest of the child and not the rights of the parents under a statuteAjay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

    "answer": "Dear client,If you are considering filing for divorce, it is important to collect evidence that supports your case, such as evidence of your spouse's infidelity or neglect of the child. This evidence can be useful in court to support your claims and help you obtain a favorable outcome. However, you should consult with a local family lawyer to determine the specific types of evidence that are admissible in your jurisdiction.In terms of child custody, the court will consider a variety of factors in determining what is in the best interests of the child. This may include factors such as the child's age, health, and educational needs, as well as each parent's ability to provide for the child's physical and emotional needs. If you are working full-time, you may need to demonstrate to the court that you have adequate childcare arrangements in place to ensure that the child's needs are being met while you are at work.To start the divorce process in India, you will need to file a petition for divorce in the appropriate court. The specific requirements for filing for divorce may vary depending on the jurisdiction, so you should consult with a local family lawyer to determine the specific requirements in your area. In some cases, it may be possible to file for divorce online, but this will also depend on the specific procedures in your jurisdiction.If you are unable to appear in person for the court hearings, you may be able to appear by video conference or telephone, depending on the specific procedures in your jurisdiction. Again, you should consult with a local family lawyer to determine the specific procedures that apply in your area.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Divorce in US",
    "answer": "Indian family law and US family laws are different . If you want the benefit of Indian law then follow it .You can file divorce case against the husband as per US law. But all the decree from US is not valid in India .Foreign court decree of divorce or dissolution of marriage can be valid in India provided such decree is according to the provision of law in India as provided under section 13 of the Civil Procedure Code and Principle of law as laid down by the Indian courts. A foreign court divorce decree may be valid in India ONLY if the spouse had lived in that country and had consented to that country's jurisdiction.Under Section 13(e), Civil Procedure Code, the foreign judgment is open to challenge \"where it has been obtained by fraud\". Fraud as to the merits of the respondent's case may be ignored and his allegation that he and his wife \"have lived separate and apart for more than three (3) consecutive years without cohabitation and that there is no possibility of a reconciliation\" may be assumed to be true. But fraud as to the jurisdiction of the foreign court is a vital consideration in the recognition of the decree passed by that court.As per the latest Supreme Court judgment which had held that a decree of divorce granted by a foreign court is not valid in India if the ground is not recognized by Indian law.A foreign judgment shall be conclusive as to any matter thereby directly adjudicated upon between the same parties or between parties under whom they or any of them claim litigating under the same title except-(a) where it has not been pronounced by a Court of competent jurisdiction;(b) where it has not been given on the merits of the case;(c) where it appears on the face of the proceedings to be founded on an incorrect view of international law or a refusal to recognise the law of India in cases in which such law is applicable;(d) where the proceedings in which the judgment was obtained are opposed to natural justice;(e) where it has been obtained by fraud;(f) where it sustains a claim founded on a breach of any law in force in India.So these six conditions are fulfilled by such foreign judgment/decree of divorce then it will be valid for dissolving such Indian marriage as has been held by the Supreme Court of India in several of its judgments.If your husband has accepted the authority of US court, it cannot be open to her to later question the authority of the US court.Decree of Divorce by a foreign Court is also valid in India if there is no challenge by the other party. If both of you go formutual consent divorce, then it is recognised and valid in India.Recognition of decrees and orders passed by foreign courts remains an eternal dilemma in as much as whenever called upon to do so, Courts in this country are bound to determine the validity of such decrees and orders keeping in view the provisions of Section 13 of theCode of Criminal Procedure1908 as amended by the Amendment Act of 1999 and 2002. The duty of a Court exercising its Parens Patraie jurisdiction as in cases involving custody of minor children is all the more onerous. Welfare of the minor in such cases being the paramount consideration; the court has to approach the issue regarding the validity and enforcement of a foreign decree or order carefully.The Supreme Court of India has consistently held that in deciding cases of child custody ‘the first and paramount consideration is the welfare and interest of the child and not the rights of the parents under a statuteAjay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

    "answer": "Dear client,It seems that you have sold a land B and used the sale proceeds to purchase land A, both of which were used for agricultural purposes. You have used agricultural income savings to purchase land A and have been farming on it for more than 2 years. However, you have received an order denying exemption under section 54B of the Income Tax Act, which provides for exemption on capital gains arising from the transfer of land used for agricultural purposes, due to a variation of one to two months in the period of two years of farming on land A.In this situation, you may need to file an appeal against the order denying exemption under section 54B. You can approach a tax consultant or a lawyer to help you with the appeal process. However, it is important to note that the success of the appeal may depend on several factors such as the specific facts of the case, the evidence available, and the interpretation of the relevant tax laws.Regarding the Vivad se Vishwas Scheme, it is a scheme introduced by the Government of India to provide relief to taxpayers who have disputes with the income tax department. It allows taxpayers to settle their disputes by paying the disputed tax amount with certain concessions. If you have already opted for this scheme and paid the disputed tax amount, you may have to check with the concerned authorities regarding the status of your case and the applicability of the scheme in your case.Overall, it is advisable to seek professional help from a tax consultant or a lawyer to understand your options and to proceed with the appeal process.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The apartment cannot compel you to stick their society sticker on your vehicle as it is your personal choice. However, it is possible that the apartment has made it mandatory for all vehicles parked in the parking spot to have the society sticker as a part of their security measures. In such a case, you may need to comply with the rules of the apartment or look for alternative parking options.It is not advisable to take the law into your own hands and hire a weldor to cut through the locks as this can result in criminal charges against you. Instead, you can take legal action against the apartment for their actions and seek a remedy through the appropriate legal channels.You can file a complaint with the local police or file a civil suit against the apartment for violation of your rights as a resident. It is advisable to seek legal counsel from a lawyer who specializes in property law to understand your legal options and the appropriate course of action.

    "answer": "Dear client,It seems that you have sold a land B and used the sale proceeds to purchase land A, both of which were used for agricultural purposes. You have used agricultural income savings to purchase land A and have been farming on it for more than 2 years. However, you have received an order denying exemption under section 54B of the Income Tax Act, which provides for exemption on capital gains arising from the transfer of land used for agricultural purposes, due to a variation of one to two months in the period of two years of farming on land A.In this situation, you may need to file an appeal against the order denying exemption under section 54B. You can approach a tax consultant or a lawyer to help you with the appeal process. However, it is important to note that the success of the appeal may depend on several factors such as the specific facts of the case, the evidence available, and the interpretation of the relevant tax laws.Regarding the Vivad se Vishwas Scheme, it is a scheme introduced by the Government of India to provide relief to taxpayers who have disputes with the income tax department. It allows taxpayers to settle their disputes by paying the disputed tax amount with certain concessions. If you have already opted for this scheme and paid the disputed tax amount, you may have to check with the concerned authorities regarding the status of your case and the applicability of the scheme in your case.Overall, it is advisable to seek professional help from a tax consultant or a lawyer to understand your options and to proceed with the appeal process.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Neighbour claiming land while they dont have document",
    "answer": "Dear client,Yes, you can file a case against your neighbor to claim back your 4 feet land that he has illegally occupied. You can file a civil suit for declaration of title and recovery of possession under Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. In this suit, you can seek a declaration from the court that you are the owner of the land in question, and ask for an order of possession directing your neighbor to vacate the land and hand it over to you.It is important to note that in such cases, the burden of proof lies on the plaintiff (i.e., you) to prove that the land belongs to you and has been illegally occupied by the defendant (i.e., your neighbor). Therefore, you will need to produce all the relevant documents such as the sale deed, link documents, survey plan, etc., to prove your ownership of the land.As far as the chances of success are concerned, it will depend on the strength of your case and the evidence that you are able to produce in support of your claim. If you are able to establish your ownership of the land and that your neighbor has illegally occupied it, then you are likely to get a favorable judgment.Regarding the effect of the case on your current construction, it is possible that the court may order a stay on your construction until the dispute is resolved. Therefore, it is important to consult with a lawyer and take appropriate legal advice before initiating any legal action.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, it is important to protect your legal rights and interests, and it is better to take legal action than to let someone illegally occupy your property.As an NRI, you can appoint an attorney or a legal representative in India to represent you in court. Your attorney can file the case on your behalf, represent you in court hearings, and carry out legal procedures in your absence. You will need to provide your attorney with the relevant documents and information related to the case, and also authorize them to act on your behalf through a power of attorney.It is important to note that you may be required to appear in court at least once during the proceedings, depending on the nature of the case and the court's discretion. However, your attorney can guide you on this matter and make arrangements accordingly.The procedure for filing a case for illegal occupation of land involves drafting a plaint, paying court fees, and submitting the same to the relevant court. The court will then issue a notice to the respondent (your neighbor), and the case will proceed in accordance with the legal procedures.It is advisable to consult with a local lawyer in India who can guide you on the specific legal procedures and requirements in your case, and also represent you in court if necessary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,The adopted son of your father's elder sister cannot ask for a share for her deceased mother in the partition suit which is now in execution phase. This is because your father's elder sister was not made a party to the suit and the decree is passed only for shares between your father and his brothers. The adopted son of your father's elder sister has no legal right to claim a share in the ancestral property.The adopted son cannot implead in the same suit after being silent till the preliminary decree is passed. He cannot file a new suit as well. The reason is that the partition suit has already been decided by a preliminary decree in 2011, and it is now in the execution phase. The adopted son had the opportunity to join the suit during the pendency of the suit, but since he did not join the suit, he has lost his right to claim a share in the ancestral property.If the court allows the petition of the adopted son for his mother's share, the process to send notices to all respondents, trial, witness, arguments all these stages will be there. This is because the partition suit has already been decided by a preliminary decree, and the execution phase is ongoing. If the adopted son files a petition claiming his mother's share, it will be treated as a separate case, and the court will have to follow the usual procedure for deciding the case.In conclusion, the adopted son of your father's elder sister has no legal right to claim a share in the ancestral property, since his mother was not made a party to the suit, and the decree was passed only for shares between your father and his brothers.

    "answer": "Dear client,Yes, you can file a case against your neighbor to claim back your 4 feet land that he has illegally occupied. You can file a civil suit for declaration of title and recovery of possession under Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. In this suit, you can seek a declaration from the court that you are the owner of the land in question, and ask for an order of possession directing your neighbor to vacate the land and hand it over to you.It is important to note that in such cases, the burden of proof lies on the plaintiff (i.e., you) to prove that the land belongs to you and has been illegally occupied by the defendant (i.e., your neighbor). Therefore, you will need to produce all the relevant documents such as the sale deed, link documents, survey plan, etc., to prove your ownership of the land.As far as the chances of success are concerned, it will depend on the strength of your case and the evidence that you are able to produce in support of your claim. If you are able to establish your ownership of the land and that your neighbor has illegally occupied it, then you are likely to get a favorable judgment.Regarding the effect of the case on your current construction, it is possible that the court may order a stay on your construction until the dispute is resolved. Therefore, it is important to consult with a lawyer and take appropriate legal advice before initiating any legal action.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,If you file a case against your neighbor for illegal occupation of your land, it may affect the ongoing construction work, as the court may pass an injunction order to stop the construction until the dispute is resolved. However, it is important to protect your legal rights and interests, and it is better to take legal action than to let someone illegally occupy your property.As an NRI, you can appoint an attorney or a legal representative in India to represent you in court. Your attorney can file the case on your behalf, represent you in court hearings, and carry out legal procedures in your absence. You will need to provide your attorney with the relevant documents and information related to the case, and also authorize them to act on your behalf through a power of attorney.It is important to note that you may be required to appear in court at least once during the proceedings, depending on the nature of the case and the court's discretion. However, your attorney can guide you on this matter and make arrangements accordingly.The procedure for filing a case for illegal occupation of land involves drafting a plaint, paying court fees, and submitting the same to the relevant court. The court will then issue a notice to the respondent (your neighbor), and the case will proceed in accordance with the legal procedures.It is advisable to consult with a local lawyer in India who can guide you on the specific legal procedures and requirements in your case, and also represent you in court if necessary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,It seems that you have sold a land B and used the sale proceeds to purchase land A, both of which were used for agricultural purposes. You have used agricultural income savings to purchase land A and have been farming on it for more than 2 years. However, you have received an order denying exemption under section 54B of the Income Tax Act, which provides for exemption on capital gains arising from the transfer of land used for agricultural purposes, due to a variation of one to two months in the period of two years of farming on land A.In this situation, you may need to file an appeal against the order denying exemption under section 54B. You can approach a tax consultant or a lawyer to help you with the appeal process. However, it is important to note that the success of the appeal may depend on several factors such as the specific facts of the case, the evidence available, and the interpretation of the relevant tax laws.Regarding the Vivad se Vishwas Scheme, it is a scheme introduced by the Government of India to provide relief to taxpayers who have disputes with the income tax department. It allows taxpayers to settle their disputes by paying the disputed tax amount with certain concessions. If you have already opted for this scheme and paid the disputed tax amount, you may have to check with the concerned authorities regarding the status of your case and the applicability of the scheme in your case.Overall, it is advisable to seek professional help from a tax consultant or a lawyer to understand your options and to proceed with the appeal process.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Register General Power of Attorney created in USA",
    "answer": "As per the rules of the Indian Government, the Power of Attorney (POA) executed in a foreign country can be registered with the Sub-Registrar in Mumbai, India. However, if the POA is notarized and apostilled in the USA, it needs to be attested by the Indian Consulate in the USA before it can be registered in India. The Indian Consulate's attestation confirms the authenticity of the notarization and apostille, and it ensures that the POA is legally valid for use in India.While the Indian Consulate in the USA may leave it to individual discretion whether or not to attest the POA, it is recommended to get it attested to avoid any legal issues in India. The attestation process by the Indian Consulate involves verifying the identity of the person executing the POA, verifying the notary public's signature, and confirming that the apostille is authentic.In summary, it is advisable to get the POA attested by the Indian Consulate in the USA before registering it with the Sub-Registrar in Mumbai to ensure that the POA is legally valid and can be executed without any issues in India.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If the flat was owned by your deceased mother and your father has also passed away, the property would be inherited by the legal heirs of your mother as per theHindu Succession Act. To sell the flat, you will need to transfer ownership of the property from your mother's name to the names of the legal heirs, which can be done through a process known as mutation or transfer of property. The specific procedure and requirements for mutation may vary depending on the state or jurisdiction where the property is located. It is recommended to consult with a qualified legal professional or property lawyer in India to ensure that you follow the correct procedures and comply with all applicable laws and regulations.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,I apologize for any confusion in my previous response. As you are an NRI, you will need to execute a Power of Attorney (POA) in favor of a trusted person in India to act on your behalf for the relinquishment deed. The stamp duty and registration charges for the POA and relinquishment deed will be based on the market value of the property, which in your case is 65 lacs.The stamp duty and registration charges vary from state to state in India, and also depend on the value of the property. In Maharashtra, the stamp duty for POA is 0.25% of the market value of the property, subject to a maximum of Rs.25,000. The registration charge for POA is Rs.1000.For the relinquishment deed, the stamp duty in Maharashtra is 3% of the market value of the property. In addition, there is a registration fee of 1% of the market value of the property, subject to a maximum of Rs.30,000.Therefore, based on the market value of your property at 65 lacs, the stamp duty for the POA would be Rs.16,250, and the registration fee would be Rs.1,000. The stamp duty for the relinquishment deed would be Rs.1,95,000, and the registration fee would be Rs.30,000.Please note that the stamp duty and registration charges are subject to change, and you should confirm the current charges with the relevant authorities or a local lawyer before proceeding with the transactions.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Land purchase via power of attorney, inhertance impact",
    "answer": "Dear client,Answer 1: If the court orders to attach the property belonging to POA's family members, then your property may also get affected as it was purchased from POA's wife. However, this will depend on the nature and extent of the attachment order passed by the court. If the court only attaches certain specific properties or bank accounts belonging to POA's family members, then your property may not get affected. However, if the court orders a blanket attachment of all properties belonging to POA's family members, then your property may also get attached.Answer 2: The kids of the principal may have a right to the property if it was inherited by the principal as a coparcener property, and not as a self-acquired property. If it was inherited as a coparcener property, then the kids will have a share in the property by birth, irrespective of the fact that their father gave POA while they were minors. However, if it was inherited as a self-acquired property, then the kids will not have any right in the property, unless it was gifted or bequeathed to them by their father.Regarding your second question, the time limit to file a suit for partition is 12 years from the date of knowledge of the cause of action. So, if the kids have recently come to know about the sale of the property by POA, they can still file a suit for partition. However, if the sale was done more than 12 years ago, then the kids will not be able to claim any rights over the property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Neighbour claiming land while they dont have document",
    "answer": "Dear client,Yes, you can file a case against your neighbor to claim back your 4 feet land that he has illegally occupied. You can file a civil suit for declaration of title and recovery of possession under Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. In this suit, you can seek a declaration from the court that you are the owner of the land in question, and ask for an order of possession directing your neighbor to vacate the land and hand it over to you.It is important to note that in such cases, the burden of proof lies on the plaintiff (i.e., you) to prove that the land belongs to you and has been illegally occupied by the defendant (i.e., your neighbor). Therefore, you will need to produce all the relevant documents such as the sale deed, link documents, survey plan, etc., to prove your ownership of the land.As far as the chances of success are concerned, it will depend on the strength of your case and the evidence that you are able to produce in support of your claim. If you are able to establish your ownership of the land and that your neighbor has illegally occupied it, then you are likely to get a favorable judgment.Regarding the effect of the case on your current construction, it is possible that the court may order a stay on your construction until the dispute is resolved. Therefore, it is important to consult with a lawyer and take appropriate legal advice before initiating any legal action.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, it is important to protect your legal rights and interests, and it is better to take legal action than to let someone illegally occupy your property.As an NRI, you can appoint an attorney or a legal representative in India to represent you in court. Your attorney can file the case on your behalf, represent you in court hearings, and carry out legal procedures in your absence. You will need to provide your attorney with the relevant documents and information related to the case, and also authorize them to act on your behalf through a power of attorney.It is important to note that you may be required to appear in court at least once during the proceedings, depending on the nature of the case and the court's discretion. However, your attorney can guide you on this matter and make arrangements accordingly.The procedure for filing a case for illegal occupation of land involves drafting a plaint, paying court fees, and submitting the same to the relevant court. The court will then issue a notice to the respondent (your neighbor), and the case will proceed in accordance with the legal procedures.It is advisable to consult with a local lawyer in India who can guide you on the specific legal procedures and requirements in your case, and also represent you in court if necessary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Registration of a Mortagage Flat in a venture without CC",
    "answer": "Dear client,Before making any payment, it is important to verify the status of the mortgage with the relevant authority to ensure that the builder is authorized to release the mortgage of the particular flat with the money you pay. Additionally, you should also verify the status of the occupancy certificate (OC) and completion certificate (CC) with the local authorities to confirm that the project is compliant with all the necessary regulations and safety standards.If you are satisfied with the status of the mortgage and the necessary certificates, you can proceed with the purchase. However, it is recommended that you enter into a written agreement with the builder, specifying the payment terms and conditions, timelines for obtaining the necessary certificates, and consequences for delay or non-compliance.If the builder is demanding full payment upfront, you can negotiate to pay a token amount as advance to secure the flat, subject to the necessary certificates being obtained within the agreed timelines. You can also include a clause in the agreement that allows you to cancel the agreement and seek a refund if the certificates are not obtained within the agreed timelines.In case of any dispute or non-compliance, you can seek legal recourse through the appropriate authorities or courts.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Paying entire amount upfront pending the CC and release of mortgage is not at all advisablewhat if the builder defaults?your money will be trappedso if you want to block this particular flat then make a part payment and enter into an agreement in which the builder would be made to agree on specific timelines within which he will get the mortgaged released and obtain the CCif he does not comply with the agreed period then it can be agreed that he will have to refund your advance with some interestalternatively you can make the payment directly to the mortgagee/lender instead of to the builderwhen the builder gets the CC, you can make the balance payment to the lender and if there is any more amount left as per your agreement with the builder then that much only will be paid to the builderhowever please note that if the builder defaults in getting the CC, then it would be difficult to get refund of your advance from the lender in which case the liability would have to be borne by the builder to refund you that amountso the agreement has to be properly worded in order to safeguard and protect your money and interest in the flatYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

If the flat was owned by your deceased mother and your father has also passed away, the property would be inherited by the legal heirs of your mother as per theHindu Succession Act. To sell the flat, you will need to transfer ownership of the property from your mother's name to the names of the legal heirs, which can be done through a process known as mutation or transfer of property. The specific procedure and requirements for mutation may vary depending on the state or jurisdiction where the property is located.

    "answer": "Dear client,I apologize for any confusion in my previous response. As you are an NRI, you will need to execute a Power of Attorney (POA) in favor of a trusted person in India to act on your behalf for the relinquishment deed. The stamp duty and registration charges for the POA and relinquishment deed will be based on the market value of the property, which in your case is 65 lacs.The stamp duty and registration charges vary from state to state in India, and also depend on the value of the property. In Maharashtra, the stamp duty for POA is 0.25% of the market value of the property, subject to a maximum of Rs.25,000. The registration charge for POA is Rs.1000.For the relinquishment deed, the stamp duty in Maharashtra is 3% of the market value of the property. In addition, there is a registration fee of 1% of the market value of the property, subject to a maximum of Rs.30,000.Therefore, based on the market value of your property at 65 lacs, the stamp duty for the POA would be Rs.16,250, and the registration fee would be Rs.1,000. The stamp duty for the relinquishment deed would be Rs.1,95,000, and the registration fee would be Rs.30,000.Please note that the stamp duty and registration charges are subject to change, and you should confirm the current charges with the relevant authorities or a local lawyer before proceeding with the transactions.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Neighbour claiming land while they dont have document",
    "answer": "Dear client,Yes, you can file a case against your neighbor to claim back your 4 feet land that he has illegally occupied. You can file a civil suit for declaration of title and recovery of possession under Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. In this suit, you can seek a declaration from the court that you are the owner of the land in question, and ask for an order of possession directing your neighbor to vacate the land and hand it over to you.It is important to note that in such cases, the burden of proof lies on the plaintiff (i.e., you) to prove that the land belongs to you and has been illegally occupied by the defendant (i.e., your neighbor). Therefore, you will need to produce all the relevant documents such as the sale deed, link documents, survey plan, etc., to prove your ownership of the land.As far as the chances of success are concerned, it will depend on the strength of your case and the evidence that you are able to produce in support of your claim. If you are able to establish your ownership of the land and that your neighbor has illegally occupied it, then you are likely to get a favorable judgment.Regarding the effect of the case on your current construction, it is possible that the court may order a stay on your construction until the dispute is resolved. Therefore, it is important to consult with a lawyer and take appropriate legal advice before initiating any legal action.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,If you file a case against your neighbor for illegal occupation of your land, it may affect the ongoing construction work, as the court may pass an injunction order to stop the construction until the dispute is resolved. However, it is important to protect your legal rights and interests, and it is better to take legal action than to let someone illegally occupy your property.As an NRI, you can appoint an attorney or a legal representative in India to represent you in court. Your attorney can file the case on your behalf, represent you in court hearings, and carry out legal procedures in your absence. You will need to provide your attorney with the relevant documents and information related to the case, and also authorize them to act on your behalf through a power of attorney.It is important to note that you may be required to appear in court at least once during the proceedings, depending on the nature of the case and the court's discretion. However, your attorney can guide you on this matter and make arrangements accordingly.The procedure for filing a case for illegal occupation of land involves drafting a plaint, paying court fees, and submitting the same to the relevant court. The court will then issue a notice to the respondent (your neighbor), and the case will proceed in accordance with the legal procedures.It is advisable to consult with a local lawyer in India who can guide you on the specific legal procedures and requirements in your case, and also represent you in court if necessary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The police may then transfer the complaint to the relevant police station in Jaipur or Delhi for further investigation, depending on the jurisdiction of the case.

It is understandable that you are frustrated with the legal system and the difficulty you have faced in trying to unfreeze your funds.In general, banks are required to comply with law enforcement requests to freeze accounts and funds if there is suspected illegal activity, such as fraud or money laundering. This is done to prevent the proceeds of crime from being used or transferred, and to facilitate any investigations.If you have not been contacted by the police or received any legal notice or summons, it is possible that the investigation is ongoing and you may be contacted in the future. It is important to cooperate with any investigation and provide any information that may be requested.In terms of recovering your funds, you may want to consider seeking legal advice from a lawyer who is familiar with banking and cryptocurrency laws. They can advise you on the best course of action and whether it is necessary to obtain a court order to unfreeze your funds.It is important to remember that the legal process can be slow and frustrating, but it is designed to ensure that justice is served.

    "question": "Register General Power of Attorney created in USA",
    "answer": "As per the rules of the Indian Government, the Power of Attorney (POA) executed in a foreign country can be registered with the Sub-Registrar in Mumbai, India. However, if the POA is notarized and apostilled in the USA, it needs to be attested by the Indian Consulate in the USA before it can be registered in India. The Indian Consulate's attestation confirms the authenticity of the notarization and apostille, and it ensures that the POA is legally valid for use in India.While the Indian Consulate in the USA may leave it to individual discretion whether or not to attest the POA, it is recommended to get it attested to avoid any legal issues in India. The attestation process by the Indian Consulate involves verifying the identity of the person executing the POA, verifying the notary public's signature, and confirming that the apostille is authentic.In summary, it is advisable to get the POA attested by the Indian Consulate in the USA before registering it with the Sub-Registrar in Mumbai to ensure that the POA is legally valid and can be executed without any issues in India.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can i challenge WILL if the property given to me is of litigation or withdraw will after execution",
    "answer": "Dear client,I'm sorry to hear about the complicated situation with your father's properties. It can be challenging to navigate these legal matters, but I will do my best to provide you with some guidance.Firstly, regarding the gift deed and will, it's important to understand that gift deeds and wills are two separate legal instruments. A gift deed transfers the ownership of the property immediately, whereas a will only transfers the ownership upon the death of the testator (your father in this case). So, the 4 acres of land gifted to your father's second wife belongs to her, and it is not part of your father's estate that is subject to distribution under his will.Regarding the litigation on the 3 acres of land bequeathed to you in your father's will, it would be best to consult a lawyer who can help you navigate the legal system and provide you with the best course of action. Filing a partition suit may be an option, but it depends on the specifics of your case and the laws in your jurisdiction. It's also worth noting that if the litigation results in the land being transferred to someone else, then that land will no longer be part of your father's estate and will not be distributed according to his will.Regarding the ancestral property and the third party's claim, it's crucial to gather all relevant documents and evidence that establish your father's ownership of the property. This evidence could include sale deeds, property tax receipts, and other relevant documents. The court will decide the ownership of the property based on the evidence presented, so it's essential to gather as much evidence as possible to support your claim.In conclusion, I recommend consulting a lawyer who can help you navigate the legal system and provide you with the best course of action. It's important to gather as much evidence as possible to support your claim to the property and to be prepared for the possibility that the litigation may not be resolved in your favor.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,I apologize for any confusion in my previous response. As you are an NRI, you will need to execute a Power of Attorney (POA) in favor of a trusted person in India to act on your behalf for the relinquishment deed. The stamp duty and registration charges for the POA and relinquishment deed will be based on the market value of the property, which in your case is 65 lacs.The stamp duty and registration charges vary from state to state in India, and also depend on the value of the property. In Maharashtra, the stamp duty for POA is 0.25% of the market value of the property, subject to a maximum of Rs.25,000. The registration charge for POA is Rs.1000.For the relinquishment deed, the stamp duty in Maharashtra is 3% of the market value of the property. In addition, there is a registration fee of 1% of the market value of the property, subject to a maximum of Rs.30,000.Therefore, based on the market value of your property at 65 lacs, the stamp duty for the POA would be Rs.16,250, and the registration fee would be Rs.1,000. The stamp duty for the relinquishment deed would be Rs.1,95,000, and the registration fee would be Rs.30,000.Please note that the stamp duty and registration charges are subject to change, and you should confirm the current charges with the relevant authorities or a local lawyer before proceeding with the transactions.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Neighbour claiming land while they dont have document",
    "answer": "Dear client,Yes, you can file a case against your neighbor to claim back your 4 feet land that he has illegally occupied. You can file a civil suit for declaration of title and recovery of possession under Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. In this suit, you can seek a declaration from the court that you are the owner of the land in question, and ask for an order of possession directing your neighbor to vacate the land and hand it over to you.It is important to note that in such cases, the burden of proof lies on the plaintiff (i.e., you) to prove that the land belongs to you and has been illegally occupied by the defendant (i.e., your neighbor). Therefore, you will need to produce all the relevant documents such as the sale deed, link documents, survey plan, etc., to prove your ownership of the land.As far as the chances of success are concerned, it will depend on the strength of your case and the evidence that you are able to produce in support of your claim. If you are able to establish your ownership of the land and that your neighbor has illegally occupied it, then you are likely to get a favorable judgment.Regarding the effect of the case on your current construction, it is possible that the court may order a stay on your construction until the dispute is resolved. Therefore, it is important to consult with a lawyer and take appropriate legal advice before initiating any legal action.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,If you file a case against your neighbor for illegal occupation of your land, it may affect the ongoing construction work, as the court may pass an injunction order to stop the construction until the dispute is resolved. However, it is important to protect your legal rights and interests, and it is better to take legal action than to let someone illegally occupy your property.As an NRI, you can appoint an attorney or a legal representative in India to represent you in court. Your attorney can file the case on your behalf, represent you in court hearings, and carry out legal procedures in your absence. You will need to provide your attorney with the relevant documents and information related to the case, and also authorize them to act on your behalf through a power of attorney.It is important to note that you may be required to appear in court at least once during the proceedings, depending on the nature of the case and the court's discretion. However, your attorney can guide you on this matter and make arrangements accordingly.The procedure for filing a case for illegal occupation of land involves drafting a plaint, paying court fees, and submitting the same to the relevant court. The court will then issue a notice to the respondent (your neighbor), and the case will proceed in accordance with the legal procedures.It is advisable to consult with a local lawyer in India who can guide you on the specific legal procedures and requirements in your case, and also represent you in court if necessary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It is important to have evidence of the transaction and the attempts made to resolve the matter with the recipient and the bank. In case the lady is not responding to your queries, you may also consider sending a legal notice demanding the refund of the amount.In the second case, you may file a complaint with the local police station against the coaching institute for cheating and breach of contract. You may also send a legal notice demanding the refund of the amount paid for the course. However, it is important to review the terms and conditions of the contract or agreement signed with the coaching institute to determine if the course fees are indeed non-refundable. In case the institute refuses to refund the amount, you may consider approaching the consumer court or seeking legal advice from a qualified lawyer.Regarding the police complaint, you may file it with your local police station. The police may then transfer the complaint to the relevant police station in Jaipur or Delhi for further investigation, depending on the jurisdiction of the case. The chances of getting your money back will depend on the specific facts and circumstances of each case and the legal remedies available.

    "question": "Register General Power of Attorney created in USA",
    "answer": "As per the rules of the Indian Government, the Power of Attorney (POA) executed in a foreign country can be registered with the Sub-Registrar in Mumbai, India. However, if the POA is notarized and apostilled in the USA, it needs to be attested by the Indian Consulate in the USA before it can be registered in India. The Indian Consulate's attestation confirms the authenticity of the notarization and apostille, and it ensures that the POA is legally valid for use in India.While the Indian Consulate in the USA may leave it to individual discretion whether or not to attest the POA, it is recommended to get it attested to avoid any legal issues in India. The attestation process by the Indian Consulate involves verifying the identity of the person executing the POA, verifying the notary public's signature, and confirming that the apostille is authentic.In summary, it is advisable to get the POA attested by the Indian Consulate in the USA before registering it with the Sub-Registrar in Mumbai to ensure that the POA is legally valid and can be executed without any issues in India.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Neighbour claiming land while they dont have document",
    "answer": "Dear client,Yes, you can file a case against your neighbor to claim back your 4 feet land that he has illegally occupied. You can file a civil suit for declaration of title and recovery of possession under Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. In this suit, you can seek a declaration from the court that you are the owner of the land in question, and ask for an order of possession directing your neighbor to vacate the land and hand it over to you.It is important to note that in such cases, the burden of proof lies on the plaintiff (i.e., you) to prove that the land belongs to you and has been illegally occupied by the defendant (i.e., your neighbor). Therefore, you will need to produce all the relevant documents such as the sale deed, link documents, survey plan, etc., to prove your ownership of the land.As far as the chances of success are concerned, it will depend on the strength of your case and the evidence that you are able to produce in support of your claim. If you are able to establish your ownership of the land and that your neighbor has illegally occupied it, then you are likely to get a favorable judgment.Regarding the effect of the case on your current construction, it is possible that the court may order a stay on your construction until the dispute is resolved. Therefore, it is important to consult with a lawyer and take appropriate legal advice before initiating any legal action.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,If you file a case against your neighbor for illegal occupation of your land, it may affect the ongoing construction work, as the court may pass an injunction order to stop the construction until the dispute is resolved. However, it is important to protect your legal rights and interests, and it is better to take legal action than to let someone illegally occupy your property.As an NRI, you can appoint an attorney or a legal representative in India to represent you in court. Your attorney can file the case on your behalf, represent you in court hearings, and carry out legal procedures in your absence. You will need to provide your attorney with the relevant documents and information related to the case, and also authorize them to act on your behalf through a power of attorney.It is important to note that you may be required to appear in court at least once during the proceedings, depending on the nature of the case and the court's discretion. However, your attorney can guide you on this matter and make arrangements accordingly.The procedure for filing a case for illegal occupation of land involves drafting a plaint, paying court fees, and submitting the same to the relevant court. The court will then issue a notice to the respondent (your neighbor), and the case will proceed in accordance with the legal procedures.It is advisable to consult with a local lawyer in India who can guide you on the specific legal procedures and requirements in your case, and also represent you in court if necessary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It is understandable that you are frustrated with the legal system and the difficulty you have faced in trying to unfreeze your funds.In general, banks are required to comply with law enforcement requests to freeze accounts and funds if there is suspected illegal activity, such as fraud or money laundering. This is done to prevent the proceeds of crime from being used or transferred, and to facilitate any investigations.If you have not been contacted by the police or received any legal notice or summons, it is possible that the investigation is ongoing and you may be contacted in the future. It is important to cooperate with any investigation and provide any information that may be requested.In terms of recovering your funds, you may want to consider seeking legal advice from a lawyer who is familiar with banking and cryptocurrency laws. They can advise you on the best course of action and whether it is necessary to obtain a court order to unfreeze your funds.It is important to remember that the legal process can be slow and frustrating, but it is designed to ensure that justice is served.

    "answer": "Dear client,Before making any payment, it is important to verify the status of the mortgage with the relevant authority to ensure that the builder is authorized to release the mortgage of the particular flat with the money you pay. Additionally, you should also verify the status of the occupancy certificate (OC) and completion certificate (CC) with the local authorities to confirm that the project is compliant with all the necessary regulations and safety standards.If you are satisfied with the status of the mortgage and the necessary certificates, you can proceed with the purchase. However, it is recommended that you enter into a written agreement with the builder, specifying the payment terms and conditions, timelines for obtaining the necessary certificates, and consequences for delay or non-compliance.If the builder is demanding full payment upfront, you can negotiate to pay a token amount as advance to secure the flat, subject to the necessary certificates being obtained within the agreed timelines. You can also include a clause in the agreement that allows you to cancel the agreement and seek a refund if the certificates are not obtained within the agreed timelines.In case of any dispute or non-compliance, you can seek legal recourse through the appropriate authorities or courts.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Register General Power of Attorney created in USA",
    "answer": "As per the rules of the Indian Government, the Power of Attorney (POA) executed in a foreign country can be registered with the Sub-Registrar in Mumbai, India. However, if the POA is notarized and apostilled in the USA, it needs to be attested by the Indian Consulate in the USA before it can be registered in India. The Indian Consulate's attestation confirms the authenticity of the notarization and apostille, and it ensures that the POA is legally valid for use in India.While the Indian Consulate in the USA may leave it to individual discretion whether or not to attest the POA, it is recommended to get it attested to avoid any legal issues in India. The attestation process by the Indian Consulate involves verifying the identity of the person executing the POA, verifying the notary public's signature, and confirming that the apostille is authentic.In summary, it is advisable to get the POA attested by the Indian Consulate in the USA before registering it with the Sub-Registrar in Mumbai to ensure that the POA is legally valid and can be executed without any issues in India.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "As your deceased husband's property is located in Hyderabad, India, Indian law will govern the inheritance of the property. In general, in the absence of a will, Indian law provides for the property of a deceased person to be inherited by their legal heirs.To claim the property, you will need to establish your status as a legal heir of your husband under Indian law. This may require obtaining a certificate of legal heirship from the Indian authorities, which will require providing documentation such as birth certificates, marriage certificates, and death certificates.In addition, it may be necessary to obtain letters of administration or a similar court order from an Indian court in order to legally transfer the property to your name. It is advisable to consult with an Indian lawyer who has experience in inheritance and property matters to guide you through this process.As you are US citizens, it may also be advisable to consult with a US attorney who has experience in international estate planning matters to ensure that your estate plan takes into account your overseas assets and the potential tax implications of inheriting foreign property.Overall, the process of claiming the property in India may be complex, and it is important to seek legal advice from attorneys familiar with both Indian and US law to ensure that the process is carried out in a legally sound and efficient manner.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,As you and your spouse are both green card holders living in the United States, you can file for divorce in the state where you currently reside. Each state has its own laws regarding divorce, so you will need to research the specific laws in your state. You may need to establish residency in the state for a certain period of time before you can file for divorce there.As for filing for divorce in India, you will need to consult with an Indian lawyer familiar with family law to determine the appropriate jurisdiction to file for divorce. Depending on the specific circumstances of your marriage, it may be possible to file for divorce in multiple jurisdictions.In terms of what kind of divorce to apply for, if both parties agree to the divorce and the terms of the divorce (such as property division, child custody, and support), an uncontested divorce is likely the best option. This can be a simpler and less expensive process than a contested divorce, which involves a court proceeding to resolve disagreements between the parties.It's important to note that divorce laws and procedures can be complex, so it may be beneficial to seek the advice of a family law attorney who can guide you through the process and help ensure that your rights and interests are protected."

    "answer": "Dear client,I apologize for any confusion in my previous response. As you are an NRI, you will need to execute a Power of Attorney (POA) in favor of a trusted person in India to act on your behalf for the relinquishment deed. The stamp duty and registration charges for the POA and relinquishment deed will be based on the market value of the property, which in your case is 65 lacs.The stamp duty and registration charges vary from state to state in India, and also depend on the value of the property. In Maharashtra, the stamp duty for POA is 0.25% of the market value of the property, subject to a maximum of Rs.25,000. The registration charge for POA is Rs.1000.For the relinquishment deed, the stamp duty in Maharashtra is 3% of the market value of the property. In addition, there is a registration fee of 1% of the market value of the property, subject to a maximum of Rs.30,000.Therefore, based on the market value of your property at 65 lacs, the stamp duty for the POA would be Rs.16,250, and the registration fee would be Rs.1,000. The stamp duty for the relinquishment deed would be Rs.1,95,000, and the registration fee would be Rs.30,000.Please note that the stamp duty and registration charges are subject to change, and you should confirm the current charges with the relevant authorities or a local lawyer before proceeding with the transactions.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Child custody of US citizen residing in india",
    "answer": "Dear client,I'm sorry to hear about your situation. As a language model, I can provide you with some general guidance, but please note that you should consult with a qualified attorney for legal advice specific to your case.Since your wife and child are currently residing in India, it may be more appropriate to initiate legal action in India to seek custody or visitation rights. However, since your son is a US citizen, you may also be able to seek assistance from the US government to enforce your custody or visitation rights.If you have a court order specifying visitation rights, you may be able to seek enforcement of that order in India through the Indian courts. You would need to consult with a qualified attorney in India to understand the specific procedures and requirements for seeking enforcement.Alternatively, you may be able to seek assistance from the US government through the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. The Hague Convention is an international treaty that provides a framework for the return of children who have been wrongfully removed from their country of habitual residence. However, in order to seek relief under the Hague Convention, you would need to show that your child was wrongfully removed from the US.In any case, it would be important to gather evidence to support your case, such as documentation of your wife's agreement to joint custody and evidence of her mental health issues and suicidal threats.Again, I strongly recommend consulting with a qualified attorney who is experienced in international child custody cases to discuss your options and develop a strategy for pursuing your rights.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "From examining all the facts of your query I want to say that-These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard.To my mind, people are shielded from the law by their legal and constitutional rights. In India, displays of affection can result in violence, and couples frequently have to deal with harassment for the sake of \"protecting dignity.\" Unmarried couples are shielded from harassment and violence by their legal privileges. Unmarried couples should actively monitor their rights to safeguard themselves from abuse or harassment.Unmarried couples are not prohibited by law from lodging together or checking into a hotel. Even reputable hotel booking websites have a special category of hotels that are couple friendly.There are no laws or regulations forbearing unmarried persons of opposite sex from occupying hotel rooms as guests. While live-in relationship of two adults is not deemed to be an offence terming the occupation of hotel room by an unmarried couple will not attract a criminal offence.The Supreme Court stated in its decision in the case of S.P.S. Balasubramanyam v. Suruttayan held that if a man and woman are living under the same roof and cohabiting for some years, there will be a presumption under Section 114 of the Evidence Act that they live as husband and wife and the children born to them will not be illegitimate.TheConstitution of Indiagrants us the right to privacy through article 21 and sexual autonomy is an integral part of this article. The Supreme Court has also reiterated this in its judgements – the 2017 Puttaswamy judgment and the 2018 Navtej Johar judgment.You can send a legal notice through Advocate to the hotel initially for claiming compensation. My team is dealing with various such matters. A legal notice is a formal written communication between the parties where the sender notifies the recipient about his intention of undertaking legal proceedings against the latter. It helps in making the recipient party aware of the grievances of the sender. It is considered to be a warning to the receiver to fulfill a certain condition if he does not want to take the matter to the court. It is a very time and cost-effective tool for settling the matters without any litigation procedure but rather through negotiation, mediation or arbitration. It is only this method that legalizes producing a matter to court. The intimation given is known as 'legal notice.' A legal notice is, hence, formal notification to a person or an entity, notifying the other party of your purpose to commence legal proceedings against them. Legal notice can serve as a target of negotiations among the parties and save time, effort, and money spent in court cases. This makes the party aware of your complaint. Many times, a legal notice served will bring the other party on heels, and the difficulty can get resolved out of court, too, with fruitful arguments on both sides. If the opposite party is still not heeding to the grievance, one can always start the court procedures after a particular interval, as pronounced by the law.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal Verma,Advocate on Record & Amicus CuriaeSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "question": "Registration of a Mortagage Flat in a venture without CC",
    "answer": "Dear client,Before making any payment, it is important to verify the status of the mortgage with the relevant authority to ensure that the builder is authorized to release the mortgage of the particular flat with the money you pay. Additionally, you should also verify the status of the occupancy certificate (OC) and completion certificate (CC) with the local authorities to confirm that the project is compliant with all the necessary regulations and safety standards.If you are satisfied with the status of the mortgage and the necessary certificates, you can proceed with the purchase. However, it is recommended that you enter into a written agreement with the builder, specifying the payment terms and conditions, timelines for obtaining the necessary certificates, and consequences for delay or non-compliance.If the builder is demanding full payment upfront, you can negotiate to pay a token amount as advance to secure the flat, subject to the necessary certificates being obtained within the agreed timelines. You can also include a clause in the agreement that allows you to cancel the agreement and seek a refund if the certificates are not obtained within the agreed timelines.In case of any dispute or non-compliance, you can seek legal recourse through the appropriate authorities or courts.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Based on the information provided, it appears that you have purchased agricultural land before selling your previous agricultural land. You intend to use the newly purchased land for farming purposes, and you have filed tax returns for agricultural income in the past. However, you have been denied exemption under section 54B of the Income Tax Act, 1961, which provides exemption on the capital gains arising from the sale of agricultural land if the sale proceeds are invested in another agricultural land within a specified period.To claim exemption under section 54B, the newly purchased land must be used for agricultural purposes for at least two years from the date of its acquisition. Since you have sold your previous agricultural land within a few months of purchasing the new land, you may not be eligible for exemption under this section.In order to appeal against the order denying exemption, you may need to provide additional evidence to establish that your intent was to use the newly purchased land for agricultural purposes only. This may include proof of your past agricultural income, evidence of the fertility and suitability of the new land for farming, and any other relevant documents.It is recommended that you consult with a qualified tax professional or a lawyer to understand your options and to prepare a strong case for your appeal.

    "answer": "Dear client,The likelihood of the conversion of the property from agricultural to non-agricultural use will depend on various factors, including the specific rules and regulations of the local authorities and the prevailing land use policies. However, if the property is not being used for agricultural purposes and is surrounded by similar properties with houses, there may be a decent chance of it being reclassified as non-agricultural.To ensure a smooth and successful conversion process, it is advisable to hire a local lawyer who specializes in property law and has experience in handling similar cases. The lawyer can guide you through the application process, review the necessary documents, and represent you before the relevant authorities. The lawyer's fees may vary depending on their experience, reputation, and the complexity of the case, so it is best to discuss this with the lawyer directly.To get the process started, the seller may need to provide various documents, such as the property deed, survey map, and tax receipts, among others. Your lawyer can advise you on the specific documents required and help you obtain them from the seller.Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I am not able to provide specific lawyer recommendations or legal services.

    "question": "Clarification on No Tenancy Certificate (Karnataka)",
    "answer": "Dear client,I need some help in clarifying the requirement of \"No/Nil Tenancy Certificate (NTC)\" for buying an agricultural land in Karnataka. A. Is the NTC document required to show that the seller is not the tenant or to show that there are no tenants in the land which is up for sale? B. Is the NTC required, if the mutation papers shows that the seller is the legitimate owner of the land through acquisition, and he is not the tenant? C. If the NTC document is required, is it only for the intended survey # (which is up for sale) or for all the properties held by the seller in the taluka where the sale property is located?In Karnataka, as per the provisions of the Karnataka Land Reforms Act, 1961, it is mandatory to obtain a No Objection Certificate or Nil Tenancy Certificate (NTC) from the concerned Tahsildar before the purchase of agricultural land. This certificate is required to establish that the land is not tenanted and there are no tenants on the land.To answer your questions specifically:A. The NTC document is required to establish that there are no tenants on the land which is up for sale.B. Even if the mutation papers show that the seller is the legitimate owner of the land, it is still necessary to obtain a No Objection Certificate or Nil Tenancy Certificate (NTC) from the concerned Tahsildar before the purchase of agricultural land.C. The NTC is required only for the intended survey number which is up for sale, and not for all the properties held by the seller in the taluka where the sale property is located.It's important to note that the requirements for obtaining a No Objection Certificate or Nil Tenancy Certificate (NTC) can vary depending on the specific circumstances and location of the land, and it's recommended to consult with a local lawyer or the concerned revenue authorities for more specific and up-to-date information on the process.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Studying LL.B  cannot be claimed as a right to file petition on your own before high court, however you can file a writ petition as a party in person provided you know the procedures of law as prescribed for high court practice.Speedy trial is a fundamental right implicit in the guarantee of life and personal liberty enshrined inArticle 21 of the Constitutionand any accused who is denied this right of speedy trial is entitled to approach Supreme Court under Article 32 for the purpose of enforcing such right. Hence you can file a petition before high court as a party in person too provided you have sufficient reasons to state that the proceedings are intentionally delayed or protracted.3. If the circumstances of the cited authority suits your own case situation, and the ruling given therein  applies to  your situation, then you can rely upon this to your case but of course you can be able to use this only at the time of final hearing in the proposed writ petition.4.  The procedures of law has to be followed while you are pursuing a case through court.You cannot skip the procedures for the reasons you state.It is pertinent to implead the LRs of the deceased respondent or else your case will be dismissed for not taking proper steps to implead the LRs of the deceased respondents.you can ask your  advocate the reasons, it is not known what your advocate has done on your case, hence without knowing the proper details no opinion can be rendered on your advocate's acts, if you don't trust your advocate anymore, you are at your liberty to change your lawyer at this moment too.You can discuss the details of your case with any lawyer of this forum by getting their contact details from this forum and opt for phone consultation so that you can get more clarity on the subject.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

It's possible that the judge may not be happy about the request, but it's your advocate's duty to represent your interests and seek the best possible outcome for you. However, there is a risk that your advocate's other cases before the judge may be impacted if the judge perceives the request as inappropriate or aggressive.You can file a writ petition in the High Court if the trial court refuses to expedite the case.

This is because your father's elder sister was not made a party to the suit and the decree is passed only for shares between your father and his brothers. The adopted son of your father's elder sister has no legal right to claim a share in the ancestral property.The adopted son cannot implead in the same suit after being silent till the preliminary decree is passed. He cannot file a new suit as well. The reason is that the partition suit has already been decided by a preliminary decree in 2011, and it is now in the execution phase. The adopted son had the opportunity to join the suit during the pendency of the suit, but since he did not join the suit, he has lost his right to claim a share in the ancestral property.If the court allows the petition of the adopted son for his mother's share, the process to send notices to all respondents, trial, witness, arguments all these stages will be there. This is because the partition suit has already been decided by a preliminary decree, and the execution phase is ongoing. If the adopted son files a petition claiming his mother's share, it will be treated as a separate case, and the court will have to follow the usual procedure for deciding the case.In conclusion, the adopted son of your father's elder sister has no legal right to claim a share in the ancestral property, since his mother was not made a party to the suit, and the decree was passed only for shares between your father and his brothers.

    "question": "A khata and OC CC related",
    "answer": "Dear client,If the builder has built an extra floor more than the approved plan, it could mean that the building is in violation of the local building bylaws and regulations. This may lead to legal issues in the future, such as demolition of the building, fines or penalties, and difficulty in getting necessary approvals.Regarding the builder's promise to get an A khata, it's important to verify whether the builder has obtained all necessary approvals from the local authorities, including the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB). Without these approvals, getting an A khata may not be possible, and it could lead to legal complications.With respect to the bank providing loans for the property, it's possible that the bank may not be aware of the deviation from the approved plan. It's important for you to do your own due diligence and verify all information provided by the builder before making any decisions.It's always advisable to consult with a local property lawyer who can help you conduct a thorough due diligence and provide you with the necessary legal advice before purchasing a property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

As a nominee and legal heir, you are entitled to receive the Hereditary Renewal Commission, Gratuity, and other benefits that your father was eligible for as an LIC agent.Firstly, you should try to resolve the matter through the LIC branch where your father was associated. You can request a meeting with the Development Officer in charge of your father's agency and present all the necessary documents to support your claim. If the officer is unresponsive or unhelpful, you can escalate the matter to higher authorities within LIC.If you are still unable to receive a satisfactory response from LIC, you may consider filing a legal case against the Development Officer or LIC. You can approach the Consumer Forum or the Civil Court, depending on the amount of money involved in the claim. In case you suspect foul play, you can also file a complaint with the police.As for Public Litigation Interest (PIL), it is a legal mechanism used in India to bring matters of public importance to the attention of the court. While your case may not necessarily qualify as a PIL, you can certainly seek legal assistance to pursue your claim through the appropriate legal channels.It is advisable to seek the guidance of a lawyer who specializes in such matters to understand the legal options available to you and to represent you in court if necessary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Before making any payment, it is important to verify the status of the mortgage with the relevant authority to ensure that the builder is authorized to release the mortgage of the particular flat with the money you pay. Additionally, you should also verify the status of the occupancy certificate (OC) and completion certificate (CC) with the local authorities to confirm that the project is compliant with all the necessary regulations and safety standards.If you are satisfied with the status of the mortgage and the necessary certificates, you can proceed with the purchase. However, it is recommended that you enter into a written agreement with the builder, specifying the payment terms and conditions, timelines for obtaining the necessary certificates, and consequences for delay or non-compliance.If the builder is demanding full payment upfront, you can negotiate to pay a token amount as advance to secure the flat, subject to the necessary certificates being obtained within the agreed timelines. You can also include a clause in the agreement that allows you to cancel the agreement and seek a refund if the certificates are not obtained within the agreed timelines.In case of any dispute or non-compliance, you can seek legal recourse through the appropriate authorities or courts.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Stamp Duty for a transaction",
    "answer": "Dear client,I apologize for any confusion in my previous response. As you are an NRI, you will need to execute a Power of Attorney (POA) in favor of a trusted person in India to act on your behalf for the relinquishment deed. The stamp duty and registration charges for the POA and relinquishment deed will be based on the market value of the property, which in your case is 65 lacs.The stamp duty and registration charges vary from state to state in India, and also depend on the value of the property. In Maharashtra, the stamp duty for POA is 0.25% of the market value of the property, subject to a maximum of Rs.25,000. The registration charge for POA is Rs.1000.For the relinquishment deed, the stamp duty in Maharashtra is 3% of the market value of the property. In addition, there is a registration fee of 1% of the market value of the property, subject to a maximum of Rs.30,000.Therefore, based on the market value of your property at 65 lacs, the stamp duty for the POA would be Rs.16,250, and the registration fee would be Rs.1,000. The stamp duty for the relinquishment deed would be Rs.1,95,000, and the registration fee would be Rs.30,000.Please note that the stamp duty and registration charges are subject to change, and you should confirm the current charges with the relevant authorities or a local lawyer before proceeding with the transactions.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "The property gifted to you by your deceased father is under litigation, hence you my have to fight the litigation properly i.e., continue the litigation as LR of your father and get the case dismissed on merits.If the judgment is against you then you prefer an appeal on the basis of the registered sale deed on your father's name.However you cannot file for partition of other properties settled/transferred by your father in favor of your step mother and step brothers.You can produce the Will written by your father in respect of the properties bequeathed in your favor by which you can claim title to the property under litigation.You cannot claim any share in the other properties which stands transferred to others by gift or any other mode of transfer as a right.Hence no partition suit for a share in those properties is maintainableT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Can i challenge WILL if the property given to me is of litigation or withdraw will after execution",
    "answer": "Dear client,I'm sorry to hear about the complicated situation with your father's properties. It can be challenging to navigate these legal matters, but I will do my best to provide you with some guidance.Firstly, regarding the gift deed and will, it's important to understand that gift deeds and wills are two separate legal instruments. A gift deed transfers the ownership of the property immediately, whereas a will only transfers the ownership upon the death of the testator (your father in this case). So, the 4 acres of land gifted to your father's second wife belongs to her, and it is not part of your father's estate that is subject to distribution under his will.Regarding the litigation on the 3 acres of land bequeathed to you in your father's will, it would be best to consult a lawyer who can help you navigate the legal system and provide you with the best course of action. Filing a partition suit may be an option, but it depends on the specifics of your case and the laws in your jurisdiction. It's also worth noting that if the litigation results in the land being transferred to someone else, then that land will no longer be part of your father's estate and will not be distributed according to his will.Regarding the ancestral property and the third party's claim, it's crucial to gather all relevant documents and evidence that establish your father's ownership of the property. This evidence could include sale deeds, property tax receipts, and other relevant documents. The court will decide the ownership of the property based on the evidence presented, so it's essential to gather as much evidence as possible to support your claim.In conclusion, I recommend consulting a lawyer who can help you navigate the legal system and provide you with the best course of action. It's important to gather as much evidence as possible to support your claim to the property and to be prepared for the possibility that the litigation may not be resolved in your favor.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Since the FIR is registered in Uttar Pradesh, you will need to approach the High Court at Allahabad for quashing it however the High Court may not entertain your petition because the final report/chargesheet has not been submitted yet.Regarding the SI threatening you, next time if he calls you ask him to serve you the original notice by post. The notice contains details such as time and place of where to meet, etc. and he is duty bound to prepare it within 2 weeks of filing the FIR. He cannot arrest you until and unless the notice is served and is not complied. In many cases the High Court at Allahabad has severely punished police officers for not complying with guidelines of serving notice to the accused. I would suggest you file a petition under section 482 of CrPC at Allahabad against the SI ordering him to be within the guidelines.Utkarsh SinghAdvocate, Noida3 AnswersTalk to Advocate Utkarsh Singh"

You ask him to transfer his share in the proeprty by a registered sale deed and express that you are ready to pay the market rate towards this or vice versa, i.e., you can offer your share of property to him for sale at the market rate.The gift deed will become a headache for life long,hence you may avoid such an subject in this connection.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

However, it is important to note that such a gift deed may be challenged by your father in the future if he changes his mind. To avoid any future legal disputes, you can enter into a settlement agreement with your father and have it registered with the Sub-Registrar of Assurances. This agreement will outline the terms and conditions of the transfer of ownership, including the amount to be paid and the release of any future claims or demands.Regarding the consequences of the gift deed, it will transfer the ownership of the property from your father to you. However, it is important to ensure that the gift deed is executed on a proper legal stamp paper and is registered with the Sub-Registrar of Assurances. You may also need to pay any applicable stamp duty and registration fees.Regarding the mistake in the purchase agreement, you can approach the developer or builder and ask for a correction to be made in the agreement.

In case you suspect foul play, you can also file a complaint with the police.As for Public Litigation Interest (PIL), it is a legal mechanism used in India to bring matters of public importance to the attention of the court.

    "answer": "It is not advisable to pay any money or purchase the property in haste.The developer cannot be trusted, once he has received the full money he may not keep up his words to get CC for the property.A flat without CC can be demolished by the authorities concerned if it has been constructed violating the the approved plans.There is no necessity for you to pay the loan obtained by the developer, until and unless you do not get NOC from the mortgagor, there is no guarantee on this.If the developer do not pay the mortgage loan on the property you selected then there are chances that the mortgagor or the bank to recover the the loan amount by taking possession of this property and sell it by auction sale.What prevents you from taking a proper legal opinion from an experienced lawyer by producing the copies of property related papers.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Registration of a Mortagage Flat in a venture without CC",
    "answer": "Dear client,Before making any payment, it is important to verify the status of the mortgage with the relevant authority to ensure that the builder is authorized to release the mortgage of the particular flat with the money you pay. Additionally, you should also verify the status of the occupancy certificate (OC) and completion certificate (CC) with the local authorities to confirm that the project is compliant with all the necessary regulations and safety standards.If you are satisfied with the status of the mortgage and the necessary certificates, you can proceed with the purchase. However, it is recommended that you enter into a written agreement with the builder, specifying the payment terms and conditions, timelines for obtaining the necessary certificates, and consequences for delay or non-compliance.If the builder is demanding full payment upfront, you can negotiate to pay a token amount as advance to secure the flat, subject to the necessary certificates being obtained within the agreed timelines. You can also include a clause in the agreement that allows you to cancel the agreement and seek a refund if the certificates are not obtained within the agreed timelines.In case of any dispute or non-compliance, you can seek legal recourse through the appropriate authorities or courts.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can i challenge WILL if the property given to me is of litigation or withdraw will after execution",
    "answer": "Dear client,I'm sorry to hear about the complicated situation with your father's properties. It can be challenging to navigate these legal matters, but I will do my best to provide you with some guidance.Firstly, regarding the gift deed and will, it's important to understand that gift deeds and wills are two separate legal instruments. A gift deed transfers the ownership of the property immediately, whereas a will only transfers the ownership upon the death of the testator (your father in this case). So, the 4 acres of land gifted to your father's second wife belongs to her, and it is not part of your father's estate that is subject to distribution under his will.Regarding the litigation on the 3 acres of land bequeathed to you in your father's will, it would be best to consult a lawyer who can help you navigate the legal system and provide you with the best course of action. Filing a partition suit may be an option, but it depends on the specifics of your case and the laws in your jurisdiction. It's also worth noting that if the litigation results in the land being transferred to someone else, then that land will no longer be part of your father's estate and will not be distributed according to his will.Regarding the ancestral property and the third party's claim, it's crucial to gather all relevant documents and evidence that establish your father's ownership of the property. This evidence could include sale deeds, property tax receipts, and other relevant documents. The court will decide the ownership of the property based on the evidence presented, so it's essential to gather as much evidence as possible to support your claim.In conclusion, I recommend consulting a lawyer who can help you navigate the legal system and provide you with the best course of action. It's important to gather as much evidence as possible to support your claim to the property and to be prepared for the possibility that the litigation may not be resolved in your favor.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The stamp duty and registration charges for the POA and relinquishment deed will be based on the market value of the property, which in your case is 65 lacs.The stamp duty and registration charges vary from state to state in India, and also depend on the value of the property. In Maharashtra, the stamp duty for POA is 0.25% of the market value of the property, subject to a maximum of Rs.25,000. The registration charge for POA is Rs.1000.For the relinquishment deed, the stamp duty in Maharashtra is 3% of the market value of the property. In addition, there is a registration fee of 1% of the market value of the property, subject to a maximum of Rs.30,000.Therefore, based on the market value of your property at 65 lacs, the stamp duty for the POA would be Rs.16,250, and the registration fee would be Rs.1,000. The stamp duty for the relinquishment deed would be Rs.1,95,000, and the registration fee would be Rs.30,000.Please note that the stamp duty and registration charges are subject to change, and you should confirm the current charges with the relevant authorities or a local lawyer before proceeding with the transactions.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Since you and your wife are currently living separately and your son is staying with her parents, the first step would be to try to communicate and come to a mutual understanding with your wife about your concerns and wishes.It is important to note that legally, your wife is not obligated to come to your home in Bangalore with your child, as both parents have equal rights to the child's custody. However, you can try to reach a compromise with your wife by discussing your concerns and proposing a plan that works for both of you.You could consider seeking the assistance of a mediator or a family counselor to help facilitate communication and reach an agreement that is in the best interest of your child.

He cannot arrest you until and unless the notice is served and is not complied. In many cases the High Court at Allahabad has severely punished police officers for not complying with guidelines of serving notice to the accused.

    "answer": "According to theHindu Succession Act, 1956, the property of a deceased person is inherited by his legal heirs. In this case, Mr. Z's property would be inherited equally by his two sons, X and Y. However, since both X and Y are deceased, their respective shares in the property would be inherited by their legal heirs. X had one son, A, who is also deceased, but had a son named B. Y had five sons, named C, D, E, F, and G. Therefore, the property would be divided equally among B, C, D, E, F, and G, with each person entitled to a share of 100/6 = 16.67 (rounded off) rupees.Any partition of immovable property must be made by a registered partition deed. The partition deed must be signed by all legal heirs, and each of them must receive their respective share of the property. If any legal heir does not consent to the partition, they can challenge it in court. If the partition does not follow these legal requirements, it may be considered invalid. Therefore, an unregistered partition of property without the consent of all legal heirs would not be considered valid in the eyes of the law. If any legal heir, such as the son or daughter of G, has not signed the partition agreement, it could be challenged in court, and the partition may be considered invalid."

    "answer": "Dear client ,The property of Mr. Z will be inherited by his legal heirs according to the Indian Succession Act, 1925. Since X and Y both died before Mr. Z, their share of the property will pass on to their legal heirs.In this case, X has one son A, who has died, leaving behind his son B. So, B will inherit the share of his father X.Y has 5 sons C, D, E, F, G. Since Y died before Mr. Z, his share of the property will pass on to his legal heirs. In this case, the legal heirs of Y are his sons C, D, E, F, G.Therefore, the property will be divided into 6 equal shares (1 share for each legal heir) and B, C, D, E, F, and G will each inherit 1/6th of the property.Each legal heir will inherit 1/6th of the property. So, in this case, B, C, D, E, F, and G will each inherit Rs. 16.67 (100/6).An unregistered partition of property among legal heirs may be considered valid if it is done with mutual consent and the shares are defined clearly. However, it is always advisable to get the partition deed registered to avoid any future disputes. If any legal heir has not signed the partition deed, their share may not be affected, and they may still be entitled to their share of the property as per the legal inheritance rules.

You would need to provide evidence to prove your ownership of the property, such as the registered gift deed and any other relevant documents.Regarding the donation made by the son of X to the school, if the plot of land donated was legally owned by him, it would be difficult to demolish the school.

    "question": "Land purchase via power of attorney, inhertance impact",
    "answer": "Dear client,Answer 1: If the court orders to attach the property belonging to POA's family members, then your property may also get affected as it was purchased from POA's wife. However, this will depend on the nature and extent of the attachment order passed by the court. If the court only attaches certain specific properties or bank accounts belonging to POA's family members, then your property may not get affected. However, if the court orders a blanket attachment of all properties belonging to POA's family members, then your property may also get attached.Answer 2: The kids of the principal may have a right to the property if it was inherited by the principal as a coparcener property, and not as a self-acquired property. If it was inherited as a coparcener property, then the kids will have a share in the property by birth, irrespective of the fact that their father gave POA while they were minors. However, if it was inherited as a self-acquired property, then the kids will not have any right in the property, unless it was gifted or bequeathed to them by their father.Regarding your second question, the time limit to file a suit for partition is 12 years from the date of knowledge of the cause of action. So, if the kids have recently come to know about the sale of the property by POA, they can still file a suit for partition. However, if the sale was done more than 12 years ago, then the kids will not be able to claim any rights over the property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Registration of a Mortagage Flat in a venture without CC",
    "answer": "Dear client,Before making any payment, it is important to verify the status of the mortgage with the relevant authority to ensure that the builder is authorized to release the mortgage of the particular flat with the money you pay. Additionally, you should also verify the status of the occupancy certificate (OC) and completion certificate (CC) with the local authorities to confirm that the project is compliant with all the necessary regulations and safety standards.If you are satisfied with the status of the mortgage and the necessary certificates, you can proceed with the purchase. However, it is recommended that you enter into a written agreement with the builder, specifying the payment terms and conditions, timelines for obtaining the necessary certificates, and consequences for delay or non-compliance.If the builder is demanding full payment upfront, you can negotiate to pay a token amount as advance to secure the flat, subject to the necessary certificates being obtained within the agreed timelines. You can also include a clause in the agreement that allows you to cancel the agreement and seek a refund if the certificates are not obtained within the agreed timelines.In case of any dispute or non-compliance, you can seek legal recourse through the appropriate authorities or courts.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,I apologize for any confusion in my previous response. As you are an NRI, you will need to execute a Power of Attorney (POA) in favor of a trusted person in India to act on your behalf for the relinquishment deed. The stamp duty and registration charges for the POA and relinquishment deed will be based on the market value of the property, which in your case is 65 lacs.The stamp duty and registration charges vary from state to state in India, and also depend on the value of the property. In Maharashtra, the stamp duty for POA is 0.25% of the market value of the property, subject to a maximum of Rs.25,000. The registration charge for POA is Rs.1000.For the relinquishment deed, the stamp duty in Maharashtra is 3% of the market value of the property. In addition, there is a registration fee of 1% of the market value of the property, subject to a maximum of Rs.30,000.Therefore, based on the market value of your property at 65 lacs, the stamp duty for the POA would be Rs.16,250, and the registration fee would be Rs.1,000. The stamp duty for the relinquishment deed would be Rs.1,95,000, and the registration fee would be Rs.30,000.Please note that the stamp duty and registration charges are subject to change, and you should confirm the current charges with the relevant authorities or a local lawyer before proceeding with the transactions.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "According to theHindu Succession Act, 1956, the property of a deceased person is inherited by his legal heirs. In this case, Mr. Z's property would be inherited equally by his two sons, X and Y. However, since both X and Y are deceased, their respective shares in the property would be inherited by their legal heirs. X had one son, A, who is also deceased, but had a son named B. Y had five sons, named C, D, E, F, and G. Therefore, the property would be divided equally among B, C, D, E, F, and G, with each person entitled to a share of 100/6 = 16.67 (rounded off) rupees.Any partition of immovable property must be made by a registered partition deed. The partition deed must be signed by all legal heirs, and each of them must receive their respective share of the property. If any legal heir does not consent to the partition, they can challenge it in court. If the partition does not follow these legal requirements, it may be considered invalid. Therefore, an unregistered partition of property without the consent of all legal heirs would not be considered valid in the eyes of the law. If any legal heir, such as the son or daughter of G, has not signed the partition agreement, it could be challenged in court, and the partition may be considered invalid."

    "answer": "Dear client ,The property of Mr. Z will be inherited by his legal heirs according to the Indian Succession Act, 1925. Since X and Y both died before Mr. Z, their share of the property will pass on to their legal heirs.In this case, X has one son A, who has died, leaving behind his son B. So, B will inherit the share of his father X.Y has 5 sons C, D, E, F, G. Since Y died before Mr. Z, his share of the property will pass on to his legal heirs. In this case, the legal heirs of Y are his sons C, D, E, F, G.Therefore, the property will be divided into 6 equal shares (1 share for each legal heir) and B, C, D, E, F, and G will each inherit 1/6th of the property.Each legal heir will inherit 1/6th of the property. So, in this case, B, C, D, E, F, and G will each inherit Rs. 16.67 (100/6).An unregistered partition of property among legal heirs may be considered valid if it is done with mutual consent and the shares are defined clearly. However, it is always advisable to get the partition deed registered to avoid any future disputes. If any legal heir has not signed the partition deed, their share may not be affected, and they may still be entitled to their share of the property as per the legal inheritance rules. Therefore, it is important to ensure that all legal heirs sign the partition deed to avoid any future disputes.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, it would depend on how the property is described in the gift deed, and whether it is clear from the document which specific plot was intended to be gifted to your grandfather.Regarding the grandson of X who has taken illegal possession of the property, you can file a case of eviction against him in the appropriate court. You would need to provide evidence to prove your ownership of the property, such as the registered gift deed and any other relevant documents.Regarding the donation made by the son of X to the school, if the plot of land donated was legally owned by him, it would be difficult to demolish the school. However, if the donation was made illegally or if the land was not owned by him, you may be able to take legal action to reclaim the property. You should consult with a lawyer to discuss your options and the specific details of your case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,If the society's PAN card is registered as a firm, then the society can be considered as a partnership firm for the purpose of taking loans. As you mentioned, the previous chairman took a loan against Society Fixed Deposit in the name of the Society which was registered as a firm. If the loan has been paid back, then there should not be any financial damage to the society.However, it is important to verify whether the loan was taken with the consent and approval of the society members and whether the loan agreement was properly documented. If the loan was taken without proper authorization, then it could be considered as a fraudulent act.In any case, it is advisable to consult a legal expert and review the relevant documents such as the loan agreement, society registration documents, and PAN card registration to understand the legal implications and take necessary actions accordingly.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Land purchase via power of attorney, inhertance impact",
    "answer": "Dear client,Answer 1: If the court orders to attach the property belonging to POA's family members, then your property may also get affected as it was purchased from POA's wife. However, this will depend on the nature and extent of the attachment order passed by the court. If the court only attaches certain specific properties or bank accounts belonging to POA's family members, then your property may not get affected. However, if the court orders a blanket attachment of all properties belonging to POA's family members, then your property may also get attached.Answer 2: The kids of the principal may have a right to the property if it was inherited by the principal as a coparcener property, and not as a self-acquired property. If it was inherited as a coparcener property, then the kids will have a share in the property by birth, irrespective of the fact that their father gave POA while they were minors. However, if it was inherited as a self-acquired property, then the kids will not have any right in the property, unless it was gifted or bequeathed to them by their father.Regarding your second question, the time limit to file a suit for partition is 12 years from the date of knowledge of the cause of action. So, if the kids have recently come to know about the sale of the property by POA, they can still file a suit for partition. However, if the sale was done more than 12 years ago, then the kids will not be able to claim any rights over the property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It is understandable that you are frustrated with the legal system and the difficulty you have faced in trying to unfreeze your funds.In general, banks are required to comply with law enforcement requests to freeze accounts and funds if there is suspected illegal activity, such as fraud or money laundering. This is done to prevent the proceeds of crime from being used or transferred, and to facilitate any investigations.If you have not been contacted by the police or received any legal notice or summons, it is possible that the investigation is ongoing and you may be contacted in the future. It is important to cooperate with any investigation and provide any information that may be requested.In terms of recovering your funds, you may want to consider seeking legal advice from a lawyer who is familiar with banking and cryptocurrency laws. They can advise you on the best course of action and whether it is necessary to obtain a court order to unfreeze your funds.It is important to remember that the legal process can be slow and frustrating, but it is designed to ensure that justice is served.

    "question": "How many dates can Civil court give?",
    "answer": "Yes, you may ask the court to award you costs for every adjournment if you feel that the adjournments were caused due to the other party or their lawyer's delay or misconduct. The court has the discretion to award costs in such situations, but it will depend on the specific facts and circumstances of your case. You may want to discuss this with your lawyer and request them to make a plea for costs on every adjournment in court.Regarding checking court records, you can request your lawyer to provide you with a copy of the court attendance sheet for each hearing. This sheet will typically have the details of the lawyers and parties present in court on that day. You can also request your lawyer to provide you with updates after each hearing, including whether they attended the hearing and what transpired in court. If you have any doubts or concerns about your lawyer's attendance, you can discuss it with them and seek clarification.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Land purchase via power of attorney, inhertance impact",
    "answer": "Dear client,Answer 1: If the court orders to attach the property belonging to POA's family members, then your property may also get affected as it was purchased from POA's wife. However, this will depend on the nature and extent of the attachment order passed by the court. If the court only attaches certain specific properties or bank accounts belonging to POA's family members, then your property may not get affected. However, if the court orders a blanket attachment of all properties belonging to POA's family members, then your property may also get attached.Answer 2: The kids of the principal may have a right to the property if it was inherited by the principal as a coparcener property, and not as a self-acquired property. If it was inherited as a coparcener property, then the kids will have a share in the property by birth, irrespective of the fact that their father gave POA while they were minors. However, if it was inherited as a self-acquired property, then the kids will not have any right in the property, unless it was gifted or bequeathed to them by their father.Regarding your second question, the time limit to file a suit for partition is 12 years from the date of knowledge of the cause of action. So, if the kids have recently come to know about the sale of the property by POA, they can still file a suit for partition. However, if the sale was done more than 12 years ago, then the kids will not be able to claim any rights over the property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The notice contains details such as time and place of where to meet, etc. and he is duty bound to prepare it within 2 weeks of filing the FIR. He cannot arrest you until and unless the notice is served and is not complied. In many cases the High Court at Allahabad has severely punished police officers for not complying with guidelines of serving notice to the accused.

Since you and your wife are currently living separately and your son is staying with her parents, the first step would be to try to communicate and come to a mutual understanding with your wife about your concerns and wishes.It is important to note that legally, your wife is not obligated to come to your home in Bangalore with your child, as both parents have equal rights to the child's custody. However, you can try to reach a compromise with your wife by discussing your concerns and proposing a plan that works for both of you.You could consider seeking the assistance of a mediator or a family counselor to help facilitate communication and reach an agreement that is in the best interest of your child. It may also be helpful to consult with a family lawyer to understand your legal rights and options in this situation.Ultimately, it is important to prioritize the well-being and best interests of your child, and work towards a solution that is beneficial for all parties involved.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "According to theHindu Succession Act, 1956, the property of a deceased person is inherited by his legal heirs. In this case, Mr. Z's property would be inherited equally by his two sons, X and Y. However, since both X and Y are deceased, their respective shares in the property would be inherited by their legal heirs. X had one son, A, who is also deceased, but had a son named B. Y had five sons, named C, D, E, F, and G. Therefore, the property would be divided equally among B, C, D, E, F, and G, with each person entitled to a share of 100/6 = 16.67 (rounded off) rupees.Any partition of immovable property must be made by a registered partition deed. The partition deed must be signed by all legal heirs, and each of them must receive their respective share of the property. If any legal heir does not consent to the partition, they can challenge it in court. If the partition does not follow these legal requirements, it may be considered invalid. Therefore, an unregistered partition of property without the consent of all legal heirs would not be considered valid in the eyes of the law. If any legal heir, such as the son or daughter of G, has not signed the partition agreement, it could be challenged in court, and the partition may be considered invalid."

    "answer": "Dear client ,The property of Mr. Z will be inherited by his legal heirs according to the Indian Succession Act, 1925. Since X and Y both died before Mr. Z, their share of the property will pass on to their legal heirs.In this case, X has one son A, who has died, leaving behind his son B. So, B will inherit the share of his father X.Y has 5 sons C, D, E, F, G. Since Y died before Mr. Z, his share of the property will pass on to his legal heirs. In this case, the legal heirs of Y are his sons C, D, E, F, G.Therefore, the property will be divided into 6 equal shares (1 share for each legal heir) and B, C, D, E, F, and G will each inherit 1/6th of the property.Each legal heir will inherit 1/6th of the property. So, in this case, B, C, D, E, F, and G will each inherit Rs. 16.67 (100/6).An unregistered partition of property among legal heirs may be considered valid if it is done with mutual consent and the shares are defined clearly. However, it is always advisable to get the partition deed registered to avoid any future disputes. If any legal heir has not signed the partition deed, their share may not be affected, and they may still be entitled to their share of the property as per the legal inheritance rules.

    "question": "Civil",
    "answer": "Dear client,If the khata number is wrongly mentioned in the gift deed, it could potentially create confusion and disputes related to the ownership of the property. However, it would depend on how the property is described in the gift deed, and whether it is clear from the document which specific plot was intended to be gifted to your grandfather.Regarding the grandson of X who has taken illegal possession of the property, you can file a case of eviction against him in the appropriate court. You would need to provide evidence to prove your ownership of the property, such as the registered gift deed and any other relevant documents.Regarding the donation made by the son of X to the school, if the plot of land donated was legally owned by him, it would be difficult to demolish the school. However, if the donation was made illegally or if the land was not owned by him, you may be able to take legal action to reclaim the property.

    "answer": "Dear client,I am sorry to hear about your situation. It is understandable that you are frustrated with the legal system and the difficulty you have faced in trying to unfreeze your funds.In general, banks are required to comply with law enforcement requests to freeze accounts and funds if there is suspected illegal activity, such as fraud or money laundering. This is done to prevent the proceeds of crime from being used or transferred, and to facilitate any investigations.If you have not been contacted by the police or received any legal notice or summons, it is possible that the investigation is ongoing and you may be contacted in the future. It is important to cooperate with any investigation and provide any information that may be requested.In terms of recovering your funds, you may want to consider seeking legal advice from a lawyer who is familiar with banking and cryptocurrency laws. They can advise you on the best course of action and whether it is necessary to obtain a court order to unfreeze your funds.It is important to remember that the legal process can be slow and frustrating, but it is designed to ensure that justice is served.

    "answer": "Dear client,If the khata number is wrongly mentioned in the gift deed, it could potentially create confusion and disputes related to the ownership of the property. However, it would depend on how the property is described in the gift deed, and whether it is clear from the document which specific plot was intended to be gifted to your grandfather.Regarding the grandson of X who has taken illegal possession of the property, you can file a case of eviction against him in the appropriate court. You would need to provide evidence to prove your ownership of the property, such as the registered gift deed and any other relevant documents.Regarding the donation made by the son of X to the school, if the plot of land donated was legally owned by him, it would be difficult to demolish the school. However, if the donation was made illegally or if the land was not owned by him, you may be able to take legal action to reclaim the property. You should consult with a lawyer to discuss your options and the specific details of your case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,I am sorry to hear about your situation. It is understandable that you are frustrated with the legal system and the difficulty you have faced in trying to unfreeze your funds.In general, banks are required to comply with law enforcement requests to freeze accounts and funds if there is suspected illegal activity, such as fraud or money laundering. This is done to prevent the proceeds of crime from being used or transferred, and to facilitate any investigations.If you have not been contacted by the police or received any legal notice or summons, it is possible that the investigation is ongoing and you may be contacted in the future. It is important to cooperate with any investigation and provide any information that may be requested.In terms of recovering your funds, you may want to consider seeking legal advice from a lawyer who is familiar with banking and cryptocurrency laws. They can advise you on the best course of action and whether it is necessary to obtain a court order to unfreeze your funds.It is important to remember that the legal process can be slow and frustrating, but it is designed to ensure that justice is served.

The notice contains details such as time and place of where to meet, etc. and he is duty bound to prepare it within 2 weeks of filing the FIR. He cannot arrest you until and unless the notice is served and is not complied. In many cases the High Court at Allahabad has severely punished police officers for not complying with guidelines of serving notice to the accused.

    "answer": "According to theHindu Succession Act, 1956, the property of a deceased person is inherited by his legal heirs. In this case, Mr. Z's property would be inherited equally by his two sons, X and Y. However, since both X and Y are deceased, their respective shares in the property would be inherited by their legal heirs. X had one son, A, who is also deceased, but had a son named B. Y had five sons, named C, D, E, F, and G. Therefore, the property would be divided equally among B, C, D, E, F, and G, with each person entitled to a share of 100/6 = 16.67 (rounded off) rupees.Any partition of immovable property must be made by a registered partition deed. The partition deed must be signed by all legal heirs, and each of them must receive their respective share of the property. If any legal heir does not consent to the partition, they can challenge it in court. If the partition does not follow these legal requirements, it may be considered invalid. Therefore, an unregistered partition of property without the consent of all legal heirs would not be considered valid in the eyes of the law. If any legal heir, such as the son or daughter of G, has not signed the partition agreement, it could be challenged in court, and the partition may be considered invalid."

    "answer": "Dear client ,The property of Mr. Z will be inherited by his legal heirs according to the Indian Succession Act, 1925. Since X and Y both died before Mr. Z, their share of the property will pass on to their legal heirs.In this case, X has one son A, who has died, leaving behind his son B. So, B will inherit the share of his father X.Y has 5 sons C, D, E, F, G. Since Y died before Mr. Z, his share of the property will pass on to his legal heirs. In this case, the legal heirs of Y are his sons C, D, E, F, G.Therefore, the property will be divided into 6 equal shares (1 share for each legal heir) and B, C, D, E, F, and G will each inherit 1/6th of the property.Each legal heir will inherit 1/6th of the property. So, in this case, B, C, D, E, F, and G will each inherit Rs. 16.67 (100/6).An unregistered partition of property among legal heirs may be considered valid if it is done with mutual consent and the shares are defined clearly. However, it is always advisable to get the partition deed registered to avoid any future disputes. If any legal heir has not signed the partition deed, their share may not be affected, and they may still be entitled to their share of the property as per the legal inheritance rules. Therefore, it is important to ensure that all legal heirs sign the partition deed to avoid any future disputes.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,If the khata number is wrongly mentioned in the gift deed, it could potentially create confusion and disputes related to the ownership of the property. However, it would depend on how the property is described in the gift deed, and whether it is clear from the document which specific plot was intended to be gifted to your grandfather.Regarding the grandson of X who has taken illegal possession of the property, you can file a case of eviction against him in the appropriate court. You would need to provide evidence to prove your ownership of the property, such as the registered gift deed and any other relevant documents.Regarding the donation made by the son of X to the school, if the plot of land donated was legally owned by him, it would be difficult to demolish the school. However, if the donation was made illegally or if the land was not owned by him, you may be able to take legal action to reclaim the property.

    "question": "Child custody of US citizen residing in india",
    "answer": "Dear client,I'm sorry to hear about your situation. As a language model, I can provide you with some general guidance, but please note that you should consult with a qualified attorney for legal advice specific to your case.Since your wife and child are currently residing in India, it may be more appropriate to initiate legal action in India to seek custody or visitation rights. However, since your son is a US citizen, you may also be able to seek assistance from the US government to enforce your custody or visitation rights.If you have a court order specifying visitation rights, you may be able to seek enforcement of that order in India through the Indian courts. You would need to consult with a qualified attorney in India to understand the specific procedures and requirements for seeking enforcement.Alternatively, you may be able to seek assistance from the US government through the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. The Hague Convention is an international treaty that provides a framework for the return of children who have been wrongfully removed from their country of habitual residence. However, in order to seek relief under the Hague Convention, you would need to show that your child was wrongfully removed from the US.In any case, it would be important to gather evidence to support your case, such as documentation of your wife's agreement to joint custody and evidence of her mental health issues and suicidal threats.Again, I strongly recommend consulting with a qualified attorney who is experienced in international child custody cases to discuss your options and develop a strategy for pursuing your rights.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,I'm sorry to hear about your situation. As a nominee and legal heir, you are entitled to receive the Hereditary Renewal Commission, Gratuity, and other benefits that your father was eligible for as an LIC agent.Firstly, you should try to resolve the matter through the LIC branch where your father was associated. You can request a meeting with the Development Officer in charge of your father's agency and present all the necessary documents to support your claim. If the officer is unresponsive or unhelpful, you can escalate the matter to higher authorities within LIC.If you are still unable to receive a satisfactory response from LIC, you may consider filing a legal case against the Development Officer or LIC. You can approach the Consumer Forum or the Civil Court, depending on the amount of money involved in the claim. In case you suspect foul play, you can also file a complaint with the police.As for Public Litigation Interest (PIL), it is a legal mechanism used in India to bring matters of public importance to the attention of the court. While your case may not necessarily qualify as a PIL, you can certainly seek legal assistance to pursue your claim through the appropriate legal channels.It is advisable to seek the guidance of a lawyer who specializes in such matters to understand the legal options available to you and to represent you in court if necessary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "A khata and OC CC related",
    "answer": "Dear client,If the builder has built an extra floor more than the approved plan, it could mean that the building is in violation of the local building bylaws and regulations. This may lead to legal issues in the future, such as demolition of the building, fines or penalties, and difficulty in getting necessary approvals.Regarding the builder's promise to get an A khata, it's important to verify whether the builder has obtained all necessary approvals from the local authorities, including the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB). Without these approvals, getting an A khata may not be possible, and it could lead to legal complications.With respect to the bank providing loans for the property, it's possible that the bank may not be aware of the deviation from the approved plan. It's important for you to do your own due diligence and verify all information provided by the builder before making any decisions.It's always advisable to consult with a local property lawyer who can help you conduct a thorough due diligence and provide you with the necessary legal advice before purchasing a property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

You can provide them with relevant documents such as court orders or custody agreements that show that you have sole custody and decision-making authority for your daughter. You can also provide a written explanation of the circumstances that prevent you from obtaining the letter from your ex-husband. The school may be able to make an exception and admit your daughter without the letter.Another option is to seek legal advice from your lawyer regarding this matter. Your lawyer may be able to intervene and provide a legal opinion on the school's requirement for a letter from the father.

    "question": "Can i challenge WILL if the property given to me is of litigation or withdraw will after execution",
    "answer": "Dear client,I'm sorry to hear about the complicated situation with your father's properties. It can be challenging to navigate these legal matters, but I will do my best to provide you with some guidance.Firstly, regarding the gift deed and will, it's important to understand that gift deeds and wills are two separate legal instruments. A gift deed transfers the ownership of the property immediately, whereas a will only transfers the ownership upon the death of the testator (your father in this case). So, the 4 acres of land gifted to your father's second wife belongs to her, and it is not part of your father's estate that is subject to distribution under his will.Regarding the litigation on the 3 acres of land bequeathed to you in your father's will, it would be best to consult a lawyer who can help you navigate the legal system and provide you with the best course of action. Filing a partition suit may be an option, but it depends on the specifics of your case and the laws in your jurisdiction. It's also worth noting that if the litigation results in the land being transferred to someone else, then that land will no longer be part of your father's estate and will not be distributed according to his will.Regarding the ancestral property and the third party's claim, it's crucial to gather all relevant documents and evidence that establish your father's ownership of the property. This evidence could include sale deeds, property tax receipts, and other relevant documents. The court will decide the ownership of the property based on the evidence presented, so it's essential to gather as much evidence as possible to support your claim.In conclusion, I recommend consulting a lawyer who can help you navigate the legal system and provide you with the best course of action. It's important to gather as much evidence as possible to support your claim to the property and to be prepared for the possibility that the litigation may not be resolved in your favor.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The notice contains details such as time and place of where to meet, etc. and he is duty bound to prepare it within 2 weeks of filing the FIR. He cannot arrest you until and unless the notice is served and is not complied. In many cases the High Court at Allahabad has severely punished police officers for not complying with guidelines of serving notice to the accused.

    "question": "Father is threatening and harassing me for selling the co-owned flat .",
    "answer": "1.  You do not have to take precautionary steps in anticipation of his moves against you.You do not have to budge to his pressures.  you are also a owner of the property that too you have 80% share in the property.If he is going to police, let him go, the police cannot take any action against you becasue it is basically a property dispute and there is an evidence that he also owns 20% share in the property, hence there is no chance tof you ignoring him.If at all he is aggrieved as a senior citizen, he can very well approach the tribunal for senior citizens welfare, where he has to state the facts that he owns 20^ as well as he has to prove that he was driven out or he has no source to maintain himself, which cannot be possible because he has to tell lies and if the tribunal finds that he is lying before court, then his case will be dismissed after which he cannot knock the doors of any legal forum again.2. You ask him to transfer his share in the proeprty by a registered sale deed and express that you are ready to pay the market rate towards this or vice versa, i.e., you can offer your share of property to him for sale at the market rate.The gift deed will become a headache for life long,hence you may avoid such an subject in this connection.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Father is threatening and harassing me for selling the co-owned flat .",
    "answer": "Dear client,To safeguard yourself from false complaints, you can document all the payments made by you towards the home loan and maintain a record of all the correspondence with your father. If your father files a false complaint, you can present your evidence to the police and the court to prove your innocence. Additionally, you can consult a lawyer to file an anticipatory bail application to protect yourself from arrest in case your father files a false complaint.Yes, you can pay back his 20% share and claim 100% ownership of the property via a gift deed. However, it is important to note that such a gift deed may be challenged by your father in the future if he changes his mind. To avoid any future legal disputes, you can enter into a settlement agreement with your father and have it registered with the Sub-Registrar of Assurances. This agreement will outline the terms and conditions of the transfer of ownership, including the amount to be paid and the release of any future claims or demands.Regarding the consequences of the gift deed, it will transfer the ownership of the property from your father to you. However, it is important to ensure that the gift deed is executed on a proper legal stamp paper and is registered with the Sub-Registrar of Assurances. You may also need to pay any applicable stamp duty and registration fees.Regarding the mistake in the purchase agreement, you can approach the developer or builder and ask for a correction to be made in the agreement. Alternatively, you can consult a lawyer to explore legal options to rectify the error.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "A khata and OC CC related",
    "answer": "Dear client,If the builder has built an extra floor more than the approved plan, it could mean that the building is in violation of the local building bylaws and regulations. This may lead to legal issues in the future, such as demolition of the building, fines or penalties, and difficulty in getting necessary approvals.Regarding the builder's promise to get an A khata, it's important to verify whether the builder has obtained all necessary approvals from the local authorities, including the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB). Without these approvals, getting an A khata may not be possible, and it could lead to legal complications.With respect to the bank providing loans for the property, it's possible that the bank may not be aware of the deviation from the approved plan. It's important for you to do your own due diligence and verify all information provided by the builder before making any decisions.It's always advisable to consult with a local property lawyer who can help you conduct a thorough due diligence and provide you with the necessary legal advice before purchasing a property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Child custody of US citizen residing in india",
    "answer": "Dear client,I'm sorry to hear about your situation. As a language model, I can provide you with some general guidance, but please note that you should consult with a qualified attorney for legal advice specific to your case.Since your wife and child are currently residing in India, it may be more appropriate to initiate legal action in India to seek custody or visitation rights. However, since your son is a US citizen, you may also be able to seek assistance from the US government to enforce your custody or visitation rights.If you have a court order specifying visitation rights, you may be able to seek enforcement of that order in India through the Indian courts. You would need to consult with a qualified attorney in India to understand the specific procedures and requirements for seeking enforcement.Alternatively, you may be able to seek assistance from the US government through the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. The Hague Convention is an international treaty that provides a framework for the return of children who have been wrongfully removed from their country of habitual residence. However, in order to seek relief under the Hague Convention, you would need to show that your child was wrongfully removed from the US.In any case, it would be important to gather evidence to support your case, such as documentation of your wife's agreement to joint custody and evidence of her mental health issues and suicidal threats.Again, I strongly recommend consulting with a qualified attorney who is experienced in international child custody cases to discuss your options and develop a strategy for pursuing your rights.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Without these approvals, getting an A khata may not be possible, and it could lead to legal complications.With respect to the bank providing loans for the property, it's possible that the bank may not be aware of the deviation from the approved plan.

You can also provide a written explanation of the circumstances that prevent you from obtaining the letter from your ex-husband.

    "question": "Purchase agriculture land from our past agriculture savings before we sold land",
    "answer": "Dear client,Based on the information provided, it appears that you have purchased agricultural land before selling your previous agricultural land. You intend to use the newly purchased land for farming purposes, and you have filed tax returns for agricultural income in the past. However, you have been denied exemption under section 54B of the Income Tax Act, 1961, which provides exemption on the capital gains arising from the sale of agricultural land if the sale proceeds are invested in another agricultural land within a specified period.To claim exemption under section 54B, the newly purchased land must be used for agricultural purposes for at least two years from the date of its acquisition. Since you have sold your previous agricultural land within a few months of purchasing the new land, you may not be eligible for exemption under this section.In order to appeal against the order denying exemption, you may need to provide additional evidence to establish that your intent was to use the newly purchased land for agricultural purposes only. This may include proof of your past agricultural income, evidence of the fertility and suitability of the new land for farming, and any other relevant documents.It is recommended that you consult with a qualified tax professional or a lawyer to understand your options and to prepare a strong case for your appeal. They can also guide you on the specific procedures and requirements for filing an appeal in your jurisdiction.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Child custody of US citizen residing in india",
    "answer": "Dear client,I'm sorry to hear about your situation. As a language model, I can provide you with some general guidance, but please note that you should consult with a qualified attorney for legal advice specific to your case.Since your wife and child are currently residing in India, it may be more appropriate to initiate legal action in India to seek custody or visitation rights. However, since your son is a US citizen, you may also be able to seek assistance from the US government to enforce your custody or visitation rights.If you have a court order specifying visitation rights, you may be able to seek enforcement of that order in India through the Indian courts. You would need to consult with a qualified attorney in India to understand the specific procedures and requirements for seeking enforcement.Alternatively, you may be able to seek assistance from the US government through the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. The Hague Convention is an international treaty that provides a framework for the return of children who have been wrongfully removed from their country of habitual residence. However, in order to seek relief under the Hague Convention, you would need to show that your child was wrongfully removed from the US.In any case, it would be important to gather evidence to support your case, such as documentation of your wife's agreement to joint custody and evidence of her mental health issues and suicidal threats.Again, I strongly recommend consulting with a qualified attorney who is experienced in international child custody cases to discuss your options and develop a strategy for pursuing your rights.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Purchase agriculture land from our past agriculture savings before we sold land",
    "answer": "Dear client,Based on the information provided, it appears that you have purchased agricultural land before selling your previous agricultural land. You intend to use the newly purchased land for farming purposes, and you have filed tax returns for agricultural income in the past. However, you have been denied exemption under section 54B of the Income Tax Act, 1961, which provides exemption on the capital gains arising from the sale of agricultural land if the sale proceeds are invested in another agricultural land within a specified period.To claim exemption under section 54B, the newly purchased land must be used for agricultural purposes for at least two years from the date of its acquisition. Since you have sold your previous agricultural land within a few months of purchasing the new land, you may not be eligible for exemption under this section.In order to appeal against the order denying exemption, you may need to provide additional evidence to establish that your intent was to use the newly purchased land for agricultural purposes only. This may include proof of your past agricultural income, evidence of the fertility and suitability of the new land for farming, and any other relevant documents.It is recommended that you consult with a qualified tax professional or a lawyer to understand your options and to prepare a strong case for your appeal. They can also guide you on the specific procedures and requirements for filing an appeal in your jurisdiction.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Converting agricultural land to non agricultural/karnataka",
    "answer": "Dear client,The likelihood of the conversion of the property from agricultural to non-agricultural use will depend on various factors, including the specific rules and regulations of the local authorities and the prevailing land use policies. However, if the property is not being used for agricultural purposes and is surrounded by similar properties with houses, there may be a decent chance of it being reclassified as non-agricultural.To ensure a smooth and successful conversion process, it is advisable to hire a local lawyer who specializes in property law and has experience in handling similar cases. The lawyer can guide you through the application process, review the necessary documents, and represent you before the relevant authorities. The lawyer's fees may vary depending on their experience, reputation, and the complexity of the case, so it is best to discuss this with the lawyer directly.To get the process started, the seller may need to provide various documents, such as the property deed, survey map, and tax receipts, among others. Your lawyer can advise you on the specific documents required and help you obtain them from the seller.Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I am not able to provide specific lawyer recommendations or legal services. However, you may be able to find a suitable lawyer by searching online for property lawyers in Uttara Kannada district or by asking for referrals from local real estate agents or other professionals.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

You ask him to transfer his share in the proeprty by a registered sale deed and express that you are ready to pay the market rate towards this or vice versa, i.e., you can offer your share of property to him for sale at the market rate.The gift deed will become a headache for life long,hence you may avoid such an subject in this connection.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear client,To safeguard yourself from false complaints, you can document all the payments made by you towards the home loan and maintain a record of all the correspondence with your father. If your father files a false complaint, you can present your evidence to the police and the court to prove your innocence. Additionally, you can consult a lawyer to file an anticipatory bail application to protect yourself from arrest in case your father files a false complaint.Yes, you can pay back his 20% share and claim 100% ownership of the property via a gift deed. However, it is important to note that such a gift deed may be challenged by your father in the future if he changes his mind. To avoid any future legal disputes, you can enter into a settlement agreement with your father and have it registered with the Sub-Registrar of Assurances. This agreement will outline the terms and conditions of the transfer of ownership, including the amount to be paid and the release of any future claims or demands.Regarding the consequences of the gift deed, it will transfer the ownership of the property from your father to you. However, it is important to ensure that the gift deed is executed on a proper legal stamp paper and is registered with the Sub-Registrar of Assurances. You may also need to pay any applicable stamp duty and registration fees.Regarding the mistake in the purchase agreement, you can approach the developer or builder and ask for a correction to be made in the agreement. Alternatively, you can consult a lawyer to explore legal options to rectify the error.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "If all the 221 unit owners have already signed the conveyance deed containing the clause that Godrej living will maintain the society, and the conveyance has been executed, then the unit owners will have to abide by the terms and conditions mentioned in the deed. However, if the conveyance is still pending, the unit owners can request the developer to modify the clause to provide them with the option to choose their own maintenance agency.B. As per Section 11(4) of the Maharashtra Real Estate (Regulation and Development) (Registration of Real Estate Projects, Registration of Real Estate Agents, Rates of Interest and Disclosures on Website) Rules, 2017, the promoter or developer is not authorized to impose any restriction on the association of allottees, in the matters related to maintenance and transfer of the association, after the formation of such association or society or federation of such associations or societies.Therefore, the developer cannot force the society to be maintained only by Godrej living, and such a clause is not allowed under RERA. If the developer is charging unreasonable amounts for maintenance, the committee can raise the issue with the developer or file a complaint with the RERA authority.C. If the conveyance is still pending, the unit owners can raise their objections to the clause regarding the maintenance agency and request for its modification. Once the conveyance is executed, it becomes legally binding on all parties, and any modifications can be made only with the mutual agreement of all parties involved. However, if the clause is found to be in violation of RERA rules, the unit owners can approach the RERA authority for necessary action.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,If all 221 members have signed the conveyance deed containing the clause and later the society calls AGM and on majority vote decide to remove Godrej Living, it would be legal as long as the society follows the legal procedures and obtains the required majority for the resolution to be passed. However, Godrej Living may challenge the decision in court and seek appropriate legal remedies if they feel that their contractual rights have been violated.Written consent of all 221 members to remove Godrej Living may not be necessary if the society follows the legal procedures for passing a resolution to remove Godrej Living. The exact requirements for passing such a resolution may vary depending on the laws applicable to the society, but generally, a simple majority vote of the members present and voting at the AGM should be sufficient.If the society decides not to go ahead with the conveyance deed, they may need to negotiate with Godrej Living to amend the terms of the agreement or to terminate the agreement altogether. If the society goes ahead with the conveyance deed and Godrej Living challenges it in court, the society may need to defend the legality of the agreement and the removal of the clause, and may need to seek appropriate legal remedies if their position is challenged.The provisions of the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act and other relevant state laws would apply to the society's actions, but the terms of the conveyance deed would also be legally binding on the parties who signed it. In case of conflicts between the two, a court would need to determine which provision takes precedence based on the specific facts and circumstances of the case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"
