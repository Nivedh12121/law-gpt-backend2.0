    "answer": "France is not a country with whom India has bilateral treaty for execution of decrees passed in France or vice-versa under Section 44A of Civil Procedure Code, 1908. The only option available is to file a suit on the grounds of the judgment passed by a foreign court. It can be done from abroad through GPA/POA but for filing proceedings through GPA/POA at least one party should be present in India. However, you can file such proceedings from France appearing in Court virtually through video conference and obtain such decree from Indian Court. SDM  does have any jurisdiction to pass such order, it has to be judicial authority.

If he has the decree and other required documents, the process should proceed smoothly.You can submit aNo Objection Statementto support the case.Time Limit:There isno strict time limitto file a declaration suit for recognizing a foreign divorce decree in India. You can initiate the process after August 2025 if necessary.Duration for Court Proceedings:Typically, Indian courts take6–12 monthsto issue a declaration recognizing the foreign divorce decree, depending on court workload.Next Steps:Reissue the POA with proper embassy attestation and corrections.Have your ex-husband initiate the case in January.Consult your lawyer to ensure all documents meet Indian legal requirements.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.

    "question": "Can someone sell property with Power of Attorney",
    "answer": "A power of attorney cannot assign their authority to another person unless the original POA document expressly grants them that power. Such a clause is uncommon because the principal has typically chosen a specific person or persons they trust to act as their agent.Because the Power of Attorney holder is also the proprietor of the property involved, he may legally sell the property to himself as well. But it cannot be transferred through PoA unless by a registered sale deed. This is per the latest Supreme Court judgement on power of attorney.PoA remains valid only till the life of the principal. Within their lifetime also, one can revoke the PoA. A SPA gets revoked on its own as soon as the specific transaction for which it was executed is completed.The Powers-of-Attorney Act, 1882 is a law in India that defines a power of attorney as an instrument that gives a person the authority to act on behalf of another person.The validity of a power of attorney deed is governed by the provisions of the Powers of Attorney Act, 1882 and the Registration Act, 1908.Section 33 of the Registration Act recognizes the following powers of attorney.Executed before and authenticated by a Registrar or Sub-Registrar .Executed before and authenticated by a Magistrate.Executed before and authenticated by a Notary Public, or any Court, Judge, Magistrate, Consul or Vice-Consul, or representative of the Central Government.The Supreme Court has ruled that a power of attorney cannot be recognized as a title document or a document that confers rights in any immovable property.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88764 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Can someone sell property with Power of Attorney",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case, the abuse of the POA and subsequent illegal transactions are clear violations of property laws. A POA holder is the agent who acts on behalf of the principal (in this case, your mother) and cannot transfer the POA to another unless so authorized in the original POA. The second developer selling to himself, and subsequent mutation, is a legally questionable transaction as it involves breach of fiduciary duty and the unauthorised sale. Publication of cancellation of POA in newspaper would add strength to your case but the fact that no stay order was passed made it possible to complete more transactions. Frame the case: Highlight illegality in the POA transfer, and hence, the fraudulent sale deed and no consent from your mother. Seek cancellation of all subsequent transactions, restoration of ownership of the land to you, and damages for financial and emotional distress. File a petition for interim stay on further alienation of the property, present all legal notices and documents in proper format, and move for expeditious disposal citing delay that has become too protracted. The case requires careful legal drafting to emphasize procedural violations and abuse of the POA.Hope you find this answer helpful in resolving the issue.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has the authority to take action against unauthorized constructions, which can include demolition or penalties. Relying on potential future regularization schemes, such as the Building Regularisation Scheme (BRS), is uncertain and may not materialize. Additionally, obtaining home loans for such properties can be challenging, as financial institutions typically require proper approvals. Investing in a property without the necessary approvals can lead to legal complications and financial losses. It is advisable to purchase properties that have all requisite approvals to ensure a secure investment.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.

Here’s why it's crucial and what you should consider when the OC is not yet issued:Why is the Occupancy Certificate Important?Legal Compliance: The OC certifies that the building has been constructed and completed according to the approved plans and complies with all the regulations set by the local municipal authority. It ensures that the building is suitable for occupancy, which is essential for the safety and legality of living in it.Essential Services: Having an OC often ties into the provision of essential services like water, electricity, and sanitation. Local authorities may restrict the official connection of these services until the OC is issued.Loan Approval: Most banks and financial institutions require an OC for loan approval. If you plan to apply for a mortgage or sell the property in the future, having an OC can be crucial.Resale Value: Properties with an OC generally have a better resale value and are more attractive to buyers, ensuring fewer complications in the selling process.Should You Avoid Properties Without an OC?Risk Assessment: Buying a property without an OC does carry risks, primarily if the builder fails to obtain it in the future. There may be underlying issues or deviations from approved plans that could delay or prevent the issuance of the OC.Builder's Promise: If the builder promises to obtain the OC within a few months, it’s essential to assess the reliability and track record of the builder. However, promises can be delayed or unfulfilled due to various factors outside the builder's control.Protective Measures If Considering Purchase:Conditional Agreement: If you are strongly considering the property, you might negotiate a conditional agreement where the final purchase is contingent upon the issuance of the OC. This can protect your investment and ensure you don’t end up owning a property without essential legal approvals.Legal Review: Have a property lawyer review all documents and the terms of purchase. The lawyer can help ensure that your rights are protected, particularly regarding the contingency for the OC.Escrow Arrangement: Consider an escrow arrangement where your payment is held in an escrow account until the OC is delivered.In summary, while purchasing a property without an OC is generally advised against due to the associated risks, if you find a property that meets all other criteria and you have confidence in the builder’s ability to secure the OC, ensure that your investment is protected through legally binding safeguards.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.

    "question": "Can someone sell property with Power of Attorney",
    "answer": "A power of attorney cannot assign their authority to another person unless the original POA document expressly grants them that power. Such a clause is uncommon because the principal has typically chosen a specific person or persons they trust to act as their agent.Because the Power of Attorney holder is also the proprietor of the property involved, he may legally sell the property to himself as well. But it cannot be transferred through PoA unless by a registered sale deed. This is per the latest Supreme Court judgement on power of attorney.PoA remains valid only till the life of the principal. Within their lifetime also, one can revoke the PoA. A SPA gets revoked on its own as soon as the specific transaction for which it was executed is completed.The Powers-of-Attorney Act, 1882 is a law in India that defines a power of attorney as an instrument that gives a person the authority to act on behalf of another person.The validity of a power of attorney deed is governed by the provisions of the Powers of Attorney Act, 1882 and the Registration Act, 1908.Section 33 of the Registration Act recognizes the following powers of attorney.Executed before and authenticated by a Registrar or Sub-Registrar .Executed before and authenticated by a Magistrate.Executed before and authenticated by a Notary Public, or any Court, Judge, Magistrate, Consul or Vice-Consul, or representative of the Central Government.The Supreme Court has ruled that a power of attorney cannot be recognized as a title document or a document that confers rights in any immovable property.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88764 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case, the abuse of the POA and subsequent illegal transactions are clear violations of property laws. A POA holder is the agent who acts on behalf of the principal (in this case, your mother) and cannot transfer the POA to another unless so authorized in the original POA. The second developer selling to himself, and subsequent mutation, is a legally questionable transaction as it involves breach of fiduciary duty and the unauthorised sale. Publication of cancellation of POA in newspaper would add strength to your case but the fact that no stay order was passed made it possible to complete more transactions. Frame the case: Highlight illegality in the POA transfer, and hence, the fraudulent sale deed and no consent from your mother. Seek cancellation of all subsequent transactions, restoration of ownership of the land to you, and damages for financial and emotional distress. File a petition for interim stay on further alienation of the property, present all legal notices and documents in proper format, and move for expeditious disposal citing delay that has become too protracted. The case requires careful legal drafting to emphasize procedural violations and abuse of the POA.Hope you find this answer helpful in resolving the issue.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client, I shall try to describe this in terms of the act of your neighbor towards the boundary wall and growth of trees. If such a boundary wall was erected by you on your property, then without your permission, barbed wires cannot be done. That may amount to trespass and by law you would have each right to claim removal of something like that after serving notice demanding such removal. If they refuse, you can sue them civilly to get an injunction compelling them not to do any unauthorized alteration or incursion on your property. Again, the same goes for planting trees, and the same is allowed unless and until no nuisance emerges from it.If the trees border the boundary wall, their roots or branches may go into your property damaging the wall or obstruct sunlight or falling debris; in which case, such may constitute a nuisance under property law. You can then ask your neighbor to cut down or remove the trees.You may even draft a letter to the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation or even file a civil suit, in case they are not agreeing to your demands. First of all, I would say you must have had formal communications for settlement amicably in that matter. And in case it is still persisting, then you would require to send legal notices or further legal proceedings for protecting your rights in that property.Hope that this helps you to solve your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Salt lake sector 3 bidhannagar Kolkata boundary wall rules query",
    "answer": "In Salt Lake Sector 3, Bidhannagar, Kolkata, regulations concerning boundary walls and associated modifications are governed by theWest Bengal Municipal (Building) Rules, 2007.Barbed Wire Installation: The Rules define a \"boundary wall\" as a wall constructed along the property line, not exceeding the permissible height specified therein. However, they do not explicitly address the addition of barbed wire atop such walls. Therefore, installing barbed wire may be subject to local municipal guidelines or specific community regulations. It's advisable to consult theBidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC)to ascertain any restrictions or required permissions for such installations.Planting Trees Adjacent to Boundary Walls: Planting trees near boundary walls is generally permissible. However, the BMC emphasizes planting small to medium-sized trees to prevent accidents and ensure safety, especially considering the area's soil conditionsTimes of India. It's important to select appropriate tree species and maintain them properly to avoid potential damage to structures or encroachment on neighboring properties.Recommendations:Consult Local Authorities: Before installing barbed wire or planting trees near boundary walls, consult the BMC to understand specific regulations and obtain necessary approvals.Select Appropriate Tree Species: Choose tree species that are suitable for the local environment and are less likely to interfere with structures or neighboring properties.Regular Maintenance: Ensure regular upkeep of both boundary walls and adjacent vegetation to prevent any hazards or disputes.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.

According to Indian labor laws, her salary must meet the Minimum Wages Act, and the company cannot demand unreasonable repayment terms. She has the right to request a fair repayment plan, like paying Rs. 3,000/month. If the company refuses to negotiate or treats her unfairly, she can file a grievance with the Labor Commissioner or seek legal help from a lawyer by sending a Legal Notice to challenge the repayment terms and unfair treatment.

    "question": "Repayment of overpaid salary",
    "answer": "Dear Client,It will, therefore, be imperative that her rights are carefully guarded under the labor laws and that proper handling takes place. According to the Payment of Wages Act, 1936, any company making deductions cannot reduce a worker's wage below the prescribed minimum wages of the concerned region or area. As her wage happens to be around the minimum, a 40% deduction might go against the labor laws. Advise your sister to formally communicate her willingness to repay the excess amount but on reasonable terms, like ₹3,000 per month, so that she is able to sustain her living expenses. If the company refuses to negotiate, she may go to the Labor Commissioner or even file a complaint with the Ministry of Labour and Employment based on the unfair treatment and possible violation of the minimum wage law. Document all communications with HR for evidence and seek legal advice to be able to effectively address the issue and protect her financial stability.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Ramegowda that there can be no adverse possession among the members of one family for want of any animus among them over the land belonging to their family.Further, only by maintaining the property he doesn't become the owner and no legal right would arise.In case, the dispute arises within the family then he would try to grab the property.Therefore, detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Shri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, your brother cannot claim ownership of the house because he is living there, as the property was validly transferred to you via a registered gift deed under the Registration Act, 1908 and theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, making you the legal owner. Mere possession or use does not confer ownership. Furthermore, any money your brother spends on maintaining the property does not give him any legal rights, as voluntary maintenance expenses without an agreement are classified as gratuitous under the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and at most, he could seek reimbursement for the same. However, to prevent future disputes, you can formalize his stay through a leave and license agreement, ensuring it is clear that his occupancy is at your discretion and does not grant ownership rights. Additionally, you may also communicate this in writing that maintenance contributions are voluntary and do not affect your title.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Further, your society consists of 36 flats presently, and for the redevelopment project, you have identified a builder as well, who says that, he would build 120 flats in total, out of which, 72 flats would be that of the owner. With respect to the first model, the entire UDS would be transferred to the builder, wherein most of the flats would be transferred to the builder, and the owners would list their holding in the land, affecting their capital gains and developing the property further. Furthermore, with the first model, you may have to pay long term capital gains tax, but on the other hand, you may benefit due to higher holding of flat ownership. With respect to the second model, the UDS would be divided with 60% being in favour of owners and rest 40% being allocated to the builder. Herein, the owners may retain a significant share of land, that would ensure benefit from long term appreciation of land value.

    "answer": "In Tamil Nadu, the registration of a Joint Development Agreement (JDA) has been made mandatory by the state government. This move aims to bring clarity to landowners and developers by categorizing liabilities and setting time limits for construction projects. The state registration department has introduced laws to facilitate this process, eliminating the need for a power of attorney in such agreements.Risks of Not Registering the JDA:Legal Enforceability Issues:An unregistered JDA may face challenges in court regarding its enforceability. In the event of disputes, courts may not entertain unregistered agreements, making it difficult to enforce the terms outlined in the JDA.Admissibility Concerns:During legal proceedings, the admissibility of an unregistered JDA can be contested, potentially weakening your position in disputes.Tax Implications:Unregistered JDAs can lead to unfavorable tax consequences, as certain tax benefits and considerations are contingent upon proper registration.Regulatory Non-Compliance:Non-registration may result in non-compliance with state regulations, leading to potential legal penalties or complications in obtaining necessary approvals.Recommendation:Given the legal and practical implications, it is advisable to register the JDA to ensure its enforceability and to safeguard the interests of all parties involved. Consulting with a legal professional experienced in property law in Tamil Nadu is recommended to navigate the registration process and to address any specific concerns related to your redevelopment project.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.

    "question": "Please explain which is a better model for JDA",
    "answer": "In Tamil Nadu, the registration of Joint Development Agreements (JDAs) is mandatory. This requirement stems from the state's amendments to the Indian Stamp Act and the Registration Act, 1908, which mandate the registration of documents that create or assign rights in immovable property. Specifically, Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908, requires the registration of non-testamentary instruments that purport to create, declare, assign, limit, or extinguish any right, title, or interest in immovable property.A JDA typically assigns development rights from the landowner to the developer, thereby necessitating its registration to ensure legal enforceability. The Tamil Nadu government has emphasized this by mandating the registration of Joint Venture agreements and reducing the associated stamp duty and registration fees to encourage compliance.Failure to register a JDA can lead to significant legal complications:Legal Enforceability Issues: An unregistered JDA may not be legally enforceable, making it challenging to uphold its terms in a court of law.Admissibility Concerns: In legal disputes, an unregistered JDA may not be admissible as evidence, weakening any claims based on the agreement.Tax Implications: Unregistered agreements can result in unfavorable tax consequences, as certain tax benefits are contingent upon proper registration.Regulatory Non-Compliance: Non-registration may lead to non-compliance with state regulations, potentially resulting in legal penalties.Therefore, it is advisable to register the JDA to ensure its legal validity and enforceability.

    "question": "Is it safe to buy a flat in Hyderabad not having GHMC approval for the floor?",
    "answer": "Purchasing a flat on the 4th floor of a building that has GHMC approval only up to the 3rd floor carries significant risks. The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has the authority to take action against unauthorized constructions, which can include demolition or penalties. Relying on potential future regularization schemes, such as the Building Regularisation Scheme (BRS), is uncertain and may not materialize. Additionally, obtaining home loans for such properties can be challenging, as financial institutions typically require proper approvals. Investing in a property without the necessary approvals can lead to legal complications and financial losses. It is advisable to purchase properties that have all requisite approvals to ensure a secure investment.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.

    "answer": "You're welcome, and I'm glad to hear the information was helpful!Regarding the Occupancy Certificate (OC), it is indeed an important document. Here’s why it's crucial and what you should consider when the OC is not yet issued:Why is the Occupancy Certificate Important?Legal Compliance: The OC certifies that the building has been constructed and completed according to the approved plans and complies with all the regulations set by the local municipal authority. It ensures that the building is suitable for occupancy, which is essential for the safety and legality of living in it.Essential Services: Having an OC often ties into the provision of essential services like water, electricity, and sanitation. Local authorities may restrict the official connection of these services until the OC is issued.Loan Approval: Most banks and financial institutions require an OC for loan approval. If you plan to apply for a mortgage or sell the property in the future, having an OC can be crucial.Resale Value: Properties with an OC generally have a better resale value and are more attractive to buyers, ensuring fewer complications in the selling process.Should You Avoid Properties Without an OC?Risk Assessment: Buying a property without an OC does carry risks, primarily if the builder fails to obtain it in the future. There may be underlying issues or deviations from approved plans that could delay or prevent the issuance of the OC.Builder's Promise: If the builder promises to obtain the OC within a few months, it’s essential to assess the reliability and track record of the builder. However, promises can be delayed or unfulfilled due to various factors outside the builder's control.Protective Measures If Considering Purchase:Conditional Agreement: If you are strongly considering the property, you might negotiate a conditional agreement where the final purchase is contingent upon the issuance of the OC. This can protect your investment and ensure you don’t end up owning a property without essential legal approvals.Legal Review: Have a property lawyer review all documents and the terms of purchase. The lawyer can help ensure that your rights are protected, particularly regarding the contingency for the OC.Escrow Arrangement: Consider an escrow arrangement where your payment is held in an escrow account until the OC is delivered.In summary, while purchasing a property without an OC is generally advised against due to the associated risks, if you find a property that meets all other criteria and you have confidence in the builder’s ability to secure the OC, ensure that your investment is protected through legally binding safeguards.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.

No, since your mother has written a valid will bequeathing the property to you, upon her death, it should transfer to you as per the Indian Succession Act, 1925, provided the will is properly executed, in accordance to the Indian Legal Framework. Herein, your brother's claim of co-ownership does not have strength unless he can prove the will invalid, your mother’s lack of mental capacity when it was executed, or establish that your father has a joint interest overriding the will. However, if your father's consent is required here, for any of the legal formalities, you may defend the same by granting a medical certificate of his condition. In the event of your mother’s death, you should probate the will in court to establish its validity, and in case your brother files a suit, the case would mostly fall under theHindu Succession Act, 1956.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If such a boundary wall was erected by you on your property, then without your permission, barbed wires cannot be done. That may amount to trespass and by law you would have each right to claim removal of something like that after serving notice demanding such removal. If they refuse, you can sue them civilly to get an injunction compelling them not to do any unauthorized alteration or incursion on your property. Again, the same goes for planting trees, and the same is allowed unless and until no nuisance emerges from it.If the trees border the boundary wall, their roots or branches may go into your property damaging the wall or obstruct sunlight or falling debris; in which case, such may constitute a nuisance under property law. You can then ask your neighbor to cut down or remove the trees.You may even draft a letter to the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation or even file a civil suit, in case they are not agreeing to your demands. First of all, I would say you must have had formal communications for settlement amicably in that matter. And in case it is still persisting, then you would require to send legal notices or further legal proceedings for protecting your rights in that property.Hope that this helps you to solve your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "In Salt Lake Sector 3, Bidhannagar, Kolkata, regulations concerning boundary walls and associated modifications are governed by theWest Bengal Municipal (Building) Rules, 2007.Barbed Wire Installation: The Rules define a \"boundary wall\" as a wall constructed along the property line, not exceeding the permissible height specified therein. However, they do not explicitly address the addition of barbed wire atop such walls. Therefore, installing barbed wire may be subject to local municipal guidelines or specific community regulations. It's advisable to consult theBidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC)to ascertain any restrictions or required permissions for such installations.Planting Trees Adjacent to Boundary Walls: Planting trees near boundary walls is generally permissible. However, the BMC emphasizes planting small to medium-sized trees to prevent accidents and ensure safety, especially considering the area's soil conditionsTimes of India. It's important to select appropriate tree species and maintain them properly to avoid potential damage to structures or encroachment on neighboring properties.Recommendations:Consult Local Authorities: Before installing barbed wire or planting trees near boundary walls, consult the BMC to understand specific regulations and obtain necessary approvals.Select Appropriate Tree Species: Choose tree species that are suitable for the local environment and are less likely to interfere with structures or neighboring properties.Regular Maintenance: Ensure regular upkeep of both boundary walls and adjacent vegetation to prevent any hazards or disputes.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.

    "question": "Inquiry regarding property modifications and tax obligations",
    "answer": "Dear Client, Thank you for also contacting me with some questions about the demolition of the party wall, and tax upon property for your two flats. In most instances, partially divided walls can be demolished, provided that such works will not have the effect of impairing the structural safety of the building.But then again, it would be perfect if you are able to consult the builder or a qualified structural engineer for the confirmation that this wall is not load-bearing. Sometimes, you would even require NOC from the housing society and other concerned authorities so that your local building regulations are in good book, and you do not get into disputes.Now, property tax you have two separate agreements for two flats therefore BMC will treat these two as two units only.Since the exemption is on residential units of less than 500 square feet each you can continue getting this exemption for both flats though BMC re-designates it as a single unit and gives it a composite area of 660 square feet.So, before issues come up, right would be that BMC clarifies properly, so that any structural change gets all the necessary approvals.Hope that this helps you to solve your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Not permissible without the consent of the society if formed- Further , removing wall between the two flats may required approval from the BMC, hence you should take permission after giving an application before removing the wall.2. If you will combine the two flats into one unit then it will exceed the limit of exemption of 500 sq.feet,- Further, if you have two sale agreement for the said two flats , then even after combing into one unit , it will treated as two separate unit for the calculation of the property tax.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

By transferring authority to second builder, first builder played fraud on you and his POA became invalid. You can file criminal complaint  against first builder for criminal breach of trust. Second builder has not power to transfer the  property, he is stranger to the  transaction.

    "question": "Can someone sell property with Power of Attorney",
    "answer": "A power of attorney cannot assign their authority to another person unless the original POA document expressly grants them that power. Such a clause is uncommon because the principal has typically chosen a specific person or persons they trust to act as their agent.Because the Power of Attorney holder is also the proprietor of the property involved, he may legally sell the property to himself as well. But it cannot be transferred through PoA unless by a registered sale deed. This is per the latest Supreme Court judgement on power of attorney.PoA remains valid only till the life of the principal. Within their lifetime also, one can revoke the PoA. A SPA gets revoked on its own as soon as the specific transaction for which it was executed is completed.The Powers-of-Attorney Act, 1882 is a law in India that defines a power of attorney as an instrument that gives a person the authority to act on behalf of another person.The validity of a power of attorney deed is governed by the provisions of the Powers of Attorney Act, 1882 and the Registration Act, 1908.Section 33 of the Registration Act recognizes the following powers of attorney.Executed before and authenticated by a Registrar or Sub-Registrar .Executed before and authenticated by a Magistrate.Executed before and authenticated by a Notary Public, or any Court, Judge, Magistrate, Consul or Vice-Consul, or representative of the Central Government.The Supreme Court has ruled that a power of attorney cannot be recognized as a title document or a document that confers rights in any immovable property.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88765 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Can someone sell property with Power of Attorney",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case, the abuse of the POA and subsequent illegal transactions are clear violations of property laws. A POA holder is the agent who acts on behalf of the principal (in this case, your mother) and cannot transfer the POA to another unless so authorized in the original POA. The second developer selling to himself, and subsequent mutation, is a legally questionable transaction as it involves breach of fiduciary duty and the unauthorised sale. Publication of cancellation of POA in newspaper would add strength to your case but the fact that no stay order was passed made it possible to complete more transactions. Frame the case: Highlight illegality in the POA transfer, and hence, the fraudulent sale deed and no consent from your mother. Seek cancellation of all subsequent transactions, restoration of ownership of the land to you, and damages for financial and emotional distress. File a petition for interim stay on further alienation of the property, present all legal notices and documents in proper format, and move for expeditious disposal citing delay that has become too protracted. The case requires careful legal drafting to emphasize procedural violations and abuse of the POA.Hope you find this answer helpful in resolving the issue.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Mere possession or use does not confer ownership. Furthermore, any money your brother spends on maintaining the property does not give him any legal rights, as voluntary maintenance expenses without an agreement are classified as gratuitous under the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and at most, he could seek reimbursement for the same. However, to prevent future disputes, you can formalize his stay through a leave and license agreement, ensuring it is clear that his occupancy is at your discretion and does not grant ownership rights.

    "answer": "Model Comparison:Model 1: Overall Undivided Share Transferred:Builder receives full ownership of the undivided share of land.72 flats go to existing owners, and the remaining flats belong to the builder.Pros:Simpler agreement and fewer land ownership complexities.Builder has full flexibility for future projects.Suitable for societies not keen on land division complexities.Cons:Loss of direct control over land by the owners.Owners may face higher tax liabilities on the undivided share transfer.Model 2: Land Division (60% Owners, 40% Builder):Owners retain 60% of the undivided share, while the builder holds 40%.Ownership of flats aligns proportionally with land ownership.Pros:Owners retain partial land control.May reduce long-term capital gains tax exposure for owners.Transparent distribution of land ownership.Cons:Complex legal and registration process.Builder may demand additional considerations for reduced land share.Tax Implications:Model 1: Owners may face higher capital gains tax as the entire land is transferred to the builder.Model 2: Lower capital gains tax since owners retain a portion of the land, deferring taxation until future transactions.Recommendation:Model 2is generally better if owners want partial control of the land and lower tax liability.Opt forModel 1if the builder is offering significantly better terms or higher-quality redevelopment in return for full land control.Next Steps:Consult a property tax advisor to calculate potential tax liabilities for each model.Ensure a clear redevelopment agreement that protects owners' rights, timelines, and quality assurance.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.Hope you find the information helpful.

    "answer": "Dear ClientIn the Present Scenario, your housing association is going for redevelopment and you wish to enquire on which would be a better model for redevelopment. Further, your society consists of 36 flats presently, and for the redevelopment project, you have identified a builder as well, who says that, he would build 120 flats in total, out of which, 72 flats would be that of the owner. With respect to the first model, the entire UDS would be transferred to the builder, wherein most of the flats would be transferred to the builder, and the owners would list their holding in the land, affecting their capital gains and developing the property further. Furthermore, with the first model, you may have to pay long term capital gains tax, but on the other hand, you may benefit due to higher holding of flat ownership. With respect to the second model, the UDS would be divided with 60% being in favour of owners and rest 40% being allocated to the builder. Herein, the owners may retain a significant share of land, that would ensure benefit from long term appreciation of land value. However, looking into he details of both the models, the second model may be preferred as the same suggests long term gains, including advantage from land value appreciation, and less tax liabilities.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the disputeAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "In Tamil Nadu, the registration of a Joint Development Agreement (JDA) has been made mandatory by the state government. This move aims to bring clarity to landowners and developers by categorizing liabilities and setting time limits for construction projects. The state registration department has introduced laws to facilitate this process, eliminating the need for a power of attorney in such agreements.Risks of Not Registering the JDA:Legal Enforceability Issues:An unregistered JDA may face challenges in court regarding its enforceability. In the event of disputes, courts may not entertain unregistered agreements, making it difficult to enforce the terms outlined in the JDA.Admissibility Concerns:During legal proceedings, the admissibility of an unregistered JDA can be contested, potentially weakening your position in disputes.Tax Implications:Unregistered JDAs can lead to unfavorable tax consequences, as certain tax benefits and considerations are contingent upon proper registration.Regulatory Non-Compliance:Non-registration may result in non-compliance with state regulations, leading to potential legal penalties or complications in obtaining necessary approvals.Recommendation:Given the legal and practical implications, it is advisable to register the JDA to ensure its enforceability and to safeguard the interests of all parties involved. Consulting with a legal professional experienced in property law in Tamil Nadu is recommended to navigate the registration process and to address any specific concerns related to your redevelopment project.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.

    "question": "Please explain which is a better model for JDA",
    "answer": "In Tamil Nadu, the registration of Joint Development Agreements (JDAs) is mandatory. This requirement stems from the state's amendments to the Indian Stamp Act and the Registration Act, 1908, which mandate the registration of documents that create or assign rights in immovable property. Specifically, Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908, requires the registration of non-testamentary instruments that purport to create, declare, assign, limit, or extinguish any right, title, or interest in immovable property.A JDA typically assigns development rights from the landowner to the developer, thereby necessitating its registration to ensure legal enforceability. The Tamil Nadu government has emphasized this by mandating the registration of Joint Venture agreements and reducing the associated stamp duty and registration fees to encourage compliance.Failure to register a JDA can lead to significant legal complications:Legal Enforceability Issues: An unregistered JDA may not be legally enforceable, making it challenging to uphold its terms in a court of law.Admissibility Concerns: In legal disputes, an unregistered JDA may not be admissible as evidence, weakening any claims based on the agreement.Tax Implications: Unregistered agreements can result in unfavorable tax consequences, as certain tax benefits are contingent upon proper registration.Regulatory Non-Compliance: Non-registration may lead to non-compliance with state regulations, potentially resulting in legal penalties.Therefore, it is advisable to register the JDA to ensure its legal validity and enforceability.

The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has the authority to take action against unauthorized constructions, which can include demolition or penalties. Relying on potential future regularization schemes, such as the Building Regularisation Scheme (BRS), is uncertain and may not materialize.

    "answer": "You're welcome, and I'm glad to hear the information was helpful!Regarding the Occupancy Certificate (OC), it is indeed an important document. Here’s why it's crucial and what you should consider when the OC is not yet issued:Why is the Occupancy Certificate Important?Legal Compliance: The OC certifies that the building has been constructed and completed according to the approved plans and complies with all the regulations set by the local municipal authority. It ensures that the building is suitable for occupancy, which is essential for the safety and legality of living in it.Essential Services: Having an OC often ties into the provision of essential services like water, electricity, and sanitation. Local authorities may restrict the official connection of these services until the OC is issued.Loan Approval: Most banks and financial institutions require an OC for loan approval. If you plan to apply for a mortgage or sell the property in the future, having an OC can be crucial.Resale Value: Properties with an OC generally have a better resale value and are more attractive to buyers, ensuring fewer complications in the selling process.Should You Avoid Properties Without an OC?Risk Assessment: Buying a property without an OC does carry risks, primarily if the builder fails to obtain it in the future. There may be underlying issues or deviations from approved plans that could delay or prevent the issuance of the OC.Builder's Promise: If the builder promises to obtain the OC within a few months, it’s essential to assess the reliability and track record of the builder. However, promises can be delayed or unfulfilled due to various factors outside the builder's control.Protective Measures If Considering Purchase:Conditional Agreement: If you are strongly considering the property, you might negotiate a conditional agreement where the final purchase is contingent upon the issuance of the OC. This can protect your investment and ensure you don’t end up owning a property without essential legal approvals.Legal Review: Have a property lawyer review all documents and the terms of purchase. The lawyer can help ensure that your rights are protected, particularly regarding the contingency for the OC.Escrow Arrangement: Consider an escrow arrangement where your payment is held in an escrow account until the OC is delivered.In summary, while purchasing a property without an OC is generally advised against due to the associated risks, if you find a property that meets all other criteria and you have confidence in the builder’s ability to secure the OC, ensure that your investment is protected through legally binding safeguards.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Your facts state that title to the 1350 sqft plot appears well-established in your name, as you have been in possession for over 10 years and your family has been occupying the land for 70 years. Long-standing possession will give you more leeway under adverse possession laws. But, for the sake of prevention and for the sake of clearness of record, it would be well-advised to get the mutation of the land done in the name of your wife. The pathway of 260 sqft has been demarcated as a separate pathway in the revenue map but it has been obstructed by the boundary wall of (C). You can bring a suit for declaration and injunction to recover it. This would contain evidence of ownership, which means a sale deed and revenue map, along with further assertion of your rights over your property as pertaining to easement. You could then further propose that the settlement be made out-of-court wherein your right over the common pathway shall be traded in for an exclusive right to hold possession over the 260 sqft of land; hence, it shall satisfy the need on both sides. You would engage a local property lawyer who files all the necessary suits and pleads a hard legal case. Once filed, such actions will help to put forward your rights and gain lawful direct access to your property.Hope that this helps you to solve your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Land issue dispute",
    "answer": "Dear Client, You would be able to challenge the gift deed made between A and C; it will depend a lot upon the legal grounds for the same. For instance, one can always make the argument for fraud, undue influence, coercion, or violation of your grandfather B's rights as a legal heir. Since the deed is stamped properly, registered and witnessed, anything to the contrary makes it quite credible legally. Provided that you can prove that your grandfather had a valid interest in the property or that the deed was executed by him without free will, the Court will entertain your challenge. As a general rule, it is very hard to break a gift deed or hiba, unless there is a specific ground of revocation such as fraud or want of free consent. You may try to argue that the 2002 affidavit by A to intend to share out part of the property to the other cousin represents a repugnant intention, but it cannot be automatically said to vitiate the deed of gift. Considering that your primary interest is to get a personal pathway for privacy and access, it would be in your best interest to try to arrive at an amicable settlement with C for an easement or right of way. If the negotiations break down, you can apply for legal remedy under the provisions of easement laws to create a pathway without, necessarily, annulling the deed.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, taking into consideration the Limitation Act, the time for recovering the money under the contract, would be 3 years from the time payment of the same becomes due. Herein, the decision of the arbitrator to treat the projects as four separately as each of the projects had different purchase orders, making the limitation period being applied project-wise. Additionally, the payments for the projects have been from the same bank account, and the argument for a consolidated claim may be evidenced with continual cause of action, thus, aiding in the extension of the limitation period. With respect to the MSME Act, the same provides for dispute resolution through the methods of arbitration and conciliation. But, excluding the claims of the arbitrator, for two projects specifies the procedural limitations present and thus, the expiration of the limitation period. However, to challenge this, it is suggested that you maintain all the relevant documents, including the contract, the purchase orders, relevant receipts etc. You may also appeal the decision under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, if you are not satisfied with the arbitrator's decision.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has the authority to take action against unauthorized constructions, which can include demolition or penalties. Relying on potential future regularization schemes, such as the Building Regularisation Scheme (BRS), is uncertain and may not materialize. Additionally, obtaining home loans for such properties can be challenging, as financial institutions typically require proper approvals. Investing in a property without the necessary approvals can lead to legal complications and financial losses.

Local authorities may restrict the official connection of these services until the OC is issued.Loan Approval: Most banks and financial institutions require an OC for loan approval. If you plan to apply for a mortgage or sell the property in the future, having an OC can be crucial.Resale Value: Properties with an OC generally have a better resale value and are more attractive to buyers, ensuring fewer complications in the selling process.Should You Avoid Properties Without an OC?Risk Assessment: Buying a property without an OC does carry risks, primarily if the builder fails to obtain it in the future. There may be underlying issues or deviations from approved plans that could delay or prevent the issuance of the OC.Builder's Promise: If the builder promises to obtain the OC within a few months, it’s essential to assess the reliability and track record of the builder. However, promises can be delayed or unfulfilled due to various factors outside the builder's control.Protective Measures If Considering Purchase:Conditional Agreement: If you are strongly considering the property, you might negotiate a conditional agreement where the final purchase is contingent upon the issuance of the OC. This can protect your investment and ensure you don’t end up owning a property without essential legal approvals.Legal Review: Have a property lawyer review all documents and the terms of purchase. The lawyer can help ensure that your rights are protected, particularly regarding the contingency for the OC.Escrow Arrangement: Consider an escrow arrangement where your payment is held in an escrow account until the OC is delivered.In summary, while purchasing a property without an OC is generally advised against due to the associated risks, if you find a property that meets all other criteria and you have confidence in the builder’s ability to secure the OC, ensure that your investment is protected through legally binding safeguards.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.

The right to seek specific performance is there but the remedy is lost due to lapse of timeas the 1st suit was rejected under 7/11, that operates as a decreeso the 2nd suit by the buyer would be barred by res judicata u/s 11 of cpc [this is my prima facie view]since 17[1][A] disentitles the buyer from the benefit under 53A TOPA on account of the contract being unregistered, in my prima facie view you can file a suit/counter claim for recovering possession [for which the limitation period is 12 years and also such suit would entail payment of court fees on the market value of the property]Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "On whom to complain, Govt APP or Judge",
    "answer": "Dear Client,It is unfortunate that your case has been handled inappropriately, both by the APP and the judge, which resulted in the denial of critical witness evidence. The APP failed in her duty to ensure proper examination of the eyewitness, resulting in them being declared hostile without substantive questioning, and later compounded the issue by submitting a recall application only after delays. This is therefore procedurally flawed where the judge upholds the recall applications and then hears the statement and arguments of the accused without having all witnesses, including the IO, depose. Filing a complaint about the judge at this stage may not be effective, more so since the APP is proposing that action be taken by way of avoiding scrutiny of her lapses. I instead suggest you file a writ petition or criminal revision application before the High Court under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution . You will then have ample scope to challenge the dismissal of your recall applications, denial of opportunity to examine witnesses properly, and procedural irregularities which impair your right to a fair trial. Besides, you can apply for a stay on the trial going on so that judgment is not passed without proper consideration of all the evidence. Even if judgment is delivered against you, you can appeal to the Sessions Court or High Court on grounds of these procedural lapses. At this point, your best option is to act in haste and file a petition in the High Court to save your case.Hope you find this answer helpful in resolving the issue.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

According to Indian labor laws, her salary must meet the Minimum Wages Act, and the company cannot demand unreasonable repayment terms. She has the right to request a fair repayment plan, like paying Rs. 3,000/month. If the company refuses to negotiate or treats her unfairly, she can file a grievance with the Labor Commissioner or seek legal help from a lawyer by sending a Legal Notice to challenge the repayment terms and unfair treatment.

    "answer": "Dear Client,It will, therefore, be imperative that her rights are carefully guarded under the labor laws and that proper handling takes place. According to the Payment of Wages Act, 1936, any company making deductions cannot reduce a worker's wage below the prescribed minimum wages of the concerned region or area. As her wage happens to be around the minimum, a 40% deduction might go against the labor laws. Advise your sister to formally communicate her willingness to repay the excess amount but on reasonable terms, like ₹3,000 per month, so that she is able to sustain her living expenses. If the company refuses to negotiate, she may go to the Labor Commissioner or even file a complaint with the Ministry of Labour and Employment based on the unfair treatment and possible violation of the minimum wage law.

In this manner, explain all authorities that Mr. Iqbal has at his disposal including but not limited to the bank statements, the affidavit, and all communication with Mr. Iqbal.For one to make a case under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act of 1881, copies of all the dishonored cheques together with their bank return memos must form part of the documents presented.

Mere possession or use does not confer ownership. Furthermore, any money your brother spends on maintaining the property does not give him any legal rights, as voluntary maintenance expenses without an agreement are classified as gratuitous under the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and at most, he could seek reimbursement for the same. However, to prevent future disputes, you can formalize his stay through a leave and license agreement, ensuring it is clear that his occupancy is at your discretion and does not grant ownership rights.

    "question": "House property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, your brother cannot claim ownership of the house because he is living there, as the property was validly transferred to you via a registered gift deed under the Registration Act, 1908 and theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, making you the legal owner. Mere possession or use does not confer ownership. Furthermore, any money your brother spends on maintaining the property does not give him any legal rights, as voluntary maintenance expenses without an agreement are classified as gratuitous under the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and at most, he could seek reimbursement for the same. However, to prevent future disputes, you can formalize his stay through a leave and license agreement, ensuring it is clear that his occupancy is at your discretion and does not grant ownership rights. Additionally, you may also communicate this in writing that maintenance contributions are voluntary and do not affect your title.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client, I shall try to describe this in terms of the act of your neighbor towards the boundary wall and growth of trees. If such a boundary wall was erected by you on your property, then without your permission, barbed wires cannot be done. That may amount to trespass and by law you would have each right to claim removal of something like that after serving notice demanding such removal. If they refuse, you can sue them civilly to get an injunction compelling them not to do any unauthorized alteration or incursion on your property. Again, the same goes for planting trees, and the same is allowed unless and until no nuisance emerges from it.If the trees border the boundary wall, their roots or branches may go into your property damaging the wall or obstruct sunlight or falling debris; in which case, such may constitute a nuisance under property law. You can then ask your neighbor to cut down or remove the trees.You may even draft a letter to the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation or even file a civil suit, in case they are not agreeing to your demands. First of all, I would say you must have had formal communications for settlement amicably in that matter. And in case it is still persisting, then you would require to send legal notices or further legal proceedings for protecting your rights in that property.Hope that this helps you to solve your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Salt lake sector 3 bidhannagar Kolkata boundary wall rules query",
    "answer": "In Salt Lake Sector 3, Bidhannagar, Kolkata, regulations concerning boundary walls and associated modifications are governed by theWest Bengal Municipal (Building) Rules, 2007.Barbed Wire Installation: The Rules define a \"boundary wall\" as a wall constructed along the property line, not exceeding the permissible height specified therein. However, they do not explicitly address the addition of barbed wire atop such walls. Therefore, installing barbed wire may be subject to local municipal guidelines or specific community regulations. It's advisable to consult theBidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC)to ascertain any restrictions or required permissions for such installations.Planting Trees Adjacent to Boundary Walls: Planting trees near boundary walls is generally permissible. However, the BMC emphasizes planting small to medium-sized trees to prevent accidents and ensure safety, especially considering the area's soil conditionsTimes of India. It's important to select appropriate tree species and maintain them properly to avoid potential damage to structures or encroachment on neighboring properties.Recommendations:Consult Local Authorities: Before installing barbed wire or planting trees near boundary walls, consult the BMC to understand specific regulations and obtain necessary approvals.Select Appropriate Tree Species: Choose tree species that are suitable for the local environment and are less likely to interfere with structures or neighboring properties.Regular Maintenance: Ensure regular upkeep of both boundary walls and adjacent vegetation to prevent any hazards or disputes.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.

    "answer": "Your sister should not be forced to repay the excess salary in a way that harms her livelihood. According to Indian labor laws, her salary must meet the Minimum Wages Act, and the company cannot demand unreasonable repayment terms. She has the right to request a fair repayment plan, like paying Rs. 3,000/month. If the company refuses to negotiate or treats her unfairly, she can file a grievance with the Labor Commissioner or seek legal help from a lawyer by sending a Legal Notice to challenge the repayment terms and unfair treatment.

    "question": "Repayment of overpaid salary",
    "answer": "Dear Client,It will, therefore, be imperative that her rights are carefully guarded under the labor laws and that proper handling takes place. According to the Payment of Wages Act, 1936, any company making deductions cannot reduce a worker's wage below the prescribed minimum wages of the concerned region or area. As her wage happens to be around the minimum, a 40% deduction might go against the labor laws. Advise your sister to formally communicate her willingness to repay the excess amount but on reasonable terms, like ₹3,000 per month, so that she is able to sustain her living expenses. If the company refuses to negotiate, she may go to the Labor Commissioner or even file a complaint with the Ministry of Labour and Employment based on the unfair treatment and possible violation of the minimum wage law. Document all communications with HR for evidence and seek legal advice to be able to effectively address the issue and protect her financial stability.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Mere possession or use does not confer ownership. Furthermore, any money your brother spends on maintaining the property does not give him any legal rights, as voluntary maintenance expenses without an agreement are classified as gratuitous under the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and at most, he could seek reimbursement for the same. However, to prevent future disputes, you can formalize his stay through a leave and license agreement, ensuring it is clear that his occupancy is at your discretion and does not grant ownership rights.

    "question": "On whom to complain, Govt APP or Judge",
    "answer": "Dear Client,It is unfortunate that your case has been handled inappropriately, both by the APP and the judge, which resulted in the denial of critical witness evidence. The APP failed in her duty to ensure proper examination of the eyewitness, resulting in them being declared hostile without substantive questioning, and later compounded the issue by submitting a recall application only after delays. This is therefore procedurally flawed where the judge upholds the recall applications and then hears the statement and arguments of the accused without having all witnesses, including the IO, depose. Filing a complaint about the judge at this stage may not be effective, more so since the APP is proposing that action be taken by way of avoiding scrutiny of her lapses. I instead suggest you file a writ petition or criminal revision application before the High Court under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution . You will then have ample scope to challenge the dismissal of your recall applications, denial of opportunity to examine witnesses properly, and procedural irregularities which impair your right to a fair trial. Besides, you can apply for a stay on the trial going on so that judgment is not passed without proper consideration of all the evidence. Even if judgment is delivered against you, you can appeal to the Sessions Court or High Court on grounds of these procedural lapses. At this point, your best option is to act in haste and file a petition in the High Court to save your case.Hope you find this answer helpful in resolving the issue.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the first instance, it must be proved that there is a chain of events that warrants the conclusion that Mr. Iqbal was issued a loan. Stress the fact that the amount of ₹ 4, 95, 500 was transferred to the account of Abdul Mohsin’s on the specific instructions of Mr. Iqbal and Abdul Mohsin handed over the said amount to Mr. Iqbal After Abdul Mohsin had executed the said instructions. This can be substantiated by the affidavit of Abdul Mohsin and by the statements of the relevant accounts. Parallely, he was given a cash payment of 1,49,500 on that same day. In this manner, explain all authorities that Mr. Iqbal has at his disposal including but not limited to the bank statements, the affidavit, and all communication with Mr. Iqbal.For one to make a case under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act of 1881, copies of all the dishonored cheques together with their bank return memos must form part of the documents presented. A notice of intention to sue be served to Mr. Iqbal within thirty days from the date of receiving a return cheque memo and the notice should require Mr. Iqbal to make payment within fifteen days of the notice. Such notice being received by the addressee will be evidenced by documentation. Such enablement may also be undertaken if clarification Ans. 3 is not responded to in pretty much the same manner as explained in clause note 5.Retrieve all the WhatsApp chats, audio recordings and the bank statements regarding the exchanges where Mr Iqbal admits that he owes accumulation and guarantees to remit deposition.As for the lack of punishment in regards to the violation of section 138, it is not the case that it bears severe consequences.Hope you find this answer helpful in resolving the issue.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

According to Indian labor laws, her salary must meet the Minimum Wages Act, and the company cannot demand unreasonable repayment terms. She has the right to request a fair repayment plan, like paying Rs. 3,000/month.

    "answer": "Dear Client,It will, therefore, be imperative that her rights are carefully guarded under the labor laws and that proper handling takes place. According to the Payment of Wages Act, 1936, any company making deductions cannot reduce a worker's wage below the prescribed minimum wages of the concerned region or area. As her wage happens to be around the minimum, a 40% deduction might go against the labor laws. Advise your sister to formally communicate her willingness to repay the excess amount but on reasonable terms, like ₹3,000 per month, so that she is able to sustain her living expenses. If the company refuses to negotiate, she may go to the Labor Commissioner or even file a complaint with the Ministry of Labour and Employment based on the unfair treatment and possible violation of the minimum wage law.

    "answer": "Your sister should not be forced to repay the excess salary in a way that harms her livelihood. According to Indian labor laws, her salary must meet the Minimum Wages Act, and the company cannot demand unreasonable repayment terms. She has the right to request a fair repayment plan, like paying Rs. 3,000/month. If the company refuses to negotiate or treats her unfairly, she can file a grievance with the Labor Commissioner or seek legal help from a lawyer by sending a Legal Notice to challenge the repayment terms and unfair treatment.

    "question": "Repayment of overpaid salary",
    "answer": "Dear Client,It will, therefore, be imperative that her rights are carefully guarded under the labor laws and that proper handling takes place. According to the Payment of Wages Act, 1936, any company making deductions cannot reduce a worker's wage below the prescribed minimum wages of the concerned region or area. As her wage happens to be around the minimum, a 40% deduction might go against the labor laws. Advise your sister to formally communicate her willingness to repay the excess amount but on reasonable terms, like ₹3,000 per month, so that she is able to sustain her living expenses. If the company refuses to negotiate, she may go to the Labor Commissioner or even file a complaint with the Ministry of Labour and Employment based on the unfair treatment and possible violation of the minimum wage law. Document all communications with HR for evidence and seek legal advice to be able to effectively address the issue and protect her financial stability.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Land issue dispute",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Your facts state that title to the 1350 sqft plot appears well-established in your name, as you have been in possession for over 10 years and your family has been occupying the land for 70 years. Long-standing possession will give you more leeway under adverse possession laws. But, for the sake of prevention and for the sake of clearness of record, it would be well-advised to get the mutation of the land done in the name of your wife. The pathway of 260 sqft has been demarcated as a separate pathway in the revenue map but it has been obstructed by the boundary wall of (C). You can bring a suit for declaration and injunction to recover it. This would contain evidence of ownership, which means a sale deed and revenue map, along with further assertion of your rights over your property as pertaining to easement. You could then further propose that the settlement be made out-of-court wherein your right over the common pathway shall be traded in for an exclusive right to hold possession over the 260 sqft of land; hence, it shall satisfy the need on both sides. You would engage a local property lawyer who files all the necessary suits and pleads a hard legal case. Once filed, such actions will help to put forward your rights and gain lawful direct access to your property.Hope that this helps you to solve your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Land issue dispute",
    "answer": "Dear Client, You would be able to challenge the gift deed made between A and C; it will depend a lot upon the legal grounds for the same. For instance, one can always make the argument for fraud, undue influence, coercion, or violation of your grandfather B's rights as a legal heir. Since the deed is stamped properly, registered and witnessed, anything to the contrary makes it quite credible legally. Provided that you can prove that your grandfather had a valid interest in the property or that the deed was executed by him without free will, the Court will entertain your challenge. As a general rule, it is very hard to break a gift deed or hiba, unless there is a specific ground of revocation such as fraud or want of free consent. You may try to argue that the 2002 affidavit by A to intend to share out part of the property to the other cousin represents a repugnant intention, but it cannot be automatically said to vitiate the deed of gift. Considering that your primary interest is to get a personal pathway for privacy and access, it would be in your best interest to try to arrive at an amicable settlement with C for an easement or right of way. If the negotiations break down, you can apply for legal remedy under the provisions of easement laws to create a pathway without, necessarily, annulling the deed.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Wife files a false 498a case as FIR, false DVC, MC for sake of maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case it is possible that you may have to pay maintenance during theDomestic Violence(DV) proceedings though your wife may be levelling baseless allegations. Your wife will be able to claim from your income of ₹ 90,000 or any reasonable amount minus the medical bills. While the DV case might be false, and may change maintenance obligations if proven so, it does not necessarily remove you from paying unless a court allows it to do so. As for making home dues, since your wife is capable of earning but decide not to work then this too can be taken to court to try and reduce her maintenance claim. Furthermore, an act can be an act of cruelty in terms of Section 13(1)(ia) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 where false allegations have been made. Once you prove that the allegations made by her are false you can file a defamation case undersection 354of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (previously, Section 499 IPC) or can lodge a complaint under section 246 of BNS (Previously, Section 211 of IPC) for filing a false case. For these legal issues, you should consult a family law attorney to assist you on the matter to avoid further complications.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Wife files a false 498a case as FIR, false DVC, MC for sake of maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queries1. In the case ofDomestic Violence, if your wife produces before the court photographs of bruises, then that may be taken into consideration, but she has to prove that such injuries have been given to her by you. Mere photographs cannot prove anything against a person, therefore, there is scope for argument against such evidence.2. In cases of maintenance, prima facie evidence may be permitted by the court even without any proper investigation, and an order for interim maintenance can be passed by the judge. You will have to pay maintenance even if you prove her allegations of default to be false, but the amount may be reduced or even disallowed by the court as per its estimation of her needs and your ability to pay.3. If you can show your wife is capable of earning -- by showing past work as a beautician or education -- the court may remit or refuse to award maintenance. The courts, in general, are reluctant to award maintenance if wife has deliberately avoided employment with the sole intention of claiming maintenance.4. Maintenance amount is usually computed on your income and not your parent's. If your monthly salary is ₹90,000 and you have heavy financial commitments like loan repayments or medical and legal charges, the court is likely to consider all these points while deciding an amount for you. The figure can range between 20-30% of your net income with deductions.5. If allegations prove untrue, one could prohibit future maintenance but could not recover past payments.6.a) A police can even file an FIR without investigation in false cases. b) Maintenance can also be granted in false cases. c) Husband protection laws are lesser but exist.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Without a medical report from government hospital ,simply the bruises will not prove violence's upon her.2.  You will be given opportunity to file reply of her complaint and to produce her financial status & education before deciding the interim maintenance.3. As per law, awell qualified wife, who is having the earning capability & capacity, but desirous of remaining idle, is not entitled to claim any maintenance from her husband.- You can produce her educational details before the Court.4. She is not entitled to get any benefits or advantage from her in-law , and she can only claim maintenance from you as per your net income after deducting all the expenditures.5. No.6.

    "question": "Wife files a false 498a case as FIR, false DVC, MC for sake of maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queries,1. Your child and second wife's case: Visiting your child will not add to complication in the 498A case filed against you by your second wife. This is because child visitation rights are separate, cannot be tagged with that kind of case.2. Right to visit your child: You have the right to visit your child at home or at school, other than that allowed by the conditions of a court order. Hostile behavior by the family of your first wife can be legally controlled through the enforcement of your visitation rights.3. Rights to visit your child: Regardless of whether you ever remarry, nothing impacts on the rights to visit your child from the previous marriage.4. False enrollment in land registration: In case there have been forged engravings in your wife's and father-in-law's land registration you may file a complaint against them. However, the legal significance to your case depends on how you word it legally.5. Income proof: Gather evidence that she earns her money by sending business advertisements and photographs or even client feedback. You can present these in court to prove that she is indeed capable of earning.6. Effect of acting in court: lllCourts do not rely on acting. If your wife cannot properly present her evidence, her exaggerated claims are likely to fall. Make sure you have good, factual evidence to defend yourself with.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Since the accused is required to appear in court although the FIR and charge sheet have been filed, you have some legal measures under the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) {previously,Code of Criminal Procedure(CrPC)}. According to section 227 of BNSS (previously, Section 204 of theCriminal Procedure Code), the magistrate may issue summons to the accused person. In the event that they do not show up after being called by the magistrate, you can ask the magistrate of get a warrant of arrest under Section 72 of BNSS (previously, Section 70 of CrPC). If an accused refuses to respond to or ignore the summons issued to them, you can apply for a bailable warrant under Section 90 of BNSS (previously, Section 87 of CrPC). If the accused fails to follow the direction of the court, the court may order for the arrest of the accused under Section 91 of BNSS (previously, Section 88 of theCriminal Procedure Code) or it may order for a non-bailable warrant. In case the magistrate fails to take proper action you can go to sessions court under Section 438 of BNSS (previously, Section 397 of CrPC) and ask for revision so as to ensure that the summons are enforced to compel the accused to appear. It is necessary to take records of all the hearings and stay in touch with your attorney to manage this process and achieve the goal of punishment for the accused.Hope this advice helps in solving your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Land issue dispute",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Your facts state that title to the 1350 sqft plot appears well-established in your name, as you have been in possession for over 10 years and your family has been occupying the land for 70 years. Long-standing possession will give you more leeway under adverse possession laws. But, for the sake of prevention and for the sake of clearness of record, it would be well-advised to get the mutation of the land done in the name of your wife. The pathway of 260 sqft has been demarcated as a separate pathway in the revenue map but it has been obstructed by the boundary wall of (C). You can bring a suit for declaration and injunction to recover it. This would contain evidence of ownership, which means a sale deed and revenue map, along with further assertion of your rights over your property as pertaining to easement. You could then further propose that the settlement be made out-of-court wherein your right over the common pathway shall be traded in for an exclusive right to hold possession over the 260 sqft of land; hence, it shall satisfy the need on both sides. You would engage a local property lawyer who files all the necessary suits and pleads a hard legal case. Once filed, such actions will help to put forward your rights and gain lawful direct access to your property.Hope that this helps you to solve your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Land issue dispute",
    "answer": "Dear Client, You would be able to challenge the gift deed made between A and C; it will depend a lot upon the legal grounds for the same. For instance, one can always make the argument for fraud, undue influence, coercion, or violation of your grandfather B's rights as a legal heir. Since the deed is stamped properly, registered and witnessed, anything to the contrary makes it quite credible legally. Provided that you can prove that your grandfather had a valid interest in the property or that the deed was executed by him without free will, the Court will entertain your challenge. As a general rule, it is very hard to break a gift deed or hiba, unless there is a specific ground of revocation such as fraud or want of free consent. You may try to argue that the 2002 affidavit by A to intend to share out part of the property to the other cousin represents a repugnant intention, but it cannot be automatically said to vitiate the deed of gift. Considering that your primary interest is to get a personal pathway for privacy and access, it would be in your best interest to try to arrive at an amicable settlement with C for an easement or right of way. If the negotiations break down, you can apply for legal remedy under the provisions of easement laws to create a pathway without, necessarily, annulling the deed.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Herein, the tenant continued paying rent during the agreement period, but an eviction notice was served in 2012, which the tenant acknowledged. The original tenant passed away in March 2019, and presently, in 2024, the tenant’s grandson occupied the property with force, and without any legal authority. Under the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1997 (WBPTA), tenancy rights can only be inherited by specific heirs who reside with the tenant at the time of their death, and here, the grandchildren are excluded unless proven to be dependent at the time of death. Here, since the tenancy agreement expired in 2002, and the grand child does not qualify as a tenant under WBPTA, his continued occupation is unauthorised. For the same, legal action may be taken by filing a complaint/eviction suit, and theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, citing the expiration of the tenancy and lack of legal authority.

    "answer": "Dear Client,According to the facts you have presented, it is prudent to file an action for eviction against all five members of the family of the deceased tenant because that way nobody will be left unheard. Because the tenancy agreement expired in 2002 and none of the present occupants is covered by the definition of a tenant as defined in the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1997 (WBPTA), their occupation is illegal. The eviction notice of 2012 and accepted by the first tenant would strengthen your case. The latest judgments of the Supreme Court relating to Section 2(g) of WBPTA, 1997 would override the Act but that would not be adverse to your case since the tenancy rights of the current occupant are illegal. You may even seek mesne profits for the period for which the property was illegally occupied during this period. Engage a lawyer that will file a case for eviction where all the legal grounds will be properly covered.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Wife files a false 498a case as FIR, false DVC, MC for sake of maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case it is possible that you may have to pay maintenance during theDomestic Violence(DV) proceedings though your wife may be levelling baseless allegations. Your wife will be able to claim from your income of ₹ 90,000 or any reasonable amount minus the medical bills. While the DV case might be false, and may change maintenance obligations if proven so, it does not necessarily remove you from paying unless a court allows it to do so. As for making home dues, since your wife is capable of earning but decide not to work then this too can be taken to court to try and reduce her maintenance claim. Furthermore, an act can be an act of cruelty in terms of Section 13(1)(ia) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 where false allegations have been made. Once you prove that the allegations made by her are false you can file a defamation case undersection 354of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (previously, Section 499 IPC) or can lodge a complaint under section 246 of BNS (Previously, Section 211 of IPC) for filing a false case. For these legal issues, you should consult a family law attorney to assist you on the matter to avoid further complications.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Wife files a false 498a case as FIR, false DVC, MC for sake of maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queries1. In the case ofDomestic Violence, if your wife produces before the court photographs of bruises, then that may be taken into consideration, but she has to prove that such injuries have been given to her by you. Mere photographs cannot prove anything against a person, therefore, there is scope for argument against such evidence.2. In cases of maintenance, prima facie evidence may be permitted by the court even without any proper investigation, and an order for interim maintenance can be passed by the judge. You will have to pay maintenance even if you prove her allegations of default to be false, but the amount may be reduced or even disallowed by the court as per its estimation of her needs and your ability to pay.3. If you can show your wife is capable of earning -- by showing past work as a beautician or education -- the court may remit or refuse to award maintenance. The courts, in general, are reluctant to award maintenance if wife has deliberately avoided employment with the sole intention of claiming maintenance.4. Maintenance amount is usually computed on your income and not your parent's. If your monthly salary is ₹90,000 and you have heavy financial commitments like loan repayments or medical and legal charges, the court is likely to consider all these points while deciding an amount for you. The figure can range between 20-30% of your net income with deductions.5. If allegations prove untrue, one could prohibit future maintenance but could not recover past payments.6.a) A police can even file an FIR without investigation in false cases. b) Maintenance can also be granted in false cases. c) Husband protection laws are lesser but exist.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Wife files a false 498a case as FIR, false DVC, MC for sake of maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queries,1. Your child and second wife's case: Visiting your child will not add to complication in the 498A case filed against you by your second wife. This is because child visitation rights are separate, cannot be tagged with that kind of case.2. Right to visit your child: You have the right to visit your child at home or at school, other than that allowed by the conditions of a court order. Hostile behavior by the family of your first wife can be legally controlled through the enforcement of your visitation rights.3. Rights to visit your child: Regardless of whether you ever remarry, nothing impacts on the rights to visit your child from the previous marriage.4. False enrollment in land registration: In case there have been forged engravings in your wife's and father-in-law's land registration you may file a complaint against them. However, the legal significance to your case depends on how you word it legally.5. Income proof: Gather evidence that she earns her money by sending business advertisements and photographs or even client feedback.

    "answer": "Dear ClientIn the Present Scenario, your housing association is going for redevelopment and you wish to enquire on which would be a better model for redevelopment. Further, your society consists of 36 flats presently, and for the redevelopment project, you have identified a builder as well, who says that, he would build 120 flats in total, out of which, 72 flats would be that of the owner. With respect to the first model, the entire UDS would be transferred to the builder, wherein most of the flats would be transferred to the builder, and the owners would list their holding in the land, affecting their capital gains and developing the property further. Furthermore, with the first model, you may have to pay long term capital gains tax, but on the other hand, you may benefit due to higher holding of flat ownership. With respect to the second model, the UDS would be divided with 60% being in favour of owners and rest 40% being allocated to the builder. Herein, the owners may retain a significant share of land, that would ensure benefit from long term appreciation of land value. However, looking into he details of both the models, the second model may be preferred as the same suggests long term gains, including advantage from land value appreciation, and less tax liabilities.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the disputeAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Please explain which is a better model for JDA",
    "answer": "In Tamil Nadu, the registration of a Joint Development Agreement (JDA) has been made mandatory by the state government. This move aims to bring clarity to landowners and developers by categorizing liabilities and setting time limits for construction projects. The state registration department has introduced laws to facilitate this process, eliminating the need for a power of attorney in such agreements.Risks of Not Registering the JDA:Legal Enforceability Issues:An unregistered JDA may face challenges in court regarding its enforceability. In the event of disputes, courts may not entertain unregistered agreements, making it difficult to enforce the terms outlined in the JDA.Admissibility Concerns:During legal proceedings, the admissibility of an unregistered JDA can be contested, potentially weakening your position in disputes.Tax Implications:Unregistered JDAs can lead to unfavorable tax consequences, as certain tax benefits and considerations are contingent upon proper registration.Regulatory Non-Compliance:Non-registration may result in non-compliance with state regulations, leading to potential legal penalties or complications in obtaining necessary approvals.Recommendation:Given the legal and practical implications, it is advisable to register the JDA to ensure its enforceability and to safeguard the interests of all parties involved. Consulting with a legal professional experienced in property law in Tamil Nadu is recommended to navigate the registration process and to address any specific concerns related to your redevelopment project.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.

    "question": "Please explain which is a better model for JDA",
    "answer": "In Tamil Nadu, the registration of Joint Development Agreements (JDAs) is mandatory. This requirement stems from the state's amendments to the Indian Stamp Act and the Registration Act, 1908, which mandate the registration of documents that create or assign rights in immovable property. Specifically, Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908, requires the registration of non-testamentary instruments that purport to create, declare, assign, limit, or extinguish any right, title, or interest in immovable property.A JDA typically assigns development rights from the landowner to the developer, thereby necessitating its registration to ensure legal enforceability. The Tamil Nadu government has emphasized this by mandating the registration of Joint Venture agreements and reducing the associated stamp duty and registration fees to encourage compliance.Failure to register a JDA can lead to significant legal complications:Legal Enforceability Issues: An unregistered JDA may not be legally enforceable, making it challenging to uphold its terms in a court of law.Admissibility Concerns: In legal disputes, an unregistered JDA may not be admissible as evidence, weakening any claims based on the agreement.Tax Implications: Unregistered agreements can result in unfavorable tax consequences, as certain tax benefits are contingent upon proper registration.Regulatory Non-Compliance: Non-registration may lead to non-compliance with state regulations, potentially resulting in legal penalties.Therefore, it is advisable to register the JDA to ensure its legal validity and enforceability.

Buchi Reddy , A simple suit for bare injunction is not maintainable.- Further, if he is in possession of the property then he cannot be declared as owner in the absence of a registered agreement , and his status is like a trespasser.- You can file a complaint against him for the offence of trespassing .Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, taking into consideration the Limitation Act, the time for recovering the money under the contract, would be 3 years from the time payment of the same becomes due. Herein, the decision of the arbitrator to treat the projects as four separately as each of the projects had different purchase orders, making the limitation period being applied project-wise. Additionally, the payments for the projects have been from the same bank account, and the argument for a consolidated claim may be evidenced with continual cause of action, thus, aiding in the extension of the limitation period. With respect to the MSME Act, the same provides for dispute resolution through the methods of arbitration and conciliation. But, excluding the claims of the arbitrator, for two projects specifies the procedural limitations present and thus, the expiration of the limitation period. However, to challenge this, it is suggested that you maintain all the relevant documents, including the contract, the purchase orders, relevant receipts etc. You may also appeal the decision under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, if you are not satisfied with the arbitrator's decision.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, taking into consideration the Limitation Act, the time for recovering the money under the contract, would be 3 years from the time payment of the same becomes due. Herein, the decision of the arbitrator to treat the projects as four separately as each of the projects had different purchase orders, making the limitation period being applied project-wise. Additionally, the payments for the projects have been from the same bank account, and the argument for a consolidated claim may be evidenced with continual cause of action, thus, aiding in the extension of the limitation period. With respect to the MSME Act, the same provides for dispute resolution through the methods of arbitration and conciliation. But, excluding the claims of the arbitrator, for two projects specifies the procedural limitations present and thus, the expiration of the limitation period. However, to challenge this, it is suggested that you maintain all the relevant documents, including the contract, the purchase orders, relevant receipts etc. You may also appeal the decision under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, if you are not satisfied with the arbitrator's decision.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This can be substantiated by the affidavit of Abdul Mohsin and by the statements of the relevant accounts. Parallely, he was given a cash payment of 1,49,500 on that same day. In this manner, explain all authorities that Mr. Iqbal has at his disposal including but not limited to the bank statements, the affidavit, and all communication with Mr. Iqbal.For one to make a case under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act of 1881, copies of all the dishonored cheques together with their bank return memos must form part of the documents presented. A notice of intention to sue be served to Mr. Iqbal within thirty days from the date of receiving a return cheque memo and the notice should require Mr. Iqbal to make payment within fifteen days of the notice.

    "question": "On whom to complain, Govt APP or Judge",
    "answer": "Dear Client,It is unfortunate that your case has been handled inappropriately, both by the APP and the judge, which resulted in the denial of critical witness evidence. The APP failed in her duty to ensure proper examination of the eyewitness, resulting in them being declared hostile without substantive questioning, and later compounded the issue by submitting a recall application only after delays. This is therefore procedurally flawed where the judge upholds the recall applications and then hears the statement and arguments of the accused without having all witnesses, including the IO, depose. Filing a complaint about the judge at this stage may not be effective, more so since the APP is proposing that action be taken by way of avoiding scrutiny of her lapses. I instead suggest you file a writ petition or criminal revision application before the High Court under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution . You will then have ample scope to challenge the dismissal of your recall applications, denial of opportunity to examine witnesses properly, and procedural irregularities which impair your right to a fair trial. Besides, you can apply for a stay on the trial going on so that judgment is not passed without proper consideration of all the evidence. Even if judgment is delivered against you, you can appeal to the Sessions Court or High Court on grounds of these procedural lapses. At this point, your best option is to act in haste and file a petition in the High Court to save your case.Hope you find this answer helpful in resolving the issue.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The right to seek specific performance is there but the remedy is lost due to lapse of timeas the 1st suit was rejected under 7/11, that operates as a decreeso the 2nd suit by the buyer would be barred by res judicata u/s 11 of cpc [this is my prima facie view]since 17[1][A] disentitles the buyer from the benefit under 53A TOPA on account of the contract being unregistered, in my prima facie view you can file a suit/counter claim for recovering possession [for which the limitation period is 12 years and also such suit would entail payment of court fees on the market value of the property]Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

You will then have ample scope to challenge the dismissal of your recall applications, denial of opportunity to examine witnesses properly, and procedural irregularities which impair your right to a fair trial. Besides, you can apply for a stay on the trial going on so that judgment is not passed without proper consideration of all the evidence. Even if judgment is delivered against you, you can appeal to the Sessions Court or High Court on grounds of these procedural lapses. At this point, your best option is to act in haste and file a petition in the High Court to save your case.Hope you find this answer helpful in resolving the issue.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Land issue dispute",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Your facts state that title to the 1350 sqft plot appears well-established in your name, as you have been in possession for over 10 years and your family has been occupying the land for 70 years. Long-standing possession will give you more leeway under adverse possession laws. But, for the sake of prevention and for the sake of clearness of record, it would be well-advised to get the mutation of the land done in the name of your wife. The pathway of 260 sqft has been demarcated as a separate pathway in the revenue map but it has been obstructed by the boundary wall of (C). You can bring a suit for declaration and injunction to recover it. This would contain evidence of ownership, which means a sale deed and revenue map, along with further assertion of your rights over your property as pertaining to easement. You could then further propose that the settlement be made out-of-court wherein your right over the common pathway shall be traded in for an exclusive right to hold possession over the 260 sqft of land; hence, it shall satisfy the need on both sides. You would engage a local property lawyer who files all the necessary suits and pleads a hard legal case. Once filed, such actions will help to put forward your rights and gain lawful direct access to your property.Hope that this helps you to solve your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Land issue dispute",
    "answer": "Dear Client, You would be able to challenge the gift deed made between A and C; it will depend a lot upon the legal grounds for the same. For instance, one can always make the argument for fraud, undue influence, coercion, or violation of your grandfather B's rights as a legal heir. Since the deed is stamped properly, registered and witnessed, anything to the contrary makes it quite credible legally. Provided that you can prove that your grandfather had a valid interest in the property or that the deed was executed by him without free will, the Court will entertain your challenge. As a general rule, it is very hard to break a gift deed or hiba, unless there is a specific ground of revocation such as fraud or want of free consent. You may try to argue that the 2002 affidavit by A to intend to share out part of the property to the other cousin represents a repugnant intention, but it cannot be automatically said to vitiate the deed of gift. Considering that your primary interest is to get a personal pathway for privacy and access, it would be in your best interest to try to arrive at an amicable settlement with C for an easement or right of way. If the negotiations break down, you can apply for legal remedy under the provisions of easement laws to create a pathway without, necessarily, annulling the deed.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Agreement and power attorney",
    "answer": "Dear Client, There are a few things that a person needs to be careful about at the time of signing the deed and handing over the power of attorney to the builder for ensuring his interest. It will demand that the contract which is entered between the builder reflects a timeline when such a project is expected to be completed. Include also a penalty clause specifying an amount of compensation if such commitment beyond two years is delayed.The contract should also carry construction milestones. The disputes can be amicably settled through arbitration. Get it registered with the local sub-registrar to give the strength of enforceability. To make the transfer of three flats available to your wife and children at your death due to some cause during the period of construction, get a provision in the agreement for this transfer or execute a separate will or declaration of intent for this purpose.Alternately, a trust deed or an agreement of joint ownership could also be drafted to protect their interests.Draft a special power of attorney limiting the powers of the builder strictly to the things necessary for the project such as getting permits and representing you in the construction, excluding from it sale, transfer, or mortgage of the property without your written consent. If you would like your wife to be a joint owner of the plot, you can have a gift deed or a sale deed prepared in her name. This will incur stamp duty, approx. 2-3%-and registration fees. This should all be done at the sub-registrar's office in Bhubaneswar and shall take approximately about a week in total. You should hire a property lawyer to draft and review all agreements and legal documents that would ensure your interests are very well protected during the process.Hope that this helps you to solve your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, they do not explicitly address the addition of barbed wire atop such walls. Therefore, installing barbed wire may be subject to local municipal guidelines or specific community regulations. It's advisable to consult theBidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC)to ascertain any restrictions or required permissions for such installations.Planting Trees Adjacent to Boundary Walls: Planting trees near boundary walls is generally permissible. However, the BMC emphasizes planting small to medium-sized trees to prevent accidents and ensure safety, especially considering the area's soil conditionsTimes of India. It's important to select appropriate tree species and maintain them properly to avoid potential damage to structures or encroachment on neighboring properties.Recommendations:Consult Local Authorities: Before installing barbed wire or planting trees near boundary walls, consult the BMC to understand specific regulations and obtain necessary approvals.Select Appropriate Tree Species: Choose tree species that are suitable for the local environment and are less likely to interfere with structures or neighboring properties.Regular Maintenance: Ensure regular upkeep of both boundary walls and adjacent vegetation to prevent any hazards or disputes.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.

    "question": "Inquiry regarding property modifications and tax obligations",
    "answer": "Dear Client, Thank you for also contacting me with some questions about the demolition of the party wall, and tax upon property for your two flats. In most instances, partially divided walls can be demolished, provided that such works will not have the effect of impairing the structural safety of the building.But then again, it would be perfect if you are able to consult the builder or a qualified structural engineer for the confirmation that this wall is not load-bearing. Sometimes, you would even require NOC from the housing society and other concerned authorities so that your local building regulations are in good book, and you do not get into disputes.Now, property tax you have two separate agreements for two flats therefore BMC will treat these two as two units only.Since the exemption is on residential units of less than 500 square feet each you can continue getting this exemption for both flats though BMC re-designates it as a single unit and gives it a composite area of 660 square feet.So, before issues come up, right would be that BMC clarifies properly, so that any structural change gets all the necessary approvals.Hope that this helps you to solve your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "i would like to revise my reply to your querythe 2nd suit would not be hit by res judicata since the cause of action in that suit is materially different from the cause of action in the 1st suitthe relief claimed in the 1st suit was for specific performance of contract by registering a conveyance in favour of the buyer whereas the relief claimed in 2nd suit is for protection of possession. So the causes of action in both the suits are different and res judicata will not applythe 2nd suit would also not be barred by limitation since the alleged interference in possession of the buyer would be within the limitation periodthe owner or his heir cannot maintain a suit to seek recovery of possession from the buyer who was put in possession under an unregistered agreement for saleYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "On whom to complain, Govt APP or Judge",
    "answer": "Dear Client,It is unfortunate that your case has been handled inappropriately, both by the APP and the judge, which resulted in the denial of critical witness evidence. The APP failed in her duty to ensure proper examination of the eyewitness, resulting in them being declared hostile without substantive questioning, and later compounded the issue by submitting a recall application only after delays. This is therefore procedurally flawed where the judge upholds the recall applications and then hears the statement and arguments of the accused without having all witnesses, including the IO, depose. Filing a complaint about the judge at this stage may not be effective, more so since the APP is proposing that action be taken by way of avoiding scrutiny of her lapses. I instead suggest you file a writ petition or criminal revision application before the High Court under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution . You will then have ample scope to challenge the dismissal of your recall applications, denial of opportunity to examine witnesses properly, and procedural irregularities which impair your right to a fair trial. Besides, you can apply for a stay on the trial going on so that judgment is not passed without proper consideration of all the evidence. Even if judgment is delivered against you, you can appeal to the Sessions Court or High Court on grounds of these procedural lapses. At this point, your best option is to act in haste and file a petition in the High Court to save your case.Hope you find this answer helpful in resolving the issue.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Inquiry regarding property modifications and tax obligations",
    "answer": "Dear Client, Thank you for also contacting me with some questions about the demolition of the party wall, and tax upon property for your two flats. In most instances, partially divided walls can be demolished, provided that such works will not have the effect of impairing the structural safety of the building.But then again, it would be perfect if you are able to consult the builder or a qualified structural engineer for the confirmation that this wall is not load-bearing. Sometimes, you would even require NOC from the housing society and other concerned authorities so that your local building regulations are in good book, and you do not get into disputes.Now, property tax you have two separate agreements for two flats therefore BMC will treat these two as two units only.Since the exemption is on residential units of less than 500 square feet each you can continue getting this exemption for both flats though BMC re-designates it as a single unit and gives it a composite area of 660 square feet.So, before issues come up, right would be that BMC clarifies properly, so that any structural change gets all the necessary approvals.Hope that this helps you to solve your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Your facts state that title to the 1350 sqft plot appears well-established in your name, as you have been in possession for over 10 years and your family has been occupying the land for 70 years. Long-standing possession will give you more leeway under adverse possession laws. But, for the sake of prevention and for the sake of clearness of record, it would be well-advised to get the mutation of the land done in the name of your wife. The pathway of 260 sqft has been demarcated as a separate pathway in the revenue map but it has been obstructed by the boundary wall of (C). You can bring a suit for declaration and injunction to recover it. This would contain evidence of ownership, which means a sale deed and revenue map, along with further assertion of your rights over your property as pertaining to easement. You could then further propose that the settlement be made out-of-court wherein your right over the common pathway shall be traded in for an exclusive right to hold possession over the 260 sqft of land; hence, it shall satisfy the need on both sides. You would engage a local property lawyer who files all the necessary suits and pleads a hard legal case. Once filed, such actions will help to put forward your rights and gain lawful direct access to your property.Hope that this helps you to solve your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Land issue dispute",
    "answer": "Dear Client, You would be able to challenge the gift deed made between A and C; it will depend a lot upon the legal grounds for the same. For instance, one can always make the argument for fraud, undue influence, coercion, or violation of your grandfather B's rights as a legal heir. Since the deed is stamped properly, registered and witnessed, anything to the contrary makes it quite credible legally. Provided that you can prove that your grandfather had a valid interest in the property or that the deed was executed by him without free will, the Court will entertain your challenge. As a general rule, it is very hard to break a gift deed or hiba, unless there is a specific ground of revocation such as fraud or want of free consent. You may try to argue that the 2002 affidavit by A to intend to share out part of the property to the other cousin represents a repugnant intention, but it cannot be automatically said to vitiate the deed of gift. Considering that your primary interest is to get a personal pathway for privacy and access, it would be in your best interest to try to arrive at an amicable settlement with C for an easement or right of way. If the negotiations break down, you can apply for legal remedy under the provisions of easement laws to create a pathway without, necessarily, annulling the deed.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client, I shall try to describe this in terms of the act of your neighbor towards the boundary wall and growth of trees. If such a boundary wall was erected by you on your property, then without your permission, barbed wires cannot be done. That may amount to trespass and by law you would have each right to claim removal of something like that after serving notice demanding such removal. If they refuse, you can sue them civilly to get an injunction compelling them not to do any unauthorized alteration or incursion on your property. Again, the same goes for planting trees, and the same is allowed unless and until no nuisance emerges from it.If the trees border the boundary wall, their roots or branches may go into your property damaging the wall or obstruct sunlight or falling debris; in which case, such may constitute a nuisance under property law. You can then ask your neighbor to cut down or remove the trees.You may even draft a letter to the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation or even file a civil suit, in case they are not agreeing to your demands. First of all, I would say you must have had formal communications for settlement amicably in that matter. And in case it is still persisting, then you would require to send legal notices or further legal proceedings for protecting your rights in that property.Hope that this helps you to solve your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Salt lake sector 3 bidhannagar Kolkata boundary wall rules query",
    "answer": "In Salt Lake Sector 3, Bidhannagar, Kolkata, regulations concerning boundary walls and associated modifications are governed by theWest Bengal Municipal (Building) Rules, 2007.Barbed Wire Installation: The Rules define a \"boundary wall\" as a wall constructed along the property line, not exceeding the permissible height specified therein. However, they do not explicitly address the addition of barbed wire atop such walls. Therefore, installing barbed wire may be subject to local municipal guidelines or specific community regulations. It's advisable to consult theBidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC)to ascertain any restrictions or required permissions for such installations.Planting Trees Adjacent to Boundary Walls: Planting trees near boundary walls is generally permissible. However, the BMC emphasizes planting small to medium-sized trees to prevent accidents and ensure safety, especially considering the area's soil conditionsTimes of India. It's important to select appropriate tree species and maintain them properly to avoid potential damage to structures or encroachment on neighboring properties.Recommendations:Consult Local Authorities: Before installing barbed wire or planting trees near boundary walls, consult the BMC to understand specific regulations and obtain necessary approvals.Select Appropriate Tree Species: Choose tree species that are suitable for the local environment and are less likely to interfere with structures or neighboring properties.Regular Maintenance: Ensure regular upkeep of both boundary walls and adjacent vegetation to prevent any hazards or disputes.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.

    "answer": "Dear ClientIn the Present Scenario, your housing association is going for redevelopment and you wish to enquire on which would be a better model for redevelopment. Further, your society consists of 36 flats presently, and for the redevelopment project, you have identified a builder as well, who says that, he would build 120 flats in total, out of which, 72 flats would be that of the owner. With respect to the first model, the entire UDS would be transferred to the builder, wherein most of the flats would be transferred to the builder, and the owners would list their holding in the land, affecting their capital gains and developing the property further. Furthermore, with the first model, you may have to pay long term capital gains tax, but on the other hand, you may benefit due to higher holding of flat ownership. With respect to the second model, the UDS would be divided with 60% being in favour of owners and rest 40% being allocated to the builder. Herein, the owners may retain a significant share of land, that would ensure benefit from long term appreciation of land value. However, looking into he details of both the models, the second model may be preferred as the same suggests long term gains, including advantage from land value appreciation, and less tax liabilities.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the disputeAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "In Tamil Nadu, the registration of a Joint Development Agreement (JDA) has been made mandatory by the state government. This move aims to bring clarity to landowners and developers by categorizing liabilities and setting time limits for construction projects. The state registration department has introduced laws to facilitate this process, eliminating the need for a power of attorney in such agreements.Risks of Not Registering the JDA:Legal Enforceability Issues:An unregistered JDA may face challenges in court regarding its enforceability. In the event of disputes, courts may not entertain unregistered agreements, making it difficult to enforce the terms outlined in the JDA.Admissibility Concerns:During legal proceedings, the admissibility of an unregistered JDA can be contested, potentially weakening your position in disputes.Tax Implications:Unregistered JDAs can lead to unfavorable tax consequences, as certain tax benefits and considerations are contingent upon proper registration.Regulatory Non-Compliance:Non-registration may result in non-compliance with state regulations, leading to potential legal penalties or complications in obtaining necessary approvals.Recommendation:Given the legal and practical implications, it is advisable to register the JDA to ensure its enforceability and to safeguard the interests of all parties involved. Consulting with a legal professional experienced in property law in Tamil Nadu is recommended to navigate the registration process and to address any specific concerns related to your redevelopment project.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.

    "question": "Please explain which is a better model for JDA",
    "answer": "In Tamil Nadu, the registration of Joint Development Agreements (JDAs) is mandatory. This requirement stems from the state's amendments to the Indian Stamp Act and the Registration Act, 1908, which mandate the registration of documents that create or assign rights in immovable property. Specifically, Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908, requires the registration of non-testamentary instruments that purport to create, declare, assign, limit, or extinguish any right, title, or interest in immovable property.A JDA typically assigns development rights from the landowner to the developer, thereby necessitating its registration to ensure legal enforceability. The Tamil Nadu government has emphasized this by mandating the registration of Joint Venture agreements and reducing the associated stamp duty and registration fees to encourage compliance.Failure to register a JDA can lead to significant legal complications:Legal Enforceability Issues: An unregistered JDA may not be legally enforceable, making it challenging to uphold its terms in a court of law.Admissibility Concerns: In legal disputes, an unregistered JDA may not be admissible as evidence, weakening any claims based on the agreement.Tax Implications: Unregistered agreements can result in unfavorable tax consequences, as certain tax benefits are contingent upon proper registration.Regulatory Non-Compliance: Non-registration may lead to non-compliance with state regulations, potentially resulting in legal penalties.Therefore, it is advisable to register the JDA to ensure its legal validity and enforceability.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Your facts state that title to the 1350 sqft plot appears well-established in your name, as you have been in possession for over 10 years and your family has been occupying the land for 70 years. Long-standing possession will give you more leeway under adverse possession laws. But, for the sake of prevention and for the sake of clearness of record, it would be well-advised to get the mutation of the land done in the name of your wife. The pathway of 260 sqft has been demarcated as a separate pathway in the revenue map but it has been obstructed by the boundary wall of (C). You can bring a suit for declaration and injunction to recover it. This would contain evidence of ownership, which means a sale deed and revenue map, along with further assertion of your rights over your property as pertaining to easement. You could then further propose that the settlement be made out-of-court wherein your right over the common pathway shall be traded in for an exclusive right to hold possession over the 260 sqft of land; hence, it shall satisfy the need on both sides. You would engage a local property lawyer who files all the necessary suits and pleads a hard legal case. Once filed, such actions will help to put forward your rights and gain lawful direct access to your property.Hope that this helps you to solve your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Land issue dispute",
    "answer": "Dear Client, You would be able to challenge the gift deed made between A and C; it will depend a lot upon the legal grounds for the same. For instance, one can always make the argument for fraud, undue influence, coercion, or violation of your grandfather B's rights as a legal heir. Since the deed is stamped properly, registered and witnessed, anything to the contrary makes it quite credible legally. Provided that you can prove that your grandfather had a valid interest in the property or that the deed was executed by him without free will, the Court will entertain your challenge. As a general rule, it is very hard to break a gift deed or hiba, unless there is a specific ground of revocation such as fraud or want of free consent. You may try to argue that the 2002 affidavit by A to intend to share out part of the property to the other cousin represents a repugnant intention, but it cannot be automatically said to vitiate the deed of gift. Considering that your primary interest is to get a personal pathway for privacy and access, it would be in your best interest to try to arrive at an amicable settlement with C for an easement or right of way. If the negotiations break down, you can apply for legal remedy under the provisions of easement laws to create a pathway without, necessarily, annulling the deed.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Can You Challenge the Gift Deed?Yes, you can challenge the gift deed if:You can prove that your grandfather (B) had rights to a share in the property, which were ignored during the execution of the gift deed.The deed is fraudulent or made under undue influence.A valid legal interest of your grandfather or your family is affected by the gift.However, since the deed is stamped, registered, and witnessed, the burden of proof lies heavily on you.Can the Gift Deed Be Broken (Hiba)?A gift deed (Hiba) can be revoked in certain cases, such as:Fraud, coercion, or undue influence during its execution.If the donor retained rights to revoke the gift.If none of these conditions apply, breaking the deed may not be straightforward.Can the 2002 Affidavit Help?The affidavit can be used to:Highlight inconsistencies or favoritism in the gift deed.Argue that (A) intended to distribute land to other family members, including your grandfather.It may not nullify the gift deed directly but can strengthen your case for claiming a pathway or another equitable solution.How to Secure the Pathway Without Breaking the Gift Deed?File a suit foreasement rightsorpartition adjustment:Claim a right to access the pathway as it is essential for reaching your property.Propose to exchange part of your common land for the 260 sq. ft. blocked by (C).Present your case for privacy and practicality while respecting the existing gift deed.Action PlanAttempt Negotiation:Even if (C) refuses, document your efforts to resolve the matter amicably.File a Civil Suit:File for possession or easement rights over the pathway based on necessity and fairness.Use the affidavit, sale deed, and revenue maps as supporting evidence.Focus on Pathway Resolution:Avoid challenging the entire gift deed unless absolutely necessary. Courts may prefer equitable solutions (like granting access) over overturning a registered document.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.

    "question": "Agreement and power attorney",
    "answer": "Dear Client, There are a few things that a person needs to be careful about at the time of signing the deed and handing over the power of attorney to the builder for ensuring his interest. It will demand that the contract which is entered between the builder reflects a timeline when such a project is expected to be completed. Include also a penalty clause specifying an amount of compensation if such commitment beyond two years is delayed.The contract should also carry construction milestones. The disputes can be amicably settled through arbitration. Get it registered with the local sub-registrar to give the strength of enforceability. To make the transfer of three flats available to your wife and children at your death due to some cause during the period of construction, get a provision in the agreement for this transfer or execute a separate will or declaration of intent for this purpose.Alternately, a trust deed or an agreement of joint ownership could also be drafted to protect their interests.Draft a special power of attorney limiting the powers of the builder strictly to the things necessary for the project such as getting permits and representing you in the construction, excluding from it sale, transfer, or mortgage of the property without your written consent. If you would like your wife to be a joint owner of the plot, you can have a gift deed or a sale deed prepared in her name. This will incur stamp duty, approx. 2-3%-and registration fees. This should all be done at the sub-registrar's office in Bhubaneswar and shall take approximately about a week in total. You should hire a property lawyer to draft and review all agreements and legal documents that would ensure your interests are very well protected during the process.Hope that this helps you to solve your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client, Thank you for also contacting me with some questions about the demolition of the party wall, and tax upon property for your two flats. In most instances, partially divided walls can be demolished, provided that such works will not have the effect of impairing the structural safety of the building.But then again, it would be perfect if you are able to consult the builder or a qualified structural engineer for the confirmation that this wall is not load-bearing. Sometimes, you would even require NOC from the housing society and other concerned authorities so that your local building regulations are in good book, and you do not get into disputes.Now, property tax you have two separate agreements for two flats therefore BMC will treat these two as two units only.Since the exemption is on residential units of less than 500 square feet each you can continue getting this exemption for both flats though BMC re-designates it as a single unit and gives it a composite area of 660 square feet.So, before issues come up, right would be that BMC clarifies properly, so that any structural change gets all the necessary approvals.Hope that this helps you to solve your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, taking into consideration the Limitation Act, the time for recovering the money under the contract, would be 3 years from the time payment of the same becomes due. Herein, the decision of the arbitrator to treat the projects as four separately as each of the projects had different purchase orders, making the limitation period being applied project-wise. Additionally, the payments for the projects have been from the same bank account, and the argument for a consolidated claim may be evidenced with continual cause of action, thus, aiding in the extension of the limitation period. With respect to the MSME Act, the same provides for dispute resolution through the methods of arbitration and conciliation. But, excluding the claims of the arbitrator, for two projects specifies the procedural limitations present and thus, the expiration of the limitation period. However, to challenge this, it is suggested that you maintain all the relevant documents, including the contract, the purchase orders, relevant receipts etc. You may also appeal the decision under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, if you are not satisfied with the arbitrator's decision.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Inquiry regarding property modifications and tax obligations",
    "answer": "Dear Client, Thank you for also contacting me with some questions about the demolition of the party wall, and tax upon property for your two flats. In most instances, partially divided walls can be demolished, provided that such works will not have the effect of impairing the structural safety of the building.But then again, it would be perfect if you are able to consult the builder or a qualified structural engineer for the confirmation that this wall is not load-bearing. Sometimes, you would even require NOC from the housing society and other concerned authorities so that your local building regulations are in good book, and you do not get into disputes.Now, property tax you have two separate agreements for two flats therefore BMC will treat these two as two units only.Since the exemption is on residential units of less than 500 square feet each you can continue getting this exemption for both flats though BMC re-designates it as a single unit and gives it a composite area of 660 square feet.So, before issues come up, right would be that BMC clarifies properly, so that any structural change gets all the necessary approvals.Hope that this helps you to solve your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Model Comparison:Model 1: Overall Undivided Share Transferred:Builder receives full ownership of the undivided share of land.72 flats go to existing owners, and the remaining flats belong to the builder.Pros:Simpler agreement and fewer land ownership complexities.Builder has full flexibility for future projects.Suitable for societies not keen on land division complexities.Cons:Loss of direct control over land by the owners.Owners may face higher tax liabilities on the undivided share transfer.Model 2: Land Division (60% Owners, 40% Builder):Owners retain 60% of the undivided share, while the builder holds 40%.Ownership of flats aligns proportionally with land ownership.Pros:Owners retain partial land control.May reduce long-term capital gains tax exposure for owners.Transparent distribution of land ownership.Cons:Complex legal and registration process.Builder may demand additional considerations for reduced land share.Tax Implications:Model 1: Owners may face higher capital gains tax as the entire land is transferred to the builder.Model 2: Lower capital gains tax since owners retain a portion of the land, deferring taxation until future transactions.Recommendation:Model 2is generally better if owners want partial control of the land and lower tax liability.Opt forModel 1if the builder is offering significantly better terms or higher-quality redevelopment in return for full land control.Next Steps:Consult a property tax advisor to calculate potential tax liabilities for each model.Ensure a clear redevelopment agreement that protects owners' rights, timelines, and quality assurance.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.Hope you find the information helpful.

    "answer": "Dear ClientIn the Present Scenario, your housing association is going for redevelopment and you wish to enquire on which would be a better model for redevelopment. Further, your society consists of 36 flats presently, and for the redevelopment project, you have identified a builder as well, who says that, he would build 120 flats in total, out of which, 72 flats would be that of the owner. With respect to the first model, the entire UDS would be transferred to the builder, wherein most of the flats would be transferred to the builder, and the owners would list their holding in the land, affecting their capital gains and developing the property further. Furthermore, with the first model, you may have to pay long term capital gains tax, but on the other hand, you may benefit due to higher holding of flat ownership. With respect to the second model, the UDS would be divided with 60% being in favour of owners and rest 40% being allocated to the builder. Herein, the owners may retain a significant share of land, that would ensure benefit from long term appreciation of land value. However, looking into he details of both the models, the second model may be preferred as the same suggests long term gains, including advantage from land value appreciation, and less tax liabilities.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the disputeAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "In Tamil Nadu, the registration of a Joint Development Agreement (JDA) has been made mandatory by the state government. This move aims to bring clarity to landowners and developers by categorizing liabilities and setting time limits for construction projects. The state registration department has introduced laws to facilitate this process, eliminating the need for a power of attorney in such agreements.Risks of Not Registering the JDA:Legal Enforceability Issues:An unregistered JDA may face challenges in court regarding its enforceability. In the event of disputes, courts may not entertain unregistered agreements, making it difficult to enforce the terms outlined in the JDA.Admissibility Concerns:During legal proceedings, the admissibility of an unregistered JDA can be contested, potentially weakening your position in disputes.Tax Implications:Unregistered JDAs can lead to unfavorable tax consequences, as certain tax benefits and considerations are contingent upon proper registration.Regulatory Non-Compliance:Non-registration may result in non-compliance with state regulations, leading to potential legal penalties or complications in obtaining necessary approvals.Recommendation:Given the legal and practical implications, it is advisable to register the JDA to ensure its enforceability and to safeguard the interests of all parties involved. Consulting with a legal professional experienced in property law in Tamil Nadu is recommended to navigate the registration process and to address any specific concerns related to your redevelopment project.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.

    "question": "Please explain which is a better model for JDA",
    "answer": "In Tamil Nadu, the registration of Joint Development Agreements (JDAs) is mandatory. This requirement stems from the state's amendments to the Indian Stamp Act and the Registration Act, 1908, which mandate the registration of documents that create or assign rights in immovable property. Specifically, Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908, requires the registration of non-testamentary instruments that purport to create, declare, assign, limit, or extinguish any right, title, or interest in immovable property.A JDA typically assigns development rights from the landowner to the developer, thereby necessitating its registration to ensure legal enforceability. The Tamil Nadu government has emphasized this by mandating the registration of Joint Venture agreements and reducing the associated stamp duty and registration fees to encourage compliance.Failure to register a JDA can lead to significant legal complications:Legal Enforceability Issues: An unregistered JDA may not be legally enforceable, making it challenging to uphold its terms in a court of law.Admissibility Concerns: In legal disputes, an unregistered JDA may not be admissible as evidence, weakening any claims based on the agreement.Tax Implications: Unregistered agreements can result in unfavorable tax consequences, as certain tax benefits are contingent upon proper registration.Regulatory Non-Compliance: Non-registration may lead to non-compliance with state regulations, potentially resulting in legal penalties.Therefore, it is advisable to register the JDA to ensure its legal validity and enforceability.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Your facts state that title to the 1350 sqft plot appears well-established in your name, as you have been in possession for over 10 years and your family has been occupying the land for 70 years. Long-standing possession will give you more leeway under adverse possession laws. But, for the sake of prevention and for the sake of clearness of record, it would be well-advised to get the mutation of the land done in the name of your wife. The pathway of 260 sqft has been demarcated as a separate pathway in the revenue map but it has been obstructed by the boundary wall of (C). You can bring a suit for declaration and injunction to recover it. This would contain evidence of ownership, which means a sale deed and revenue map, along with further assertion of your rights over your property as pertaining to easement. You could then further propose that the settlement be made out-of-court wherein your right over the common pathway shall be traded in for an exclusive right to hold possession over the 260 sqft of land; hence, it shall satisfy the need on both sides. You would engage a local property lawyer who files all the necessary suits and pleads a hard legal case. Once filed, such actions will help to put forward your rights and gain lawful direct access to your property.Hope that this helps you to solve your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Land issue dispute",
    "answer": "Dear Client, You would be able to challenge the gift deed made between A and C; it will depend a lot upon the legal grounds for the same. For instance, one can always make the argument for fraud, undue influence, coercion, or violation of your grandfather B's rights as a legal heir. Since the deed is stamped properly, registered and witnessed, anything to the contrary makes it quite credible legally. Provided that you can prove that your grandfather had a valid interest in the property or that the deed was executed by him without free will, the Court will entertain your challenge. As a general rule, it is very hard to break a gift deed or hiba, unless there is a specific ground of revocation such as fraud or want of free consent. You may try to argue that the 2002 affidavit by A to intend to share out part of the property to the other cousin represents a repugnant intention, but it cannot be automatically said to vitiate the deed of gift. Considering that your primary interest is to get a personal pathway for privacy and access, it would be in your best interest to try to arrive at an amicable settlement with C for an easement or right of way. If the negotiations break down, you can apply for legal remedy under the provisions of easement laws to create a pathway without, necessarily, annulling the deed.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In Kerala, the land use regulations are governed by the Kerala Town and Country Planning Act, 2016, and the Kerala Municipality Act, 1994. These laws require certain permissions for converting residential plots to commercial use. If the driving school is operating on a residential plot without conversion to commercial use, it might be in violation of these regulations. Under the Kerala Municipality Act, the Corporation or Municipality is responsible for regulating land use and ensuring compliance with zoning laws. If the plot has not been converted for commercial purposes, operating a driving school there without permission could be illegal. You can pursue a civil suit for nuisance and seek relief for damages and an injunction to prevent further disturbances. Request the court to issue a mandatory injunction to prevent the driving school from operating until proper permissions are obtained and the nuisance is addressed. Petition the Municipal Corporation to take immediate safety measures such as installing a boundary wall or barriers to prevent accidents and protect your property. Engage with local authorities to ensure compliance with safety and land use regulations. For Criminal recourse, you can request the police to register an FIR Considering that the preliminary investigation confirms that the allegations are true. you can file a complaint with the Superintendent of Police or approach the Magistrate to direct the police to register the FIR.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "As far as the alimony is concerned she has to file an application seeking it without which it is not automatic.You can file the divorce case on the grounds of mental cruelty, especially if she has voluntarily abandoned the matrimonial home and living separately on her own and also instructing you to leave your mother behind and stay with her alone, are all considered to be acts of cruelty besides other reasons.If she files an application for alimony she has to file an affidavit declaring her assets and liabilities, if she suppresses her employment and salary income details, you can repudiate her claim mentioning that she has perjured law hence doesn't deserves alimony.That is a matter of trial, hence you can concentrate on the main subject for now.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88765 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Wife threatening with false cases",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, subsequent to the divorce, alimony would be determined based on various factors, including the duration of the marriage, financial capacity of both spouses, and the wife’s ability to support herself, and so on. Under the BNSS, maintenance is typically granted if the wife is unable to maintain herself, but since your wife is earning Rs. 40,000 per month and has been living separately, her claim for alimony may be reduced. Further, underHindu Marriage Act, the provisions allow for interim maintenance during divorce proceedings, and permanent alimony based on the husband’s income and the wife’s financial capacity. Here, your monthly income is Rs. 1.4 lakhs, and since your wife is employed, the court will consider your financial obligations you have, as well as her ability to support herself. Further, since your marriage lasted only about 13 months and your wife has not contributed financially to you or the marriage, the court may award an alimony of certain percentage of your monthly income. Additionally, the issues you have, your medical check-ups and so on, would also strengthen your case for divorce. However, it is suggested that you maintain the documentation and salary details of both you and your spouse, so as to maintain a proof for your defence.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Wife threatening with false cases",
    "answer": "- As per Supreme Court judgment, wife is expected to move in with the relatives of their husbands, follow the rules and customs of their home, and ideally, blend in seamlessly as a new daughter.- Further, the court granted divorce to a man on the grounds of “cruelty” after his wife refused to share a home with her in-laws.- Hence, as per law, she cannot deny living with you, under the condition of separate living from your mother.- Further, If wife is not supporting her husband for the enjoyment of life and denying relation, then the husband can get divorce after filing a divorce petition before the court on this ground.Further, As per Delhi High Court, physical intimacy is an essential aspect of marriage and a wife's continuous refusal to have such relationship with her husband can be a ground for divorce,- Hence, ifshe is not interested to live with you, then try to take her consent for mutual divorce.- If, she not agrees for mutual divorce, then file a divorce petition on the above mentioned grounds.- Since, she has left you, then for your safeguards, you can lodged a complaint before the police and higher official, as an information, after mentioning the details and also for threatening to implicate you in false dowry cases.- Since, she is earning then she cannot claim maintenance from you.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

This creates a record for your protection.Mental Health Records:Retain medical records of anxiety treatments to show the emotional impact caused by her actions.2.Divorce Considerations:Grounds:File for divorce citing mental cruelty.Proofs:Maintain records of her absence, lack of contribution, and threats for strong grounds in court.3.Alimony Calculation:Short Marriage:Since the marriage lasted only 13 months, courts may not order long-term alimony.Financial Independence:Highlight that she earns ₹40,000/month and has not contributed to your household.Your Obligations:Show your EMI, your mother’s medical expenses, and your limited disposable income.Expected Alimony:In case of a lump sum, it may range between ₹2–4 lakhs (roughly 3–6 months of your income), depending on her claims.Monthly maintenance is unlikely given her income.4.Precautions:Do not engage directly with her or her family regarding the divorce to avoid escalating the situation.Record all communications for legal use if required.5.Legal Advice:Consult a matrimonial lawyer for drafting the divorce petition and preparing for any counterclaims.Consider mediation to settle the matter amicably.This approach ensures minimal financial impact and safeguards against false cases while proceeding with divorce.Shubham GoyalAdvocate, Delhi1186 Answers7 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shubham Goyal"

    "question": "Buyer postponing cancellation deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you may consider the Indian Contract Act, 1872, under which, the failure of the purchaser to pay the full amount within one month, as agreed in the registered Agreement to Sale, constitutes a breach of contract. While this breach makes the purchaser liable, the agreement remains valid until formally cancelled or declared void. Furthermore, according to theTransfer of Property Act, 1882,an Agreement to Sale does not transfer ownership but creates a contractual obligation, meaning selling the property to another buyer without cancelling the first agreement could expose you to a legal action. However, to proceed further with this, you may send a legal notice to the first buyer citing the breach, and demanding cancellation of the agreement. However, if he continues to delay, you can take the initiative to draft a cancellation deed, clearly stating whether you intend to refund or forfeit the advance payment of ₹1. In case of non-compliance or not co-operating to any of your actions, you may file a suit under the Specific Relief Act, 1963,seeking a declaration that the agreement is void due to non-performance.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "- A Collaboration Agreement is needed between an owner of the land and a builder where the land owner contributes the land and the developer undertakes the responsibility of obtaining approvals, property development, launching and marketing the project with the help of his financial resources.- As per law, the builder is not the transferee or buyer of the flats as per theTransfer of Property Act, 1882 under the Collaboration Agreement.- The ownership lies with the owner of the land, but the landowner grants the builder along with development rights, a license to enter the land for the purpose of development.- The license/authority to enter the land is typically given by way of a Power of attorney issued in favor of the Builder, and this General power of attorney should be registered with the Registrar in order to be legally binding on both parties.- Hence, the transfer of the land on which construction will be carried by the Builder, is mandatory.- On completion of the construction by the builder, the occupancy right is granted by the competent authority to the owner, and the owner will himself execute the sale deed in favour of the buyers.- Further, in case of breach of the terms of the Collaboration agreement, the land owner will have the right to revoke the power of attorney.- You should take services of a lawyer for drafting the agreement.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Agreement and power attorney",
    "answer": "Dear Client, There are a few things that a person needs to be careful about at the time of signing the deed and handing over the power of attorney to the builder for ensuring his interest. It will demand that the contract which is entered between the builder reflects a timeline when such a project is expected to be completed. Include also a penalty clause specifying an amount of compensation if such commitment beyond two years is delayed.The contract should also carry construction milestones. The disputes can be amicably settled through arbitration. Get it registered with the local sub-registrar to give the strength of enforceability. To make the transfer of three flats available to your wife and children at your death due to some cause during the period of construction, get a provision in the agreement for this transfer or execute a separate will or declaration of intent for this purpose.Alternately, a trust deed or an agreement of joint ownership could also be drafted to protect their interests.Draft a special power of attorney limiting the powers of the builder strictly to the things necessary for the project such as getting permits and representing you in the construction, excluding from it sale, transfer, or mortgage of the property without your written consent. If you would like your wife to be a joint owner of the plot, you can have a gift deed or a sale deed prepared in her name. This will incur stamp duty, approx. 2-3%-and registration fees. This should all be done at the sub-registrar's office in Bhubaneswar and shall take approximately about a week in total. You should hire a property lawyer to draft and review all agreements and legal documents that would ensure your interests are very well protected during the process.Hope that this helps you to solve your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Constructing an additional toilet is permissible if it does not pose a safety risk, and you have already obtained an architect's approval confirming its feasibility. Herein, the Apartment Owners’ Association, under the Karnataka Apartment Ownership Act, 1972, cannot arbitrarily deny permission without substantiated technical reasons. Their concerns regarding load-bearing or water seepage must be validated by an expert, which they have so far failed to arrange. To proceed further, it is suggested that, you send a formal written request to the association, including your architect’s approval and assurances of safety, to appoint their own expert for verification within a reasonable deadline. If they remain unresponsive or deny the request without considering or providing any evidence, you may approach the Bangalore Municipal Corporation or any other independent structural engineer for approval. You may also consider filing a complaint with the Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum for undue inconvenience or financial loss.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, taking into consideration the Limitation Act, the time for recovering the money under the contract, would be 3 years from the time payment of the same becomes due. Herein, the decision of the arbitrator to treat the projects as four separately as each of the projects had different purchase orders, making the limitation period being applied project-wise. Additionally, the payments for the projects have been from the same bank account, and the argument for a consolidated claim may be evidenced with continual cause of action, thus, aiding in the extension of the limitation period. With respect to the MSME Act, the same provides for dispute resolution through the methods of arbitration and conciliation. But, excluding the claims of the arbitrator, for two projects specifies the procedural limitations present and thus, the expiration of the limitation period. However, to challenge this, it is suggested that you maintain all the relevant documents, including the contract, the purchase orders, relevant receipts etc. You may also appeal the decision under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, if you are not satisfied with the arbitrator's decision.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, subsequent to the divorce, alimony would be determined based on various factors, including the duration of the marriage, financial capacity of both spouses, and the wife’s ability to support herself, and so on. Under the BNSS, maintenance is typically granted if the wife is unable to maintain herself, but since your wife is earning Rs. 40,000 per month and has been living separately, her claim for alimony may be reduced. Further, underHindu Marriage Act, the provisions allow for interim maintenance during divorce proceedings, and permanent alimony based on the husband’s income and the wife’s financial capacity. Here, your monthly income is Rs. 1.4 lakhs, and since your wife is employed, the court will consider your financial obligations you have, as well as her ability to support herself. Further, since your marriage lasted only about 13 months and your wife has not contributed financially to you or the marriage, the court may award an alimony of certain percentage of your monthly income. Additionally, the issues you have, your medical check-ups and so on, would also strengthen your case for divorce. However, it is suggested that you maintain the documentation and salary details of both you and your spouse, so as to maintain a proof for your defence.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Giving such assurances or guarantee is itself unprofessional and amounts to professional misconduct. Ideally an advocate can only give a tentative timeline to the client within which his case would be adjudicated by the Court. This is only by way of a ballpark estimate.you must understand that Courts are highly unpredictable and with the heavy backlog of cases it becomes all the more difficult to get a sooner listing, except in cases of extreme urgencyi would like to see the order by which the LOC was issued against youit is unfortunate that the first lawyer used abusive language [assuming that to be correct].

    "question": "PCC and DV",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, the Police Clearance Certificate (PCC) usually shows whether there are any criminal cases or investigations against you. However, if there is no FIR or criminal case, the PCC usually indicates that there are no adverse police records though the police may still be aware of adomestic violencecase through Non-Cognizable records or investigation reports, as DV cases may not always result in an FIR but can still be investigated informally. Further, Police usually do not have access to court records, but if adomestic violencecase was filed, the police may be involved in the preliminary stages of investigation. But, if your wife withdrew the case, the PCC would generally reflect that the case was dismissed or disposed of, without explicitly stating it was withdrawn, indicating that there are no ongoing investigations. With respect to the false acquisitions made, you may file a criminal defamation case. Further, usually, political influences do not affect the PCC, as it reflects the factual details. Also, if your wife wrongly included your mother in theDomestic Violencecase that was later dismissed, you may pursue criminal action against her.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Police does not have access to DV court records right?opinion: DV cannot be shown to anyone due to confidential hence police cannot get the details of the case until and unless the police has any order against you received by the Court in that DV case.3) If police has found no FIR in their records how come police will know that DV is pending about me?opinion: in DV case, if any order passed by the Ld. Trial court than generally, a copy of the same has to send to the concerned police station and if they received it than they may be mentioned the details of that case.4) Police has only NC and FIR records in their hands right? so if DV with no FIR how come police will know about DV?opinion: as above.5) if my wife withdrawn the DV case what will be written statement in PCC in Mumbai? will it show DV was filed but its withdrawn or it will be clearly written like there is no adverse information against me.opinion: as above.6) i want to file criminal defamation against wife. can any lawyer in Mumbai has done it before who can contact me?opinion: contact the lawyer of your choice.7) can police purposely mention DV was withdrawn in PCC just because of political influences?opinion: they will mentioned as per their record and not otherwise.8) wife has included my mother as well in the DV but she got discharged as it was false name added into DV. i want to a criminal action against wife. what action can i take?your mother may file a criminal complaint for malicious prosecution or may file a civil suit for defamation and claim damages against her.

    "answer": "A case for malicious prosecution can be filed in the court that has jurisdiction over the area where the wrong was committed.Malicious prosecution is a legal action that can be taken against someone who abuses the court process by wrongfully starting a lawsuit. The essential elements of malicious prosecution are:The defendant acted maliciouslyThe defendant had no reasonable or probable causeThe plaintiff was harmed as a result of the prosecutionThe proceedings ended in the plaintiff's favorThe main difference between claims based on criminal and civil actions has to do with evidence. A claim based on malicious criminal prosecution might allege damages for mental suffering. Here, a plaintiff might not need to provide proof in the form of verifiable economic damages. But for claims based on civil actions, the plaintiff must be able to prove quantifiable damages.A client relationship with a personal injury lawyer means you'll have the legal advice you need to pursue damages."

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, taking into consideration the Limitation Act, the time for recovering the money under the contract, would be 3 years from the time payment of the same becomes due. Herein, the decision of the arbitrator to treat the projects as four separately as each of the projects had different purchase orders, making the limitation period being applied project-wise. Additionally, the payments for the projects have been from the same bank account, and the argument for a consolidated claim may be evidenced with continual cause of action, thus, aiding in the extension of the limitation period. With respect to the MSME Act, the same provides for dispute resolution through the methods of arbitration and conciliation. But, excluding the claims of the arbitrator, for two projects specifies the procedural limitations present and thus, the expiration of the limitation period. However, to challenge this, it is suggested that you maintain all the relevant documents, including the contract, the purchase orders, relevant receipts etc. You may also appeal the decision under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, if you are not satisfied with the arbitrator's decision.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, taking into consideration the Limitation Act, the time for recovering the money under the contract, would be 3 years from the time payment of the same becomes due. Herein, the decision of the arbitrator to treat the projects as four separately as each of the projects had different purchase orders, making the limitation period being applied project-wise. Additionally, the payments for the projects have been from the same bank account, and the argument for a consolidated claim may be evidenced with continual cause of action, thus, aiding in the extension of the limitation period. With respect to the MSME Act, the same provides for dispute resolution through the methods of arbitration and conciliation. But, excluding the claims of the arbitrator, for two projects specifies the procedural limitations present and thus, the expiration of the limitation period. However, to challenge this, it is suggested that you maintain all the relevant documents, including the contract, the purchase orders, relevant receipts etc. You may also appeal the decision under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, if you are not satisfied with the arbitrator's decision.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Cheque bounce case filed for Secured Home loan when its not even NPA",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. This practice is being adopted as a matter for recovering the outstanding in case of eventuality. From the lender side they are more concerned about the recovery of the money with the contracted interest amount.Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that if in a transaction, a loan is advanced and the borrower agrees to repay the amount in a specified timeframe and issues a cheque as security to secure such repayment; if the loan amount is not repaid in any other form before the due date or if there is no other understanding or agreement between the parties to defer the payment of amount, the cheque which is issued as security would mature for presentation and the drawee of the cheque would be entitled to present the same. On such presentation, if the same is dishonoured, the consequences contemplated under Section 138 and the other provisions of N.I. Act would flow. When a cheque is issued even though as ‘security’ the consequence flowing therefrom is also known to the drawer of the cheque and in the circumstance stated above if the cheque is presented and dishonoured, the holder of the cheque/drawee would have the option of initiating the civil proceedings for recovery or the criminal proceedings for punishment in the fact situation, but in any event, it is not for the drawer of the cheque to dictate terms with regard to the nature of litigation.However, there are always defences available as per facts and circumstances of each case. Since you have already received the summons, therefore, the case has to appropriately defended.

    "answer": "There is no legal infirmity in using the security cheque for recovering the defaulted loan amount.The bank issued a statutory legal demand notice before filing thecheque bouncecase, whereas you failed to avail the opportunity.Therefore the bank has exercised its right to recover the loan amount especially when you continuously defaulted the EMI for two months.The bank cannot make it NPA for two months default. hence for putting pressure on you they have adopted this method.The high court may not entertain any petition for quash. hence you may better contact bank itself and negotiate settlement amount.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88766 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Misuse of Section 138 in Secured Loan:Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act (NI Act) applies to cheques issued fordischarging a debt or liability, not as security.Your home is the pledged security, and the bank’s action of depositing theentire loan amount chequedespite ongoing EMI payments is disproportionate and abusive.Key Legal Points in Your Favor:Blank Cheques Taken as Security: Courts have held that cheques given as security arenot actionable under Section 138unless explicitly stated as a repayment instrument in the agreement.Non-NPA Account: Since your account is not classified as NPA, the bank cannot justify depositing the cheque for the full loan amount.Partial Liability: With only two EMIs overdue, the bank should seek recovery for the outstanding amount, not initiate criminal proceedings for the entire loan amount.Action Plan:Challenge Jurisdiction: File a petition under Section482 CrPCin the High Court to quash the complaint. Argue:The cheque was for security, not repayment.The entire loan amount was not due.The property is mortgaged, providing sufficient recourse for the bank.Highlight Abuse of Process: Emphasize that Section 138 is being misused as a coercive tool, ignoring the secured nature of the loan.File a Counterclaim: If needed, initiate a counter-complaint for harassment or abuse of legal process.Precedents Supporting Your Case:ICDS Ltd. v. Beena Shabeer (2002): Cheques given as security are not covered under Section 138.Sampelly Satyanarayana Rao v. Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (2016): Security cheques do not constitute \"legally enforceable debt or liability.\"Next Steps:Engage a competent lawyer to file a quashing petition in the High Court.Emphasize that the criminal proceedings are unwarranted since the bank has adequate security and recovery mechanisms (e.g., SARFAESI Act).Conclusion: Courts have frowned upon the misuse of Section 138 for secured loans. With strong legal arguments and precedents, you can effectively challenge this case.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.Hope you find the information helpful.

Act would flow.” On a similar tangent, in the case of Sunil Todi,  SC  observed that a security cheque issued for advancement of a loan would be mature for presentation upon the default of repayment of loan.

Mere possession or use does not confer ownership. Furthermore, any money your brother spends on maintaining the property does not give him any legal rights, as voluntary maintenance expenses without an agreement are classified as gratuitous under the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and at most, he could seek reimbursement for the same. However, to prevent future disputes, you can formalize his stay through a leave and license agreement, ensuring it is clear that his occupancy is at your discretion and does not grant ownership rights. Additionally, you may also communicate this in writing that maintenance contributions are voluntary and do not affect your title.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "PCC and DV",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, the Police Clearance Certificate (PCC) usually shows whether there are any criminal cases or investigations against you. However, if there is no FIR or criminal case, the PCC usually indicates that there are no adverse police records though the police may still be aware of adomestic violencecase through Non-Cognizable records or investigation reports, as DV cases may not always result in an FIR but can still be investigated informally. Further, Police usually do not have access to court records, but if adomestic violencecase was filed, the police may be involved in the preliminary stages of investigation. But, if your wife withdrew the case, the PCC would generally reflect that the case was dismissed or disposed of, without explicitly stating it was withdrawn, indicating that there are no ongoing investigations. With respect to the false acquisitions made, you may file a criminal defamation case. Further, usually, political influences do not affect the PCC, as it reflects the factual details. Also, if your wife wrongly included your mother in theDomestic Violencecase that was later dismissed, you may pursue criminal action against her.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "A case for malicious prosecution can be filed in the court that has jurisdiction over the area where the wrong was committed.Malicious prosecution is a legal action that can be taken against someone who abuses the court process by wrongfully starting a lawsuit. The essential elements of malicious prosecution are:The defendant acted maliciouslyThe defendant had no reasonable or probable causeThe plaintiff was harmed as a result of the prosecutionThe proceedings ended in the plaintiff's favorThe main difference between claims based on criminal and civil actions has to do with evidence. A claim based on malicious criminal prosecution might allege damages for mental suffering. Here, a plaintiff might not need to provide proof in the form of verifiable economic damages. But for claims based on civil actions, the plaintiff must be able to prove quantifiable damages.A client relationship with a personal injury lawyer means you'll have the legal advice you need to pursue damages."

    "question": "Home loan",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, a loan of 4 crores was taken with two applicants Na, and Be, on September 2020. Na was the primary applicant and the single registered owner has contributed to the loan fully. On November 2024, the Primary applicant Na had paid the loan in full and, Be the secondary applicant, did not contribute at all. Your query is whether a NOC is required from Be. Herein, generally, HDFC Bank does not require a NOC, from the secondary applicant, for closing the loan, as Na, the primary applicant and sole registered owner of the property, has fully repaid the ₹4 crore loan. However, under the Indian Contract Act, since both are applicants, both are jointly and severally liable for the loan. But, once the loan is repaid, Be's liability ceases. Further, the status of co-applicant in the loan does not grant ownership rights to the property, that remains solely with Na, also as reflected in the registration documents. Therefore, since Be has neither contributed to the loan repayment, not does he/she holds any legal rights over the property, HDFC Bank should release the property documents and issue a Loan Closure Certificate based solely on Na’s request and proof of repayment.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Giving such assurances or guarantee is itself unprofessional and amounts to professional misconduct. Ideally an advocate can only give a tentative timeline to the client within which his case would be adjudicated by the Court. This is only by way of a ballpark estimate.you must understand that Courts are highly unpredictable and with the heavy backlog of cases it becomes all the more difficult to get a sooner listing, except in cases of extreme urgencyi would like to see the order by which the LOC was issued against youit is unfortunate that the first lawyer used abusive language [assuming that to be correct].

    "question": "Issue with Housing Society Committee",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you have some shops in a Society, in Kalyan West Maharashtra. With respect to this, you have asked a few queries. Firstly, with respect to the query as to whether it is compulsory to inform the society before giving the shop on rent, under the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, and its related bye-laws, it is generally required that, an information must be given in writing to the society, on renting out your shop, which would ensure that there is a tenant verification performed, and security compliance is also present. With respect to the second query, usually no permission is required specifically for doing any internal work within your shop, but if it affects the common areas of the society in any way, or such installations are carried out that are visible to the outer society, a written information to be given is suggested. with respect to your third query, usually police verification is necessary for everyone regardless of their membership in the society. With respect to your fourth query, society notices are generally sent through the registered address provided in the relevant documents. However, if such address was obtained unlawfully without you providing such information to send notices, the same may be brought to the society's attention. With respect to your fifth query, a society cannot recommend the cancellation of your membership in a unilateral way for the reason of not providing tenant verification, especially if a tenant is already the member of the society. With respect to your sixth query, in general terms, a society cannot charge for the work that was conducted within your shop unless the same impacts the common areas of the society. With respect to your last query, the society may write to the municipal corporation or police for such issues including security concerns, or violation of any laws that were set, but however, such complaints must be properly substantiated with the relevant reasons.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Model Comparison:Model 1: Overall Undivided Share Transferred:Builder receives full ownership of the undivided share of land.72 flats go to existing owners, and the remaining flats belong to the builder.Pros:Simpler agreement and fewer land ownership complexities.Builder has full flexibility for future projects.Suitable for societies not keen on land division complexities.Cons:Loss of direct control over land by the owners.Owners may face higher tax liabilities on the undivided share transfer.Model 2: Land Division (60% Owners, 40% Builder):Owners retain 60% of the undivided share, while the builder holds 40%.Ownership of flats aligns proportionally with land ownership.Pros:Owners retain partial land control.May reduce long-term capital gains tax exposure for owners.Transparent distribution of land ownership.Cons:Complex legal and registration process.Builder may demand additional considerations for reduced land share.Tax Implications:Model 1: Owners may face higher capital gains tax as the entire land is transferred to the builder.Model 2: Lower capital gains tax since owners retain a portion of the land, deferring taxation until future transactions.Recommendation:Model 2is generally better if owners want partial control of the land and lower tax liability.Opt forModel 1if the builder is offering significantly better terms or higher-quality redevelopment in return for full land control.Next Steps:Consult a property tax advisor to calculate potential tax liabilities for each model.Ensure a clear redevelopment agreement that protects owners' rights, timelines, and quality assurance.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.Hope you find the information helpful.

    "answer": "Dear ClientIn the Present Scenario, your housing association is going for redevelopment and you wish to enquire on which would be a better model for redevelopment. Further, your society consists of 36 flats presently, and for the redevelopment project, you have identified a builder as well, who says that, he would build 120 flats in total, out of which, 72 flats would be that of the owner. With respect to the first model, the entire UDS would be transferred to the builder, wherein most of the flats would be transferred to the builder, and the owners would list their holding in the land, affecting their capital gains and developing the property further. Furthermore, with the first model, you may have to pay long term capital gains tax, but on the other hand, you may benefit due to higher holding of flat ownership. With respect to the second model, the UDS would be divided with 60% being in favour of owners and rest 40% being allocated to the builder. Herein, the owners may retain a significant share of land, that would ensure benefit from long term appreciation of land value. However, looking into he details of both the models, the second model may be preferred as the same suggests long term gains, including advantage from land value appreciation, and less tax liabilities.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the disputeAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "In Tamil Nadu, the registration of a Joint Development Agreement (JDA) has been made mandatory by the state government. This move aims to bring clarity to landowners and developers by categorizing liabilities and setting time limits for construction projects. The state registration department has introduced laws to facilitate this process, eliminating the need for a power of attorney in such agreements.Risks of Not Registering the JDA:Legal Enforceability Issues:An unregistered JDA may face challenges in court regarding its enforceability. In the event of disputes, courts may not entertain unregistered agreements, making it difficult to enforce the terms outlined in the JDA.Admissibility Concerns:During legal proceedings, the admissibility of an unregistered JDA can be contested, potentially weakening your position in disputes.Tax Implications:Unregistered JDAs can lead to unfavorable tax consequences, as certain tax benefits and considerations are contingent upon proper registration.Regulatory Non-Compliance:Non-registration may result in non-compliance with state regulations, leading to potential legal penalties or complications in obtaining necessary approvals.Recommendation:Given the legal and practical implications, it is advisable to register the JDA to ensure its enforceability and to safeguard the interests of all parties involved. Consulting with a legal professional experienced in property law in Tamil Nadu is recommended to navigate the registration process and to address any specific concerns related to your redevelopment project.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.

    "question": "Please explain which is a better model for JDA",
    "answer": "In Tamil Nadu, the registration of Joint Development Agreements (JDAs) is mandatory. This requirement stems from the state's amendments to the Indian Stamp Act and the Registration Act, 1908, which mandate the registration of documents that create or assign rights in immovable property. Specifically, Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908, requires the registration of non-testamentary instruments that purport to create, declare, assign, limit, or extinguish any right, title, or interest in immovable property.A JDA typically assigns development rights from the landowner to the developer, thereby necessitating its registration to ensure legal enforceability. The Tamil Nadu government has emphasized this by mandating the registration of Joint Venture agreements and reducing the associated stamp duty and registration fees to encourage compliance.Failure to register a JDA can lead to significant legal complications:Legal Enforceability Issues: An unregistered JDA may not be legally enforceable, making it challenging to uphold its terms in a court of law.Admissibility Concerns: In legal disputes, an unregistered JDA may not be admissible as evidence, weakening any claims based on the agreement.Tax Implications: Unregistered agreements can result in unfavorable tax consequences, as certain tax benefits are contingent upon proper registration.Regulatory Non-Compliance: Non-registration may lead to non-compliance with state regulations, potentially resulting in legal penalties.Therefore, it is advisable to register the JDA to ensure its legal validity and enforceability.

Wait for the employer to raise concerns (if they find anything during verification).How to Explain if Asked:Keep the explanation professional:\"I am involved in personal family matters since 2021, including legal proceedings. These are civil and family disputes, with no convictions or arrests. I have High Court orders in my favor, including a stay on key cases. These matters do not impact my professional capabilities.\"Focus on your skills and commitment to the role.Criminal Record Checks:Since no FIRs have led to arrest or chargesheeted convictions, you can confidently state thatthere is no criminal record against you.Senior Position Considerations:For senior roles, companies value transparency. Be honestif askedbut do not elaborate unnecessarily.Steps to Ensure Smooth BGV:Cross-check personal records: Ensure no discrepancies in your background (e.g., PAN, Aadhar, or address).Obtain certified copies: Keep copies of High Court stay orders to provide clarification if needed.Be ready to explain: Prepare a clear, concise explanation of the situation focusing on professionalism.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.Hope you find the information helpful.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, being an NRI, and facing issues with respect to loan payment with ICICI Bank, you have made efforts to repay the loan through the NRILINK platform. However, the same does not work in your location, and as a result you mailed cheques that were rejected due to alleged signature mismatches. But the bank has failed to provide a resolution, resulting in a financial loss of ₹1 lakh per month for the past four months. This clearly constitutes a deficiency in service under theConsumer Protection Act, 2019. Additionally, under the Banking Ombudsman Scheme, 2006, you are entitled to complain on the matter for non-resolution within certain days of your complaint. However, to resolve this, you may complain on the issue to ICICI Bank’s NRI Grievance Redressal Cell, lodge a formal complaint with the Banking Ombudsman, and if required, may also file a complaint with the Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum, seeking compensation for the loss caused. Further, it is suggested that you maintain all the relevant documents and obtain written acknowledgment of your complaint.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Since the accused is required to appear in court although the FIR and charge sheet have been filed, you have some legal measures under the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) {previously,Code of Criminal Procedure(CrPC)}. According to section 227 of BNSS (previously, Section 204 of theCriminal Procedure Code), the magistrate may issue summons to the accused person. In the event that they do not show up after being called by the magistrate, you can ask the magistrate of get a warrant of arrest under Section 72 of BNSS (previously, Section 70 of CrPC). If an accused refuses to respond to or ignore the summons issued to them, you can apply for a bailable warrant under Section 90 of BNSS (previously, Section 87 of CrPC). If the accused fails to follow the direction of the court, the court may order for the arrest of the accused under Section 91 of BNSS (previously, Section 88 of theCriminal Procedure Code) or it may order for a non-bailable warrant. In case the magistrate fails to take proper action you can go to sessions court under Section 438 of BNSS (previously, Section 397 of CrPC) and ask for revision so as to ensure that the summons are enforced to compel the accused to appear. It is necessary to take records of all the hearings and stay in touch with your attorney to manage this process and achieve the goal of punishment for the accused.Hope this advice helps in solving your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, taking into consideration the Limitation Act, the time for recovering the money under the contract, would be 3 years from the time payment of the same becomes due. Herein, the decision of the arbitrator to treat the projects as four separately as each of the projects had different purchase orders, making the limitation period being applied project-wise. Additionally, the payments for the projects have been from the same bank account, and the argument for a consolidated claim may be evidenced with continual cause of action, thus, aiding in the extension of the limitation period. With respect to the MSME Act, the same provides for dispute resolution through the methods of arbitration and conciliation. But, excluding the claims of the arbitrator, for two projects specifies the procedural limitations present and thus, the expiration of the limitation period. However, to challenge this, it is suggested that you maintain all the relevant documents, including the contract, the purchase orders, relevant receipts etc. You may also appeal the decision under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, if you are not satisfied with the arbitrator's decision.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear ClientIn the Present Scenario, your housing association is going for redevelopment and you wish to enquire on which would be a better model for redevelopment. Further, your society consists of 36 flats presently, and for the redevelopment project, you have identified a builder as well, who says that, he would build 120 flats in total, out of which, 72 flats would be that of the owner. With respect to the first model, the entire UDS would be transferred to the builder, wherein most of the flats would be transferred to the builder, and the owners would list their holding in the land, affecting their capital gains and developing the property further. Furthermore, with the first model, you may have to pay long term capital gains tax, but on the other hand, you may benefit due to higher holding of flat ownership. With respect to the second model, the UDS would be divided with 60% being in favour of owners and rest 40% being allocated to the builder. Herein, the owners may retain a significant share of land, that would ensure benefit from long term appreciation of land value. However, looking into he details of both the models, the second model may be preferred as the same suggests long term gains, including advantage from land value appreciation, and less tax liabilities.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the disputeAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "In Tamil Nadu, the registration of a Joint Development Agreement (JDA) has been made mandatory by the state government. This move aims to bring clarity to landowners and developers by categorizing liabilities and setting time limits for construction projects. The state registration department has introduced laws to facilitate this process, eliminating the need for a power of attorney in such agreements.Risks of Not Registering the JDA:Legal Enforceability Issues:An unregistered JDA may face challenges in court regarding its enforceability. In the event of disputes, courts may not entertain unregistered agreements, making it difficult to enforce the terms outlined in the JDA.Admissibility Concerns:During legal proceedings, the admissibility of an unregistered JDA can be contested, potentially weakening your position in disputes.Tax Implications:Unregistered JDAs can lead to unfavorable tax consequences, as certain tax benefits and considerations are contingent upon proper registration.Regulatory Non-Compliance:Non-registration may result in non-compliance with state regulations, leading to potential legal penalties or complications in obtaining necessary approvals.Recommendation:Given the legal and practical implications, it is advisable to register the JDA to ensure its enforceability and to safeguard the interests of all parties involved. Consulting with a legal professional experienced in property law in Tamil Nadu is recommended to navigate the registration process and to address any specific concerns related to your redevelopment project.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.

    "question": "Please explain which is a better model for JDA",
    "answer": "In Tamil Nadu, the registration of Joint Development Agreements (JDAs) is mandatory. This requirement stems from the state's amendments to the Indian Stamp Act and the Registration Act, 1908, which mandate the registration of documents that create or assign rights in immovable property. Specifically, Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908, requires the registration of non-testamentary instruments that purport to create, declare, assign, limit, or extinguish any right, title, or interest in immovable property.A JDA typically assigns development rights from the landowner to the developer, thereby necessitating its registration to ensure legal enforceability. The Tamil Nadu government has emphasized this by mandating the registration of Joint Venture agreements and reducing the associated stamp duty and registration fees to encourage compliance.Failure to register a JDA can lead to significant legal complications:Legal Enforceability Issues: An unregistered JDA may not be legally enforceable, making it challenging to uphold its terms in a court of law.Admissibility Concerns: In legal disputes, an unregistered JDA may not be admissible as evidence, weakening any claims based on the agreement.Tax Implications: Unregistered agreements can result in unfavorable tax consequences, as certain tax benefits are contingent upon proper registration.Regulatory Non-Compliance: Non-registration may lead to non-compliance with state regulations, potentially resulting in legal penalties.Therefore, it is advisable to register the JDA to ensure its legal validity and enforceability.

In the event that they do not show up after being called by the magistrate, you can ask the magistrate of get a warrant of arrest under Section 72 of BNSS (previously, Section 70 of CrPC). If an accused refuses to respond to or ignore the summons issued to them, you can apply for a bailable warrant under Section 90 of BNSS (previously, Section 87 of CrPC). If the accused fails to follow the direction of the court, the court may order for the arrest of the accused under Section 91 of BNSS (previously, Section 88 of theCriminal Procedure Code) or it may order for a non-bailable warrant. In case the magistrate fails to take proper action you can go to sessions court under Section 438 of BNSS (previously, Section 397 of CrPC) and ask for revision so as to ensure that the summons are enforced to compel the accused to appear.

This is only by way of a ballpark estimate.you must understand that Courts are highly unpredictable and with the heavy backlog of cases it becomes all the more difficult to get a sooner listing, except in cases of extreme urgencyi would like to see the order by which the LOC was issued against youit is unfortunate that the first lawyer used abusive language [assuming that to be correct]. It is very unprofessional and derogatory of the profession.most likely your petition will be listed in due course for hearing. If you wish it to be listed sooner you will have to give compelling reasons for a sooner listing.making general statements that you need to visit your elderly parents and you can no longer delay your visit to them, will not work.Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

No court at the stage of FIR and when investigation is pending quash such FIR so your step in approaching HC is not been properly advised. Judges are not on sale but some lawyers are involved in such gimmicks to make easy money. Details and FIR etc. are required to be examined in order to ascertain the facts and to explore possible remedies. Issue of aged parents is also to be taken care of thoroughly. Prima facie case does not seem to be made out against hem, however, it could be ascertained only on examination of facts and documents and complaints etc.   Duty of lawyer is to represent his client in court with all diligence, sincerity but no lawyer can give guarantee quashing or disposal of case within fix timeframe.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, taking into consideration the Limitation Act, the time for recovering the money under the contract, would be 3 years from the time payment of the same becomes due. Herein, the decision of the arbitrator to treat the projects as four separately as each of the projects had different purchase orders, making the limitation period being applied project-wise. Additionally, the payments for the projects have been from the same bank account, and the argument for a consolidated claim may be evidenced with continual cause of action, thus, aiding in the extension of the limitation period. With respect to the MSME Act, the same provides for dispute resolution through the methods of arbitration and conciliation. But, excluding the claims of the arbitrator, for two projects specifies the procedural limitations present and thus, the expiration of the limitation period. However, to challenge this, it is suggested that you maintain all the relevant documents, including the contract, the purchase orders, relevant receipts etc. You may also appeal the decision under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, if you are not satisfied with the arbitrator's decision.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Further, your society consists of 36 flats presently, and for the redevelopment project, you have identified a builder as well, who says that, he would build 120 flats in total, out of which, 72 flats would be that of the owner. With respect to the first model, the entire UDS would be transferred to the builder, wherein most of the flats would be transferred to the builder, and the owners would list their holding in the land, affecting their capital gains and developing the property further. Furthermore, with the first model, you may have to pay long term capital gains tax, but on the other hand, you may benefit due to higher holding of flat ownership. With respect to the second model, the UDS would be divided with 60% being in favour of owners and rest 40% being allocated to the builder. Herein, the owners may retain a significant share of land, that would ensure benefit from long term appreciation of land value. However, looking into he details of both the models, the second model may be preferred as the same suggests long term gains, including advantage from land value appreciation, and less tax liabilities.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the disputeAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Please explain which is a better model for JDA",
    "answer": "In Tamil Nadu, the registration of a Joint Development Agreement (JDA) has been made mandatory by the state government. This move aims to bring clarity to landowners and developers by categorizing liabilities and setting time limits for construction projects. The state registration department has introduced laws to facilitate this process, eliminating the need for a power of attorney in such agreements.Risks of Not Registering the JDA:Legal Enforceability Issues:An unregistered JDA may face challenges in court regarding its enforceability. In the event of disputes, courts may not entertain unregistered agreements, making it difficult to enforce the terms outlined in the JDA.Admissibility Concerns:During legal proceedings, the admissibility of an unregistered JDA can be contested, potentially weakening your position in disputes.Tax Implications:Unregistered JDAs can lead to unfavorable tax consequences, as certain tax benefits and considerations are contingent upon proper registration.Regulatory Non-Compliance:Non-registration may result in non-compliance with state regulations, leading to potential legal penalties or complications in obtaining necessary approvals.Recommendation:Given the legal and practical implications, it is advisable to register the JDA to ensure its enforceability and to safeguard the interests of all parties involved. Consulting with a legal professional experienced in property law in Tamil Nadu is recommended to navigate the registration process and to address any specific concerns related to your redevelopment project.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.

    "question": "Please explain which is a better model for JDA",
    "answer": "In Tamil Nadu, the registration of Joint Development Agreements (JDAs) is mandatory. This requirement stems from the state's amendments to the Indian Stamp Act and the Registration Act, 1908, which mandate the registration of documents that create or assign rights in immovable property. Specifically, Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908, requires the registration of non-testamentary instruments that purport to create, declare, assign, limit, or extinguish any right, title, or interest in immovable property.A JDA typically assigns development rights from the landowner to the developer, thereby necessitating its registration to ensure legal enforceability. The Tamil Nadu government has emphasized this by mandating the registration of Joint Venture agreements and reducing the associated stamp duty and registration fees to encourage compliance.Failure to register a JDA can lead to significant legal complications:Legal Enforceability Issues: An unregistered JDA may not be legally enforceable, making it challenging to uphold its terms in a court of law.Admissibility Concerns: In legal disputes, an unregistered JDA may not be admissible as evidence, weakening any claims based on the agreement.Tax Implications: Unregistered agreements can result in unfavorable tax consequences, as certain tax benefits are contingent upon proper registration.Regulatory Non-Compliance: Non-registration may lead to non-compliance with state regulations, potentially resulting in legal penalties.Therefore, it is advisable to register the JDA to ensure its legal validity and enforceability. Consulting with a legal professional experienced in property law in Tamil Nadu is recommended to navigate the registration process and address any specific concerns related to your redevelopment project.Shubham GoyalAdvocate, Delhi1186 Answers7 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shubham Goyal"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, your brother cannot claim ownership of the house because he is living there, as the property was validly transferred to you via a registered gift deed under the Registration Act, 1908 and theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, making you the legal owner. Mere possession or use does not confer ownership. Furthermore, any money your brother spends on maintaining the property does not give him any legal rights, as voluntary maintenance expenses without an agreement are classified as gratuitous under the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and at most, he could seek reimbursement for the same. However, to prevent future disputes, you can formalize his stay through a leave and license agreement, ensuring it is clear that his occupancy is at your discretion and does not grant ownership rights. Additionally, you may also communicate this in writing that maintenance contributions are voluntary and do not affect your title.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you may consider the Indian Contract Act, 1872, under which, the failure of the purchaser to pay the full amount within one month, as agreed in the registered Agreement to Sale, constitutes a breach of contract. While this breach makes the purchaser liable, the agreement remains valid until formally cancelled or declared void. Furthermore, according to theTransfer of Property Act, 1882,an Agreement to Sale does not transfer ownership but creates a contractual obligation, meaning selling the property to another buyer without cancelling the first agreement could expose you to a legal action. However, to proceed further with this, you may send a legal notice to the first buyer citing the breach, and demanding cancellation of the agreement. However, if he continues to delay, you can take the initiative to draft a cancellation deed, clearly stating whether you intend to refund or forfeit the advance payment of ₹1. In case of non-compliance or not co-operating to any of your actions, you may file a suit under the Specific Relief Act, 1963,seeking a declaration that the agreement is void due to non-performance.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Understanding Background Verification (BGV):IT MNCs usually check criminal records, employment history, and other public data.Since you haveno convictions or arrests, pending cases are unlikely to appear unless the company conducts in-depth manual checks.Proactive vs. Reactive Approach:Proactive (if asked explicitly): If the job application or BGV form asks about ongoing legal cases, disclose them briefly but emphasize:No convictions or arrests.Stay orders granted in your favor by the High Court.Reactive: If not asked directly, do not disclose proactively. Wait for the employer to raise concerns (if they find anything during verification).How to Explain if Asked:Keep the explanation professional:\"I am involved in personal family matters since 2021, including legal proceedings. These are civil and family disputes, with no convictions or arrests. I have High Court orders in my favor, including a stay on key cases.

Constructing an additional toilet is permissible if it does not pose a safety risk, and you have already obtained an architect's approval confirming its feasibility. Herein, the Apartment Owners’ Association, under the Karnataka Apartment Ownership Act, 1972, cannot arbitrarily deny permission without substantiated technical reasons. Their concerns regarding load-bearing or water seepage must be validated by an expert, which they have so far failed to arrange. To proceed further, it is suggested that, you send a formal written request to the association, including your architect’s approval and assurances of safety, to appoint their own expert for verification within a reasonable deadline. If they remain unresponsive or deny the request without considering or providing any evidence, you may approach the Bangalore Municipal Corporation or any other independent structural engineer for approval. You may also consider filing a complaint with the Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum for undue inconvenience or financial loss.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. It is a settled law by Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Nanjegowda (D) by L.Rs. and Ors. Vs. Ramegowda that there can be no adverse possession among the members of one family for want of any animus among them over the land belonging to their family.Further, only by maintaining the property he doesn't become the owner and no legal right would arise.In case, the dispute arises within the family then he would try to grab the property.Therefore, detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Shri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "question": "House property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, your brother cannot claim ownership of the house because he is living there, as the property was validly transferred to you via a registered gift deed under the Registration Act, 1908 and theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, making you the legal owner. Mere possession or use does not confer ownership. Furthermore, any money your brother spends on maintaining the property does not give him any legal rights, as voluntary maintenance expenses without an agreement are classified as gratuitous under the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and at most, he could seek reimbursement for the same. However, to prevent future disputes, you can formalize his stay through a leave and license agreement, ensuring it is clear that his occupancy is at your discretion and does not grant ownership rights. Additionally, you may also communicate this in writing that maintenance contributions are voluntary and do not affect your title.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Understanding Background Verification (BGV):IT MNCs usually check criminal records, employment history, and other public data.Since you haveno convictions or arrests, pending cases are unlikely to appear unless the company conducts in-depth manual checks.Proactive vs. Reactive Approach:Proactive (if asked explicitly): If the job application or BGV form asks about ongoing legal cases, disclose them briefly but emphasize:No convictions or arrests.Stay orders granted in your favor by the High Court.Reactive: If not asked directly, do not disclose proactively. Wait for the employer to raise concerns (if they find anything during verification).How to Explain if Asked:Keep the explanation professional:\"I am involved in personal family matters since 2021, including legal proceedings. These are civil and family disputes, with no convictions or arrests. I have High Court orders in my favor, including a stay on key cases. These matters do not impact my professional capabilities.\"Focus on your skills and commitment to the role.Criminal Record Checks:Since no FIRs have led to arrest or chargesheeted convictions, you can confidently state thatthere is no criminal record against you.Senior Position Considerations:For senior roles, companies value transparency. Be honestif askedbut do not elaborate unnecessarily.Steps to Ensure Smooth BGV:Cross-check personal records: Ensure no discrepancies in your background (e.g., PAN, Aadhar, or address).Obtain certified copies: Keep copies of High Court stay orders to provide clarification if needed.Be ready to explain: Prepare a clear, concise explanation of the situation focusing on professionalism.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.Hope you find the information helpful.

Further, the Power of Attorney should be precise, mentioning the purpose, land description, the authority granted, and an irrevocability clause so as to ensure it remains effective until partition is completed. Further, the same must also adhere to the state-specific stamp duty laws and be registered with a Sub-Registrar, generally in the same district where the land is located. Besides, the partition deed, once executed, will not affect the future value of the land if registered correctly, provided it clearly demarcates the boundaries, extent, and allocation of land and is final and binding, with no encumbrances. However, it is suggested that, you maintain all the land records, and the requirements are complied with under the relevant laws.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Home loan document collection",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, a loan of 4 crores was taken with two applicants Namrata, and Benod, on September 2020. Namrata was the primary applicant and the single registered owner has contributed to the loan fully. On November 2024, the Primary applicant Namrata had paid the loan in full and, Benod the secondary applicant, did not contribute at all. Your query is whether a NOC is required from Benod. Herein, generally, HDFC Bank does not require a NOC, from the secondary applicant, for closing the loan, as Namrata, the primary applicant and sole registered owner of the property, has fully repaid the ₹4 crore loan. However, under the Indian Contract Act, since both are applicants, both are jointly and severally liable for the loan. But, once the loan is repaid, Benod’s liability ceases. Further, the status of co-applicant in the loan does not grant ownership rights to the property, that remains solely with Namrata, also as reflected in the registration documents. Therefore, since Benod has neither contributed to the loan repayment, not does he/she holds any legal rights over the property, HDFC Bank should release the property documents and issue a Loan Closure Certificate based solely on Namrata’s request and proof of repayment.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Giving such assurances or guarantee is itself unprofessional and amounts to professional misconduct. Ideally an advocate can only give a tentative timeline to the client within which his case would be adjudicated by the Court. This is only by way of a ballpark estimate.you must understand that Courts are highly unpredictable and with the heavy backlog of cases it becomes all the more difficult to get a sooner listing, except in cases of extreme urgencyi would like to see the order by which the LOC was issued against youit is unfortunate that the first lawyer used abusive language [assuming that to be correct].

Mere possession or use does not confer ownership. Furthermore, any money your brother spends on maintaining the property does not give him any legal rights, as voluntary maintenance expenses without an agreement are classified as gratuitous under the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and at most, he could seek reimbursement for the same.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you have some shops in a Society, in Kalyan West Maharashtra. With respect to this, you have asked a few queries. Firstly, with respect to the query as to whether it is compulsory to inform the society before giving the shop on rent, under the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, and its related bye-laws, it is generally required that, an information must be given in writing to the society, on renting out your shop, which would ensure that there is a tenant verification performed, and security compliance is also present. With respect to the second query, usually no permission is required specifically for doing any internal work within your shop, but if it affects the common areas of the society in any way, or such installations are carried out that are visible to the outer society, a written information to be given is suggested. with respect to your third query, usually police verification is necessary for everyone regardless of their membership in the society. With respect to your fourth query, society notices are generally sent through the registered address provided in the relevant documents. However, if such address was obtained unlawfully without you providing such information to send notices, the same may be brought to the society's attention. With respect to your fifth query, a society cannot recommend the cancellation of your membership in a unilateral way for the reason of not providing tenant verification, especially if a tenant is already the member of the society. With respect to your sixth query, in general terms, a society cannot charge for the work that was conducted within your shop unless the same impacts the common areas of the society. With respect to your last query, the society may write to the municipal corporation or police for such issues including security concerns, or violation of any laws that were set, but however, such complaints must be properly substantiated with the relevant reasons.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Understanding Background Verification (BGV):IT MNCs usually check criminal records, employment history, and other public data.Since you haveno convictions or arrests, pending cases are unlikely to appear unless the company conducts in-depth manual checks.Proactive vs. Reactive Approach:Proactive (if asked explicitly): If the job application or BGV form asks about ongoing legal cases, disclose them briefly but emphasize:No convictions or arrests.Stay orders granted in your favor by the High Court.Reactive: If not asked directly, do not disclose proactively. Wait for the employer to raise concerns (if they find anything during verification).How to Explain if Asked:Keep the explanation professional:\"I am involved in personal family matters since 2021, including legal proceedings. These are civil and family disputes, with no convictions or arrests. I have High Court orders in my favor, including a stay on key cases. These matters do not impact my professional capabilities.\"Focus on your skills and commitment to the role.Criminal Record Checks:Since no FIRs have led to arrest or chargesheeted convictions, you can confidently state thatthere is no criminal record against you.Senior Position Considerations:For senior roles, companies value transparency. Be honestif askedbut do not elaborate unnecessarily.Steps to Ensure Smooth BGV:Cross-check personal records: Ensure no discrepancies in your background (e.g., PAN, Aadhar, or address).Obtain certified copies: Keep copies of High Court stay orders to provide clarification if needed.Be ready to explain: Prepare a clear, concise explanation of the situation focusing on professionalism.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.Hope you find the information helpful.

Na was the primary applicant and the single registered owner has contributed to the loan fully. On November 2024, the Primary applicant Na had paid the loan in full and, Be the secondary applicant, did not contribute at all. Your query is whether a NOC is required from Be. Herein, generally, HDFC Bank does not require a NOC, from the secondary applicant, for closing the loan, as Na, the primary applicant and sole registered owner of the property, has fully repaid the ₹4 crore loan. However, under the Indian Contract Act, since both are applicants, both are jointly and severally liable for the loan. But, once the loan is repaid, Be's liability ceases. Further, the status of co-applicant in the loan does not grant ownership rights to the property, that remains solely with Na, also as reflected in the registration documents. Therefore, since Be has neither contributed to the loan repayment, not does he/she holds any legal rights over the property, HDFC Bank should release the property documents and issue a Loan Closure Certificate based solely on Na’s request and proof of repayment.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you have some shops in a Society, in Kalyan West Maharashtra. With respect to this, you have asked a few queries. Firstly, with respect to the query as to whether it is compulsory to inform the society before giving the shop on rent, under the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, and its related bye-laws, it is generally required that, an information must be given in writing to the society, on renting out your shop, which would ensure that there is a tenant verification performed, and security compliance is also present. With respect to the second query, usually no permission is required specifically for doing any internal work within your shop, but if it affects the common areas of the society in any way, or such installations are carried out that are visible to the outer society, a written information to be given is suggested. with respect to your third query, usually police verification is necessary for everyone regardless of their membership in the society. With respect to your fourth query, society notices are generally sent through the registered address provided in the relevant documents. However, if such address was obtained unlawfully without you providing such information to send notices, the same may be brought to the society's attention. With respect to your fifth query, a society cannot recommend the cancellation of your membership in a unilateral way for the reason of not providing tenant verification, especially if a tenant is already the member of the society. With respect to your sixth query, in general terms, a society cannot charge for the work that was conducted within your shop unless the same impacts the common areas of the society. With respect to your last query, the society may write to the municipal corporation or police for such issues including security concerns, or violation of any laws that were set, but however, such complaints must be properly substantiated with the relevant reasons.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, being an NRI, and facing issues with respect to loan payment with ICICI Bank, you have made efforts to repay the loan through the NRILINK platform. However, the same does not work in your location, and as a result you mailed cheques that were rejected due to alleged signature mismatches. But the bank has failed to provide a resolution, resulting in a financial loss of ₹1 lakh per month for the past four months. This clearly constitutes a deficiency in service under theConsumer Protection Act, 2019. Additionally, under the Banking Ombudsman Scheme, 2006, you are entitled to complain on the matter for non-resolution within certain days of your complaint. However, to resolve this, you may complain on the issue to ICICI Bank’s NRI Grievance Redressal Cell, lodge a formal complaint with the Banking Ombudsman, and if required, may also file a complaint with the Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum, seeking compensation for the loss caused.

On November 2024, the Primary applicant Na had paid the loan in full and, Be the secondary applicant, did not contribute at all. Your query is whether a NOC is required from Be. Herein, generally, HDFC Bank does not require a NOC, from the secondary applicant, for closing the loan, as Na, the primary applicant and sole registered owner of the property, has fully repaid the ₹4 crore loan. However, under the Indian Contract Act, since both are applicants, both are jointly and severally liable for the loan. But, once the loan is repaid, Be's liability ceases. Further, the status of co-applicant in the loan does not grant ownership rights to the property, that remains solely with Na, also as reflected in the registration documents.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, since there are no convictions or arrests against you and the High Court of Karnataka has granted an interim stay on the 498A FIR andDomestic Violencecase, such disputes remain allegations and cannot legally disqualify you from employment unless the company explicitly states against such stance. You may emphasize on the same, during the background verification process, by stating the ongoing family disputes, and highlighting the High Court's stay and absence of any police action. However, it is suggested that you mentally be prepared for providing the requisite documents, including the copies of stay order, proof of no arrests made by Police, and visitation rights granted by the court. You may also obtain a police case status certificate showing no convictions. And further, since usually MNCs require the consent for no criminal cases lodged, it is suggested that you remain honest, show the court records, and other aspects relevant to the case.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Understanding Background Verification (BGV):IT MNCs usually check criminal records, employment history, and other public data.Since you haveno convictions or arrests, pending cases are unlikely to appear unless the company conducts in-depth manual checks.Proactive vs. Reactive Approach:Proactive (if asked explicitly): If the job application or BGV form asks about ongoing legal cases, disclose them briefly but emphasize:No convictions or arrests.Stay orders granted in your favor by the High Court.Reactive: If not asked directly, do not disclose proactively. Wait for the employer to raise concerns (if they find anything during verification).How to Explain if Asked:Keep the explanation professional:\"I am involved in personal family matters since 2021, including legal proceedings. These are civil and family disputes, with no convictions or arrests. I have High Court orders in my favor, including a stay on key cases. These matters do not impact my professional capabilities.\"Focus on your skills and commitment to the role.Criminal Record Checks:Since no FIRs have led to arrest or chargesheeted convictions, you can confidently state thatthere is no criminal record against you.Senior Position Considerations:For senior roles, companies value transparency. Be honestif askedbut do not elaborate unnecessarily.Steps to Ensure Smooth BGV:Cross-check personal records: Ensure no discrepancies in your background (e.g., PAN, Aadhar, or address).Obtain certified copies: Keep copies of High Court stay orders to provide clarification if needed.Be ready to explain: Prepare a clear, concise explanation of the situation focusing on professionalism.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.Hope you find the information helpful.

    "question": "Brother asking for property will was written",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, the property has been registered in your mother's name, making her the legal owner of the property, regardless of the fact that your father funded its purchase, as per the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, which allows such transactions between spouses. No, since your mother has written a valid will bequeathing the property to you, upon her death, it should transfer to you as per the Indian Succession Act, 1925, provided the will is properly executed, in accordance to the Indian Legal Framework. Herein, your brother's claim of co-ownership does not have strength unless he can prove the will invalid, your mother’s lack of mental capacity when it was executed, or establish that your father has a joint interest overriding the will. However, if your father's consent is required here, for any of the legal formalities, you may defend the same by granting a medical certificate of his condition. In the event of your mother’s death, you should probate the will in court to establish its validity, and in case your brother files a suit, the case would mostly fall under theHindu Succession Act, 1956.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Besides, the partition deed, once executed, will not affect the future value of the land if registered correctly, provided it clearly demarcates the boundaries, extent, and allocation of land and is final and binding, with no encumbrances. However, it is suggested that, you maintain all the land records, and the requirements are complied with under the relevant laws.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Wait for the employer to raise concerns (if they find anything during verification).How to Explain if Asked:Keep the explanation professional:\"I am involved in personal family matters since 2021, including legal proceedings. These are civil and family disputes, with no convictions or arrests. I have High Court orders in my favor, including a stay on key cases. These matters do not impact my professional capabilities.\"Focus on your skills and commitment to the role.Criminal Record Checks:Since no FIRs have led to arrest or chargesheeted convictions, you can confidently state thatthere is no criminal record against you.Senior Position Considerations:For senior roles, companies value transparency. Be honestif askedbut do not elaborate unnecessarily.Steps to Ensure Smooth BGV:Cross-check personal records: Ensure no discrepancies in your background (e.g., PAN, Aadhar, or address).Obtain certified copies: Keep copies of High Court stay orders to provide clarification if needed.Be ready to explain: Prepare a clear, concise explanation of the situation focusing on professionalism.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.Hope you find the information helpful.

    "answer": "Understanding Background Verification (BGV):IT MNCs usually check criminal records, employment history, and other public data.Since you haveno convictions or arrests, pending cases are unlikely to appear unless the company conducts in-depth manual checks.Proactive vs. Reactive Approach:Proactive (if asked explicitly): If the job application or BGV form asks about ongoing legal cases, disclose them briefly but emphasize:No convictions or arrests.Stay orders granted in your favor by the High Court.Reactive: If not asked directly, do not disclose proactively. Wait for the employer to raise concerns (if they find anything during verification).How to Explain if Asked:Keep the explanation professional:\"I am involved in personal family matters since 2021, including legal proceedings. These are civil and family disputes, with no convictions or arrests. I have High Court orders in my favor, including a stay on key cases. These matters do not impact my professional capabilities.\"Focus on your skills and commitment to the role.Criminal Record Checks:Since no FIRs have led to arrest or chargesheeted convictions, you can confidently state thatthere is no criminal record against you.Senior Position Considerations:For senior roles, companies value transparency. Be honestif askedbut do not elaborate unnecessarily.Steps to Ensure Smooth BGV:Cross-check personal records: Ensure no discrepancies in your background (e.g., PAN, Aadhar, or address).Obtain certified copies: Keep copies of High Court stay orders to provide clarification if needed.Be ready to explain: Prepare a clear, concise explanation of the situation focusing on professionalism.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.Hope you find the information helpful.

    "question": "Brother asking for property will was written",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, the property has been registered in your mother's name, making her the legal owner of the property, regardless of the fact that your father funded its purchase, as per the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, which allows such transactions between spouses. No, since your mother has written a valid will bequeathing the property to you, upon her death, it should transfer to you as per the Indian Succession Act, 1925, provided the will is properly executed, in accordance to the Indian Legal Framework. Herein, your brother's claim of co-ownership does not have strength unless he can prove the will invalid, your mother’s lack of mental capacity when it was executed, or establish that your father has a joint interest overriding the will. However, if your father's consent is required here, for any of the legal formalities, you may defend the same by granting a medical certificate of his condition. In the event of your mother’s death, you should probate the will in court to establish its validity, and in case your brother files a suit, the case would mostly fall under theHindu Succession Act, 1956.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Back dated increment in rent without agreement.",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, the landlord does not seem to be having a valid legal basis for demanding backdated rent increments. Herein, since the leave and license agreement expired after the initial 11 months, and further there was no renewal, your tenancy is seen to be continued on a month-to-month basis, with the same terms unless anything else has been mutually agreed upon. In India, the Rent Control Act typically governs such tenancies. While you raised the rent in the previous years, the landlord cannot demand unreasonable increases without prior agreement for the same. Moreover, the threat of legal action for unauthorized occupation cannot stay as you have been diligently paying rent every month, and no legal eviction notice has been provided for the same. Thus, the landlord's demand for a sudden large increment may not be enforceable unless specifically mentioned in a renewal or agreement. However, it is suggested that you maintain all the required documentation and you may also request for a written agreement to clarify the terms of the continued tenancy.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "PCC and DV",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, the Police Clearance Certificate (PCC) usually shows whether there are any criminal cases or investigations against you. However, if there is no FIR or criminal case, the PCC usually indicates that there are no adverse police records though the police may still be aware of adomestic violencecase through Non-Cognizable records or investigation reports, as DV cases may not always result in an FIR but can still be investigated informally. Further, Police usually do not have access to court records, but if adomestic violencecase was filed, the police may be involved in the preliminary stages of investigation. But, if your wife withdrew the case, the PCC would generally reflect that the case was dismissed or disposed of, without explicitly stating it was withdrawn, indicating that there are no ongoing investigations. With respect to the false acquisitions made, you may file a criminal defamation case. Further, usually, political influences do not affect the PCC, as it reflects the factual details. Also, if your wife wrongly included your mother in theDomestic Violencecase that was later dismissed, you may pursue criminal action against her.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "A case for malicious prosecution can be filed in the court that has jurisdiction over the area where the wrong was committed.Malicious prosecution is a legal action that can be taken against someone who abuses the court process by wrongfully starting a lawsuit. The essential elements of malicious prosecution are:The defendant acted maliciouslyThe defendant had no reasonable or probable causeThe plaintiff was harmed as a result of the prosecutionThe proceedings ended in the plaintiff's favorThe main difference between claims based on criminal and civil actions has to do with evidence. A claim based on malicious criminal prosecution might allege damages for mental suffering. Here, a plaintiff might not need to provide proof in the form of verifiable economic damages. But for claims based on civil actions, the plaintiff must be able to prove quantifiable damages.A client relationship with a personal injury lawyer means you'll have the legal advice you need to pursue damages."

Wait for the employer to raise concerns (if they find anything during verification).How to Explain if Asked:Keep the explanation professional:\"I am involved in personal family matters since 2021, including legal proceedings. These are civil and family disputes, with no convictions or arrests. I have High Court orders in my favor, including a stay on key cases. These matters do not impact my professional capabilities.\"Focus on your skills and commitment to the role.Criminal Record Checks:Since no FIRs have led to arrest or chargesheeted convictions, you can confidently state thatthere is no criminal record against you.Senior Position Considerations:For senior roles, companies value transparency. Be honestif askedbut do not elaborate unnecessarily.Steps to Ensure Smooth BGV:Cross-check personal records: Ensure no discrepancies in your background (e.g., PAN, Aadhar, or address).Obtain certified copies: Keep copies of High Court stay orders to provide clarification if needed.Be ready to explain: Prepare a clear, concise explanation of the situation focusing on professionalism.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.Hope you find the information helpful.

However, if your father's consent is required here, for any of the legal formalities, you may defend the same by granting a medical certificate of his condition.

Further, the Power of Attorney should be precise, mentioning the purpose, land description, the authority granted, and an irrevocability clause so as to ensure it remains effective until partition is completed. Further, the same must also adhere to the state-specific stamp duty laws and be registered with a Sub-Registrar, generally in the same district where the land is located. Besides, the partition deed, once executed, will not affect the future value of the land if registered correctly, provided it clearly demarcates the boundaries, extent, and allocation of land and is final and binding, with no encumbrances. However, it is suggested that, you maintain all the land records, and the requirements are complied with under the relevant laws.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "PCC and DV",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, the Police Clearance Certificate (PCC) usually shows whether there are any criminal cases or investigations against you. However, if there is no FIR or criminal case, the PCC usually indicates that there are no adverse police records though the police may still be aware of adomestic violencecase through Non-Cognizable records or investigation reports, as DV cases may not always result in an FIR but can still be investigated informally. Further, Police usually do not have access to court records, but if adomestic violencecase was filed, the police may be involved in the preliminary stages of investigation. But, if your wife withdrew the case, the PCC would generally reflect that the case was dismissed or disposed of, without explicitly stating it was withdrawn, indicating that there are no ongoing investigations. With respect to the false acquisitions made, you may file a criminal defamation case. Further, usually, political influences do not affect the PCC, as it reflects the factual details. Also, if your wife wrongly included your mother in theDomestic Violencecase that was later dismissed, you may pursue criminal action against her.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

A claim based on malicious criminal prosecution might allege damages for mental suffering. Here, a plaintiff might not need to provide proof in the form of verifiable economic damages. But for claims based on civil actions, the plaintiff must be able to prove quantifiable damages.A client relationship with a personal injury lawyer means you'll have the legal advice you need to pursue damages."

It's actually a civil dispute having a criminal overtoneYou need to check the loan agreement as to what was agreed thereinWhen any EMI is outstanding and not paid by the borrower before the due date the lender is given the right to recall the entire loan and require the borrower to pay the full amount which is what the bank seems to have done by encashing the security cheque by entering therein the full outstanding amountThis cannot be called abuse of the process of the lawIt is merely trying to recover the dues by following the due process of lawEven if the security cheques are not mentioned in the loan agreement,  it doesn't matter.The fact that you gave security cheques to the bank is sufficient reason that the cheque were given by you not by exercise of any force or pressure. That was a part of the loan transactionIt does not also matter if the cheques were given in 2015 so long as they were undated and have not become stale.138 is always invoked to recover a legally enforceable debt. Now though the cheques were merely for security,  the moment you defaulted in the EMI payment, the loan became a legally enforceable debt and the cheque ceased to be security chequeYou won't achieve anything by filing any PIL.

The bank has a legal right to proceed against a defaulting borrower under Sec-138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, if a cheques issued by the borrower is returned unpaid for insufficient funds in the account. It is entirely within the bank's discretion to dispose off the security.4.

    "answer": "No Agreement: Without a valid agreement, backdated rent increment is unenforceable.Legal Action: As you’ve paid rent consistently, the landlord's claim of \"unauthorised occupation\" is weak.Negotiate: Propose a reasonable increment to settle the dispute amicably.Keep Records: Save proof of rent payments and all communication.Legal Support: If served a notice, consult a tenancy lawyer.Future Step: Suggest signing a new agreement to avoid disputes.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.Hope you find the information helpful.

    "question": "Back dated increment in rent without agreement.",
    "answer": "- As per law, in the absence of a  leave and license agreement , the tenancy will termed as month to month basis.- Since, there is no agreement now , hence you are not bound to the terms and conditions of an expired agreement.- Hence, the landlord cannot ask for an increment rent for the compliance of an expired  leave and license agreement.- Further, if you are paying the rent regularly , then your possession cannot be considered as unauthorized.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Back dated increment in rent without agreement.",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, the landlord does not seem to be having a valid legal basis for demanding backdated rent increments. Herein, since the leave and license agreement expired after the initial 11 months, and further there was no renewal, your tenancy is seen to be continued on a month-to-month basis, with the same terms unless anything else has been mutually agreed upon. In India, the Rent Control Act typically governs such tenancies. While you raised the rent in the previous years, the landlord cannot demand unreasonable increases without prior agreement for the same. Moreover, the threat of legal action for unauthorized occupation cannot stay as you have been diligently paying rent every month, and no legal eviction notice has been provided for the same. Thus, the landlord's demand for a sudden large increment may not be enforceable unless specifically mentioned in a renewal or agreement. However, it is suggested that you maintain all the required documentation and you may also request for a written agreement to clarify the terms of the continued tenancy.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Buyer postponing cancellation deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you may consider the Indian Contract Act, 1872, under which, the failure of the purchaser to pay the full amount within one month, as agreed in the registered Agreement to Sale, constitutes a breach of contract. While this breach makes the purchaser liable, the agreement remains valid until formally cancelled or declared void. Furthermore, according to theTransfer of Property Act, 1882,an Agreement to Sale does not transfer ownership but creates a contractual obligation, meaning selling the property to another buyer without cancelling the first agreement could expose you to a legal action. However, to proceed further with this, you may send a legal notice to the first buyer citing the breach, and demanding cancellation of the agreement. However, if he continues to delay, you can take the initiative to draft a cancellation deed, clearly stating whether you intend to refund or forfeit the advance payment of ₹1. In case of non-compliance or not co-operating to any of your actions, you may file a suit under the Specific Relief Act, 1963,seeking a declaration that the agreement is void due to non-performance.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, the tenancy agreement for the non-residential property was signed in June 1992 for a period of 10 years and expired in May 2002. Herein, the tenant continued paying rent during the agreement period, but an eviction notice was served in 2012, which the tenant acknowledged. The original tenant passed away in March 2019, and presently, in 2024, the tenant’s grandson occupied the property with force, and without any legal authority. Under the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1997 (WBPTA), tenancy rights can only be inherited by specific heirs who reside with the tenant at the time of their death, and here, the grandchildren are excluded unless proven to be dependent at the time of death. Here, since the tenancy agreement expired in 2002, and the grand child does not qualify as a tenant under WBPTA, his continued occupation is unauthorised. For the same, legal action may be taken by filing a complaint/eviction suit, and theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, citing the expiration of the tenancy and lack of legal authority. Additionally, a claim for mesne profits may be made for illegal occupation.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Because the tenancy agreement expired in 2002 and none of the present occupants is covered by the definition of a tenant as defined in the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1997 (WBPTA), their occupation is illegal. The eviction notice of 2012 and accepted by the first tenant would strengthen your case. The latest judgments of the Supreme Court relating to Section 2(g) of WBPTA, 1997 would override the Act but that would not be adverse to your case since the tenancy rights of the current occupant are illegal. You may even seek mesne profits for the period for which the property was illegally occupied during this period.

    "question": "PCC and DV",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, the Police Clearance Certificate (PCC) usually shows whether there are any criminal cases or investigations against you. However, if there is no FIR or criminal case, the PCC usually indicates that there are no adverse police records though the police may still be aware of adomestic violencecase through Non-Cognizable records or investigation reports, as DV cases may not always result in an FIR but can still be investigated informally. Further, Police usually do not have access to court records, but if adomestic violencecase was filed, the police may be involved in the preliminary stages of investigation. But, if your wife withdrew the case, the PCC would generally reflect that the case was dismissed or disposed of, without explicitly stating it was withdrawn, indicating that there are no ongoing investigations. With respect to the false acquisitions made, you may file a criminal defamation case. Further, usually, political influences do not affect the PCC, as it reflects the factual details. Also, if your wife wrongly included your mother in theDomestic Violencecase that was later dismissed, you may pursue criminal action against her.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "A case for malicious prosecution can be filed in the court that has jurisdiction over the area where the wrong was committed.Malicious prosecution is a legal action that can be taken against someone who abuses the court process by wrongfully starting a lawsuit. The essential elements of malicious prosecution are:The defendant acted maliciouslyThe defendant had no reasonable or probable causeThe plaintiff was harmed as a result of the prosecutionThe proceedings ended in the plaintiff's favorThe main difference between claims based on criminal and civil actions has to do with evidence. A claim based on malicious criminal prosecution might allege damages for mental suffering. Here, a plaintiff might not need to provide proof in the form of verifiable economic damages. But for claims based on civil actions, the plaintiff must be able to prove quantifiable damages.A client relationship with a personal injury lawyer means you'll have the legal advice you need to pursue damages."

    "question": "Back dated increment in rent without agreement.",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, the landlord does not seem to be having a valid legal basis for demanding backdated rent increments. Herein, since the leave and license agreement expired after the initial 11 months, and further there was no renewal, your tenancy is seen to be continued on a month-to-month basis, with the same terms unless anything else has been mutually agreed upon. In India, the Rent Control Act typically governs such tenancies. While you raised the rent in the previous years, the landlord cannot demand unreasonable increases without prior agreement for the same. Moreover, the threat of legal action for unauthorized occupation cannot stay as you have been diligently paying rent every month, and no legal eviction notice has been provided for the same. Thus, the landlord's demand for a sudden large increment may not be enforceable unless specifically mentioned in a renewal or agreement. However, it is suggested that you maintain all the required documentation and you may also request for a written agreement to clarify the terms of the continued tenancy.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Under the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1997 (WBPTA), tenancy rights can only be inherited by specific heirs who reside with the tenant at the time of their death, and here, the grandchildren are excluded unless proven to be dependent at the time of death. Here, since the tenancy agreement expired in 2002, and the grand child does not qualify as a tenant under WBPTA, his continued occupation is unauthorised. For the same, legal action may be taken by filing a complaint/eviction suit, and theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, citing the expiration of the tenancy and lack of legal authority.

    "answer": "Dear Client,According to the facts you have presented, it is prudent to file an action for eviction against all five members of the family of the deceased tenant because that way nobody will be left unheard. Because the tenancy agreement expired in 2002 and none of the present occupants is covered by the definition of a tenant as defined in the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1997 (WBPTA), their occupation is illegal. The eviction notice of 2012 and accepted by the first tenant would strengthen your case. The latest judgments of the Supreme Court relating to Section 2(g) of WBPTA, 1997 would override the Act but that would not be adverse to your case since the tenancy rights of the current occupant are illegal. You may even seek mesne profits for the period for which the property was illegally occupied during this period.

    "question": "Cheque bounce case filed for Secured Home loan when its not even NPA",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. This practice is being adopted as a matter for recovering the outstanding in case of eventuality. From the lender side they are more concerned about the recovery of the money with the contracted interest amount.Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that if in a transaction, a loan is advanced and the borrower agrees to repay the amount in a specified timeframe and issues a cheque as security to secure such repayment; if the loan amount is not repaid in any other form before the due date or if there is no other understanding or agreement between the parties to defer the payment of amount, the cheque which is issued as security would mature for presentation and the drawee of the cheque would be entitled to present the same. On such presentation, if the same is dishonoured, the consequences contemplated under Section 138 and the other provisions of N.I. Act would flow. When a cheque is issued even though as ‘security’ the consequence flowing therefrom is also known to the drawer of the cheque and in the circumstance stated above if the cheque is presented and dishonoured, the holder of the cheque/drawee would have the option of initiating the civil proceedings for recovery or the criminal proceedings for punishment in the fact situation, but in any event, it is not for the drawer of the cheque to dictate terms with regard to the nature of litigation.However, there are always defences available as per facts and circumstances of each case. Since you have already received the summons, therefore, the case has to appropriately defended.

    "answer": "There is no legal infirmity in using the security cheque for recovering the defaulted loan amount.The bank issued a statutory legal demand notice before filing thecheque bouncecase, whereas you failed to avail the opportunity.Therefore the bank has exercised its right to recover the loan amount especially when you continuously defaulted the EMI for two months.The bank cannot make it NPA for two months default. hence for putting pressure on you they have adopted this method.The high court may not entertain any petition for quash. hence you may better contact bank itself and negotiate settlement amount.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88766 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Cheque bounce case filed for Secured Home loan when its not even NPA",
    "answer": "Misuse of Section 138 in Secured Loan:Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act (NI Act) applies to cheques issued fordischarging a debt or liability, not as security.Your home is the pledged security, and the bank’s action of depositing theentire loan amount chequedespite ongoing EMI payments is disproportionate and abusive.Key Legal Points in Your Favor:Blank Cheques Taken as Security: Courts have held that cheques given as security arenot actionable under Section 138unless explicitly stated as a repayment instrument in the agreement.Non-NPA Account: Since your account is not classified as NPA, the bank cannot justify depositing the cheque for the full loan amount.Partial Liability: With only two EMIs overdue, the bank should seek recovery for the outstanding amount, not initiate criminal proceedings for the entire loan amount.Action Plan:Challenge Jurisdiction: File a petition under Section482 CrPCin the High Court to quash the complaint. Argue:The cheque was for security, not repayment.The entire loan amount was not due.The property is mortgaged, providing sufficient recourse for the bank.Highlight Abuse of Process: Emphasize that Section 138 is being misused as a coercive tool, ignoring the secured nature of the loan.File a Counterclaim: If needed, initiate a counter-complaint for harassment or abuse of legal process.Precedents Supporting Your Case:ICDS Ltd. v. Beena Shabeer (2002): Cheques given as security are not covered under Section 138.Sampelly Satyanarayana Rao v. Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (2016): Security cheques do not constitute \"legally enforceable debt or liability.\"Next Steps:Engage a competent lawyer to file a quashing petition in the High Court.Emphasize that the criminal proceedings are unwarranted since the bank has adequate security and recovery mechanisms (e.g., SARFAESI Act).Conclusion: Courts have frowned upon the misuse of Section 138 for secured loans. With strong legal arguments and precedents, you can effectively challenge this case.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.Hope you find the information helpful.

    "answer": "A cheque issued as security for a loan or other financial liability is considered to mature when the loan or installment is due. The drawer can present the cheque if the loan or installment is not repaid in any other way.2)  The Apex Court in the case of Sampelly Satyanarayana Rao v Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited(Sampelly case) held that wherein a post-dated cheque described as ‘security’ in the loan agreement is dishonoured, the same would be punishable under Section 138 of NIA.3)where a cheque is issued as security for a time specific loan, then on default of repayment of loan the security cheque issued would mature, if then the security cheque is dishonored, “the consequences contemplated under Section 138 and other provisions of N.I. Act would flow.” On a similar tangent, in the case of Sunil Todi,  SC  observed that a security cheque issued for advancement of a loan would be mature for presentation upon the default of repayment of loan. Upon dishonour of such a security cheque, the same would lie under the ambit of Section 138.4) filing of PIL would be a futile exerciseAjay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98565 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "question": "PCC and DV",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, the Police Clearance Certificate (PCC) usually shows whether there are any criminal cases or investigations against you. However, if there is no FIR or criminal case, the PCC usually indicates that there are no adverse police records though the police may still be aware of adomestic violencecase through Non-Cognizable records or investigation reports, as DV cases may not always result in an FIR but can still be investigated informally. Further, Police usually do not have access to court records, but if adomestic violencecase was filed, the police may be involved in the preliminary stages of investigation. But, if your wife withdrew the case, the PCC would generally reflect that the case was dismissed or disposed of, without explicitly stating it was withdrawn, indicating that there are no ongoing investigations. With respect to the false acquisitions made, you may file a criminal defamation case. Further, usually, political influences do not affect the PCC, as it reflects the factual details. Also, if your wife wrongly included your mother in theDomestic Violencecase that was later dismissed, you may pursue criminal action against her.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "A case for malicious prosecution can be filed in the court that has jurisdiction over the area where the wrong was committed.Malicious prosecution is a legal action that can be taken against someone who abuses the court process by wrongfully starting a lawsuit. The essential elements of malicious prosecution are:The defendant acted maliciouslyThe defendant had no reasonable or probable causeThe plaintiff was harmed as a result of the prosecutionThe proceedings ended in the plaintiff's favorThe main difference between claims based on criminal and civil actions has to do with evidence. A claim based on malicious criminal prosecution might allege damages for mental suffering. Here, a plaintiff might not need to provide proof in the form of verifiable economic damages. But for claims based on civil actions, the plaintiff must be able to prove quantifiable damages.A client relationship with a personal injury lawyer means you'll have the legal advice you need to pursue damages."

    "question": "Buyer postponing cancellation deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you may consider the Indian Contract Act, 1872, under which, the failure of the purchaser to pay the full amount within one month, as agreed in the registered Agreement to Sale, constitutes a breach of contract. While this breach makes the purchaser liable, the agreement remains valid until formally cancelled or declared void. Furthermore, according to theTransfer of Property Act, 1882,an Agreement to Sale does not transfer ownership but creates a contractual obligation, meaning selling the property to another buyer without cancelling the first agreement could expose you to a legal action. However, to proceed further with this, you may send a legal notice to the first buyer citing the breach, and demanding cancellation of the agreement. However, if he continues to delay, you can take the initiative to draft a cancellation deed, clearly stating whether you intend to refund or forfeit the advance payment of ₹1. In case of non-compliance or not co-operating to any of your actions, you may file a suit under the Specific Relief Act, 1963,seeking a declaration that the agreement is void due to non-performance.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, the tenancy agreement for the non-residential property was signed in June 1992 for a period of 10 years and expired in May 2002. Herein, the tenant continued paying rent during the agreement period, but an eviction notice was served in 2012, which the tenant acknowledged. The original tenant passed away in March 2019, and presently, in 2024, the tenant’s grandson occupied the property with force, and without any legal authority. Under the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1997 (WBPTA), tenancy rights can only be inherited by specific heirs who reside with the tenant at the time of their death, and here, the grandchildren are excluded unless proven to be dependent at the time of death. Here, since the tenancy agreement expired in 2002, and the grand child does not qualify as a tenant under WBPTA, his continued occupation is unauthorised. For the same, legal action may be taken by filing a complaint/eviction suit, and theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, citing the expiration of the tenancy and lack of legal authority. Additionally, a claim for mesne profits may be made for illegal occupation.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "There is nothing like thatThe lender can pursue both civil as well as criminal remediesAnd 138 is per se not purely criminal. It's quasi criminal. It's actually a civil dispute having a criminal overtoneYou need to check the loan agreement as to what was agreed thereinWhen any EMI is outstanding and not paid by the borrower before the due date the lender is given the right to recall the entire loan and require the borrower to pay the full amount which is what the bank seems to have done by encashing the security cheque by entering therein the full outstanding amountThis cannot be called abuse of the process of the lawIt is merely trying to recover the dues by following the due process of lawEven if the security cheques are not mentioned in the loan agreement,  it doesn't matter.The fact that you gave security cheques to the bank is sufficient reason that the cheque were given by you not by exercise of any force or pressure. That was a part of the loan transactionIt does not also matter if the cheques were given in 2015 so long as they were undated and have not become stale.138 is always invoked to recover a legally enforceable debt. Now though the cheques were merely for security,  the moment you defaulted in the EMI payment, the loan became a legally enforceable debt and the cheque ceased to be security chequeYou won't achieve anything by filing any PIL. It will be dismissed.

    "answer": "1. If you mortgage your house for a bank loan, it becomes the primary security. Post-dated cheques are taken by some banks only to ensure timely repayment of the loan in EMIs. No bank can take 'blank cheques' for that purpose.2. The house is the 'security', and NOT the post-dated cheques.3. The bank has a legal right to proceed against a defaulting borrower under Sec-138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, if a cheques issued by the borrower is returned unpaid for insufficient funds in the account. It is entirely within the bank's discretion to dispose off the security.4.

    "question": "Back dated increment in rent without agreement.",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, the landlord does not seem to be having a valid legal basis for demanding backdated rent increments. Herein, since the leave and license agreement expired after the initial 11 months, and further there was no renewal, your tenancy is seen to be continued on a month-to-month basis, with the same terms unless anything else has been mutually agreed upon. In India, the Rent Control Act typically governs such tenancies. While you raised the rent in the previous years, the landlord cannot demand unreasonable increases without prior agreement for the same. Moreover, the threat of legal action for unauthorized occupation cannot stay as you have been diligently paying rent every month, and no legal eviction notice has been provided for the same. Thus, the landlord's demand for a sudden large increment may not be enforceable unless specifically mentioned in a renewal or agreement. However, it is suggested that you maintain all the required documentation and you may also request for a written agreement to clarify the terms of the continued tenancy.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "PCC and DV",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, the Police Clearance Certificate (PCC) usually shows whether there are any criminal cases or investigations against you. However, if there is no FIR or criminal case, the PCC usually indicates that there are no adverse police records though the police may still be aware of adomestic violencecase through Non-Cognizable records or investigation reports, as DV cases may not always result in an FIR but can still be investigated informally. Further, Police usually do not have access to court records, but if adomestic violencecase was filed, the police may be involved in the preliminary stages of investigation. But, if your wife withdrew the case, the PCC would generally reflect that the case was dismissed or disposed of, without explicitly stating it was withdrawn, indicating that there are no ongoing investigations. With respect to the false acquisitions made, you may file a criminal defamation case. Further, usually, political influences do not affect the PCC, as it reflects the factual details. Also, if your wife wrongly included your mother in theDomestic Violencecase that was later dismissed, you may pursue criminal action against her.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "A case for malicious prosecution can be filed in the court that has jurisdiction over the area where the wrong was committed.Malicious prosecution is a legal action that can be taken against someone who abuses the court process by wrongfully starting a lawsuit. The essential elements of malicious prosecution are:The defendant acted maliciouslyThe defendant had no reasonable or probable causeThe plaintiff was harmed as a result of the prosecutionThe proceedings ended in the plaintiff's favorThe main difference between claims based on criminal and civil actions has to do with evidence. A claim based on malicious criminal prosecution might allege damages for mental suffering. Here, a plaintiff might not need to provide proof in the form of verifiable economic damages. But for claims based on civil actions, the plaintiff must be able to prove quantifiable damages.A client relationship with a personal injury lawyer means you'll have the legal advice you need to pursue damages."

Mere possession or use does not confer ownership. Furthermore, any money your brother spends on maintaining the property does not give him any legal rights, as voluntary maintenance expenses without an agreement are classified as gratuitous under the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and at most, he could seek reimbursement for the same. However, to prevent future disputes, you can formalize his stay through a leave and license agreement, ensuring it is clear that his occupancy is at your discretion and does not grant ownership rights.

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. My team has dealt with various disputes of such nature. Legal Notice can be sent to the other side through good lawyer. A legal notice is a formal, written communication that informs the recipient of a legal matter or issue. It is typically sent by an individual, company, or legal representative to another party, outlining specific claims, demands, or intentions. Legal notices are often the first step in resolving disputes or enforcing legal rights before escalating matters to a court of law. It works as a final warning to the receiver and saves time & money which is usually spent in long drawn Court proceedings.The Legal Notice would act as a a caveat which is a precautionary measure undertaken by an individual anticipating that another individual may file an application in a suit or proceeding.In case, the issue is not resolved then any person who has any legal character or any legal rights as to any property by virtue of title deeds or otherwise may file a suit for declaration of those rights and for injunction against any person denying or interested to deny his title to such character or right.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Shri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

This ensures no legal action can proceed without notifying you.Documents Needed:Obtain theproperty title deedand other documents to establish the property as ancestral.Collect evidence of your father’s relationship to the property (e.g., family tree, revenue records).Consult a Lawyer:A property lawyer will help draft the partition suit and caveat, ensuring all procedural requirements are met.Conclusion: File a partition suit and caveat to secure your father’s and your rightful share in the ancestral property.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.Hope you find the information helpful.

    "question": "PCC and DV",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, the Police Clearance Certificate (PCC) usually shows whether there are any criminal cases or investigations against you. However, if there is no FIR or criminal case, the PCC usually indicates that there are no adverse police records though the police may still be aware of adomestic violencecase through Non-Cognizable records or investigation reports, as DV cases may not always result in an FIR but can still be investigated informally. Further, Police usually do not have access to court records, but if adomestic violencecase was filed, the police may be involved in the preliminary stages of investigation. But, if your wife withdrew the case, the PCC would generally reflect that the case was dismissed or disposed of, without explicitly stating it was withdrawn, indicating that there are no ongoing investigations. With respect to the false acquisitions made, you may file a criminal defamation case. Further, usually, political influences do not affect the PCC, as it reflects the factual details. Also, if your wife wrongly included your mother in theDomestic Violencecase that was later dismissed, you may pursue criminal action against her.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "A case for malicious prosecution can be filed in the court that has jurisdiction over the area where the wrong was committed.Malicious prosecution is a legal action that can be taken against someone who abuses the court process by wrongfully starting a lawsuit. The essential elements of malicious prosecution are:The defendant acted maliciouslyThe defendant had no reasonable or probable causeThe plaintiff was harmed as a result of the prosecutionThe proceedings ended in the plaintiff's favorThe main difference between claims based on criminal and civil actions has to do with evidence. A claim based on malicious criminal prosecution might allege damages for mental suffering. Here, a plaintiff might not need to provide proof in the form of verifiable economic damages. But for claims based on civil actions, the plaintiff must be able to prove quantifiable damages.A client relationship with a personal injury lawyer means you'll have the legal advice you need to pursue damages."

    "answer": "There is nothing like thatThe lender can pursue both civil as well as criminal remediesAnd 138 is per se not purely criminal. It's quasi criminal. It's actually a civil dispute having a criminal overtoneYou need to check the loan agreement as to what was agreed thereinWhen any EMI is outstanding and not paid by the borrower before the due date the lender is given the right to recall the entire loan and require the borrower to pay the full amount which is what the bank seems to have done by encashing the security cheque by entering therein the full outstanding amountThis cannot be called abuse of the process of the lawIt is merely trying to recover the dues by following the due process of lawEven if the security cheques are not mentioned in the loan agreement,  it doesn't matter.The fact that you gave security cheques to the bank is sufficient reason that the cheque were given by you not by exercise of any force or pressure. That was a part of the loan transactionIt does not also matter if the cheques were given in 2015 so long as they were undated and have not become stale.138 is always invoked to recover a legally enforceable debt. Now though the cheques were merely for security,  the moment you defaulted in the EMI payment, the loan became a legally enforceable debt and the cheque ceased to be security chequeYou won't achieve anything by filing any PIL.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In Kerala, the land use regulations are governed by the Kerala Town and Country Planning Act, 2016, and the Kerala Municipality Act, 1994. These laws require certain permissions for converting residential plots to commercial use. If the driving school is operating on a residential plot without conversion to commercial use, it might be in violation of these regulations. Under the Kerala Municipality Act, the Corporation or Municipality is responsible for regulating land use and ensuring compliance with zoning laws. If the plot has not been converted for commercial purposes, operating a driving school there without permission could be illegal. You can pursue a civil suit for nuisance and seek relief for damages and an injunction to prevent further disturbances. Request the court to issue a mandatory injunction to prevent the driving school from operating until proper permissions are obtained and the nuisance is addressed. Petition the Municipal Corporation to take immediate safety measures such as installing a boundary wall or barriers to prevent accidents and protect your property. Engage with local authorities to ensure compliance with safety and land use regulations. For Criminal recourse, you can request the police to register an FIR Considering that the preliminary investigation confirms that the allegations are true. you can file a complaint with the Superintendent of Police or approach the Magistrate to direct the police to register the FIR.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Constructing an additional toilet is permissible if it does not pose a safety risk, and you have already obtained an architect's approval confirming its feasibility.

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. This practice is being adopted as a matter for recovering the outstanding in case of eventuality. From the lender side they are more concerned about the recovery of the money with the contracted interest amount.Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that if in a transaction, a loan is advanced and the borrower agrees to repay the amount in a specified timeframe and issues a cheque as security to secure such repayment; if the loan amount is not repaid in any other form before the due date or if there is no other understanding or agreement between the parties to defer the payment of amount, the cheque which is issued as security would mature for presentation and the drawee of the cheque would be entitled to present the same. On such presentation, if the same is dishonoured, the consequences contemplated under Section 138 and the other provisions of N.I. Act would flow. When a cheque is issued even though as ‘security’ the consequence flowing therefrom is also known to the drawer of the cheque and in the circumstance stated above if the cheque is presented and dishonoured, the holder of the cheque/drawee would have the option of initiating the civil proceedings for recovery or the criminal proceedings for punishment in the fact situation, but in any event, it is not for the drawer of the cheque to dictate terms with regard to the nature of litigation.However, there are always defences available as per facts and circumstances of each case. Since you have already received the summons, therefore, the case has to appropriately defended.

    "answer": "Misuse of Section 138 in Secured Loan:Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act (NI Act) applies to cheques issued fordischarging a debt or liability, not as security.Your home is the pledged security, and the bank’s action of depositing theentire loan amount chequedespite ongoing EMI payments is disproportionate and abusive.Key Legal Points in Your Favor:Blank Cheques Taken as Security: Courts have held that cheques given as security arenot actionable under Section 138unless explicitly stated as a repayment instrument in the agreement.Non-NPA Account: Since your account is not classified as NPA, the bank cannot justify depositing the cheque for the full loan amount.Partial Liability: With only two EMIs overdue, the bank should seek recovery for the outstanding amount, not initiate criminal proceedings for the entire loan amount.Action Plan:Challenge Jurisdiction: File a petition under Section482 CrPCin the High Court to quash the complaint. Argue:The cheque was for security, not repayment.The entire loan amount was not due.The property is mortgaged, providing sufficient recourse for the bank.Highlight Abuse of Process: Emphasize that Section 138 is being misused as a coercive tool, ignoring the secured nature of the loan.File a Counterclaim: If needed, initiate a counter-complaint for harassment or abuse of legal process.Precedents Supporting Your Case:ICDS Ltd. v. Beena Shabeer (2002): Cheques given as security are not covered under Section 138.Sampelly Satyanarayana Rao v. Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (2016): Security cheques do not constitute \"legally enforceable debt or liability.\"Next Steps:Engage a competent lawyer to file a quashing petition in the High Court.Emphasize that the criminal proceedings are unwarranted since the bank has adequate security and recovery mechanisms (e.g., SARFAESI Act).Conclusion: Courts have frowned upon the misuse of Section 138 for secured loans.

Mere possession or use does not confer ownership. Furthermore, any money your brother spends on maintaining the property does not give him any legal rights, as voluntary maintenance expenses without an agreement are classified as gratuitous under the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and at most, he could seek reimbursement for the same.

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. My team has dealt with various disputes of such nature. Legal Notice can be sent to the other side through good lawyer. A legal notice is a formal, written communication that informs the recipient of a legal matter or issue. It is typically sent by an individual, company, or legal representative to another party, outlining specific claims, demands, or intentions. Legal notices are often the first step in resolving disputes or enforcing legal rights before escalating matters to a court of law. It works as a final warning to the receiver and saves time & money which is usually spent in long drawn Court proceedings.The Legal Notice would act as a a caveat which is a precautionary measure undertaken by an individual anticipating that another individual may file an application in a suit or proceeding.In case, the issue is not resolved then any person who has any legal character or any legal rights as to any property by virtue of title deeds or otherwise may file a suit for declaration of those rights and for injunction against any person denying or interested to deny his title to such character or right.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Shri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "question": "Buyer postponing cancellation deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you may consider the Indian Contract Act, 1872, under which, the failure of the purchaser to pay the full amount within one month, as agreed in the registered Agreement to Sale, constitutes a breach of contract. While this breach makes the purchaser liable, the agreement remains valid until formally cancelled or declared void. Furthermore, according to theTransfer of Property Act, 1882,an Agreement to Sale does not transfer ownership but creates a contractual obligation, meaning selling the property to another buyer without cancelling the first agreement could expose you to a legal action. However, to proceed further with this, you may send a legal notice to the first buyer citing the breach, and demanding cancellation of the agreement. However, if he continues to delay, you can take the initiative to draft a cancellation deed, clearly stating whether you intend to refund or forfeit the advance payment of ₹1. In case of non-compliance or not co-operating to any of your actions, you may file a suit under the Specific Relief Act, 1963,seeking a declaration that the agreement is void due to non-performance.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "There is nothing like thatThe lender can pursue both civil as well as criminal remediesAnd 138 is per se not purely criminal. It's quasi criminal. It's actually a civil dispute having a criminal overtoneYou need to check the loan agreement as to what was agreed thereinWhen any EMI is outstanding and not paid by the borrower before the due date the lender is given the right to recall the entire loan and require the borrower to pay the full amount which is what the bank seems to have done by encashing the security cheque by entering therein the full outstanding amountThis cannot be called abuse of the process of the lawIt is merely trying to recover the dues by following the due process of lawEven if the security cheques are not mentioned in the loan agreement,  it doesn't matter.The fact that you gave security cheques to the bank is sufficient reason that the cheque were given by you not by exercise of any force or pressure. That was a part of the loan transactionIt does not also matter if the cheques were given in 2015 so long as they were undated and have not become stale.138 is always invoked to recover a legally enforceable debt. Now though the cheques were merely for security,  the moment you defaulted in the EMI payment, the loan became a legally enforceable debt and the cheque ceased to be security chequeYou won't achieve anything by filing any PIL.

With respect to addressing dual proceedings, you may request the jurisdictional priority in India since you filed for divorce under theHindu Marriage Actmonths before your spouse filed in US, and thus, on this basis argue for dismissal of the case in US. However, if the request of relocation is denied, and further your visa also expires, you may return to India, to avoid the illegal presence in the country, and seek for temporary custody orders. Further, you may also request the Indian Courts to issue summons for compelling your spouse to return to India, and for the same, international conventions may also be considered.

    "question": "Buyer postponing cancellation deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you may consider the Indian Contract Act, 1872, under which, the failure of the purchaser to pay the full amount within one month, as agreed in the registered Agreement to Sale, constitutes a breach of contract. While this breach makes the purchaser liable, the agreement remains valid until formally cancelled or declared void. Furthermore, according to theTransfer of Property Act, 1882,an Agreement to Sale does not transfer ownership but creates a contractual obligation, meaning selling the property to another buyer without cancelling the first agreement could expose you to a legal action. However, to proceed further with this, you may send a legal notice to the first buyer citing the breach, and demanding cancellation of the agreement. However, if he continues to delay, you can take the initiative to draft a cancellation deed, clearly stating whether you intend to refund or forfeit the advance payment of ₹1. In case of non-compliance or not co-operating to any of your actions, you may file a suit under the Specific Relief Act, 1963,seeking a declaration that the agreement is void due to non-performance.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. This practice is being adopted as a matter for recovering the outstanding in case of eventuality. From the lender side they are more concerned about the recovery of the money with the contracted interest amount.Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that if in a transaction, a loan is advanced and the borrower agrees to repay the amount in a specified timeframe and issues a cheque as security to secure such repayment; if the loan amount is not repaid in any other form before the due date or if there is no other understanding or agreement between the parties to defer the payment of amount, the cheque which is issued as security would mature for presentation and the drawee of the cheque would be entitled to present the same. On such presentation, if the same is dishonoured, the consequences contemplated under Section 138 and the other provisions of N.I. Act would flow. When a cheque is issued even though as ‘security’ the consequence flowing therefrom is also known to the drawer of the cheque and in the circumstance stated above if the cheque is presented and dishonoured, the holder of the cheque/drawee would have the option of initiating the civil proceedings for recovery or the criminal proceedings for punishment in the fact situation, but in any event, it is not for the drawer of the cheque to dictate terms with regard to the nature of litigation.However, there are always defences available as per facts and circumstances of each case. Since you have already received the summons, therefore, the case has to appropriately defended.

    "answer": "Misuse of Section 138 in Secured Loan:Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act (NI Act) applies to cheques issued fordischarging a debt or liability, not as security.Your home is the pledged security, and the bank’s action of depositing theentire loan amount chequedespite ongoing EMI payments is disproportionate and abusive.Key Legal Points in Your Favor:Blank Cheques Taken as Security: Courts have held that cheques given as security arenot actionable under Section 138unless explicitly stated as a repayment instrument in the agreement.Non-NPA Account: Since your account is not classified as NPA, the bank cannot justify depositing the cheque for the full loan amount.Partial Liability: With only two EMIs overdue, the bank should seek recovery for the outstanding amount, not initiate criminal proceedings for the entire loan amount.Action Plan:Challenge Jurisdiction: File a petition under Section482 CrPCin the High Court to quash the complaint. Argue:The cheque was for security, not repayment.The entire loan amount was not due.The property is mortgaged, providing sufficient recourse for the bank.Highlight Abuse of Process: Emphasize that Section 138 is being misused as a coercive tool, ignoring the secured nature of the loan.File a Counterclaim: If needed, initiate a counter-complaint for harassment or abuse of legal process.Precedents Supporting Your Case:ICDS Ltd. v. Beena Shabeer (2002): Cheques given as security are not covered under Section 138.Sampelly Satyanarayana Rao v. Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (2016): Security cheques do not constitute \"legally enforceable debt or liability.\"Next Steps:Engage a competent lawyer to file a quashing petition in the High Court.Emphasize that the criminal proceedings are unwarranted since the bank has adequate security and recovery mechanisms (e.g., SARFAESI Act).Conclusion: Courts have frowned upon the misuse of Section 138 for secured loans. With strong legal arguments and precedents, you can effectively challenge this case.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.Hope you find the information helpful.

    "answer": "A cheque issued as security for a loan or other financial liability is considered to mature when the loan or installment is due. The drawer can present the cheque if the loan or installment is not repaid in any other way.2)  The Apex Court in the case of Sampelly Satyanarayana Rao v Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited(Sampelly case) held that wherein a post-dated cheque described as ‘security’ in the loan agreement is dishonoured, the same would be punishable under Section 138 of NIA.3)where a cheque is issued as security for a time specific loan, then on default of repayment of loan the security cheque issued would mature, if then the security cheque is dishonored, “the consequences contemplated under Section 138 and other provisions of N.I. Act would flow.” On a similar tangent, in the case of Sunil Todi,  SC  observed that a security cheque issued for advancement of a loan would be mature for presentation upon the default of repayment of loan. Upon dishonour of such a security cheque, the same would lie under the ambit of Section 138.4) filing of PIL would be a futile exerciseAjay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98565 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. My team has dealt with various disputes of such nature. Legal Notice can be sent to the other side through good lawyer. A legal notice is a formal, written communication that informs the recipient of a legal matter or issue. It is typically sent by an individual, company, or legal representative to another party, outlining specific claims, demands, or intentions. Legal notices are often the first step in resolving disputes or enforcing legal rights before escalating matters to a court of law. It works as a final warning to the receiver and saves time & money which is usually spent in long drawn Court proceedings.The Legal Notice would act as a a caveat which is a precautionary measure undertaken by an individual anticipating that another individual may file an application in a suit or proceeding.In case, the issue is not resolved then any person who has any legal character or any legal rights as to any property by virtue of title deeds or otherwise may file a suit for declaration of those rights and for injunction against any person denying or interested to deny his title to such character or right.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Shri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "question": "Buyer postponing cancellation deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you may consider the Indian Contract Act, 1872, under which, the failure of the purchaser to pay the full amount within one month, as agreed in the registered Agreement to Sale, constitutes a breach of contract. While this breach makes the purchaser liable, the agreement remains valid until formally cancelled or declared void. Furthermore, according to theTransfer of Property Act, 1882,an Agreement to Sale does not transfer ownership but creates a contractual obligation, meaning selling the property to another buyer without cancelling the first agreement could expose you to a legal action. However, to proceed further with this, you may send a legal notice to the first buyer citing the breach, and demanding cancellation of the agreement. However, if he continues to delay, you can take the initiative to draft a cancellation deed, clearly stating whether you intend to refund or forfeit the advance payment of ₹1. In case of non-compliance or not co-operating to any of your actions, you may file a suit under the Specific Relief Act, 1963,seeking a declaration that the agreement is void due to non-performance.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It's actually a civil dispute having a criminal overtoneYou need to check the loan agreement as to what was agreed thereinWhen any EMI is outstanding and not paid by the borrower before the due date the lender is given the right to recall the entire loan and require the borrower to pay the full amount which is what the bank seems to have done by encashing the security cheque by entering therein the full outstanding amountThis cannot be called abuse of the process of the lawIt is merely trying to recover the dues by following the due process of lawEven if the security cheques are not mentioned in the loan agreement,  it doesn't matter.The fact that you gave security cheques to the bank is sufficient reason that the cheque were given by you not by exercise of any force or pressure. That was a part of the loan transactionIt does not also matter if the cheques were given in 2015 so long as they were undated and have not become stale.138 is always invoked to recover a legally enforceable debt. Now though the cheques were merely for security,  the moment you defaulted in the EMI payment, the loan became a legally enforceable debt and the cheque ceased to be security chequeYou won't achieve anything by filing any PIL.

    "question": "Buyer postponing cancellation deed",
    "answer": "1. If there is no clause in the agreement for the cancellation or execution of sale deed in the name of buyer , then you cannot cancel the agreement- However, as there was oral agreement for the payment of full amount within one month, then you can send a legal notice to cancel the agreement on this ground.2. Since, there is one registered agreement with the said buyer , then without cancelling the same you cannot sell the property to another3. Send a legal notice and if he cannot come forward then cancel the agreement, and also inform that if he cannot come forward for the cancellation of the agreement then the paid amount will not be returned.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Cheque bounce case filed for Secured Home loan when its not even NPA",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. This practice is being adopted as a matter for recovering the outstanding in case of eventuality. From the lender side they are more concerned about the recovery of the money with the contracted interest amount.Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that if in a transaction, a loan is advanced and the borrower agrees to repay the amount in a specified timeframe and issues a cheque as security to secure such repayment; if the loan amount is not repaid in any other form before the due date or if there is no other understanding or agreement between the parties to defer the payment of amount, the cheque which is issued as security would mature for presentation and the drawee of the cheque would be entitled to present the same. On such presentation, if the same is dishonoured, the consequences contemplated under Section 138 and the other provisions of N.I. Act would flow. When a cheque is issued even though as ‘security’ the consequence flowing therefrom is also known to the drawer of the cheque and in the circumstance stated above if the cheque is presented and dishonoured, the holder of the cheque/drawee would have the option of initiating the civil proceedings for recovery or the criminal proceedings for punishment in the fact situation, but in any event, it is not for the drawer of the cheque to dictate terms with regard to the nature of litigation.However, there are always defences available as per facts and circumstances of each case. Since you have already received the summons, therefore, the case has to appropriately defended.

    "answer": "Misuse of Section 138 in Secured Loan:Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act (NI Act) applies to cheques issued fordischarging a debt or liability, not as security.Your home is the pledged security, and the bank’s action of depositing theentire loan amount chequedespite ongoing EMI payments is disproportionate and abusive.Key Legal Points in Your Favor:Blank Cheques Taken as Security: Courts have held that cheques given as security arenot actionable under Section 138unless explicitly stated as a repayment instrument in the agreement.Non-NPA Account: Since your account is not classified as NPA, the bank cannot justify depositing the cheque for the full loan amount.Partial Liability: With only two EMIs overdue, the bank should seek recovery for the outstanding amount, not initiate criminal proceedings for the entire loan amount.Action Plan:Challenge Jurisdiction: File a petition under Section482 CrPCin the High Court to quash the complaint. Argue:The cheque was for security, not repayment.The entire loan amount was not due.The property is mortgaged, providing sufficient recourse for the bank.Highlight Abuse of Process: Emphasize that Section 138 is being misused as a coercive tool, ignoring the secured nature of the loan.File a Counterclaim: If needed, initiate a counter-complaint for harassment or abuse of legal process.Precedents Supporting Your Case:ICDS Ltd. v. Beena Shabeer (2002): Cheques given as security are not covered under Section 138.Sampelly Satyanarayana Rao v. Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (2016): Security cheques do not constitute \"legally enforceable debt or liability.\"Next Steps:Engage a competent lawyer to file a quashing petition in the High Court.Emphasize that the criminal proceedings are unwarranted since the bank has adequate security and recovery mechanisms (e.g., SARFAESI Act).Conclusion: Courts have frowned upon the misuse of Section 138 for secured loans. With strong legal arguments and precedents, you can effectively challenge this case.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.Hope you find the information helpful.

Act would flow.” On a similar tangent, in the case of Sunil Todi,  SC  observed that a security cheque issued for advancement of a loan would be mature for presentation upon the default of repayment of loan.

Constructing an additional toilet is permissible if it does not pose a safety risk, and you have already obtained an architect's approval confirming its feasibility. Herein, the Apartment Owners’ Association, under the Karnataka Apartment Ownership Act, 1972, cannot arbitrarily deny permission without substantiated technical reasons. Their concerns regarding load-bearing or water seepage must be validated by an expert, which they have so far failed to arrange.

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. My team has dealt with various disputes of such nature. Legal Notice can be sent to the other side through good lawyer. A legal notice is a formal, written communication that informs the recipient of a legal matter or issue. It is typically sent by an individual, company, or legal representative to another party, outlining specific claims, demands, or intentions. Legal notices are often the first step in resolving disputes or enforcing legal rights before escalating matters to a court of law. It works as a final warning to the receiver and saves time & money which is usually spent in long drawn Court proceedings.The Legal Notice would act as a a caveat which is a precautionary measure undertaken by an individual anticipating that another individual may file an application in a suit or proceeding.In case, the issue is not resolved then any person who has any legal character or any legal rights as to any property by virtue of title deeds or otherwise may file a suit for declaration of those rights and for injunction against any person denying or interested to deny his title to such character or right.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Shri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

By extension, you and your siblings have rights through your father.Immediate Actions:File a Partition Suit: Your father should file a partition suit in the civil court to claim his rightful share.Challenge the Distribution: If the property was transferred to your uncle’s kids, file a case to declare such transfers illegal and void, as they were done without your father’s consent.Caveat:Acaveat petitioncan be filed in the court where the property is situated to prevent further transfer or sale by your uncle or his kids. This ensures no legal action can proceed without notifying you.Documents Needed:Obtain theproperty title deedand other documents to establish the property as ancestral.Collect evidence of your father’s relationship to the property (e.g., family tree, revenue records).Consult a Lawyer:A property lawyer will help draft the partition suit and caveat, ensuring all procedural requirements are met.Conclusion: File a partition suit and caveat to secure your father’s and your rightful share in the ancestral property.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.Hope you find the information helpful.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, your brother cannot claim ownership of the house because he is living there, as the property was validly transferred to you via a registered gift deed under the Registration Act, 1908 and theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, making you the legal owner. Mere possession or use does not confer ownership. Furthermore, any money your brother spends on maintaining the property does not give him any legal rights, as voluntary maintenance expenses without an agreement are classified as gratuitous under the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and at most, he could seek reimbursement for the same. However, to prevent future disputes, you can formalize his stay through a leave and license agreement, ensuring it is clear that his occupancy is at your discretion and does not grant ownership rights. Additionally, you may also communicate this in writing that maintenance contributions are voluntary and do not affect your title.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Buyer postponing cancellation deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you may consider the Indian Contract Act, 1872, under which, the failure of the purchaser to pay the full amount within one month, as agreed in the registered Agreement to Sale, constitutes a breach of contract. While this breach makes the purchaser liable, the agreement remains valid until formally cancelled or declared void. Furthermore, according to theTransfer of Property Act, 1882,an Agreement to Sale does not transfer ownership but creates a contractual obligation, meaning selling the property to another buyer without cancelling the first agreement could expose you to a legal action. However, to proceed further with this, you may send a legal notice to the first buyer citing the breach, and demanding cancellation of the agreement. However, if he continues to delay, you can take the initiative to draft a cancellation deed, clearly stating whether you intend to refund or forfeit the advance payment of ₹1. In case of non-compliance or not co-operating to any of your actions, you may file a suit under the Specific Relief Act, 1963,seeking a declaration that the agreement is void due to non-performance.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

With respect to addressing dual proceedings, you may request the jurisdictional priority in India since you filed for divorce under theHindu Marriage Actmonths before your spouse filed in US, and thus, on this basis argue for dismissal of the case in US. However, if the request of relocation is denied, and further your visa also expires, you may return to India, to avoid the illegal presence in the country, and seek for temporary custody orders. Further, you may also request the Indian Courts to issue summons for compelling your spouse to return to India, and for the same, international conventions may also be considered.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, being the owner of your 2BHK flat in Bangalore, you have the right to make interior modifications under the Karnataka Ownership Flats Act, 1972, provided they do not compromise the building's structural integrity or common areas. Constructing an additional toilet is permissible if it does not pose a safety risk, and you have already obtained an architect's approval confirming its feasibility. Herein, the Apartment Owners’ Association, under the Karnataka Apartment Ownership Act, 1972, cannot arbitrarily deny permission without substantiated technical reasons. Their concerns regarding load-bearing or water seepage must be validated by an expert, which they have so far failed to arrange. To proceed further, it is suggested that, you send a formal written request to the association, including your architect’s approval and assurances of safety, to appoint their own expert for verification within a reasonable deadline. If they remain unresponsive or deny the request without considering or providing any evidence, you may approach the Bangalore Municipal Corporation or any other independent structural engineer for approval. You may also consider filing a complaint with the Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum for undue inconvenience or financial loss.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, for the purpose of leasing your warehouse for a 10-year term to a tenant who is intending to set up a water processing unit, it is necessary to draft a registered lease agreement under the Registration Act, detailing the lease duration, renewal terms, and rent increase details. Further, it is suggested that you include a security deposit clause , late payment penalties, and a termination clause for breaches like rent defaults or unauthorized activities. Further, you may also specify the tenant’s responsibility for routine maintenance, utility bills, operational compliance, and restoration of the premises upon lease termination. However, it is necessary that you safeguard yourself against liabilities through an indemnity clause, requiring the tenant to insure their operations and adhere to the applicable environmental and industrial laws. Further, for early termination, you may allow the party to terminate with certain months’ notice, and also include a force majeure clause for unforeseen events.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Under the Passport Act, 1967, the authorities can seek clarification regarding documents submitted for passport applications.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, being the owner of your 2BHK flat in Bangalore, you have the right to make interior modifications under the Karnataka Ownership Flats Act, 1972, provided they do not compromise the building's structural integrity or common areas. Constructing an additional toilet is permissible if it does not pose a safety risk, and you have already obtained an architect's approval confirming its feasibility. Herein, the Apartment Owners’ Association, under the Karnataka Apartment Ownership Act, 1972, cannot arbitrarily deny permission without substantiated technical reasons. Their concerns regarding load-bearing or water seepage must be validated by an expert, which they have so far failed to arrange. To proceed further, it is suggested that, you send a formal written request to the association, including your architect’s approval and assurances of safety, to appoint their own expert for verification within a reasonable deadline. If they remain unresponsive or deny the request without considering or providing any evidence, you may approach the Bangalore Municipal Corporation or any other independent structural engineer for approval. You may also consider filing a complaint with the Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum for undue inconvenience or financial loss.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Eviction of occupier from property rented out for non-residential purpose",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, the tenancy agreement for the non-residential property was signed in June 1992 for a period of 10 years and expired in May 2002. Herein, the tenant continued paying rent during the agreement period, but an eviction notice was served in 2012, which the tenant acknowledged. The original tenant passed away in March 2019, and presently, in 2024, the tenant’s grandson occupied the property with force, and without any legal authority. Under the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1997 (WBPTA), tenancy rights can only be inherited by specific heirs who reside with the tenant at the time of their death, and here, the grandchildren are excluded unless proven to be dependent at the time of death. Here, since the tenancy agreement expired in 2002, and the grand child does not qualify as a tenant under WBPTA, his continued occupation is unauthorised. For the same, legal action may be taken by filing a complaint/eviction suit, and theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, citing the expiration of the tenancy and lack of legal authority. Additionally, a claim for mesne profits may be made for illegal occupation.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Eviction of occupier from property rented out for non-residential purpose",
    "answer": "Dear Client,According to the facts you have presented, it is prudent to file an action for eviction against all five members of the family of the deceased tenant because that way nobody will be left unheard. Because the tenancy agreement expired in 2002 and none of the present occupants is covered by the definition of a tenant as defined in the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1997 (WBPTA), their occupation is illegal. The eviction notice of 2012 and accepted by the first tenant would strengthen your case. The latest judgments of the Supreme Court relating to Section 2(g) of WBPTA, 1997 would override the Act but that would not be adverse to your case since the tenancy rights of the current occupant are illegal. You may even seek mesne profits for the period for which the property was illegally occupied during this period.

But, he spoke with his lawyer, and said only an application from the buyer is required to cancel the deal and he will get the stamp duty amount less 20% deduction within 2 years. Herein, firstly, a registered agreement to sale is legally binding and cannot be unilaterally cancelled by the buyer. The claim that only his application is required for cancellation is not legally valid. Alternatively, such cancellation requires a mutually signed and registered Deed of Cancellation, without which the agreement remains enforceable. With respect to the refund of stamp duty, the same would usually require a joint application by both parties, and for the same, up to 20% of the stamp duty may be deducted. Now, in case you agree to cancel, you may insist on registering a cancellation deed, and ensure that you financial interests are protected. You may also choose to enforce the agreement under the Specific Relief Act, allowing you to seek specific performance or compensation for breach of contract.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, subsequent to the divorce, alimony would be determined based on various factors, including the duration of the marriage, financial capacity of both spouses, and the wife’s ability to support herself, and so on. Under the BNSS, maintenance is typically granted if the wife is unable to maintain herself, but since your wife is earning Rs. 40,000 per month and has been living separately, her claim for alimony may be reduced. Further, underHindu Marriage Act, the provisions allow for interim maintenance during divorce proceedings, and permanent alimony based on the husband’s income and the wife’s financial capacity. Here, your monthly income is Rs. 1.4 lakhs, and since your wife is employed, the court will consider your financial obligations you have, as well as her ability to support herself. Further, since your marriage lasted only about 13 months and your wife has not contributed financially to you or the marriage, the court may award an alimony of certain percentage of your monthly income. Additionally, the issues you have, your medical check-ups and so on, would also strengthen your case for divorce. However, it is suggested that you maintain the documentation and salary details of both you and your spouse, so as to maintain a proof for your defence.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Cancellation of Sale Agreement",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you are the seller of an apartment and your property is located in Pune. You have found a buyer and he paid a token amount, after which you registered an agreement to sale, at the Registrar's office, and the buyer applied for a loan. Presently, you stay in Bangalore, and 2 months have passed but the buyer is now making excuses to delay the sale process. Further, the buyer also agreed to cancel the deal if you are in a hurry. Hence, you told him to cancel the agreement to sale. But, he spoke with his lawyer, and said only an application from the buyer is required to cancel the deal and he will get the stamp duty amount less 20% deduction within 2 years. Herein, firstly, a registered agreement to sale is legally binding and cannot be unilaterally cancelled by the buyer. The claim that only his application is required for cancellation is not legally valid. Alternatively, such cancellation requires a mutually signed and registered Deed of Cancellation, without which the agreement remains enforceable. With respect to the refund of stamp duty, the same would usually require a joint application by both parties, and for the same, up to 20% of the stamp duty may be deducted. Now, in case you agree to cancel, you may insist on registering a cancellation deed, and ensure that you financial interests are protected. You may also choose to enforce the agreement under the Specific Relief Act, allowing you to seek specific performance or compensation for breach of contract.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can common passage be redeveloped with the consent of all joint owners?",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Addressing your legal situation,Parties B, C, and E may enter into a Joint Development Agreement (JDA) with a builder to utilize the common passage area for constructing apartments. However, However, that would depend on their legal rights in the common passage area as stipulated in the partition deed. Since they have used the common passage for over 30 years, they might have rights over it. However, they should ensure that there is no violation of parties A and D rights or violate any terms of the original partition deed.The respective proportions in the value of the common passage for parties B, C, and E would be the same as stipulated in the partition deed although this could be changed with mutual agreement between the parties involved or through court action. Their value could also be waived when the share by parties A and D, who have redeveloped their plots if they can no longer use the common passage. This would have to be legally defined, as their rights may still exist unless officially and formally relinquished.If Party C does not consent to redevelopment, the other parties (B and E) can consider buying out his proportionate share in the common passage. This buyout would require Party C to relinquish his rights formally. Given that Party C has an alternative entrance, this may simplify negotiations. However, all parties should agree on a fair valuation of Party C's share based on the current market value of the common passage.To arrive at the proportionate share value to execute buyout from Party C, assess the current market value of the entire property including the common passage. Next, calculate Party C's share in terms of his declared value in the partition deed. Further, engage in negotiations with Party C to agree on a mutually acceptable buyout price.In the process of executing these plans, it is crucial to be aware of potential legal setbacks, such as, ensuring that all co-owners are consulted with and that such consent is obtained when necessary, and that all redevelopment plans are in line with local laws and building regulations. You must also prepare for the eventual raising of conflict due to one party feeling aggrieved by decisions taken without their consent.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "1. Since the redevelopment process is for the entire area owned by all the three owners which include the one ground common passage also, on the basis of mutually agreed conditions a registered redevelopment agreement would be the option.2. The terms of the mutual agreement among all the three owners will be the guidelines in this regard.3. If one of the owners don't consent for joint redevelopment, then his share of property will be excluded. However if C consents to relinquish his rights over the common passage in return of payment of consideration, it has to be reduced to writing and executed by a registered deed to avoid future legal hassle.4.

    "answer": "Joint Development Agreement: Yes, parties B, C, and E can venture into a joint development agreement with a builder to utilize the common passage, provided all parties consent.Share Value in Common Passage: The respective share value in the common passage for B, C, and E would be as per the proportion mentioned in the partition deed (Rs. 5000 for B, Rs. 5000 for C, and Rs. 7500 for E). The shares of A and D, who no longer use or have interest in the passage, would need to be addressed legally (e.g., relinquishment, compensation) to avoid future disputes.Non-Consent of Party C: If C does not give consent, the remaining parties may attempt to buy out C's share. This would require a mutually agreed-upon value or legal valuation to compensate C and obtain their relinquishment of rights.Valuation Method for Buyout: The proportionate share value can be determined based on the current market value of the land or by evaluating the value it contributes to the redevelopment project.Legal Setbacks to Consider:All parties must provide clear and documented consent for any changes to the common passage.Proper legal agreements and buyout terms must be executed to avoid disputes.Existing laws on redevelopment, property rights, and local municipal regulations must be followed.

    "answer": "Proportionate Revalued Share for B, C & E: After Parties A and D relinquish their rights, their shares (Rs. 5,000 and Rs. 7,500) can be proportionally distributed to B, C, and E based on their existing share ratios. For instance:Total value = Rs. 30,000 - (Rs. 5,000 + Rs. 7,500) = Rs. 17,500.Reallocation depends on agreed proportions but would generally be split as per their current stake unless a new ratio is agreed upon.Valuation for Party C’s Buyout: Determine the revalued share of the common passage considering its current market value. Party C’s share would be based on their proportionate share of this revalued amount.Re-altered Shares for B & E: After buying out C’s share, B and E would redivide the passage value based on their adjusted ratios, reflecting their new combined ownership structure.Formal Relinquishment by A and D: Since A and D are deceased, their legal heirs need to execute a formal relinquishment deed through proper legal channels to transfer or waive their rights officially, ensuring clarity and preventing future disputes."
