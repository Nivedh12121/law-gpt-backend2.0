Once the petition is accepted, then only the divorce process will start, and both parties will need to appear before the court with their attorneys. A contested divorce is a difficult route to take as it takes up to 1-2 years to finalize.A stay order is a temporary stoppage or postponing of a judicial proceeding.

    "answer": "When considering the issue of whether ‘bank accounts’ fall within the scope of Section 102 of the CrPC, it was held by the Supreme Court inState of Maharashtra vs. Tapas D. Neogy,[2] that even bank accounts fall within the phrase ‘any property’ under Section 102 of the CrPC and could therefore be frozen by the investigating authorities, if found to have direct links with the commission of an offence.The Court in the matter also observed that there should beprima facieevidence to indicate that there are entries in the bank account which can be connected to the commission, result or proceeds of a crime.The most often contravened condition under Section 102 of the CrPC is the requirement to apprise the Magistrate of the seizure of the property. Section 102(3) of the CrPC clearly mandates that “[e]very police officer acting under sub-section (1) shall forthwith report the seizure to the Magistrate having jurisdiction”. The violation of this mandatory condition is what often allows the courts to direct the de-freezing of bank accounts.ou may approach concerned judicial magistrate with an application seeking to de-freeze the bank account for the reasons you may rely uponT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

According to the new guidelines, Passport authorities can consider requests from any applicant requesting a change in date of birth, regardless of when the passport was issued. Your birth certificate would suffice to change your DOB in passport along with some other documents for which DOB can be changed very easily online.Siddharth JainAdvocate, New Delhi6464 Answers102 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Siddharth Jain"

    "answer": "When considering the issue of whether ‘bank accounts’ fall within the scope of Section 102 of the CrPC, it was held by the Supreme Court inState of Maharashtra vs. Tapas D. Neogy,[2] that even bank accounts fall within the phrase ‘any property’ under Section 102 of the CrPC and could therefore be frozen by the investigating authorities, if found to have direct links with the commission of an offence.The Court in the matter also observed that there should beprima facieevidence to indicate that there are entries in the bank account which can be connected to the commission, result or proceeds of a crime.The most often contravened condition under Section 102 of the CrPC is the requirement to apprise the Magistrate of the seizure of the property. Section 102(3) of the CrPC clearly mandates that “[e]very police officer acting under sub-section (1) shall forthwith report the seizure to the Magistrate having jurisdiction”. The violation of this mandatory condition is what often allows the courts to direct the de-freezing of bank accounts.ou may approach concerned judicial magistrate with an application seeking to de-freeze the bank account for the reasons you may rely uponT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "A divorce obtain in U.S. against Indian citizen married as per Hindu rites is not valid in India. Submitting answer to notice or filing objections to divorce will not make the divorce decree valid. Such divorce cannot be enforced in India. If he wants divorce you, he needs to file divorce in Indian court underHindu Marriage Actand even that is not an easy process for him. Divorce is not a platform ticket he can purchase across booking window. The process is lengthy, he has to pay maintenance during the divorce proceedings which takes years. After divorce he will have to pay handsome alimony and even after that is not certain that Indian Court will grant him divorce. Filing rcr will not help you as after rcr decree he fails to join you for two years, it will lead to presumed divorce.Ravi ShindeAdvocate, Hyderabad4923 Answers42 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ravi Shinde"

    "answer": "If one spouse lives in the US and the other in India, it is still possible to file for divorce in the US but according to the latest Supreme Court of India ruling the grounds for divorce should be recognized by Indian law.if one party does not want a divorce and the other one does, then they would need to file for a contested divorce by filing a divorce petition in court. Once the petition is accepted, then only the divorce process will start, and both parties will need to appear before the court with their attorneys. A contested divorce is a difficult route to take as it takes up to 1-2 years to finalize.A stay order is a temporary stoppage or postponing of a judicial proceeding. This stoppage does not mean that the said order has become invalid.

Neogy,[2] that even bank accounts fall within the phrase ‘any property’ under Section 102 of the CrPC and could therefore be frozen by the investigating authorities, if found to have direct links with the commission of an offence.The Court in the matter also observed that there should beprima facieevidence to indicate that there are entries in the bank account which can be connected to the commission, result or proceeds of a crime.The most often contravened condition under Section 102 of the CrPC is the requirement to apprise the Magistrate of the seizure of the property. Section 102(3) of the CrPC clearly mandates that “[e]very police officer acting under sub-section (1) shall forthwith report the seizure to the Magistrate having jurisdiction”.

    "answer": "When considering the issue of whether ‘bank accounts’ fall within the scope of Section 102 of the CrPC, it was held by the Supreme Court inState of Maharashtra vs. Tapas D. Neogy,[2] that even bank accounts fall within the phrase ‘any property’ under Section 102 of the CrPC and could therefore be frozen by the investigating authorities, if found to have direct links with the commission of an offence.The Court in the matter also observed that there should beprima facieevidence to indicate that there are entries in the bank account which can be connected to the commission, result or proceeds of a crime.The most often contravened condition under Section 102 of the CrPC is the requirement to apprise the Magistrate of the seizure of the property. Section 102(3) of the CrPC clearly mandates that “[e]very police officer acting under sub-section (1) shall forthwith report the seizure to the Magistrate having jurisdiction”. The violation of this mandatory condition is what often allows the courts to direct the de-freezing of bank accounts.ou may approach concerned judicial magistrate with an application seeking to de-freeze the bank account for the reasons you may rely uponT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Unfreezing bank account against accused fraudulent transaction",
    "answer": "When considering the issue of whether ‘bank accounts’ fall within the scope of Section 102 of the CrPC, it was held by the Supreme Court inState of Maharashtra vs. Tapas D. Neogy,[2] that even bank accounts fall within the phrase ‘any property’ under Section 102 of the CrPC and could therefore be frozen by the investigating authorities, if found to have direct links with the commission of an offence.The Court in the matter also observed that there should beprima facieevidence to indicate that there are entries in the bank account which can be connected to the commission, result or proceeds of a crime.The most often contravened condition under Section 102 of the CrPC is the requirement to apprise the Magistrate of the seizure of the property. Section 102(3) of the CrPC clearly mandates that “[e]very police officer acting under sub-section (1) shall forthwith report the seizure to the Magistrate having jurisdiction”. The violation of this mandatory condition is what often allows the courts to direct the de-freezing of bank accounts.ou may approach concerned judicial magistrate with an application seeking to de-freeze the bank account for the reasons you may rely uponT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

If you are a victim of signature forgery, it is highly recommended to seek legal advice from an attorney immediately as fraud or forgery cases often have a statute of limitations.What you can do is file an FIR against him in relation to forgery, under sec 420 and 406 of the IPC, and while doing so it will be convenient for you if you will take along with you some documents showing that the sign has been forged.Consult a good lawyer with your details.The opinion of a handwriting expert is secondary evidence under the provisions of sec 45 of the Indian evidence act and so the court may or may not rely on the opinion of a handwriting expert as it is not conclusive proof of evidence therefore what you can do is use the expert opinion for cross-examination of witnesses who signed the third document demolish the fact that he had signed the third document.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Approach them first as blackmail and extortion are crimes under 383 and 384 of IPC, and it is their obligation to enforce the law.What you can do next is talk to an attorney, who is bound by attorney-client privilege not to reveal your secrets.

Finding and punishing wrongdoers is what the police are for. Approach them first as blackmail and extortion are crimes under 383 and 384 of IPC, and it is their obligation to enforce the law.What you can do next is talk to an attorney, who is bound by attorney-client privilege not to reveal your secrets.

    "answer": "The best step that can be taken is the offensive step by filing of a counter case but for this one you will need a lawyer who has well knowledge in this particular field.There are many sections that can help you like Section 120B of IPC, talks about punishment for criminal conspiracy, where if there is a false case registered against you then you can file a case against your wife under this section as her intentions are to crime against you.There is Section 167 of IPC that talks about a public servant framing an incorrect document with intent to cause injury, where if you think that the police is helping your wife for preparing the false case, then you can file a case under this section too.Section 191 of IPC talks in respect of giving false evidence, where if the husband feels or suspects that his wife or any other person is presenting false evidence or false document against him then he can file a case too under this section.And at last, Section 500 of IPC states defamation, where if the reputation of the man which is his biggest asset is defamed by any means than he can drag the person to the court and ask for punishment or remuneration.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "When all partners are resigned then automatically partnership firm get dissolved butthere is no rule which prohibits new partners to carry on the business in the name of the partnership firm.A Partnership Deed acts as the spine of the Partnership firm. It can be modified and altered at any time according to the business requirements or partners’ willingness. The most essential element to bring change in partnership deed is to obtain the consent of partners in form of their signature on the deed.The supplementary partnership deed will remain in force till the validity of the original partnership deed or the validity as expressed in it. The Partnership Deed and the addendum therefore at any time shall not override the provisions of the Partnership Act, 1932 and any other Act as may be applicable to the partnership from time to time.Reconstitution of partnership firm happens when changes are brought about by certain conditions like the retirement of a partner, admission of a new partner or change in terms of business among the existing partners like change in profit sharing etc. This restructuring in firms is known by the term reconstitution of a partnership firm.If all the current partners are desirous of retiring or leaving this partnership firm, then they may have to by a resolution and invoking the clauses of the partnership deed or AOA, have to first add new partners subsequent to which they may decide to quit the firm.Removing a partner from a partnership is often the reverse of adding a partner. There are three main scenarios which could take place if a partner wishes to leave:The remaining partners can use their own money to buy out the leaving partner and take control of their shares.The remaining partners can pay out the value of the leaving partner's capital account and include a cash bonus.The leaving partner can pay a bonus to the remaining partners by not fully cashing out their capital balance. This capital balance will be split between the remaining partners.If the rental agreement is on the name of the firm and not on the names of the partners, the new partners can undertake to pay the rental amount in future on behalf of the firm by sending an intimation to the owner to this effect.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

Your summary gives the impression that there was an expectation of rent, which would make them tenants as opposed to occupants in permissive possession.If the occupants are tenants, your remedy is either to file a suit for recovery of possession after termination of tenancy as per the Transfer or Property Act or an eviction petition under the local rent-control statute (depending on the amount of monthly rent).If these occupants were put into permissive possession of the property without any expectation of rent, you will need to bring a suit for recovery of possession against the occupants.In all likelihood, these occupants will take the plea of adverse possession.I will need the exact facts of your case to give you a more definitive answer.Hope that answers your question for now.

    "question": "Booking Cancellation - Builder not refunding the booking amount",
    "answer": "- There is no guidelines laid down by the government to forfeit the booking amount for the cancellation, and the deduction is done at the builder’s discretion.- Hence, legally, the builder cannot deduct any money out of the advance payment you have made for the booking till the time; a builder-buyer agreement is made and registered with the sub-registrar.- Further, A builder-buyer agreement is not created until the buyer pays at least 10 per cent of the property value.- Further, as per Real Estate Regulation Act (RERA), home-buyers can cancel allotment of the apartment booked with a builder at any stage even if there is no default on the part of the developer. The builder is bound by law to return the money collected from buyers within 45 days, after deducting the booking amount.- Hence, if you have already paid 10 percent of the flat value, and the said agreement signed by you , is not registered in the office of the Registrar , then you are liable to get full amount refund paid by you ,even there is a clause present in the agreement for not refunding  , and if the said agreement is registered , then builder has right to deduct booking amount from the paid amount.- If, builder not refunding the same ,then you should lodge your complaint before the Consumer court , and thereby prayed for the refund of paid amount with interest.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Booking Cancellation - Builder not refunding the booking amount",
    "answer": "1. In case you are buying a brand new unit in an under-construction project from a builder, by the time the builder-buyer agreement is created, the buyer has to arrangeanother trance of the advance payment, which is typically 10% of the property’s value, after which the document is registered to attain a legal validity. As long as the agreement is not registered, the seller cannot deduct any money from the advance amount. If the buyer is able to negotiate well, he may be able to get his entire money refunded.2.  Once the builder-buyer agreement is registered, the seller is legally empowered to forfeit a certain portion of this amount.If the buyer is not happy with the developer’s conduct, vis-à-vis the refunding of money, they can approach the Real Estate Regulatory Authority in their state. This can be done, if the seller is a developer and the unit purchased is an under-construction property.3. Unless a buyer is willfully trying to sabotage the deal, developers are open to refunding the booking amount, as long as the reason behind the cancellation is genuine and legitimateT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Retirement of all partners and admission of new partners in same deed and on same date",
    "answer": "When all partners are resigned then automatically partnership firm get dissolved butthere is no rule which prohibits new partners to carry on the business in the name of the partnership firm.A Partnership Deed acts as the spine of the Partnership firm. It can be modified and altered at any time according to the business requirements or partners’ willingness. The most essential element to bring change in partnership deed is to obtain the consent of partners in form of their signature on the deed.The supplementary partnership deed will remain in force till the validity of the original partnership deed or the validity as expressed in it. The Partnership Deed and the addendum therefore at any time shall not override the provisions of the Partnership Act, 1932 and any other Act as may be applicable to the partnership from time to time.Reconstitution of partnership firm happens when changes are brought about by certain conditions like the retirement of a partner, admission of a new partner or change in terms of business among the existing partners like change in profit sharing etc. This restructuring in firms is known by the term reconstitution of a partnership firm.If all the current partners are desirous of retiring or leaving this partnership firm, then they may have to by a resolution and invoking the clauses of the partnership deed or AOA, have to first add new partners subsequent to which they may decide to quit the firm.Removing a partner from a partnership is often the reverse of adding a partner. There are three main scenarios which could take place if a partner wishes to leave:The remaining partners can use their own money to buy out the leaving partner and take control of their shares.The remaining partners can pay out the value of the leaving partner's capital account and include a cash bonus.The leaving partner can pay a bonus to the remaining partners by not fully cashing out their capital balance. This capital balance will be split between the remaining partners.If the rental agreement is on the name of the firm and not on the names of the partners, the new partners can undertake to pay the rental amount in future on behalf of the firm by sending an intimation to the owner to this effect.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "For resident Indian seller TDS of 1% is applicable only if the property value is more than 50 lakhs.If your brother's who is co owner, share of consideration value is less than Rs. 50 lakhs, then no TDS will be deducted by the buyer out of the sale consideration amount.However since you are an OCI, the buyer has to deduct TDS out of the share of amount to be settled to you by way of sale consideration amount.Selling of property by NRI is taxable under u/s 195 of the Income Tax Act, 1961.Long term capital gain tax will be 22.66% if NRI is selling a property in India after holding it for more than 3 years. In case holding period is less than 3 years then Short Term Capital Gain Tax will be applicable as per income tax slab. In case of short term capital gain, TDS applicable will be 33.99% irrespective of tax slab of the NRI.Buyer will deposit TDS with Income Tax Department. TDS is applicable even if value of property is less than 50 lakhs.If you are transferring your share in the property to your brother by way of gift deed, then you may have to pay the applicable stamp duty for this registered transaction.But once you have transferred your share in the property to your brother by executing a gift deed, then you cannot legally claim the value of your share out of this property sold by your brother at any stage after you have gifted your share to your brother, because a gift deed cannot be executed for a consideration amount.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Hello,TDS will have to be deducted by the buyer on the entire sale consideration. So both you and your brother will be affected.If the buyer files an application for determination of actual capital gains with the income tax dept., the TDS will be deducted on that (lower) sum and not the entire sale consideration. So you must have this application filed.The TDS will be deducted at different rates in both cases (20-30 percent for you and 1 percent for your brother). I don’t know quite a few things about your case and so can’t give you an exact calculation.Please don’t confuse TDS with your overall tax liability. If your actual liability is lower then you will be eligible for a refund.As for gifting your share and then receiving the proceeds, it will not work because you will merely end up shifting your tax burden insofar as it relates to long-term capital gains to your brother. (Even if this were not an issue, clubbing provisions relating to revocable transfers would negate any benefits to you.)The proposed transaction will be taxed in India as per the DTAA, Article 13(1) whereof makes such transactions taxable where the immovable property is situated.Hope that answers your question.

    "answer": "Hello,TDS will have to be deducted by the buyer on the entire sale consideration. So both you and your brother will be affected.If the buyer files an application for determination of actual capital gains with the income tax dept., the TDS will be deducted on that (lower) sum and not the entire sale consideration. So you must have this application filed.The TDS will be deducted at different rates in both cases (20-30 percent for you and 1 percent for your brother). I don’t know quite a few things about your case and so can’t give you an exact calculation.Please don’t confuse TDS with your overall tax liability. If your actual liability is lower then you will be eligible for a refund.As for gifting your share and then receiving the proceeds, it will not work because you will merely end up shifting your tax burden insofar as it relates to long-term capital gains to your brother. (Even if this were not an issue, clubbing provisions relating to revocable transfers would negate any benefits to you.)The proposed transaction will be taxed in India as per the DTAA, Article 13(1) whereof makes such transactions taxable where the immovable property is situated.Hope that answers your question.

    "question": "Retirement of all partners and admission of new partners in same deed and on same date",
    "answer": "When all partners are resigned then automatically partnership firm get dissolved butthere is no rule which prohibits new partners to carry on the business in the name of the partnership firm.A Partnership Deed acts as the spine of the Partnership firm. It can be modified and altered at any time according to the business requirements or partners’ willingness. The most essential element to bring change in partnership deed is to obtain the consent of partners in form of their signature on the deed.The supplementary partnership deed will remain in force till the validity of the original partnership deed or the validity as expressed in it. The Partnership Deed and the addendum therefore at any time shall not override the provisions of the Partnership Act, 1932 and any other Act as may be applicable to the partnership from time to time.Reconstitution of partnership firm happens when changes are brought about by certain conditions like the retirement of a partner, admission of a new partner or change in terms of business among the existing partners like change in profit sharing etc. This restructuring in firms is known by the term reconstitution of a partnership firm.If all the current partners are desirous of retiring or leaving this partnership firm, then they may have to by a resolution and invoking the clauses of the partnership deed or AOA, have to first add new partners subsequent to which they may decide to quit the firm.Removing a partner from a partnership is often the reverse of adding a partner. There are three main scenarios which could take place if a partner wishes to leave:The remaining partners can use their own money to buy out the leaving partner and take control of their shares.The remaining partners can pay out the value of the leaving partner's capital account and include a cash bonus.The leaving partner can pay a bonus to the remaining partners by not fully cashing out their capital balance. This capital balance will be split between the remaining partners.If the rental agreement is on the name of the firm and not on the names of the partners, the new partners can undertake to pay the rental amount in future on behalf of the firm by sending an intimation to the owner to this effect.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Hello Mr. Pande,There is some confusion as to the status of the occupants. Your summary gives the impression that there was an expectation of rent, which would make them tenants as opposed to occupants in permissive possession.If the occupants are tenants, your remedy is either to file a suit for recovery of possession after termination of tenancy as per the Transfer or Property Act or an eviction petition under the local rent-control statute (depending on the amount of monthly rent).If these occupants were put into permissive possession of the property without any expectation of rent, you will need to bring a suit for recovery of possession against the occupants.In all likelihood, these occupants will take the plea of adverse possession.I will need the exact facts of your case to give you a more definitive answer.Hope that answers your question for now.

    "answer": "The first thing you can do is send a notice to the people living on your property regarding the eviction. To do so, you will have to file an eviction notice in a court under the suitable jurisdiction stating why you want the property to be vacated (do mention by what time and date you expect them to vacate the property). Even after this if the family is not ready to leave then you can hire a rental property lawyer and file an eviction suit against the people living at your place in a civil court in whose jurisdiction your property falls. As these occupants are living for many years and there is no existence of any agreement this might be a case where interference of court might be necessary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Hello Mr. Pande,There is some confusion as to the status of the occupants. Your summary gives the impression that there was an expectation of rent, which would make them tenants as opposed to occupants in permissive possession.If the occupants are tenants, your remedy is either to file a suit for recovery of possession after termination of tenancy as per the Transfer or Property Act or an eviction petition under the local rent-control statute (depending on the amount of monthly rent).If these occupants were put into permissive possession of the property without any expectation of rent, you will need to bring a suit for recovery of possession against the occupants.In all likelihood, these occupants will take the plea of adverse possession.I will need the exact facts of your case to give you a more definitive answer.Hope that answers your question for now.

    "answer": "For resident Indian seller TDS of 1% is applicable only if the property value is more than 50 lakhs.If your brother's who is co owner, share of consideration value is less than Rs. 50 lakhs, then no TDS will be deducted by the buyer out of the sale consideration amount.However since you are an OCI, the buyer has to deduct TDS out of the share of amount to be settled to you by way of sale consideration amount.Selling of property by NRI is taxable under u/s 195 of the Income Tax Act, 1961.Long term capital gain tax will be 22.66% if NRI is selling a property in India after holding it for more than 3 years. In case holding period is less than 3 years then Short Term Capital Gain Tax will be applicable as per income tax slab. In case of short term capital gain, TDS applicable will be 33.99% irrespective of tax slab of the NRI.Buyer will deposit TDS with Income Tax Department. TDS is applicable even if value of property is less than 50 lakhs.If you are transferring your share in the property to your brother by way of gift deed, then you may have to pay the applicable stamp duty for this registered transaction.But once you have transferred your share in the property to your brother by executing a gift deed, then you cannot legally claim the value of your share out of this property sold by your brother at any stage after you have gifted your share to your brother, because a gift deed cannot be executed for a consideration amount.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Capital gains tax on sale of flat - where the co-owner is an OCI card holder.",
    "answer": "Hello,TDS will have to be deducted by the buyer on the entire sale consideration. So both you and your brother will be affected.If the buyer files an application for determination of actual capital gains with the income tax dept., the TDS will be deducted on that (lower) sum and not the entire sale consideration. So you must have this application filed.The TDS will be deducted at different rates in both cases (20-30 percent for you and 1 percent for your brother). I don’t know quite a few things about your case and so can’t give you an exact calculation.Please don’t confuse TDS with your overall tax liability. If your actual liability is lower then you will be eligible for a refund.As for gifting your share and then receiving the proceeds, it will not work because you will merely end up shifting your tax burden insofar as it relates to long-term capital gains to your brother. (Even if this were not an issue, clubbing provisions relating to revocable transfers would negate any benefits to you.)The proposed transaction will be taxed in India as per the DTAA, Article 13(1) whereof makes such transactions taxable where the immovable property is situated.Hope that answers your question.

    "answer": "Hello,TDS will have to be deducted by the buyer on the entire sale consideration. So both you and your brother will be affected.If the buyer files an application for determination of actual capital gains with the income tax dept., the TDS will be deducted on that (lower) sum and not the entire sale consideration. So you must have this application filed.The TDS will be deducted at different rates in both cases (20-30 percent for you and 1 percent for your brother). I don’t know quite a few things about your case and so can’t give you an exact calculation.Please don’t confuse TDS with your overall tax liability. If your actual liability is lower then you will be eligible for a refund.As for gifting your share and then receiving the proceeds, it will not work because you will merely end up shifting your tax burden insofar as it relates to long-term capital gains to your brother. (Even if this were not an issue, clubbing provisions relating to revocable transfers would negate any benefits to you.)The proposed transaction will be taxed in India as per the DTAA, Article 13(1) whereof makes such transactions taxable where the immovable property is situated.Hope that answers your question.

The builder is bound by law to return the money collected from buyers within 45 days, after deducting the booking amount.- Hence, if you have already paid 10 percent of the flat value, and the said agreement signed by you , is not registered in the office of the Registrar , then you are liable to get full amount refund paid by you ,even there is a clause present in the agreement for not refunding  , and if the said agreement is registered , then builder has right to deduct booking amount from the paid amount.- If, builder not refunding the same ,then you should lodge your complaint before the Consumer court , and thereby prayed for the refund of paid amount with interest.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "- There is no guidelines laid down by the government to forfeit the booking amount for the cancellation, and the deduction is done at the builder’s discretion.- Hence, legally, the builder cannot deduct any money out of the advance payment you have made for the booking till the time; a builder-buyer agreement is made and registered with the sub-registrar.- Further, A builder-buyer agreement is not created until the buyer pays at least 10 per cent of the property value.- Further, as per Real Estate Regulation Act (RERA), home-buyers can cancel allotment of the apartment booked with a builder at any stage even if there is no default on the part of the developer. The builder is bound by law to return the money collected from buyers within 45 days, after deducting the booking amount.- Hence, if you have already paid 10 percent of the flat value, and the said agreement signed by you , is not registered in the office of the Registrar , then you are liable to get full amount refund paid by you ,even there is a clause present in the agreement for not refunding  , and if the said agreement is registered , then builder has right to deduct booking amount from the paid amount.- If, builder not refunding the same ,then you should lodge your complaint before the Consumer court , and thereby prayed for the refund of paid amount with interest.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Booking Cancellation - Builder not refunding the booking amount",
    "answer": "1. In case you are buying a brand new unit in an under-construction project from a builder, by the time the builder-buyer agreement is created, the buyer has to arrangeanother trance of the advance payment, which is typically 10% of the property’s value, after which the document is registered to attain a legal validity. As long as the agreement is not registered, the seller cannot deduct any money from the advance amount. If the buyer is able to negotiate well, he may be able to get his entire money refunded.2.  Once the builder-buyer agreement is registered, the seller is legally empowered to forfeit a certain portion of this amount.If the buyer is not happy with the developer’s conduct, vis-à-vis the refunding of money, they can approach the Real Estate Regulatory Authority in their state. This can be done, if the seller is a developer and the unit purchased is an under-construction property.3. Unless a buyer is willfully trying to sabotage the deal, developers are open to refunding the booking amount, as long as the reason behind the cancellation is genuine and legitimateT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

Prem Singh, in the high Court of Delhi, RFA 269/13, date of decision 15.01.2014 It has been held in this case after relying upon the judgment of S.T. Sahib Vs. N.Hasan Ghani Sahib, AIR 1957, Madras 646 that, \"the action for malicious prosecution is not favoured in law and should be properly guarded and its true principles strictly adhered to, since public policy favours the exposure of a crime and it is highly desirable that those reasonable suspected of crime be subjected to the process of criminal law for the protection of society and the citizen be accorded immunity for bona fide efforts to bring anti-social members to the society to the bar of justice. It was thus held, that to be successful in a suit for malicious prosecution, it is imperative for the plaintiff to show that the proceedings had been instituted against him for an offence which was groundless as evidenced by the successful termination of the proceedings in his favour, and which were instituted against him by the defendant „without probable cause‟ and from „malicious motives‟ i.e. for indirect and improper motive\"Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "question": "Termination/notice period",
    "answer": "- As per Specific Relief Act, if any employee quits before the notice period, the Employer can only recover the Notice pay, and the Company cannot force to serve the entire notice period.- Further, the resignation decision is the employee’s decision, and the employer cannot sue for breach of contract, if the employee leaves without serving contractual notice.- Further, no employer can refused to return the original certificates or to issue relieving letter .If they are doing so, their act is illegal, unjustified and against the fundamental rights of the employee.- Further, the employment bond with the negative covenant is valid and legally enforceable, if the parties agree with their free consent i.e. without force, coercion, undue influence, misrepresentation and mistake, but it is not enforceable, if it is either one sided, unconscionable or unreasonable.- Further, the probationary periods are often applied to new employees as a means of determining their capabilities in a new job.- Hence, the employer can terminate during the probation, and employee can also leave the job with the terms and conditions mentioned in the appointment letter for probation.- Hence, if an employee leaves the job during the probation period, then it not harm his career, and generally many company stipulates in contract, that during probation period either party can terminate the job with or without any notices.- Since, you have only worked for a few days , then notice period not applied on you ,and you are under no obligation to pay the notice period amount.You can contact me, if further suggestion needed.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

The mental health may deteriorated slowly and the affected person may not sense that anything was wrong until it will blow out of proportion.  Recovery is a terrible process. But by constant care of psychiatrist and psychologist, one can get cured over the period of time.Therefore it cannot be said that it is an incurable disease.Mental health conditions, such as depression or anxiety, are real, common and treatable, andrecovery is possible.If it is curable disease then the suppression of the said illness cannot be a material to file a petition seeking annulment of marriage within one year from the date of marriage..Alternately you can wait for one completion of your marriage and file a divorce case on the grounds of cruelty stating that suppression of her mental illness is an act of cruelty.For now you remain silent and endure the difficult situation somehow, wait for one year completion of the marriage and then initiate action as suggested if the situation do not improve or the threats persist.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Dealing with depression and anxiety causing mental illness can very much ruin lives. This mental illness will show up, time and time again, that it holds one back. It will robs him or her of everything her or his ability to live. The mental health may deteriorated slowly and the affected person may not sense that anything was wrong until it will blow out of proportion.  Recovery is a terrible process. But by constant care of psychiatrist and psychologist, one can get cured over the period of time.Therefore it cannot be said that it is an incurable disease.Mental health conditions, such as depression or anxiety, are real, common and treatable, andrecovery is possible.If it is curable disease then the suppression of the said illness cannot be a material to file a petition seeking annulment of marriage within one year from the date of marriage..Alternately you can wait for one completion of your marriage and file a divorce case on the grounds of cruelty stating that suppression of her mental illness is an act of cruelty.For now you remain silent and endure the difficult situation somehow, wait for one year completion of the marriage and then initiate action as suggested if the situation do not improve or the threats persist.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "- As per law, an employee is eligible to receive gratuity, only if he has completed minimum five years of service with an establishment.- However, it can be paid before the completion of five years at the death of an employee or if he has become disabled due to accident or disease.- Further , as per Madras High Court, the gratuity of an employee who completes 4 years and 240 days of service  is eligible for gratuity.- Further, as per Section 2A(1) , an employee shall be said to be in continuous service for a period if he has, for that period, been in uninterrupted service, including service which may be interrupted on account of sickness, accident, leave, absence from duty without leave.- And further, Section 4(2) of the Payment of Gratuity Act provides that for every completed year of service in excess of six months, the employer shall pay gratuity to an employee for the whole year. That means if an employee works in the establishment for more than 6 months in a year, he shall be eligible to get gratuity , if the employee has had continuous service of 190 / 240 days.- And further , since completed year of service is basis continuous service, hence for the establishment which working is less than 6 days in a week , rule of 4 years 190 days will be applicable , and for the establishment working 6 days working rule of 240 would be applicable.- Hence, you are entitled to get the gratuity.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"
