    "question": "Bail cancellation and filing of application on the day of order",
    "answer": "\"The bail already granted may be cancelledif it is found that the person who has been granted the benefit of bail has violated any of the conditions or misused the liberty by influencing the witnesses or tampering with the evidence.It is no doubt correct that cancellation of bail is not limited to the occurrence of supervening circumstances for a court to cancel the bail. In Ash Mohammed Vs. Shiv Raj Singh @ Lalla Babu and another [2012 (4) Crimes 144(SC)], the Supreme Court has stated that there is no defined universal rule that applies in every single case. Hence, in no way one can say for sure that once bail is granted to the accused, it can only be cancelled on grounds of likelihood of abuse of the bail. In light of such observation, a court is empowered to critically analyze the soundness of the bail order. Moreover, it should check its reasoning to avoid delivery of any capricious order while cancelling the bail of an accused, since the liberty of an individual being at stake makes the court all the more accountable for its decision.In Prakash Kadam and others Vs. Ram Prasad Vishwanath Gupta and another (2011 (6) SCC 189), the Supreme Court has observed, that while considering a matter dealing with cancellation of bail, the Court must consider the gravity and nature of the offence (although not the sole basis to refuse prayer for bail, see SC judgement in Prabhakar Tewari Vs. State of UP), the prima-facie case against the accused, the position and status of the accused. If the allegations leveled against the accused are very serious in nature then his bail may be cancelled even if there has been no misuse of the bail granted to him.However the court at its discretionary powers the court may allow the accused to file additional documents in his support to object the cancellation supplication"

The court may at its discretion, grant the accused person an additional opportunity to submit supporting documentation for his objection to the cancellation application.

    "answer": "Basically,  the water supply has not been disconnected to the defaulters neither the water is supplied to other members who are promptly paying their monthly maintenance charges .As the bore-well has dried up and there is no pipeline water supply  the association is making an alternate arrangement by supplying water through water tankers  to its members.The only fault on the part of the association is that it has included he expenses for supplying water through water tanker has been included in the monthly maintenance bills because of which the defaulting members are taking more advantage.The association should stop collecting the the additional charges towrds supply of water through tankers along with the monthly maintenance bill.It should collect the charges from its members directly each and every time whenever this expenses occurs, in that case they can very well inform the defaulting members to pay the charges and avail the water supply facilities.They cannot object or agitate to this arrangement because it is a common rule applicable to all the members equally.You may note that the recovery of defaulted maintenance amount can be done by issuing a legal demand notice and filing as suit for recovery through civil courtThe default in payment of monthly maintenance amount is not a criminal offenceThe MC members can decide accordingly.The police has nothing to do with this civil matter hence police cannot interfere in this.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Agreement cancellation procedure",
    "answer": "- There is no provision in the law to forfeit the booking amount for the cancellation, and the deduction is done at the builder’s discretion.- Hence, legally, the builder cannot deduct any money out of the advance payment you have made for the booking till the time; a builder-buyer agreement is made and registered with the sub-registrar.- Further, A builder-buyer agreement is not created until the buyer pays at least 10 per cent of the property value.- Further, as per RERA, home-buyers can cancel allotment of the apartment booked with a builder at any stage even if there is no default on the part of the builder . The builder is bound by law to return the money collected from buyers within 45 days, after deducting the booking amount.- Hence, if you have already paid 10 percent of the flat value, and the said agreement signed by you , is not registered in the office of the Registrar , then you are liable to get full amount refund paid by you ,even there is a clause present in the agreement for not refunding  , and if the said agreement is registered , then builder has right to deduct booking amount from the paid amount.- Send a notice to the builder to cancel the allotment and to refund the money paid by you.- If, builder not refunding the same ,then you can file your complaint before the Consumer court , and thereby prayed for the refund of paid amount with interest.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Withdraw from buying a flat, 3 months after signing Sale Agreement",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Whether you can withdraw from the agreement depends on the terms outlined in the Sale Agreement you signed with the builder. Generally, most Sale Agreements include provisions for cancellation and withdrawal, but they often come with certain conditions and penalties. Regarding the builder's cancellation policy, it's not uncommon for builders to have clauses stating that the entire amount or a portion of it will not be refunded in case of cancellation. However, the legality of such clauses depends on the specific terms and local regulations governing property transactions in Hyderabad. It's advisable to consult with a legal expert or a real estate attorney who can review the agreement and provide guidance on the legality of the cancellation policy. If the builder's cancellation policy states that the entire amount paid will not be refunded, then there's a possibility that you may lose the entire 13 lakhs. Again, this would depend on the specific terms of the agreement and the applicable laws. Your options may include negotiating with the builder for a partial refund, seeking legal advice to understand your rights and options, or exploring alternative solutions such as finding another buyer for your Bangalore plot or finding alternative sources of funding for the flat purchase. It's essential to carefully review the terms of the Sale Agreement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Basically,  the water supply has not been disconnected to the defaulters neither the water is supplied to other members who are promptly paying their monthly maintenance charges .As the bore-well has dried up and there is no pipeline water supply  the association is making an alternate arrangement by supplying water through water tankers  to its members.The only fault on the part of the association is that it has included he expenses for supplying water through water tanker has been included in the monthly maintenance bills because of which the defaulting members are taking more advantage.The association should stop collecting the the additional charges towrds supply of water through tankers along with the monthly maintenance bill.It should collect the charges from its members directly each and every time whenever this expenses occurs, in that case they can very well inform the defaulting members to pay the charges and avail the water supply facilities.They cannot object or agitate to this arrangement because it is a common rule applicable to all the members equally.You may note that the recovery of defaulted maintenance amount can be done by issuing a legal demand notice and filing as suit for recovery through civil courtThe default in payment of monthly maintenance amount is not a criminal offenceThe MC members can decide accordingly.The police has nothing to do with this civil matter hence police cannot interfere in this.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Withdraw from buying a flat, 3 months after signing Sale Agreement",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Whether you can withdraw from the agreement depends on the terms outlined in the Sale Agreement you signed with the builder. Generally, most Sale Agreements include provisions for cancellation and withdrawal, but they often come with certain conditions and penalties. Regarding the builder's cancellation policy, it's not uncommon for builders to have clauses stating that the entire amount or a portion of it will not be refunded in case of cancellation. However, the legality of such clauses depends on the specific terms and local regulations governing property transactions in Hyderabad. It's advisable to consult with a legal expert or a real estate attorney who can review the agreement and provide guidance on the legality of the cancellation policy. If the builder's cancellation policy states that the entire amount paid will not be refunded, then there's a possibility that you may lose the entire 13 lakhs. Again, this would depend on the specific terms of the agreement and the applicable laws. Your options may include negotiating with the builder for a partial refund, seeking legal advice to understand your rights and options, or exploring alternative solutions such as finding another buyer for your Bangalore plot or finding alternative sources of funding for the flat purchase. It's essential to carefully review the terms of the Sale Agreement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Withdraw from buying a flat, 3 months after signing Sale Agreement",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Whether you can withdraw from the agreement depends on the terms outlined in the Sale Agreement you signed with the builder. Generally, most Sale Agreements include provisions for cancellation and withdrawal, but they often come with certain conditions and penalties. Regarding the builder's cancellation policy, it's not uncommon for builders to have clauses stating that the entire amount or a portion of it will not be refunded in case of cancellation. However, the legality of such clauses depends on the specific terms and local regulations governing property transactions in Hyderabad. It's advisable to consult with a legal expert or a real estate attorney who can review the agreement and provide guidance on the legality of the cancellation policy. If the builder's cancellation policy states that the entire amount paid will not be refunded, then there's a possibility that you may lose the entire 13 lakhs. Again, this would depend on the specific terms of the agreement and the applicable laws. Your options may include negotiating with the builder for a partial refund, seeking legal advice to understand your rights and options, or exploring alternative solutions such as finding another buyer for your Bangalore plot or finding alternative sources of funding for the flat purchase. It's essential to carefully review the terms of the Sale Agreement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The builder is bound by law to return the money collected from buyers within 45 days, after deducting the booking amount.- Hence, if you have already paid 10 percent of the flat value, and the said agreement signed by you , is not registered in the office of the Registrar , then you are liable to get full amount refund paid by you ,even there is a clause present in the agreement for not refunding  , and if the said agreement is registered , then builder has right to deduct booking amount from the paid amount.- Send a notice to the builder to cancel the allotment and to refund the money paid by you.- If, builder not refunding the same ,then you can file your complaint before the Consumer court , and thereby prayed for the refund of paid amount with interest.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Transfer of immovable property to partner as drawings",
    "answer": "In India, the transfer of property from a firm to its partners in their personal names is governed by the Indian Partnership Act of 1932. The Act defines the rights, duties, and liabilities of partners in a partnership firm. The jurisdiction for matters related to partnerships and property transfers in Maharashtra falls under the Courts in Maharashtra.When a firm intends to transfer its property to all partners in their personal names, the process typically involves the dissolution and reconstitution of the firm. Each partner would need to agree to take ownership of the property individually, and legal documents such as deeds of conveyance or transfer would have to be executed to effectuate the transfer.If a firm wants to transfer property to only two partners while one partner holds a minority stake as a sleeping partner, the consent of the sleeping partner would likely be necessary due to their legal stake in the firm. The terms of the partnership agreement would also need to be reviewed to ascertain the rights and obligations of each partner in relation to property transfers.Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighCourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "answer": "Hello there,In India, bigamy is a punishable offense under Section 494 of theIndian Penal Code, which states that whoever, having a spouse living, marries in any case in which such marriage is void by reason of its taking place during the life of such spouse, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.The fact that your marriage was a Hindu marriage and registered can strengthen your case. However, as your husband is currently residing abroad, the process of legal action and enforcement can be more complex. It may involve international legal procedures and cooperation between countries in order to apprehend and bring him to justice.for more information, you can connect with me and if you are satisfied with the answer, kindly click on 5 star.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighCourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

If you believe that there has been judicial misconduct or bias due to the involvement of the principal district court judge's family, you may consider lodging a complaint with the High Court. Consult with your advocate to prepare a detailed complaint outlining the alleged misconduct and providing supporting evidence. Your advocate should explore options for seeking emergency relief, such as filing for a stay order or injunction to halt further construction pending the resolution of the dispute.

    "answer": "Dear client,In your legal situation, it is necessary to deal with the procedural irregularities on the wrong entry of defendants and the unclear addresses that has hindered proper delivery of summons. These are relevant when giving a petition to have the ex-parte injunction set aside on the 1st of October in the year 2024 be kicked out because under the CPC under Order V, proper service must have been made. You should consider bringing an application for contempt against Judge P. Nageswara Rao for granting the injunction when there is no sufficient basis to do so without sufficient notice violating your rights and procedurally unfair. Although there are concerns that complaints against both judges should be made, it may be more beneficial to aim at the junior judge if you think he is pressured by the first judge. Whatever samples of his calls or conversation or other such material for substantiating the allegations compiled by her must be compiled completely. The approach is associated with Section 27 of the CPC pointing out that proper summon and fair hearing should be conducted in the case.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "1.It is a matter of trial, the IO's report is not final neither you can disprove it at this stage, you ma have to get them nullified only during cross examination of IO.About the photographs, it is not admissible as primary evidence unless it is supported by a certificate under section 65B of Indian evidence act, hence don't strain over it now itself.2. No criminal case will be entertained against the police for this, the report given by them is not final, you can get them falsified during trial proceedings.3. This alone cannot be a ground for quashing the charge sheet, you may have to rely upon the factual incidents that took place between you both during your married life and highlight her acts of cruelties in your memorandum of grounds for quashing the charge sheet. The statements made before police are not any reason to rely upon to quash the charge sheet, they are actually not reliable statements or reports, they can be dealt with properly during trial proceedings, hence don't get excited over it at this preliminary stage.4. These cannot be the reasons for quashing the charge sheet.The grounds for quashing the charge sheet will be based on the complaint and the contents of the charge sheet.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Co accused turned against - witness of opposite party",
    "answer": "Hello there,Here are some general principles that may guide you in understanding the situation:1.If your cousin turns witness against your brother in the rape case in which he is a co-accused, the court will assess the credibility and reliability of his testimony. The fact that he may have come under the influence of the opposite party could be a factor that is considered by the court in assessing his testimony. However, ultimately, it will depend on the evidence presented and the overall credibility of his testimony.2.In cases likeDomestic Violence(DV), if your cousin turns as a new witness, the same principles would apply. The court would consider the circumstances under which he came forward as a witness and assess the reliability of his testimony. Again, the fact that he may be under the influence of the opposite party could be a relevant factor in this assessment.3.If your cousin's brothers are willing to testify that he is under the influence of the opposite party, this evidence could potentially be helpful in supporting your position. However, the court will still need to independently evaluate the credibility of this testimony and its relevance to the case at hand.for more information, you can connect with me and if you are satisfied with the answer, kindly click on 5 star.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighCourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "question": "Transfer of credentials including turnover from proprietor to newly formed partnership",
    "answer": "Your credentials and experience of many years can be used by newly formed partnership firm wherein you are one of the partners of the firm to participate in tenders2) the said requirement regarding experience cannot be construed to mean that the said experience should be of the tenderer in his name only. It is possible to visualise a situation where a person having past experience has entered into a partnership and the tender has been submitted in the name of the partnership firm which may not have any past experience in its own name. That does not mean that the earlier experience of one of the partners of the firm cannot be taken into consideration.3)New Horizons Ltd. v. Union of India, (1995) 1 SCC 478, tthe Supreme Court indicated the correct approach in interpreting terms of an invitation to tender, to the following effect:W.P.(C) 1712/2017 Page 6of 20 \"the requirement regarding experience does not mean that the offer of the original company must be considered because it has experience in its name though it does not have experienced persons with it and ignore the offer of the new company because it does not have experience in its name though it has persons having experience in the field. While considering the requirement regarding experience it has to be borne in mind that the said requirement is contained in a document inviting offers for a commercial transaction. The terms and conditions of such a document have to be construed from the standpoint of a prudent businessman. When a businessman enters into a contract whereunder some work is to be performed he seeks to assure himself about the credentials of the person who is to be entrusted with the performance of the work. Such credentials are to be examined from a commercial point of view which means that if the contract is to be entered with a company he will look into the background of the company and the persons who are in control of the same and their capacity to execute the work. He would go not by the name of the company but by the persons behind the company.\"4) rely upon SC judgment cited herein aboveAjay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98560 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "answer": "Drafting of the Partnership Deed would be the first step in conversion of a sole proprietorship into a partnership firm.The major inclusion in the deed must be the declaration about the sole proprietorship which is being converted into a partnership by adding more partners and bringing in investment.The deed must also state the details of all the changes expected to occur with the introduction of the new business partners.After this, transfer all assets and liabilities into partnership firms as sale of business by proprietor to partnership firm.Experience gained from erstwhile proprietorship firm could not be construed as experience of partners in an individual capacity if applied independently without the partners in any tender.In a judgment of Supreme Court in New Horizons Ltd. v. Union of India, (1995) 1 SCC 478, wherein it was held that in the absence of any exclusionary clause in the tender document, it could not be said that past experience of a partner of the firm could not be considered.The Bench opined that coercing a tender inviting authority to blindly treat experience in the name of an erstwhile partnership firm as the experience of the partner in his individual capacity, would militate against every judicious consideration.This applies to proprietorship firm too.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Indicators for the technical capacity and experience field are quite diverse depending on the sector and project type or technology demanded for the specific project.It is necessary to assess carefully how realistic and achievable the threshold values or levels of experience are. Using similar and successful precedents is helpfulDescribe the features to be met for a project to qualify as evidence of experience (that is, in order to be counted in the evaluation).Avoid duplication in the criteria so as to avoid double counting certain types of experience (which may result in an over weighting).The evidence that will be requested to confirm the existence of the experience claimed will have to be validated or be capable of validation.This can be done in a variety of ways, such as requiring certificates from the government/client for past projects, or simply requiring contact details for a key person with the relevant government/client so that the accuracy of the information can be checked.It is often appropriate to only count experience if the relevant member of the consortium commits a certain minimum percentage of the equity in the project.For instance, project experience will only count if a member of the consortium invested more than a specific percentage of the equity in that project.This means that the involvement of the consortium member in that project provided it with substantial experience that is relevant to the project currently in the tender process.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "In India, the transfer of property from a firm to its partners in their personal names is governed by the Indian Partnership Act of 1932. The Act defines the rights, duties, and liabilities of partners in a partnership firm. The jurisdiction for matters related to partnerships and property transfers in Maharashtra falls under the Courts in Maharashtra.When a firm intends to transfer its property to all partners in their personal names, the process typically involves the dissolution and reconstitution of the firm. Each partner would need to agree to take ownership of the property individually, and legal documents such as deeds of conveyance or transfer would have to be executed to effectuate the transfer.If a firm wants to transfer property to only two partners while one partner holds a minority stake as a sleeping partner, the consent of the sleeping partner would likely be necessary due to their legal stake in the firm. The terms of the partnership agreement would also need to be reviewed to ascertain the rights and obligations of each partner in relation to property transfers.Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighCourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "question": "Transfer of immovable property to partner as drawings",
    "answer": "In India, the transfer of property from a firm to its partners in their personal names is governed by the Indian Partnership Act of 1932. The Act defines the rights, duties, and liabilities of partners in a partnership firm. The jurisdiction for matters related to partnerships and property transfers in Maharashtra falls under the Courts in Maharashtra.When a firm intends to transfer its property to all partners in their personal names, the process typically involves the dissolution and reconstitution of the firm. Each partner would need to agree to take ownership of the property individually, and legal documents such as deeds of conveyance or transfer would have to be executed to effectuate the transfer.If a firm wants to transfer property to only two partners while one partner holds a minority stake as a sleeping partner, the consent of the sleeping partner would likely be necessary due to their legal stake in the firm. The terms of the partnership agreement would also need to be reviewed to ascertain the rights and obligations of each partner in relation to property transfers.Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighCourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

The fact that he may have come under the influence of the opposite party could be a factor that is considered by the court in assessing his testimony. However, ultimately, it will depend on the evidence presented and the overall credibility of his testimony.2.In cases likeDomestic Violence(DV), if your cousin turns as a new witness, the same principles would apply. The court would consider the circumstances under which he came forward as a witness and assess the reliability of his testimony. Again, the fact that he may be under the influence of the opposite party could be a relevant factor in this assessment.3.If your cousin's brothers are willing to testify that he is under the influence of the opposite party, this evidence could potentially be helpful in supporting your position. However, the court will still need to independently evaluate the credibility of this testimony and its relevance to the case at hand.for more information, you can connect with me and if you are satisfied with the answer, kindly click on 5 star.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighCourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

These are relevant when giving a petition to have the ex-parte injunction set aside on the 1st of October in the year 2024 be kicked out because under the CPC under Order V, proper service must have been made. You should consider bringing an application for contempt against Judge P. Nageswara Rao for granting the injunction when there is no sufficient basis to do so without sufficient notice violating your rights and procedurally unfair. Although there are concerns that complaints against both judges should be made, it may be more beneficial to aim at the junior judge if you think he is pressured by the first judge. Whatever samples of his calls or conversation or other such material for substantiating the allegations compiled by her must be compiled completely. The approach is associated with Section 27 of the CPC pointing out that proper summon and fair hearing should be conducted in the case.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The second option is to wait for him to respond till the expiry of the sale agreement period, communicate the decision to cancel the sale agreement and then demand him to return the advance amount with interest till the date of settlement.Failing to comply with this demand you may file a summary suit for recovery of money and seek for attachment before judgment of the property as security towards the advance amount.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

The fact that he may have come under the influence of the opposite party could be a factor that is considered by the court in assessing his testimony. However, ultimately, it will depend on the evidence presented and the overall credibility of his testimony.2.In cases likeDomestic Violence(DV), if your cousin turns as a new witness, the same principles would apply. The court would consider the circumstances under which he came forward as a witness and assess the reliability of his testimony. Again, the fact that he may be under the influence of the opposite party could be a relevant factor in this assessment.3.If your cousin's brothers are willing to testify that he is under the influence of the opposite party, this evidence could potentially be helpful in supporting your position. However, the court will still need to independently evaluate the credibility of this testimony and its relevance to the case at hand.for more information, you can connect with me and if you are satisfied with the answer, kindly click on 5 star.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighCourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

Thus with the consent of the son (in his individual capacity) the son in his capacity of an administrator will transfer the old flat and shares and since the old flat is already demolished , the right of allotment in respect of the new flat , will also be transferred. However since the paaa is already registered in favor of the mother,  this transfer deed will merely complete her title to the new flat and the society can then admit her as an exclusive shareholder in respect of the new flatIndex 2 only gives details of the parties and description of property. Index 2 does not make the mother owner of the new flat. In any event the paaa was registered in her favor as a provisional member and trustee of other heirs (in this case the other heir is the son).The stamp duty on the transfer deed is nominal Rs. 500 plus registration fee.Release deed can also be made. There is no bar against it. The son is entitled to 50% estate of the deceased. So he can very well release his 50% share in favor of his mother. The registrar's refusal to register such release deed is outright illegal. He has no such statutory powers. He has no business to look into the title of the releasor son.Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

The fact that he may have come under the influence of the opposite party could be a factor that is considered by the court in assessing his testimony. However, ultimately, it will depend on the evidence presented and the overall credibility of his testimony.2.In cases likeDomestic Violence(DV), if your cousin turns as a new witness, the same principles would apply. The court would consider the circumstances under which he came forward as a witness and assess the reliability of his testimony. Again, the fact that he may be under the influence of the opposite party could be a relevant factor in this assessment.3.If your cousin's brothers are willing to testify that he is under the influence of the opposite party, this evidence could potentially be helpful in supporting your position. However, the court will still need to independently evaluate the credibility of this testimony and its relevance to the case at hand.for more information, you can connect with me and if you are satisfied with the answer, kindly click on 5 star.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighCourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "context": "Asked 1 year ago in Family Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Relationship and girl friend family issue",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Your situation is quite complex, involving personal relationships, family dynamics, and potential legal implications. Here’s a structured approach to address your concerns and guide you through the process.The primary concern appears to be the resistance from both families due to inter-caste differences and other personal reasons. This is compounded by the legal risks associated with potential false complaints against you, including allegations of harassment or coercion, and the possibility of your girlfriend being pressured into making statements against you.Since both of you are adults (25 years old), under Indian law, you have the right to marry whoever you choose, irrespective of caste or family approval. This is a fundamental right guaranteed by theConstitution of India. If a false complaint is made, it is essential to be prepared with evidence of your relationship and the consent of your girlfriend. Such evidence could include photos, voice recordings, and any written communication that demonstrates mutual consent. This will be crucial in defending against any false allegations.Communication and mediation are essential steps in resolving this issue. It might be helpful to involve neutral, respected elders or mediators from both sides to facilitate discussions. This could help in reducing hostility and reaching a mutual understanding. However, it is important to avoid direct confrontation with her uncle or any family member without mediation, as this may escalate the situation and lead to legal complications or physical altercations.Preserving evidence is vital in this scenario. Keep all evidence of your relationship, including photos, messages, call records, and any documentation that can support your case if legal issues arise. If you visit her family or engage in discussions, consider recording these interactions (if legally permissible) to have evidence of your intentions and conduct. This documentation will be crucial in defending yourself if the situation escalates to legal proceedings.Regarding the incident on 25-05-204, where her uncle tried to beat you and said bad words to your family, it is advisable to avoid direct confrontation. Directly confronting her uncle could lead to further escalation. Given the past violent reaction, it’s better to avoid this approach. If you feel defamed or threatened, discuss with your lawyer the possibility of sending a legal notice demanding an apology or even considering defamation charges if the situation warrants it. Instead of seeking an apology through confrontation, focus on resolving the main issue, which is the acceptance of your relationship or a peaceful mutual agreement.From a legal perspective, several provisions can offer protection and recourse. Under theIndian Penal Code(IPC), sections such as Section 499/500 for defamation andSection 506for criminal intimidation may be relevant if there are false accusations or threats against you. TheSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, allows for inter-caste marriages with legal protection, which could be a viable option if you both decide to marry without family consent. Additionally, if your girlfriend faces harassment or coercion from her family, she can seek protection under the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005.In conclusion, addressing this situation requires a combination of legal, communicative, and supportive measures. Seek advice from a qualified lawyer, involve neutral mediators, preserve all evidence, and ensure both you and your girlfriend receive the necessary psychological support. Prioritize safety and well-being in all actions you take, and focus on achieving a peaceful resolution while protecting your legal rights.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

RERA has been established to protect the interests of homebuyers and to regulate the real estate sector.You can also consider filing a civil suit against the developer for breach of contract. This can be a lengthy and expensive process, but it may be necessary if you are unable to reach a resolution through other means.The time it takes to resolve the issue will vary depending on the specific circumstances of your case and the approach you choose to take.

    "question": "Wife's FIR on 498A filed with 2 police complaints the latest one with 498a ingredients and the old one without 498A ingredients",
    "answer": "Applying the points you pointed can in some way help your attempts at seeking dismissal of the FIR/charge sheet under Section 482 of the CrPC. Here's how-1. Vague Allegations: If the allegations are general and lack specific instances of harassment, it can be argued that the FIR is based on vague and unsubstantiated claims, which can be grounds for quashing.2. Two Police Complaints on the Same Date: Highlighting that two complaints were filed on the same date with the same CSR number, and one was used to file the FIR after the dowry prohibition officer's report cleared you, can indicate a possible fabrication or misuse of legal provisions. This discrepancy can be critical in showing inconsistencies and mala fide intentions.3. RCR Filing: The fact that your wife has filed aRestitution of Conjugal Rights(RCR) case asking you to live with her can be used to show that she has contradictory intentions. It is unusual for someone to seek reconciliation while simultaneously pursuing criminal charges underSection 498A, which can be portrayed as a strategy to pressurise you.4. Detention without 41A Notice: Being detained without prior notice under Section 41A CrPC and then being asked to sign it retrospectively can be a significant procedural violation. This point can highlight police misconduct and procedural lapses, strengthening your case for quashing the FIR.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Co accused turned against - witness of opposite party",
    "answer": "Hello there,Here are some general principles that may guide you in understanding the situation:1.If your cousin turns witness against your brother in the rape case in which he is a co-accused, the court will assess the credibility and reliability of his testimony. The fact that he may have come under the influence of the opposite party could be a factor that is considered by the court in assessing his testimony. However, ultimately, it will depend on the evidence presented and the overall credibility of his testimony.2.In cases likeDomestic Violence(DV), if your cousin turns as a new witness, the same principles would apply. The court would consider the circumstances under which he came forward as a witness and assess the reliability of his testimony. Again, the fact that he may be under the influence of the opposite party could be a relevant factor in this assessment.3.If your cousin's brothers are willing to testify that he is under the influence of the opposite party, this evidence could potentially be helpful in supporting your position. However, the court will still need to independently evaluate the credibility of this testimony and its relevance to the case at hand.for more information, you can connect with me and if you are satisfied with the answer, kindly click on 5 star.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighCourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

Thus with the consent of the son (in his individual capacity) the son in his capacity of an administrator will transfer the old flat and shares and since the old flat is already demolished , the right of allotment in respect of the new flat , will also be transferred. However since the paaa is already registered in favor of the mother,  this transfer deed will merely complete her title to the new flat and the society can then admit her as an exclusive shareholder in respect of the new flatIndex 2 only gives details of the parties and description of property. Index 2 does not make the mother owner of the new flat. In any event the paaa was registered in her favor as a provisional member and trustee of other heirs (in this case the other heir is the son).The stamp duty on the transfer deed is nominal Rs. 500 plus registration fee.Release deed can also be made. There is no bar against it. The son is entitled to 50% estate of the deceased. So he can very well release his 50% share in favor of his mother. The registrar's refusal to register such release deed is outright illegal. He has no such statutory powers. He has no business to look into the title of the releasor son.Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "The deceased was the owner of the old flat and holder of share certificateUpon his demise intestate the flat devolved on his legal heirs being his widow and sonBefore the old flat could be formally transferred to the names of the legal heirs, the old flat came to be demolished as the society went for redevelopmentSince the widow is one of the heirs of the deceased,  the society transferred the share certificate in her nameThus she was holding the share certificate and rights to be allotted the new flat in lieu of the old flat as a trustee or in trust for the son who is the 50% ownerThus even though the paaa is executed in favor of the widow , she is merely holding the new flat as a trusteeFor proper conferment of title the LOA holder who is the son is required to execute and register transfer deed in favor of the heirs of the deceased for transferring the assets of the deceased to his heirsThat formal transfer is not yet doneSo the LOA holder son in his capacity of an administrator has to formally transfer the old flat and shares thereto and the right to be allotted the new flat in favor of the widow , with the son in his individual capacity joining such transfer deed as a confirming partySo the LOA holder will be the transferor in his capacity as an administrator of the estate, the son in his individual capacity will be the confirming party and the widow will be the transferee. Thus with the consent of the son (in his individual capacity) the son in his capacity of an administrator will transfer the old flat and shares and since the old flat is already demolished , the right of allotment in respect of the new flat , will also be transferred. However since the paaa is already registered in favor of the mother,  this transfer deed will merely complete her title to the new flat and the society can then admit her as an exclusive shareholder in respect of the new flatIndex 2 only gives details of the parties and description of property. Index 2 does not make the mother owner of the new flat. In any event the paaa was registered in her favor as a provisional member and trustee of other heirs (in this case the other heir is the son).The stamp duty on the transfer deed is nominal Rs. 500 plus registration fee.Release deed can also be made. There is no bar against it. The son is entitled to 50% estate of the deceased. So he can very well release his 50% share in favor of his mother. The registrar's refusal to register such release deed is outright illegal. He has no such statutory powers. He has no business to look into the title of the releasor son.Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "context": "Asked 1 year ago in Family Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Relationship and girl friend family issue",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Your situation is quite complex, involving personal relationships, family dynamics, and potential legal implications. Here’s a structured approach to address your concerns and guide you through the process.The primary concern appears to be the resistance from both families due to inter-caste differences and other personal reasons. This is compounded by the legal risks associated with potential false complaints against you, including allegations of harassment or coercion, and the possibility of your girlfriend being pressured into making statements against you.Since both of you are adults (25 years old), under Indian law, you have the right to marry whoever you choose, irrespective of caste or family approval. This is a fundamental right guaranteed by theConstitution of India. If a false complaint is made, it is essential to be prepared with evidence of your relationship and the consent of your girlfriend. Such evidence could include photos, voice recordings, and any written communication that demonstrates mutual consent. This will be crucial in defending against any false allegations.Communication and mediation are essential steps in resolving this issue. It might be helpful to involve neutral, respected elders or mediators from both sides to facilitate discussions. This could help in reducing hostility and reaching a mutual understanding. However, it is important to avoid direct confrontation with her uncle or any family member without mediation, as this may escalate the situation and lead to legal complications or physical altercations.Preserving evidence is vital in this scenario. Keep all evidence of your relationship, including photos, messages, call records, and any documentation that can support your case if legal issues arise. If you visit her family or engage in discussions, consider recording these interactions (if legally permissible) to have evidence of your intentions and conduct. This documentation will be crucial in defending yourself if the situation escalates to legal proceedings.Regarding the incident on 25-05-204, where her uncle tried to beat you and said bad words to your family, it is advisable to avoid direct confrontation. Directly confronting her uncle could lead to further escalation. Given the past violent reaction, it’s better to avoid this approach. If you feel defamed or threatened, discuss with your lawyer the possibility of sending a legal notice demanding an apology or even considering defamation charges if the situation warrants it. Instead of seeking an apology through confrontation, focus on resolving the main issue, which is the acceptance of your relationship or a peaceful mutual agreement.From a legal perspective, several provisions can offer protection and recourse. Under theIndian Penal Code(IPC), sections such as Section 499/500 for defamation andSection 506for criminal intimidation may be relevant if there are false accusations or threats against you. TheSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, allows for inter-caste marriages with legal protection, which could be a viable option if you both decide to marry without family consent. Additionally, if your girlfriend faces harassment or coercion from her family, she can seek protection under the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005.In conclusion, addressing this situation requires a combination of legal, communicative, and supportive measures. Seek advice from a qualified lawyer, involve neutral mediators, preserve all evidence, and ensure both you and your girlfriend receive the necessary psychological support. Prioritize safety and well-being in all actions you take, and focus on achieving a peaceful resolution while protecting your legal rights.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "You do not have to stop or take any steps to cancel the divorce proceedings, becasue as you have not actively participated in the divorce proceedings taken place in USA which would be decided in your absence, it is called as an exparte divorce.This exparte divorce granted by USA court for the marriage solemnized in India as per Indian laws is not recognised as legally valid in India, therefore as per Indian laws you will remain married to him, he cannot file any petition to execute the divorce decree to declare it as as valid in India due to the non conformity of Indian laws in this regard.To recognize a foreign divorce decree, the court in India will ensure that there was fairness, good faith, and diligence of each party.Indian courts will not recognize a divorce decree obtained in the US if the grounds are not recognized by the Indian divorce law.The Supreme Court in Y.Narasimha Rao and Ors vs. Y.Venkata Lakshmi and Anr (supra) has already held thatforeigndecreeofdivorcegranted on a ground which is not recognized in India. is not valid in India.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "How to stop a divorce filed in US?",
    "answer": "Who wish to take benefit of Indian laws and legal system to avoid facing up to any foreign judicial system.As per the latest Supreme Court judgment which had held that a decree of divorce granted by a foreign court is not valid in India if the ground is not recognized by Indian law.Generally, amutual consent divorcegranted by a foreign court is considered valid, legal, and binding in Indian courts by virtue of sections 13 and 14 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as well as the comity of nations. Indian courts do not need to validate such divorce decrees granted by foreign courts. However,as amatter of abundant caution, one can approach the Indian Court to declare that divorce isvalid and binding.Foreign orders/decrees/judgments cannot be directly executed in India unless they are the judgments of courts in \"reciprocating territories\". In all other cases, the only mode of giving effect to a foreign judgment is to file a suit on the judgment in an appropriate Indian court, which has to be tested by section 13 of the Civil Procedure Code.If the full and final settlement agreement is signed by both parties in mediation, then both parties are bound to obey the decree. But in India, the decree from the US court can be used as a document in evidence side. The US court has no right to decide on property situated in India in between marital disputes. You can challenge this in India.In the eyes of the Indian judicial system, the property belongs to the person in whose name it's registered.  If the property is in the name of the husband then the wife has no right on that property.As per Indian law, a husband cannot claim rights on wife’s property. A wife cannot claim a share in the property of her husband during his lifetime. During his lifetime, a wife during her marriage is in existence, or even if her marriage gets dissolved by decree of divorce, she has only the right to residence on certain terms and conditions, to be provided by her husband.1. How can the proceeding is US is stopped at this stage before the hearing? Where I need to approach for this?2. In case it is not possible and Judge signs the decree, what course of action I will have in India and where to approach?Do you have any plans to visit the US and stay there ?In such a case you will act otherwise forget about the US court procedure. Legal challenges against US court decisions are permitted under Indian law. US is considered as a Non-Reciprocating Territory’ of India.An award from a ‘Non-Reciprocating Territory’ of India, a fresh suit in an Indian court with appropriate jurisdiction, needs to be instituted.  No doubt that Foreign Judgments from Non-Reciprocating Territories need to pass through the sieve of Indian Judiciary but the sieve used is broad and spacious enough to allow the sink in of ‘the cause of Justice’ upheld by the courts of Foreign Countries.Ajay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

    "question": "Wife's FIR on 498A filed with 2 police complaints the latest one with 498a ingredients and the old one without 498A ingredients",
    "answer": "Applying the points you pointed can in some way help your attempts at seeking dismissal of the FIR/charge sheet under Section 482 of the CrPC. Here's how-1. Vague Allegations: If the allegations are general and lack specific instances of harassment, it can be argued that the FIR is based on vague and unsubstantiated claims, which can be grounds for quashing.2. Two Police Complaints on the Same Date: Highlighting that two complaints were filed on the same date with the same CSR number, and one was used to file the FIR after the dowry prohibition officer's report cleared you, can indicate a possible fabrication or misuse of legal provisions. This discrepancy can be critical in showing inconsistencies and mala fide intentions.3. RCR Filing: The fact that your wife has filed aRestitution of Conjugal Rights(RCR) case asking you to live with her can be used to show that she has contradictory intentions. It is unusual for someone to seek reconciliation while simultaneously pursuing criminal charges underSection 498A, which can be portrayed as a strategy to pressurise you.4. Detention without 41A Notice: Being detained without prior notice under Section 41A CrPC and then being asked to sign it retrospectively can be a significant procedural violation.

    "answer": "1.It is a matter of trial, the IO's report is not final neither you can disprove it at this stage, you ma have to get them nullified only during cross examination of IO.About the photographs, it is not admissible as primary evidence unless it is supported by a certificate under section 65B of Indian evidence act, hence don't strain over it now itself.2. No criminal case will be entertained against the police for this, the report given by them is not final, you can get them falsified during trial proceedings.3. This alone cannot be a ground for quashing the charge sheet, you may have to rely upon the factual incidents that took place between you both during your married life and highlight her acts of cruelties in your memorandum of grounds for quashing the charge sheet. The statements made before police are not any reason to rely upon to quash the charge sheet, they are actually not reliable statements or reports, they can be dealt with properly during trial proceedings, hence don't get excited over it at this preliminary stage.4.

    "question": "Wife's FIR on 498A filed with 2 police complaints the latest one with 498a ingredients and the old one without 498A ingredients",
    "answer": "Applying the points you pointed can in some way help your attempts at seeking dismissal of the FIR/charge sheet under Section 482 of the CrPC. Here's how-1. Vague Allegations: If the allegations are general and lack specific instances of harassment, it can be argued that the FIR is based on vague and unsubstantiated claims, which can be grounds for quashing.2. Two Police Complaints on the Same Date: Highlighting that two complaints were filed on the same date with the same CSR number, and one was used to file the FIR after the dowry prohibition officer's report cleared you, can indicate a possible fabrication or misuse of legal provisions. This discrepancy can be critical in showing inconsistencies and mala fide intentions.3. RCR Filing: The fact that your wife has filed aRestitution of Conjugal Rights(RCR) case asking you to live with her can be used to show that she has contradictory intentions. It is unusual for someone to seek reconciliation while simultaneously pursuing criminal charges underSection 498A, which can be portrayed as a strategy to pressurise you.4. Detention without 41A Notice: Being detained without prior notice under Section 41A CrPC and then being asked to sign it retrospectively can be a significant procedural violation. This point can highlight police misconduct and procedural lapses, strengthening your case for quashing the FIR.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Wife's FIR on 498A filed with 2 police complaints the latest one with 498a ingredients and the old one without 498A ingredients",
    "answer": "Applying the points you pointed can in some way help your attempts at seeking dismissal of the FIR/charge sheet under Section 482 of the CrPC. Here's how-1. Vague Allegations: If the allegations are general and lack specific instances of harassment, it can be argued that the FIR is based on vague and unsubstantiated claims, which can be grounds for quashing.2. Two Police Complaints on the Same Date: Highlighting that two complaints were filed on the same date with the same CSR number, and one was used to file the FIR after the dowry prohibition officer's report cleared you, can indicate a possible fabrication or misuse of legal provisions. This discrepancy can be critical in showing inconsistencies and mala fide intentions.3. RCR Filing: The fact that your wife has filed aRestitution of Conjugal Rights(RCR) case asking you to live with her can be used to show that she has contradictory intentions. It is unusual for someone to seek reconciliation while simultaneously pursuing criminal charges underSection 498A, which can be portrayed as a strategy to pressurise you.4. Detention without 41A Notice: Being detained without prior notice under Section 41A CrPC and then being asked to sign it retrospectively can be a significant procedural violation. This point can highlight police misconduct and procedural lapses, strengthening your case for quashing the FIR.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "context": "Asked 1 year ago in Family Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Relationship and girl friend family issue",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Your situation is quite complex, involving personal relationships, family dynamics, and potential legal implications. Here’s a structured approach to address your concerns and guide you through the process.The primary concern appears to be the resistance from both families due to inter-caste differences and other personal reasons. This is compounded by the legal risks associated with potential false complaints against you, including allegations of harassment or coercion, and the possibility of your girlfriend being pressured into making statements against you.Since both of you are adults (25 years old), under Indian law, you have the right to marry whoever you choose, irrespective of caste or family approval. This is a fundamental right guaranteed by theConstitution of India. If a false complaint is made, it is essential to be prepared with evidence of your relationship and the consent of your girlfriend. Such evidence could include photos, voice recordings, and any written communication that demonstrates mutual consent. This will be crucial in defending against any false allegations.Communication and mediation are essential steps in resolving this issue. It might be helpful to involve neutral, respected elders or mediators from both sides to facilitate discussions. This could help in reducing hostility and reaching a mutual understanding. However, it is important to avoid direct confrontation with her uncle or any family member without mediation, as this may escalate the situation and lead to legal complications or physical altercations.Preserving evidence is vital in this scenario. Keep all evidence of your relationship, including photos, messages, call records, and any documentation that can support your case if legal issues arise. If you visit her family or engage in discussions, consider recording these interactions (if legally permissible) to have evidence of your intentions and conduct. This documentation will be crucial in defending yourself if the situation escalates to legal proceedings.Regarding the incident on 25-05-204, where her uncle tried to beat you and said bad words to your family, it is advisable to avoid direct confrontation. Directly confronting her uncle could lead to further escalation. Given the past violent reaction, it’s better to avoid this approach. If you feel defamed or threatened, discuss with your lawyer the possibility of sending a legal notice demanding an apology or even considering defamation charges if the situation warrants it. Instead of seeking an apology through confrontation, focus on resolving the main issue, which is the acceptance of your relationship or a peaceful mutual agreement.From a legal perspective, several provisions can offer protection and recourse. Under theIndian Penal Code(IPC), sections such as Section 499/500 for defamation andSection 506for criminal intimidation may be relevant if there are false accusations or threats against you. TheSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, allows for inter-caste marriages with legal protection, which could be a viable option if you both decide to marry without family consent. Additionally, if your girlfriend faces harassment or coercion from her family, she can seek protection under the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005.In conclusion, addressing this situation requires a combination of legal, communicative, and supportive measures. Seek advice from a qualified lawyer, involve neutral mediators, preserve all evidence, and ensure both you and your girlfriend receive the necessary psychological support. Prioritize safety and well-being in all actions you take, and focus on achieving a peaceful resolution while protecting your legal rights.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Unable to close home loan account and get NOC",
    "answer": "This is because the Reserve Bank of India rules require banks to follow NPA classification at a borrower level and not at a product level.If a borrower defaults on a bank loan, his other loans drawn from the same bank too may become non-performing assets (NPAs) affecting the customer's credit worthiness.Since this is a RBI rules, the banks cannot deviate from the set of rules or guidelines in this regard.All loans may be tagged as NPAs even if the customer is prompt on the repayment of other loans to the same bank. For example, if you default on a credit card loan to a particular bank, your home loan or car loan in the same bank, on which the loan repayment is prompt, may also become a bad loan.Even though the act of bank refusing to return the title documents of the loan already discharged appears to be illegal, the bank will take shelter under the RBI rules hence it may not fetch you a favorable result even if you think of taking it legally through court or DRT."

    "answer": "Dear Client,According to RBI guidelines, if one loan account of a borrower becomes a Non-Performing Asset (NPA), all other loan accounts with the same bank are also classified as NPA. This is done on a borrower-wise basis, not account-wise. The rationale is that if a borrower defaults on one loan, their creditworthiness is compromised, impacting their ability to repay other loans as well. However, this rule does not negate the bank’s responsibility to provide necessary documents once a loan is fully repaid. File a formal complaint with the bank’s grievance redressal cell, requesting the NOC and property papers. If the bank doesn’t resolve the issue, escalate it to the Banking Ombudsman through the RBI’s website. As a last resort, file a complaint in the Consumer Forum for redressal.

    "answer": "Dear client,In your legal situation, it is necessary to deal with the procedural irregularities on the wrong entry of defendants and the unclear addresses that has hindered proper delivery of summons. These are relevant when giving a petition to have the ex-parte injunction set aside on the 1st of October in the year 2024 be kicked out because under the CPC under Order V, proper service must have been made. You should consider bringing an application for contempt against Judge P. Nageswara Rao for granting the injunction when there is no sufficient basis to do so without sufficient notice violating your rights and procedurally unfair. Although there are concerns that complaints against both judges should be made, it may be more beneficial to aim at the junior judge if you think he is pressured by the first judge. Whatever samples of his calls or conversation or other such material for substantiating the allegations compiled by her must be compiled completely. The approach is associated with Section 27 of the CPC pointing out that proper summon and fair hearing should be conducted in the case.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "context": "Asked 1 year ago in Family Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Relationship and girl friend family issue",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Your situation is quite complex, involving personal relationships, family dynamics, and potential legal implications. Here’s a structured approach to address your concerns and guide you through the process.The primary concern appears to be the resistance from both families due to inter-caste differences and other personal reasons. This is compounded by the legal risks associated with potential false complaints against you, including allegations of harassment or coercion, and the possibility of your girlfriend being pressured into making statements against you.Since both of you are adults (25 years old), under Indian law, you have the right to marry whoever you choose, irrespective of caste or family approval. This is a fundamental right guaranteed by theConstitution of India. If a false complaint is made, it is essential to be prepared with evidence of your relationship and the consent of your girlfriend. Such evidence could include photos, voice recordings, and any written communication that demonstrates mutual consent. This will be crucial in defending against any false allegations.Communication and mediation are essential steps in resolving this issue. It might be helpful to involve neutral, respected elders or mediators from both sides to facilitate discussions. This could help in reducing hostility and reaching a mutual understanding. However, it is important to avoid direct confrontation with her uncle or any family member without mediation, as this may escalate the situation and lead to legal complications or physical altercations.Preserving evidence is vital in this scenario. Keep all evidence of your relationship, including photos, messages, call records, and any documentation that can support your case if legal issues arise. If you visit her family or engage in discussions, consider recording these interactions (if legally permissible) to have evidence of your intentions and conduct. This documentation will be crucial in defending yourself if the situation escalates to legal proceedings.Regarding the incident on 25-05-204, where her uncle tried to beat you and said bad words to your family, it is advisable to avoid direct confrontation. Directly confronting her uncle could lead to further escalation. Given the past violent reaction, it’s better to avoid this approach. If you feel defamed or threatened, discuss with your lawyer the possibility of sending a legal notice demanding an apology or even considering defamation charges if the situation warrants it. Instead of seeking an apology through confrontation, focus on resolving the main issue, which is the acceptance of your relationship or a peaceful mutual agreement.From a legal perspective, several provisions can offer protection and recourse. Under theIndian Penal Code(IPC), sections such as Section 499/500 for defamation andSection 506for criminal intimidation may be relevant if there are false accusations or threats against you. TheSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, allows for inter-caste marriages with legal protection, which could be a viable option if you both decide to marry without family consent. Additionally, if your girlfriend faces harassment or coercion from her family, she can seek protection under the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005.In conclusion, addressing this situation requires a combination of legal, communicative, and supportive measures. Seek advice from a qualified lawyer, involve neutral mediators, preserve all evidence, and ensure both you and your girlfriend receive the necessary psychological support. Prioritize safety and well-being in all actions you take, and focus on achieving a peaceful resolution while protecting your legal rights.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Unable to close home loan account and get NOC",
    "answer": "This is because the Reserve Bank of India rules require banks to follow NPA classification at a borrower level and not at a product level.If a borrower defaults on a bank loan, his other loans drawn from the same bank too may become non-performing assets (NPAs) affecting the customer's credit worthiness.Since this is a RBI rules, the banks cannot deviate from the set of rules or guidelines in this regard.All loans may be tagged as NPAs even if the customer is prompt on the repayment of other loans to the same bank. For example, if you default on a credit card loan to a particular bank, your home loan or car loan in the same bank, on which the loan repayment is prompt, may also become a bad loan.Even though the act of bank refusing to return the title documents of the loan already discharged appears to be illegal, the bank will take shelter under the RBI rules hence it may not fetch you a favorable result even if you think of taking it legally through court or DRT."

    "question": "Unable to close home loan account and get NOC",
    "answer": "Dear Client,According to RBI guidelines, if one loan account of a borrower becomes a Non-Performing Asset (NPA), all other loan accounts with the same bank are also classified as NPA. This is done on a borrower-wise basis, not account-wise. The rationale is that if a borrower defaults on one loan, their creditworthiness is compromised, impacting their ability to repay other loans as well. However, this rule does not negate the bank’s responsibility to provide necessary documents once a loan is fully repaid. File a formal complaint with the bank’s grievance redressal cell, requesting the NOC and property papers. If the bank doesn’t resolve the issue, escalate it to the Banking Ombudsman through the RBI’s website. As a last resort, file a complaint in the Consumer Forum for redressal.

For example, if you default on a credit card loan to a particular bank, your home loan or car loan in the same bank, on which the loan repayment is prompt, may also become a bad loan.Even though the act of bank refusing to return the title documents of the loan already discharged appears to be illegal, the bank will take shelter under the RBI rules hence it may not fetch you a favorable result even if you think of taking it legally through court or DRT."

    "answer": "Dear Client,According to RBI guidelines, if one loan account of a borrower becomes a Non-Performing Asset (NPA), all other loan accounts with the same bank are also classified as NPA. This is done on a borrower-wise basis, not account-wise. The rationale is that if a borrower defaults on one loan, their creditworthiness is compromised, impacting their ability to repay other loans as well. However, this rule does not negate the bank’s responsibility to provide necessary documents once a loan is fully repaid. File a formal complaint with the bank’s grievance redressal cell, requesting the NOC and property papers. If the bank doesn’t resolve the issue, escalate it to the Banking Ombudsman through the RBI’s website. As a last resort, file a complaint in the Consumer Forum for redressal. Should you require any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "This is because the Reserve Bank of India rules require banks to follow NPA classification at a borrower level and not at a product level.If a borrower defaults on a bank loan, his other loans drawn from the same bank too may become non-performing assets (NPAs) affecting the customer's credit worthiness.Since this is a RBI rules, the banks cannot deviate from the set of rules or guidelines in this regard.All loans may be tagged as NPAs even if the customer is prompt on the repayment of other loans to the same bank. For example, if you default on a credit card loan to a particular bank, your home loan or car loan in the same bank, on which the loan repayment is prompt, may also become a bad loan.Even though the act of bank refusing to return the title documents of the loan already discharged appears to be illegal, the bank will take shelter under the RBI rules hence it may not fetch you a favorable result even if you think of taking it legally through court or DRT."

This alone cannot be a ground for quashing the charge sheet, you may have to rely upon the factual incidents that took place between you both during your married life and highlight her acts of cruelties in your memorandum of grounds for quashing the charge sheet. The statements made before police are not any reason to rely upon to quash the charge sheet, they are actually not reliable statements or reports, they can be dealt with properly during trial proceedings, hence don't get excited over it at this preliminary stage.4. These cannot be the reasons for quashing the charge sheet.The grounds for quashing the charge sheet will be based on the complaint and the contents of the charge sheet.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Your credentials and experience of many years can be used by newly formed partnership firm wherein you are one of the partners of the firm to participate in tenders2) the said requirement regarding experience cannot be construed to mean that the said experience should be of the tenderer in his name only. It is possible to visualise a situation where a person having past experience has entered into a partnership and the tender has been submitted in the name of the partnership firm which may not have any past experience in its own name. That does not mean that the earlier experience of one of the partners of the firm cannot be taken into consideration.3)New Horizons Ltd. v. Union of India, (1995) 1 SCC 478, tthe Supreme Court indicated the correct approach in interpreting terms of an invitation to tender, to the following effect:W.P.(C) 1712/2017 Page 6of 20 \"the requirement regarding experience does not mean that the offer of the original company must be considered because it has experience in its name though it does not have experienced persons with it and ignore the offer of the new company because it does not have experience in its name though it has persons having experience in the field. While considering the requirement regarding experience it has to be borne in mind that the said requirement is contained in a document inviting offers for a commercial transaction. The terms and conditions of such a document have to be construed from the standpoint of a prudent businessman. When a businessman enters into a contract whereunder some work is to be performed he seeks to assure himself about the credentials of the person who is to be entrusted with the performance of the work. Such credentials are to be examined from a commercial point of view which means that if the contract is to be entered with a company he will look into the background of the company and the persons who are in control of the same and their capacity to execute the work. He would go not by the name of the company but by the persons behind the company.\"4) rely upon SC judgment cited herein aboveAjay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98560 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "answer": "Drafting of the Partnership Deed would be the first step in conversion of a sole proprietorship into a partnership firm.The major inclusion in the deed must be the declaration about the sole proprietorship which is being converted into a partnership by adding more partners and bringing in investment.The deed must also state the details of all the changes expected to occur with the introduction of the new business partners.After this, transfer all assets and liabilities into partnership firms as sale of business by proprietor to partnership firm.Experience gained from erstwhile proprietorship firm could not be construed as experience of partners in an individual capacity if applied independently without the partners in any tender.In a judgment of Supreme Court in New Horizons Ltd. v. Union of India, (1995) 1 SCC 478, wherein it was held that in the absence of any exclusionary clause in the tender document, it could not be said that past experience of a partner of the firm could not be considered.The Bench opined that coercing a tender inviting authority to blindly treat experience in the name of an erstwhile partnership firm as the experience of the partner in his individual capacity, would militate against every judicious consideration.This applies to proprietorship firm too.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Buyer cancelling property Deal after Holding deal for 100 day without sale Agreement",
    "answer": "There was no formal agreement to sell entered between you both hence you cannot claim that you had kept the property on hold.Once you saw that the buyer is delaying the process unnecessarily, you could have informed about it and looked for some other buyer.In the absence of any agreement between you both, it would be illegal for you to  deny the refund the payment of advance amount received by you.At the maximum you can deduct 10% of the amount towards waiting period and administrative costs.Your conditions to sell the property is practically not feasible because no buyer would be willing to wait for three months to take physical possession of the house property  after paying full sale consideration amount getting the property registered on his name.At least you should have agreed to pay three months rent for the property after having sold it to the buyer which can justify or make some sense.You cannot thrust your liabilities on the buyer and the buyer is not obliged to accept them.Obtaining a token amount will not construe as a sale agreement hence you cannot approach court for any relief.If you want to avoid legal disputes, you can settle the matter amicably.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

Onkarjit Singh Ahluwalia @ Omkarjeet Singh, AIR 2017 SC 1583the complainant had alleged that the accused abused her and her family members of their caste by calling them ‘Harijans and Dhobis’. The court held,The use of the word ‘Harijan’ ‘Dhobi’ etc. is often used by people belonging to the so-called upper castes as a word of insult, abuse and derision. Calling a person by these names is nowadays an abusive language and is offensive. It is basically used nowadays not to denote a caste but to intentionally insult and humiliate someone. We, as a citizen of this country, should always keep one thing in our mind and heart that no people or community should be today insulted or looked down upon, and nobody’s feelings should be hurt.3)all insults or intimidation would not be an offence under the Act unless such insult or intimidation is on account of the victim belonging to SC or ST.

    "answer": "Your credentials and experience of many years can be used by newly formed partnership firm wherein you are one of the partners of the firm to participate in tenders2) the said requirement regarding experience cannot be construed to mean that the said experience should be of the tenderer in his name only. It is possible to visualise a situation where a person having past experience has entered into a partnership and the tender has been submitted in the name of the partnership firm which may not have any past experience in its own name. That does not mean that the earlier experience of one of the partners of the firm cannot be taken into consideration.3)New Horizons Ltd. v. Union of India, (1995) 1 SCC 478, tthe Supreme Court indicated the correct approach in interpreting terms of an invitation to tender, to the following effect:W.P.(C) 1712/2017 Page 6of 20 \"the requirement regarding experience does not mean that the offer of the original company must be considered because it has experience in its name though it does not have experienced persons with it and ignore the offer of the new company because it does not have experience in its name though it has persons having experience in the field. While considering the requirement regarding experience it has to be borne in mind that the said requirement is contained in a document inviting offers for a commercial transaction. The terms and conditions of such a document have to be construed from the standpoint of a prudent businessman. When a businessman enters into a contract whereunder some work is to be performed he seeks to assure himself about the credentials of the person who is to be entrusted with the performance of the work. Such credentials are to be examined from a commercial point of view which means that if the contract is to be entered with a company he will look into the background of the company and the persons who are in control of the same and their capacity to execute the work. He would go not by the name of the company but by the persons behind the company.\"4) rely upon SC judgment cited herein aboveAjay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98560 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "answer": "you will have to file a suit against the seller for refund of your advance with interestessentially you will have to seek a declaration that the sale agreement stands terminated on non-fulfillment of obligations on the part of the sellereven if the sale agreement is not registered you can still sue the seller for refund of your advance as that would be a collateral purpose for which you want to rely on the sale agreement that you had paid an advance. Thus vide the proviso to s.49 of the registration act, non-registration of the sale agreement will not come in the way of the proposed suit to be filed by youas regards your follow up, if the time limit for registration of final sale deed has expired then the parties by their conduct can always extend the timeline. In this case you have to decide whether or not you want to enforce the agreement against the seller by requiring him to register the property in your name or whether you wish to rescind from the contract on account non-fulfillment of obligations by the seller and seek refund of your advance with interest.

    "answer": "It is not advisable to proceed with the purchase of this proper without cancelling the previous registered sale agreement.You have to insist and compel the seller to get the previous registered sale agreement by executing a registered cancellation deed jointly along with the previous buyer.The unregistered sale agreement cannot be enforced in law though it can be used for the purpose of evidence for the sale agreement or receipt of money hence you may become eligible for getting return of the  advance  amount.You have two options:1. Issue a legal notice to the seller one week prior to the last date of the sale agreement demanding the seller to executed the registered sale deed in your favor while expressing your ready and willingness to perform your part of the contract by paying the balance of sale consideration amount and to get the sale deed registered at your cost;If the seller is not responding or not complying with demands made, you may file a suit for specific performance of contract seeking execution of sale deed with an alternate prayer for refund of advance amount with interest.2. The second option is to wait for him to respond till the expiry of the sale agreement period, communicate the decision to cancel the sale agreement and then demand him to return the advance amount with interest till the date of settlement.Failing to comply with this demand you may file a summary suit for recovery of money and seek for attachment before judgment of the property as security towards the advance amount.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Who wish to take benefit of Indian laws and legal system to avoid facing up to any foreign judicial system.As per the latest Supreme Court judgment which had held that a decree of divorce granted by a foreign court is not valid in India if the ground is not recognized by Indian law.Generally, amutual consent divorcegranted by a foreign court is considered valid, legal, and binding in Indian courts by virtue of sections 13 and 14 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as well as the comity of nations. Indian courts do not need to validate such divorce decrees granted by foreign courts. However,as amatter of abundant caution, one can approach the Indian Court to declare that divorce isvalid and binding.Foreign orders/decrees/judgments cannot be directly executed in India unless they are the judgments of courts in \"reciprocating territories\". In all other cases, the only mode of giving effect to a foreign judgment is to file a suit on the judgment in an appropriate Indian court, which has to be tested by section 13 of the Civil Procedure Code.If the full and final settlement agreement is signed by both parties in mediation, then both parties are bound to obey the decree. But in India, the decree from the US court can be used as a document in evidence side. The US court has no right to decide on property situated in India in between marital disputes. You can challenge this in India.In the eyes of the Indian judicial system, the property belongs to the person in whose name it's registered.  If the property is in the name of the husband then the wife has no right on that property.As per Indian law, a husband cannot claim rights on wife’s property. A wife cannot claim a share in the property of her husband during his lifetime. During his lifetime, a wife during her marriage is in existence, or even if her marriage gets dissolved by decree of divorce, she has only the right to residence on certain terms and conditions, to be provided by her husband.1. How can the proceeding is US is stopped at this stage before the hearing? Where I need to approach for this?2. In case it is not possible and Judge signs the decree, what course of action I will have in India and where to approach?Do you have any plans to visit the US and stay there ?In such a case you will act otherwise forget about the US court procedure. Legal challenges against US court decisions are permitted under Indian law. US is considered as a Non-Reciprocating Territory’ of India.An award from a ‘Non-Reciprocating Territory’ of India, a fresh suit in an Indian court with appropriate jurisdiction, needs to be instituted.  No doubt that Foreign Judgments from Non-Reciprocating Territories need to pass through the sieve of Indian Judiciary but the sieve used is broad and spacious enough to allow the sink in of ‘the cause of Justice’ upheld by the courts of Foreign Countries.Ajay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

Calling a person by these names is nowadays an abusive language and is offensive. It is basically used nowadays not to denote a caste but to intentionally insult and humiliate someone.

    "answer": "The sub registrar has no power under the registration act to refuse registrationHe cannot go behind the title of the vendor to the subject propertyHe also cannot question the power of the authorized person of the unregistered group to execute the sale deed in favor of the purchaser5 persons of that unregistered group can grant a poa to one of them in conformity with s. 32 and 33 of the registration actThe sub registrar only has powers as are given in s. 34 of the registration act if I recollect it properlyThe powers of the sub registrar are clearly provided in the registration act. So he cannot require something to be done which is outside the purview of such statutory powersUnder the registration act if the sub registrar refuses to register the document presented to him for registration,  then an appeal can be preferred to his superior as provided in the registration actBut you can also file a writ petition in HC since remedy of issuing a writ is a discretionary relief and when the law is settled and despite that the sub registrar ignores such settled law, then a writ surely lies to the HC. In that case there is no need to exhaust the alternate remedies before approaching the HC.So writ petition is the appropriate remedy for youFor now make a written application to the sub registrar to register the document and if he refuses then ask him to state his reasons in writingIf after a reasonable period of you submitting the written application,  the sub registrar does not give a written response then you can file the writ petitionYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

Thus vide the proviso to s.49 of the registration act, non-registration of the sale agreement will not come in the way of the proposed suit to be filed by youas regards your follow up, if the time limit for registration of final sale deed has expired then the parties by their conduct can always extend the timeline. In this case you have to decide whether or not you want to enforce the agreement against the seller by requiring him to register the property in your name or whether you wish to rescind from the contract on account non-fulfillment of obligations by the seller and seek refund of your advance with interest.

Issue a legal notice to the seller one week prior to the last date of the sale agreement demanding the seller to executed the registered sale deed in your favor while expressing your ready and willingness to perform your part of the contract by paying the balance of sale consideration amount and to get the sale deed registered at your cost;If the seller is not responding or not complying with demands made, you may file a suit for specific performance of contract seeking execution of sale deed with an alternate prayer for refund of advance amount with interest.2. The second option is to wait for him to respond till the expiry of the sale agreement period, communicate the decision to cancel the sale agreement and then demand him to return the advance amount with interest till the date of settlement.Failing to comply with this demand you may file a summary suit for recovery of money and seek for attachment before judgment of the property as security towards the advance amount.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

Calling a person by these names is nowadays an abusive language and is offensive. It is basically used nowadays not to denote a caste but to intentionally insult and humiliate someone. We, as a citizen of this country, should always keep one thing in our mind and heart that no people or community should be today insulted or looked down upon, and nobody’s feelings should be hurt.3)all insults or intimidation would not be an offence under the Act unless such insult or intimidation is on account of the victim belonging to SC or ST. The court concluded that “it has to be held that all insults or intimidation do not make out an offence under the Act unless it is directed against the person on account of his caste.”Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98560 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

A maximum limit of Rs 10 crore has also been fixed for this exemption on LTCG tax.However, the purchase of a new residential property must be made within one year of the sale of the old property.

    "answer": "Who wish to take benefit of Indian laws and legal system to avoid facing up to any foreign judicial system.As per the latest Supreme Court judgment which had held that a decree of divorce granted by a foreign court is not valid in India if the ground is not recognized by Indian law.Generally, amutual consent divorcegranted by a foreign court is considered valid, legal, and binding in Indian courts by virtue of sections 13 and 14 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as well as the comity of nations. Indian courts do not need to validate such divorce decrees granted by foreign courts. However,as amatter of abundant caution, one can approach the Indian Court to declare that divorce isvalid and binding.Foreign orders/decrees/judgments cannot be directly executed in India unless they are the judgments of courts in \"reciprocating territories\". In all other cases, the only mode of giving effect to a foreign judgment is to file a suit on the judgment in an appropriate Indian court, which has to be tested by section 13 of the Civil Procedure Code.If the full and final settlement agreement is signed by both parties in mediation, then both parties are bound to obey the decree. But in India, the decree from the US court can be used as a document in evidence side. The US court has no right to decide on property situated in India in between marital disputes. You can challenge this in India.In the eyes of the Indian judicial system, the property belongs to the person in whose name it's registered.  If the property is in the name of the husband then the wife has no right on that property.As per Indian law, a husband cannot claim rights on wife’s property. A wife cannot claim a share in the property of her husband during his lifetime. During his lifetime, a wife during her marriage is in existence, or even if her marriage gets dissolved by decree of divorce, she has only the right to residence on certain terms and conditions, to be provided by her husband.1. How can the proceeding is US is stopped at this stage before the hearing? Where I need to approach for this?2. In case it is not possible and Judge signs the decree, what course of action I will have in India and where to approach?Do you have any plans to visit the US and stay there ?In such a case you will act otherwise forget about the US court procedure. Legal challenges against US court decisions are permitted under Indian law. US is considered as a Non-Reciprocating Territory’ of India.An award from a ‘Non-Reciprocating Territory’ of India, a fresh suit in an Indian court with appropriate jurisdiction, needs to be instituted.  No doubt that Foreign Judgments from Non-Reciprocating Territories need to pass through the sieve of Indian Judiciary but the sieve used is broad and spacious enough to allow the sink in of ‘the cause of Justice’ upheld by the courts of Foreign Countries.Ajay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

The second option is to wait for him to respond till the expiry of the sale agreement period, communicate the decision to cancel the sale agreement and then demand him to return the advance amount with interest till the date of settlement.Failing to comply with this demand you may file a summary suit for recovery of money and seek for attachment before judgment of the property as security towards the advance amount.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

A maximum limit of Rs 10 crore has also been fixed for this exemption on LTCG tax.However, the purchase of a new residential property must be made within one year of the sale of the old property.

    "answer": "Who wish to take benefit of Indian laws and legal system to avoid facing up to any foreign judicial system.As per the latest Supreme Court judgment which had held that a decree of divorce granted by a foreign court is not valid in India if the ground is not recognized by Indian law.Generally, amutual consent divorcegranted by a foreign court is considered valid, legal, and binding in Indian courts by virtue of sections 13 and 14 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as well as the comity of nations. Indian courts do not need to validate such divorce decrees granted by foreign courts. However,as amatter of abundant caution, one can approach the Indian Court to declare that divorce isvalid and binding.Foreign orders/decrees/judgments cannot be directly executed in India unless they are the judgments of courts in \"reciprocating territories\". In all other cases, the only mode of giving effect to a foreign judgment is to file a suit on the judgment in an appropriate Indian court, which has to be tested by section 13 of the Civil Procedure Code.If the full and final settlement agreement is signed by both parties in mediation, then both parties are bound to obey the decree. But in India, the decree from the US court can be used as a document in evidence side. The US court has no right to decide on property situated in India in between marital disputes. You can challenge this in India.In the eyes of the Indian judicial system, the property belongs to the person in whose name it's registered.  If the property is in the name of the husband then the wife has no right on that property.As per Indian law, a husband cannot claim rights on wife’s property. A wife cannot claim a share in the property of her husband during his lifetime. During his lifetime, a wife during her marriage is in existence, or even if her marriage gets dissolved by decree of divorce, she has only the right to residence on certain terms and conditions, to be provided by her husband.1. How can the proceeding is US is stopped at this stage before the hearing? Where I need to approach for this?2. In case it is not possible and Judge signs the decree, what course of action I will have in India and where to approach?Do you have any plans to visit the US and stay there ?In such a case you will act otherwise forget about the US court procedure. Legal challenges against US court decisions are permitted under Indian law. US is considered as a Non-Reciprocating Territory’ of India.An award from a ‘Non-Reciprocating Territory’ of India, a fresh suit in an Indian court with appropriate jurisdiction, needs to be instituted.  No doubt that Foreign Judgments from Non-Reciprocating Territories need to pass through the sieve of Indian Judiciary but the sieve used is broad and spacious enough to allow the sink in of ‘the cause of Justice’ upheld by the courts of Foreign Countries.Ajay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

    "answer": "Dear Client,You can check with your local municipality or zoning authority to ensure that your property is zoned for commercial use, specifically for a party hall or events venue. If it's not currently zoned for commercial activities, you may need to apply for a zoning change or variance. Since you'll be making modifications to your existing structure, such as installing roof shades and ensuring proper ventilation, you'll likely need a building permit. This permit ensures that the modifications comply with local building codes and regulations. Depending on your location, there may be specific health and safety regulations that apply to event venues. This could include requirements for fire safety, accessibility for people with disabilities, food handling facilities, restroom facilities, etc. You'll need to ensure that your property meets all relevant health and safety standards. You'll likely need to obtain a business license or permit to operate a party hall or events venue. This license ensures that your business complies with local business regulations and taxation requirements.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "To convert a house in to a party hall and register the property for commercial purpose",
    "answer": "It is permittedunder certain conditions.It mainly depends on: Zoning laws: Your local municipal or planning department determines zoning, which dictates land use.Changing zoning requires approval, often involving public hearings and justification for the commercial benefit.Building codes:Commercial properties have stricter safety and accessibility codes than residential ones. Your existing property might need renovations to comply.Permits and licenses:You'll need specific permits and licenses for the intended commercial activity.DC conversion usually refers to converting agricultural land to non-agricultural use.Charges for such conversion vary significantly depending on location, land size, intended use, and relevant government policies.It's best to consult with local authorities for specific details.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,You can check with your local municipality or zoning authority to ensure that your property is zoned for commercial use, specifically for a party hall or events venue. If it's not currently zoned for commercial activities, you may need to apply for a zoning change or variance. Since you'll be making modifications to your existing structure, such as installing roof shades and ensuring proper ventilation, you'll likely need a building permit. This permit ensures that the modifications comply with local building codes and regulations. Depending on your location, there may be specific health and safety regulations that apply to event venues. This could include requirements for fire safety, accessibility for people with disabilities, food handling facilities, restroom facilities, etc. You'll need to ensure that your property meets all relevant health and safety standards. You'll likely need to obtain a business license or permit to operate a party hall or events venue.

Your existing property might need renovations to comply.Permits and licenses:You'll need specific permits and licenses for the intended commercial activity.DC conversion usually refers to converting agricultural land to non-agricultural use.Charges for such conversion vary significantly depending on location, land size, intended use, and relevant government policies.It's best to consult with local authorities for specific details.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

Naikthe respondent no.1 filed an application for child access u/s 21 of DV Act on 20th December 2017. The matter was heard by the Trial Court and by order dated 5 th January 2018, the learned Magistrate partly allowed the application allowing access of Vihan to respondent no.1.6. It is further submitted that the applicant then preferred an appeal before the Sessions Court which was heard at length. Both the sides were heard and case laws were tendered by both the parties. The Sessions Court was pleased to dismiss the appeal and . upheld the legality and validity of order dated 5 th January 2018 passed by the learned Magistrate.It is contended that since Section 21 does not provide any right to the husband to prefer such application, and since the legislature has not provided such right to the husband, except as stipulated in Section 21 of DV Act, the Court ought not to have entertained the application and granted relief as prayed by respondent no.1. If the interpretation advanced by the applicant is accepted, it would defeat the whole purpose of the statute. It is well settled principle of interpretation that Court must start with the presumption that legislature did not make a mistake and it must interpret so as to carry out the obvious intention of legislature and 18 of 34 APL.186.2018.doc that it must not correct or make up a deficiency nor the Court read into a provision any word which is not there particularly when literal reading does not lead to an intelligible result. The said proposition of law has been laid down in the case of Rajender Prashad Vs. Darshana Devi (2001)7-SCC-69. In the case of Nathidevi Vs. Radhadevi Gupta (2005)2-SCC-271, it was observed that in interpreting a statute, Court must, if the words are clear, plain, unambiguous and reasonable insusceptible to only one meaning, give to the words that meaning irrespective of the consequences.12. In the present case, it is the grievance of the applicant that on 2nd December, 2017, on account of the circumstances referred to by her, the applicant had left the matrimonial home along with the child. The reliefs sought in the application enumerates the reliefs under Sections 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 of the said Act. The complaint also mentions that requisite orders under Section 21 with regards to the custody of the child are also sought. The said aspect is apparent from paragraph 5 of the complaint. The intent of the legislature as expressed under the proviso has to be taken into account keeping in view the aim and object of the Act. The application under Section 21 of the Act by the respondent could be made in the factual matrix of the present case.In the case of Smt. Hudidrom Ningol Ongbi (supra) relied upon by the counsel for the respondent the High Court of Manipur has observed that where there is no obscurity or ambiguity and intention of legislature is clearly conveyed, there is no scope for the Court to innovate or to take upon its task of amending or altering a statutory provisions which proposition of law has been laid down in several cases including in a case of Institute of Chartered Accounts of India Vs. Price Water 19 of 34 APL.186.2018.doc House and another - (1997)6-SCC-312. In that case it has been observed that the judges should not proclaim that they are playing the role of law makers merely for an exhibition of judicial valour. They should remember that there is a line though thin which separates adjudication from legislation. That line should not be crossed.This can be vouchsafed by an alert recognition of the necessity not to cross it and instinctive as well as trained reluctance to do so. However, where there appears to be obscurity, ambiguity, what the Court is supposed to do has been dealt with in the case of Grid Corporation of Orissa Limited Vs. And others. Eastern Matters Ferros Allous and others reported in (2011)11-SCC-334 wherein it has been observed that the golden rule of interpretation is that the words of the statute have to be read and understood in their natural, ordinary and popular sense. Where however, the words used are capable of bearing two or more constructions, it is necessary to adopt purposive construction, to identify the construction to be preferred by posing the following questions. (i) what is the purpose for which the provision is made; (ii) what was the position before making the provision; (iii) whether any of the constructions proposed would lead to an absurd result or would render any part of the provisions redundant; (iv) which of the interpretations will advance the object of the provision. The answer to these questions will enable the Court to identify the purposive interpretation to be preferred while excluding others. Such an exercise is involving ascertainment of the object of the provision and choosing the interpretation that will advance the object of the provision can be undertaken only where the language of the provision is capable of more than one construction. It is further observed that Section 21 is amenable to two interpretations as is being highlighted by the 20 of 34 APL.186.2018.doc parties, in such event only that interpretation which advanced the object of the provision can be accepted. It is worthwhile to note that the Act enacted to prevent the occurrence ofdomestic violencein the society and keeping in view that several protection orders including the safety of the aggrieved person and the child have been contemplated to be passed. Therefore, the cause of the safety of the aggrieved person or the child is always warrants to be taken into account in interpreting the provision. In such situation if the interpretation given on behalf of the wife aggrieved parties accepted it will render the provision incomplete as in case where wife - aggrieved party seeks custody of the child, if the child is in custody of the husband and an order of custody is passed in favour of the aggrieved party, visitation right can be granted to the husband. But if custody lies with the wife - aggrieved party, than the husband will have no remedy of visitation right if the interpretation as contemplated by the wife - aggrieved party is given effect to and thereby it can easily be said that interpretation given by the aggrieved party - wife will never advance the cause of the child. On the other hand, if it is held that the husband, in absence of any application for grant of custody can maintain his application for visitation right will advance the object of the provision as in case of child being in custody of the husband, application for custody can be filed by the wife wherein the husband can have visitation right if order is of custody of child passed in favour of the aggrieved party. In other situation, when the custody of the child lies with the wife, there would be no occasion for the wife for filing an application for custody. In that situation, husband will have remedy to have visitation right by filing application to that effect. The said interpretation and observations can be applied in the present case.In the case of Dipti Bhandari (supra), the apex Court has dealt with a situation wherein the complaint under the DV Act was filed by wife. The husband preferred an application u/s 21 of DV Act for visitation rights which was dismissed by the Family Court. The husband filed an appeal against the said order before the District Judge, which was also dismissed. The husband then preferred an application u/s 482 of Cr.P.C for quashing the charge sheet in FIR u/s 498A of IPC. The High Court stayed the said proceedings. The husband also preferred petition challenging the proceedings under the DV Act. The same was also stayed by the High Court. The Court requested both the parties to consider settlement of the matter. The High Court also passed orders allowing visitation rights to respondent no.1 husband in respect of minor child. The order dismissing application for visitation right was challenged before the appropriate Court. The application for visitation rights was allowed and the petitioner therein was directed to arrange for the meeting of the respondent no.1 with the petitioner and their minor daughter. The Apex Court in the said decision modified the said order and disposed off the petition. The contention of the counsel for the respondent is that while deciding the said petition, the Apex Court did not observe that the application preferred by the husband u/s 21 of DV Act is not maintainable.It was also observed that the application filed under Section 21 of theDomestic ViolenceAct seeking interim custody is maintainable before a Magistrate exercising jurisdiction in relation to area where family Court is established and the Magistrate has jurisdiction to decide such an application in accordance with law. Irresistible conclusion further would be that the application filed under Section 21 before the Court of Judicial Magistrate First Class Amravati in the instant case is tenable and impugned order cannot be assailed on the ground of want of jurisdiction.20. For the reasons stated herein above, I do not find that the order passed by the Courts below suffers from any legal infirmity and petition is therefore devoid of merits and same deserves to be dismissed. Hence, I pass the following order.Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98560 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Your father can file an application seeking visitation rights under Section 21 of the DV Act through his advocate. The application can outline the reasons why visitation rights should be granted and any evidence supporting his case. Since the cases are in the initial stages, it's essential to cooperate with your advocate. If your mother has been summoned due to specific allegations, your advocate should prepare a defense based on the facts of the case and present it in court during the hearings. It's crucial to provide all relevant information and evidence to your advocate to strengthen your defense. Mutual agreements regarding custody, including visitation rights, are essential for maintaining family relationships and ensuring the well-being of the child. While such agreements are not legally binding unless endorsed by the court, they provide a framework for parents to cooperate in raising their child post-separation or divorce.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If it's not currently zoned for commercial activities, you may need to apply for a zoning change or variance. Since you'll be making modifications to your existing structure, such as installing roof shades and ensuring proper ventilation, you'll likely need a building permit. This permit ensures that the modifications comply with local building codes and regulations. Depending on your location, there may be specific health and safety regulations that apply to event venues. This could include requirements for fire safety, accessibility for people with disabilities, food handling facilities, restroom facilities, etc. You'll need to ensure that your property meets all relevant health and safety standards. You'll likely need to obtain a business license or permit to operate a party hall or events venue.

While such agreements are not legally binding unless endorsed by the court, they provide a framework for parents to cooperate in raising their child post-separation or divorce.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Divorce",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Custody decisions are typically made based on the best interests of the child, considering factors such as the child's age, the relationship with each parent, the ability of each parent to provide for the child's physical and emotional needs, and any history of abuse or neglect. If your wife is convicted in the FIR and it is deemed relevant to the custody decision, it could certainly impact the court's determination of what is in the best interests of the child. Regarding custody arrangements, \"joint custody\" can refer to joint legal custody, joint physical custody, or both. Joint legal custody typically means both parents share decision-making authority regarding important aspects of the child's life, such as education, healthcare, and religious upbringing. Joint physical custody involves the child spending significant time living with both parents. If you are awarded full custody of your child, it generally means that you have sole physical and legal custody, and your wife would likely be granted visitation rights or parenting time according to the court's determination of what is in the child's best interestsAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,When a wife elopes with an adopted daughter and seeks a divorce, the custody battle is complicated, especially when the father's adoption papers were on Though the CARA guidelines measure parents, although the adoptee is responsible for all the requirements of their child, the parents are equal legal guardians of the . adoption of children. The court will focus primarily on the welfare and well-being of the child when determining custody, considering factors such as emotional attachment, the ability to meet the child’s needs, and overall stability.The wife’s act of concealing the child complicates the situation and may be viewed negatively by the court, as it is seen as an attempt to give the father a fair chance. The Hindu Minority Guardians Act, 1956, also gives natural rights to both parents, with the father having superior rights to the sons, unless the mother is found unfit.In summary, although the adoption was on the father's certificate, the wife can still claim maintenance. The court will focus on the best interests of the child, and the custody of the legal father can assist in making appropriate custody arrangements. The Court dislikes the unilateral action of a mother with her child and emphasises the child's right to access to both parents"

If your society refuses to do so, you can lodge a formal complaint.If there is no response during this period, you can approach the deputy registrar’s office, which regulates matters pertaining to housing societies.After the hearing, if it is found that the members are indeed holding positions without having contested the elections, the existing committee can be dissolved. In its place, the deputy registrar can appoint an administrative officer to run the affairs of the society till fresh elections are conducted, which should take place within six months."

    "answer": "Bombay High CourtPayal Sudeep Laad Alias Payal Sharma vs Sudeep Govind Laad And Anr on 2 November, 2018Equivalent citations: AIRONLINE 2018 BOM 1230Author: Prakash D. Naikthe respondent no.1 filed an application for child access u/s 21 of DV Act on 20th December 2017. The matter was heard by the Trial Court and by order dated 5 th January 2018, the learned Magistrate partly allowed the application allowing access of Vihan to respondent no.1.6. It is further submitted that the applicant then preferred an appeal before the Sessions Court which was heard at length. Both the sides were heard and case laws were tendered by both the parties. The Sessions Court was pleased to dismiss the appeal and . upheld the legality and validity of order dated 5 th January 2018 passed by the learned Magistrate.It is contended that since Section 21 does not provide any right to the husband to prefer such application, and since the legislature has not provided such right to the husband, except as stipulated in Section 21 of DV Act, the Court ought not to have entertained the application and granted relief as prayed by respondent no.1. If the interpretation advanced by the applicant is accepted, it would defeat the whole purpose of the statute. It is well settled principle of interpretation that Court must start with the presumption that legislature did not make a mistake and it must interpret so as to carry out the obvious intention of legislature and 18 of 34 APL.186.2018.doc that it must not correct or make up a deficiency nor the Court read into a provision any word which is not there particularly when literal reading does not lead to an intelligible result. The said proposition of law has been laid down in the case of Rajender Prashad Vs. Darshana Devi (2001)7-SCC-69. In the case of Nathidevi Vs. Radhadevi Gupta (2005)2-SCC-271, it was observed that in interpreting a statute, Court must, if the words are clear, plain, unambiguous and reasonable insusceptible to only one meaning, give to the words that meaning irrespective of the consequences.12. In the present case, it is the grievance of the applicant that on 2nd December, 2017, on account of the circumstances referred to by her, the applicant had left the matrimonial home along with the child. The reliefs sought in the application enumerates the reliefs under Sections 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 of the said Act. The complaint also mentions that requisite orders under Section 21 with regards to the custody of the child are also sought. The said aspect is apparent from paragraph 5 of the complaint. The intent of the legislature as expressed under the proviso has to be taken into account keeping in view the aim and object of the Act. The application under Section 21 of the Act by the respondent could be made in the factual matrix of the present case.In the case of Smt. Hudidrom Ningol Ongbi (supra) relied upon by the counsel for the respondent the High Court of Manipur has observed that where there is no obscurity or ambiguity and intention of legislature is clearly conveyed, there is no scope for the Court to innovate or to take upon its task of amending or altering a statutory provisions which proposition of law has been laid down in several cases including in a case of Institute of Chartered Accounts of India Vs. Price Water 19 of 34 APL.186.2018.doc House and another - (1997)6-SCC-312. In that case it has been observed that the judges should not proclaim that they are playing the role of law makers merely for an exhibition of judicial valour. They should remember that there is a line though thin which separates adjudication from legislation. That line should not be crossed.This can be vouchsafed by an alert recognition of the necessity not to cross it and instinctive as well as trained reluctance to do so. However, where there appears to be obscurity, ambiguity, what the Court is supposed to do has been dealt with in the case of Grid Corporation of Orissa Limited Vs. And others. Eastern Matters Ferros Allous and others reported in (2011)11-SCC-334 wherein it has been observed that the golden rule of interpretation is that the words of the statute have to be read and understood in their natural, ordinary and popular sense. Where however, the words used are capable of bearing two or more constructions, it is necessary to adopt purposive construction, to identify the construction to be preferred by posing the following questions. (i) what is the purpose for which the provision is made; (ii) what was the position before making the provision; (iii) whether any of the constructions proposed would lead to an absurd result or would render any part of the provisions redundant; (iv) which of the interpretations will advance the object of the provision. The answer to these questions will enable the Court to identify the purposive interpretation to be preferred while excluding others. Such an exercise is involving ascertainment of the object of the provision and choosing the interpretation that will advance the object of the provision can be undertaken only where the language of the provision is capable of more than one construction. It is further observed that Section 21 is amenable to two interpretations as is being highlighted by the 20 of 34 APL.186.2018.doc parties, in such event only that interpretation which advanced the object of the provision can be accepted. It is worthwhile to note that the Act enacted to prevent the occurrence ofdomestic violencein the society and keeping in view that several protection orders including the safety of the aggrieved person and the child have been contemplated to be passed. Therefore, the cause of the safety of the aggrieved person or the child is always warrants to be taken into account in interpreting the provision. In such situation if the interpretation given on behalf of the wife aggrieved parties accepted it will render the provision incomplete as in case where wife - aggrieved party seeks custody of the child, if the child is in custody of the husband and an order of custody is passed in favour of the aggrieved party, visitation right can be granted to the husband. But if custody lies with the wife - aggrieved party, than the husband will have no remedy of visitation right if the interpretation as contemplated by the wife - aggrieved party is given effect to and thereby it can easily be said that interpretation given by the aggrieved party - wife will never advance the cause of the child. On the other hand, if it is held that the husband, in absence of any application for grant of custody can maintain his application for visitation right will advance the object of the provision as in case of child being in custody of the husband, application for custody can be filed by the wife wherein the husband can have visitation right if order is of custody of child passed in favour of the aggrieved party. In other situation, when the custody of the child lies with the wife, there would be no occasion for the wife for filing an application for custody. In that situation, husband will have remedy to have visitation right by filing application to that effect. The said interpretation and observations can be applied in the present case.In the case of Dipti Bhandari (supra), the apex Court has dealt with a situation wherein the complaint under the DV Act was filed by wife. The husband preferred an application u/s 21 of DV Act for visitation rights which was dismissed by the Family Court. The husband filed an appeal against the said order before the District Judge, which was also dismissed. The husband then preferred an application u/s 482 of Cr.P.C for quashing the charge sheet in FIR u/s 498A of IPC. The High Court stayed the said proceedings. The husband also preferred petition challenging the proceedings under the DV Act. The same was also stayed by the High Court. The Court requested both the parties to consider settlement of the matter. The High Court also passed orders allowing visitation rights to respondent no.1 husband in respect of minor child. The order dismissing application for visitation right was challenged before the appropriate Court. The application for visitation rights was allowed and the petitioner therein was directed to arrange for the meeting of the respondent no.1 with the petitioner and their minor daughter. The Apex Court in the said decision modified the said order and disposed off the petition. The contention of the counsel for the respondent is that while deciding the said petition, the Apex Court did not observe that the application preferred by the husband u/s 21 of DV Act is not maintainable.It was also observed that the application filed under Section 21 of theDomestic ViolenceAct seeking interim custody is maintainable before a Magistrate exercising jurisdiction in relation to area where family Court is established and the Magistrate has jurisdiction to decide such an application in accordance with law. Irresistible conclusion further would be that the application filed under Section 21 before the Court of Judicial Magistrate First Class Amravati in the instant case is tenable and impugned order cannot be assailed on the ground of want of jurisdiction.20. For the reasons stated herein above, I do not find that the order passed by the Courts below suffers from any legal infirmity and petition is therefore devoid of merits and same deserves to be dismissed. Hence, I pass the following order.Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98560 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Your father can file an application seeking visitation rights under Section 21 of the DV Act through his advocate. The application can outline the reasons why visitation rights should be granted and any evidence supporting his case. Since the cases are in the initial stages, it's essential to cooperate with your advocate. If your mother has been summoned due to specific allegations, your advocate should prepare a defense based on the facts of the case and present it in court during the hearings. It's crucial to provide all relevant information and evidence to your advocate to strengthen your defense. Mutual agreements regarding custody, including visitation rights, are essential for maintaining family relationships and ensuring the well-being of the child. While such agreements are not legally binding unless endorsed by the court, they provide a framework for parents to cooperate in raising their child post-separation or divorce.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Divorce",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Custody decisions are typically made based on the best interests of the child, considering factors such as the child's age, the relationship with each parent, the ability of each parent to provide for the child's physical and emotional needs, and any history of abuse or neglect. If your wife is convicted in the FIR and it is deemed relevant to the custody decision, it could certainly impact the court's determination of what is in the best interests of the child. Regarding custody arrangements, \"joint custody\" can refer to joint legal custody, joint physical custody, or both. Joint legal custody typically means both parents share decision-making authority regarding important aspects of the child's life, such as education, healthcare, and religious upbringing. Joint physical custody involves the child spending significant time living with both parents. If you are awarded full custody of your child, it generally means that you have sole physical and legal custody, and your wife would likely be granted visitation rights or parenting time according to the court's determination of what is in the child's best interestsAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,When a wife elopes with an adopted daughter and seeks a divorce, the custody battle is complicated, especially when the father's adoption papers were on Though the CARA guidelines measure parents, although the adoptee is responsible for all the requirements of their child, the parents are equal legal guardians of the . adoption of children. The court will focus primarily on the welfare and well-being of the child when determining custody, considering factors such as emotional attachment, the ability to meet the child’s needs, and overall stability.The wife’s act of concealing the child complicates the situation and may be viewed negatively by the court, as it is seen as an attempt to give the father a fair chance. The Hindu Minority Guardians Act, 1956, also gives natural rights to both parents, with the father having superior rights to the sons, unless the mother is found unfit.In summary, although the adoption was on the father's certificate, the wife can still claim maintenance. The court will focus on the best interests of the child, and the custody of the legal father can assist in making appropriate custody arrangements. The Court dislikes the unilateral action of a mother with her child and emphasises the child's right to access to both parents"

If your society refuses to do so, you can lodge a formal complaint.If there is no response during this period, you can approach the deputy registrar’s office, which regulates matters pertaining to housing societies.After the hearing, if it is found that the members are indeed holding positions without having contested the elections, the existing committee can be dissolved. In its place, the deputy registrar can appoint an administrative officer to run the affairs of the society till fresh elections are conducted, which should take place within six months."

    "answer": "Bombay High CourtPayal Sudeep Laad Alias Payal Sharma vs Sudeep Govind Laad And Anr on 2 November, 2018Equivalent citations: AIRONLINE 2018 BOM 1230Author: Prakash D. Naikthe respondent no.1 filed an application for child access u/s 21 of DV Act on 20th December 2017. The matter was heard by the Trial Court and by order dated 5 th January 2018, the learned Magistrate partly allowed the application allowing access of Vihan to respondent no.1.6. It is further submitted that the applicant then preferred an appeal before the Sessions Court which was heard at length. Both the sides were heard and case laws were tendered by both the parties. The Sessions Court was pleased to dismiss the appeal and . upheld the legality and validity of order dated 5 th January 2018 passed by the learned Magistrate.It is contended that since Section 21 does not provide any right to the husband to prefer such application, and since the legislature has not provided such right to the husband, except as stipulated in Section 21 of DV Act, the Court ought not to have entertained the application and granted relief as prayed by respondent no.1. If the interpretation advanced by the applicant is accepted, it would defeat the whole purpose of the statute. It is well settled principle of interpretation that Court must start with the presumption that legislature did not make a mistake and it must interpret so as to carry out the obvious intention of legislature and 18 of 34 APL.186.2018.doc that it must not correct or make up a deficiency nor the Court read into a provision any word which is not there particularly when literal reading does not lead to an intelligible result. The said proposition of law has been laid down in the case of Rajender Prashad Vs. Darshana Devi (2001)7-SCC-69. In the case of Nathidevi Vs. Radhadevi Gupta (2005)2-SCC-271, it was observed that in interpreting a statute, Court must, if the words are clear, plain, unambiguous and reasonable insusceptible to only one meaning, give to the words that meaning irrespective of the consequences.12. In the present case, it is the grievance of the applicant that on 2nd December, 2017, on account of the circumstances referred to by her, the applicant had left the matrimonial home along with the child. The reliefs sought in the application enumerates the reliefs under Sections 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 of the said Act. The complaint also mentions that requisite orders under Section 21 with regards to the custody of the child are also sought. The said aspect is apparent from paragraph 5 of the complaint. The intent of the legislature as expressed under the proviso has to be taken into account keeping in view the aim and object of the Act. The application under Section 21 of the Act by the respondent could be made in the factual matrix of the present case.In the case of Smt. Hudidrom Ningol Ongbi (supra) relied upon by the counsel for the respondent the High Court of Manipur has observed that where there is no obscurity or ambiguity and intention of legislature is clearly conveyed, there is no scope for the Court to innovate or to take upon its task of amending or altering a statutory provisions which proposition of law has been laid down in several cases including in a case of Institute of Chartered Accounts of India Vs. Price Water 19 of 34 APL.186.2018.doc House and another - (1997)6-SCC-312. In that case it has been observed that the judges should not proclaim that they are playing the role of law makers merely for an exhibition of judicial valour. They should remember that there is a line though thin which separates adjudication from legislation. That line should not be crossed.This can be vouchsafed by an alert recognition of the necessity not to cross it and instinctive as well as trained reluctance to do so. However, where there appears to be obscurity, ambiguity, what the Court is supposed to do has been dealt with in the case of Grid Corporation of Orissa Limited Vs. And others. Eastern Matters Ferros Allous and others reported in (2011)11-SCC-334 wherein it has been observed that the golden rule of interpretation is that the words of the statute have to be read and understood in their natural, ordinary and popular sense. Where however, the words used are capable of bearing two or more constructions, it is necessary to adopt purposive construction, to identify the construction to be preferred by posing the following questions. (i) what is the purpose for which the provision is made; (ii) what was the position before making the provision; (iii) whether any of the constructions proposed would lead to an absurd result or would render any part of the provisions redundant; (iv) which of the interpretations will advance the object of the provision. The answer to these questions will enable the Court to identify the purposive interpretation to be preferred while excluding others. Such an exercise is involving ascertainment of the object of the provision and choosing the interpretation that will advance the object of the provision can be undertaken only where the language of the provision is capable of more than one construction. It is further observed that Section 21 is amenable to two interpretations as is being highlighted by the 20 of 34 APL.186.2018.doc parties, in such event only that interpretation which advanced the object of the provision can be accepted. It is worthwhile to note that the Act enacted to prevent the occurrence ofdomestic violencein the society and keeping in view that several protection orders including the safety of the aggrieved person and the child have been contemplated to be passed. Therefore, the cause of the safety of the aggrieved person or the child is always warrants to be taken into account in interpreting the provision. In such situation if the interpretation given on behalf of the wife aggrieved parties accepted it will render the provision incomplete as in case where wife - aggrieved party seeks custody of the child, if the child is in custody of the husband and an order of custody is passed in favour of the aggrieved party, visitation right can be granted to the husband. But if custody lies with the wife - aggrieved party, than the husband will have no remedy of visitation right if the interpretation as contemplated by the wife - aggrieved party is given effect to and thereby it can easily be said that interpretation given by the aggrieved party - wife will never advance the cause of the child. On the other hand, if it is held that the husband, in absence of any application for grant of custody can maintain his application for visitation right will advance the object of the provision as in case of child being in custody of the husband, application for custody can be filed by the wife wherein the husband can have visitation right if order is of custody of child passed in favour of the aggrieved party. In other situation, when the custody of the child lies with the wife, there would be no occasion for the wife for filing an application for custody. In that situation, husband will have remedy to have visitation right by filing application to that effect. The said interpretation and observations can be applied in the present case.In the case of Dipti Bhandari (supra), the apex Court has dealt with a situation wherein the complaint under the DV Act was filed by wife. The husband preferred an application u/s 21 of DV Act for visitation rights which was dismissed by the Family Court. The husband filed an appeal against the said order before the District Judge, which was also dismissed. The husband then preferred an application u/s 482 of Cr.P.C for quashing the charge sheet in FIR u/s 498A of IPC. The High Court stayed the said proceedings. The husband also preferred petition challenging the proceedings under the DV Act. The same was also stayed by the High Court. The Court requested both the parties to consider settlement of the matter. The High Court also passed orders allowing visitation rights to respondent no.1 husband in respect of minor child. The order dismissing application for visitation right was challenged before the appropriate Court. The application for visitation rights was allowed and the petitioner therein was directed to arrange for the meeting of the respondent no.1 with the petitioner and their minor daughter. The Apex Court in the said decision modified the said order and disposed off the petition. The contention of the counsel for the respondent is that while deciding the said petition, the Apex Court did not observe that the application preferred by the husband u/s 21 of DV Act is not maintainable.It was also observed that the application filed under Section 21 of theDomestic ViolenceAct seeking interim custody is maintainable before a Magistrate exercising jurisdiction in relation to area where family Court is established and the Magistrate has jurisdiction to decide such an application in accordance with law. Irresistible conclusion further would be that the application filed under Section 21 before the Court of Judicial Magistrate First Class Amravati in the instant case is tenable and impugned order cannot be assailed on the ground of want of jurisdiction.20. For the reasons stated herein above, I do not find that the order passed by the Courts below suffers from any legal infirmity and petition is therefore devoid of merits and same deserves to be dismissed. Hence, I pass the following order.Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98560 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Your father can file an application seeking visitation rights under Section 21 of the DV Act through his advocate. The application can outline the reasons why visitation rights should be granted and any evidence supporting his case. Since the cases are in the initial stages, it's essential to cooperate with your advocate. If your mother has been summoned due to specific allegations, your advocate should prepare a defense based on the facts of the case and present it in court during the hearings. It's crucial to provide all relevant information and evidence to your advocate to strengthen your defense. Mutual agreements regarding custody, including visitation rights, are essential for maintaining family relationships and ensuring the well-being of the child. While such agreements are not legally binding unless endorsed by the court, they provide a framework for parents to cooperate in raising their child post-separation or divorce.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Withdraw from buying a flat, 3 months after signing Sale Agreement",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Whether you can withdraw from the agreement depends on the terms outlined in the Sale Agreement you signed with the builder. Generally, most Sale Agreements include provisions for cancellation and withdrawal, but they often come with certain conditions and penalties. Regarding the builder's cancellation policy, it's not uncommon for builders to have clauses stating that the entire amount or a portion of it will not be refunded in case of cancellation. However, the legality of such clauses depends on the specific terms and local regulations governing property transactions in Hyderabad. It's advisable to consult with a legal expert or a real estate attorney who can review the agreement and provide guidance on the legality of the cancellation policy. If the builder's cancellation policy states that the entire amount paid will not be refunded, then there's a possibility that you may lose the entire 13 lakhs. Again, this would depend on the specific terms of the agreement and the applicable laws. Your options may include negotiating with the builder for a partial refund, seeking legal advice to understand your rights and options, or exploring alternative solutions such as finding another buyer for your Bangalore plot or finding alternative sources of funding for the flat purchase. It's essential to carefully review the terms of the Sale Agreement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If your wife is convicted in the FIR and it is deemed relevant to the custody decision, it could certainly impact the court's determination of what is in the best interests of the child. Regarding custody arrangements, \"joint custody\" can refer to joint legal custody, joint physical custody, or both. Joint legal custody typically means both parents share decision-making authority regarding important aspects of the child's life, such as education, healthcare, and religious upbringing. Joint physical custody involves the child spending significant time living with both parents. If you are awarded full custody of your child, it generally means that you have sole physical and legal custody, and your wife would likely be granted visitation rights or parenting time according to the court's determination of what is in the child's best interestsAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The court will focus primarily on the welfare and well-being of the child when determining custody, considering factors such as emotional attachment, the ability to meet the child’s needs, and overall stability.The wife’s act of concealing the child complicates the situation and may be viewed negatively by the court, as it is seen as an attempt to give the father a fair chance. The Hindu Minority Guardians Act, 1956, also gives natural rights to both parents, with the father having superior rights to the sons, unless the mother is found unfit.In summary, although the adoption was on the father's certificate, the wife can still claim maintenance. The court will focus on the best interests of the child, and the custody of the legal father can assist in making appropriate custody arrangements. The Court dislikes the unilateral action of a mother with her child and emphasises the child's right to access to both parents"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Both parents typically have equal rights when it comes to making decisions about their child's education, unless otherwise specified by a court order. If your sister and her husband have not gone through a legal separation or divorce process, the husband may still have legal rights regarding the child's education. Schools often require documentation such as a birth certificate and sometimes proof of guardianship or custody. If your sister is the legal guardian of her daughter or has sole custody, she should be able to provide documentation to support this. While it's ideal to involve both parents in a child's education, if the father is not taking responsibility and your sister has legal custody or guardianship, she may be able to enroll her daughter in school without his involvement. However, this could potentially lead to legal complications if the father disagrees or challenges the decision. Whether or not to include the father's name on the admission form depends on the school's requirements and the legal situation.

Regarding your question about the EC for the specific apartment, it's common for such documents to not be available until the apartments are individually registered. In the absence of an apartment-specific EC, a document on the builder's letterhead confirming that the apartment has not been sold to anyone else and that you are the first buyer can indeed serve as additional proof of ownership. However, it's essential to ensure that the letter from the builder includes all relevant details, such as the apartment number, building name, survey number, and any other identifying information. This letter should also be duly signed and stamped by the builder for authenticity. Overall, while the absence of an apartment-specific EC might seem like a gap, the builder's letter can serve as a valid interim solution until such documentation becomes available.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Here's why:An EC typically reflects encumbrances on the land itself, not individual units within a new building. Since the building is under construction, a traditional EC for the apartment might not be available yet.However, there are alternative ways to confirm the property's status:Builder Agreement:Meticulously review the agreement you have with the builder. It should clearly mention the specific apartment you're buying and confirm its free from any encumbrances.Sale Deed with Undertaking:A registered sale deed with an undertaking from the builder can serve as proof of your purchase and guarantee the apartment is free from claims. This undertaking should state that the builder will be responsible for any existing or future encumbrances on the property.You can also apply for Loan from a bank and pay the due diligence fees and you may not opt for taking loan afterwards. The benefit of this will be, that the bank will check everything for you.Here are some additional points to consider:Verify Builder Reputation:Research the builder's reputation in Vizag. Look for online reviews and check with local authorities for any complaints against them.Don't Rely Solely on Verbal Assurances:While a letter from the builder is a good starting point, don't rely solely on their verbal assurances. Get everything documented properly in the sale agreement and undertaking.By taking these steps, you can be more confident that you're buying a property with a clear title and minimizing the risk of future disputes.Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighCourt."

While the original deed may only mention the super built area, if the local regulations require both super built and carpet area to be specified, it might be necessary to include an estimate of the carpet area. However, it's essential to ensure that any estimates provided are accurate and clearly disclosed as approximations. It's generally advisable to adhere to the requirements specified for submitting queries, as failure to do so might result in rejection or delays in processing. If the lawyer had to include the carpet area in the query to meet regulatory standards, it might not be feasible to exclude it in the gift deed without potentially facing complications or non-compliance issues. It's possible to mention in the gift deed that your father is transferring his share of the super built area of the flat to you, especially if you jointly hold the flat with him.

    "question": "Withdraw from buying a flat, 3 months after signing Sale Agreement",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Whether you can withdraw from the agreement depends on the terms outlined in the Sale Agreement you signed with the builder. Generally, most Sale Agreements include provisions for cancellation and withdrawal, but they often come with certain conditions and penalties. Regarding the builder's cancellation policy, it's not uncommon for builders to have clauses stating that the entire amount or a portion of it will not be refunded in case of cancellation. However, the legality of such clauses depends on the specific terms and local regulations governing property transactions in Hyderabad. It's advisable to consult with a legal expert or a real estate attorney who can review the agreement and provide guidance on the legality of the cancellation policy. If the builder's cancellation policy states that the entire amount paid will not be refunded, then there's a possibility that you may lose the entire 13 lakhs. Again, this would depend on the specific terms of the agreement and the applicable laws. Your options may include negotiating with the builder for a partial refund, seeking legal advice to understand your rights and options, or exploring alternative solutions such as finding another buyer for your Bangalore plot or finding alternative sources of funding for the flat purchase.

    "question": "Regarding visitation rights for father under section 21 act of DV",
    "answer": "Bombay High CourtPayal Sudeep Laad Alias Payal Sharma vs Sudeep Govind Laad And Anr on 2 November, 2018Equivalent citations: AIRONLINE 2018 BOM 1230Author: Prakash D. Naikthe respondent no.1 filed an application for child access u/s 21 of DV Act on 20th December 2017. The matter was heard by the Trial Court and by order dated 5 th January 2018, the learned Magistrate partly allowed the application allowing access of Vihan to respondent no.1.6. It is further submitted that the applicant then preferred an appeal before the Sessions Court which was heard at length. Both the sides were heard and case laws were tendered by both the parties. The Sessions Court was pleased to dismiss the appeal and . upheld the legality and validity of order dated 5 th January 2018 passed by the learned Magistrate.It is contended that since Section 21 does not provide any right to the husband to prefer such application, and since the legislature has not provided such right to the husband, except as stipulated in Section 21 of DV Act, the Court ought not to have entertained the application and granted relief as prayed by respondent no.1. If the interpretation advanced by the applicant is accepted, it would defeat the whole purpose of the statute. It is well settled principle of interpretation that Court must start with the presumption that legislature did not make a mistake and it must interpret so as to carry out the obvious intention of legislature and 18 of 34 APL.186.2018.doc that it must not correct or make up a deficiency nor the Court read into a provision any word which is not there particularly when literal reading does not lead to an intelligible result. The said proposition of law has been laid down in the case of Rajender Prashad Vs. Darshana Devi (2001)7-SCC-69. In the case of Nathidevi Vs. Radhadevi Gupta (2005)2-SCC-271, it was observed that in interpreting a statute, Court must, if the words are clear, plain, unambiguous and reasonable insusceptible to only one meaning, give to the words that meaning irrespective of the consequences.12. In the present case, it is the grievance of the applicant that on 2nd December, 2017, on account of the circumstances referred to by her, the applicant had left the matrimonial home along with the child. The reliefs sought in the application enumerates the reliefs under Sections 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 of the said Act. The complaint also mentions that requisite orders under Section 21 with regards to the custody of the child are also sought. The said aspect is apparent from paragraph 5 of the complaint. The intent of the legislature as expressed under the proviso has to be taken into account keeping in view the aim and object of the Act. The application under Section 21 of the Act by the respondent could be made in the factual matrix of the present case.In the case of Smt. Hudidrom Ningol Ongbi (supra) relied upon by the counsel for the respondent the High Court of Manipur has observed that where there is no obscurity or ambiguity and intention of legislature is clearly conveyed, there is no scope for the Court to innovate or to take upon its task of amending or altering a statutory provisions which proposition of law has been laid down in several cases including in a case of Institute of Chartered Accounts of India Vs. Price Water 19 of 34 APL.186.2018.doc House and another - (1997)6-SCC-312. In that case it has been observed that the judges should not proclaim that they are playing the role of law makers merely for an exhibition of judicial valour. They should remember that there is a line though thin which separates adjudication from legislation. That line should not be crossed.This can be vouchsafed by an alert recognition of the necessity not to cross it and instinctive as well as trained reluctance to do so. However, where there appears to be obscurity, ambiguity, what the Court is supposed to do has been dealt with in the case of Grid Corporation of Orissa Limited Vs. And others. Eastern Matters Ferros Allous and others reported in (2011)11-SCC-334 wherein it has been observed that the golden rule of interpretation is that the words of the statute have to be read and understood in their natural, ordinary and popular sense. Where however, the words used are capable of bearing two or more constructions, it is necessary to adopt purposive construction, to identify the construction to be preferred by posing the following questions. (i) what is the purpose for which the provision is made; (ii) what was the position before making the provision; (iii) whether any of the constructions proposed would lead to an absurd result or would render any part of the provisions redundant; (iv) which of the interpretations will advance the object of the provision. The answer to these questions will enable the Court to identify the purposive interpretation to be preferred while excluding others. Such an exercise is involving ascertainment of the object of the provision and choosing the interpretation that will advance the object of the provision can be undertaken only where the language of the provision is capable of more than one construction. It is further observed that Section 21 is amenable to two interpretations as is being highlighted by the 20 of 34 APL.186.2018.doc parties, in such event only that interpretation which advanced the object of the provision can be accepted. It is worthwhile to note that the Act enacted to prevent the occurrence ofdomestic violencein the society and keeping in view that several protection orders including the safety of the aggrieved person and the child have been contemplated to be passed. Therefore, the cause of the safety of the aggrieved person or the child is always warrants to be taken into account in interpreting the provision. In such situation if the interpretation given on behalf of the wife aggrieved parties accepted it will render the provision incomplete as in case where wife - aggrieved party seeks custody of the child, if the child is in custody of the husband and an order of custody is passed in favour of the aggrieved party, visitation right can be granted to the husband. But if custody lies with the wife - aggrieved party, than the husband will have no remedy of visitation right if the interpretation as contemplated by the wife - aggrieved party is given effect to and thereby it can easily be said that interpretation given by the aggrieved party - wife will never advance the cause of the child. On the other hand, if it is held that the husband, in absence of any application for grant of custody can maintain his application for visitation right will advance the object of the provision as in case of child being in custody of the husband, application for custody can be filed by the wife wherein the husband can have visitation right if order is of custody of child passed in favour of the aggrieved party. In other situation, when the custody of the child lies with the wife, there would be no occasion for the wife for filing an application for custody. In that situation, husband will have remedy to have visitation right by filing application to that effect. The said interpretation and observations can be applied in the present case.In the case of Dipti Bhandari (supra), the apex Court has dealt with a situation wherein the complaint under the DV Act was filed by wife. The husband preferred an application u/s 21 of DV Act for visitation rights which was dismissed by the Family Court. The husband filed an appeal against the said order before the District Judge, which was also dismissed. The husband then preferred an application u/s 482 of Cr.P.C for quashing the charge sheet in FIR u/s 498A of IPC. The High Court stayed the said proceedings. The husband also preferred petition challenging the proceedings under the DV Act. The same was also stayed by the High Court. The Court requested both the parties to consider settlement of the matter. The High Court also passed orders allowing visitation rights to respondent no.1 husband in respect of minor child. The order dismissing application for visitation right was challenged before the appropriate Court. The application for visitation rights was allowed and the petitioner therein was directed to arrange for the meeting of the respondent no.1 with the petitioner and their minor daughter. The Apex Court in the said decision modified the said order and disposed off the petition. The contention of the counsel for the respondent is that while deciding the said petition, the Apex Court did not observe that the application preferred by the husband u/s 21 of DV Act is not maintainable.It was also observed that the application filed under Section 21 of theDomestic ViolenceAct seeking interim custody is maintainable before a Magistrate exercising jurisdiction in relation to area where family Court is established and the Magistrate has jurisdiction to decide such an application in accordance with law. Irresistible conclusion further would be that the application filed under Section 21 before the Court of Judicial Magistrate First Class Amravati in the instant case is tenable and impugned order cannot be assailed on the ground of want of jurisdiction.20. For the reasons stated herein above, I do not find that the order passed by the Courts below suffers from any legal infirmity and petition is therefore devoid of merits and same deserves to be dismissed. Hence, I pass the following order.Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98560 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Your father can file an application seeking visitation rights under Section 21 of the DV Act through his advocate. The application can outline the reasons why visitation rights should be granted and any evidence supporting his case. Since the cases are in the initial stages, it's essential to cooperate with your advocate. If your mother has been summoned due to specific allegations, your advocate should prepare a defense based on the facts of the case and present it in court during the hearings. It's crucial to provide all relevant information and evidence to your advocate to strengthen your defense. Mutual agreements regarding custody, including visitation rights, are essential for maintaining family relationships and ensuring the well-being of the child. While such agreements are not legally binding unless endorsed by the court, they provide a framework for parents to cooperate in raising their child post-separation or divorce.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Nageswara Rao for granting the injunction when there is no sufficient basis to do so without sufficient notice violating your rights and procedurally unfair. Although there are concerns that complaints against both judges should be made, it may be more beneficial to aim at the junior judge if you think he is pressured by the first judge. Whatever samples of his calls or conversation or other such material for substantiating the allegations compiled by her must be compiled completely. The approach is associated with Section 27 of the CPC pointing out that proper summon and fair hearing should be conducted in the case.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

RERA has the authority to enforce its orders, and they can take action against the builder for non-compliance, which may include penalties or other measures. You can also consider filing a case in the consumer court to increase pressure on the builder. Since you're from Indore and the flat is in Jaipur, you may prefer to file the case in Indore. Even though the initial agreement mentioned Jaipur as the jurisdiction, since there is no jurisdiction mentioned in the registry, you might have more flexibility in choosing the jurisdiction. Make sure to keep all communication with the builder, including emails, letters, and any agreements or court orders.

    "question": "I am giving interest free loan to a person for establishing an institute in my locality",
    "answer": "Dear Client,When drafting a contract for this loan arrangement, it's important to be clear and precise to avoid any misunderstandings later on. Here's a basic outline of the contractual conditions you can include:Clearly state the loan amount (5 lakh rupees) and the repayment terms (within 15 months).Specify whether there will be any interest charged on the loan. If there is, clearly outline the interest rate and how it will be calculated. If there is no interest charged mention it.Provide a repayment schedule detailing when and how the borrower will make payments. This could include monthly, quarterly, or lump-sum payments.Define penalties or consequences for late or missed payments. This could include additional interest, forfeiture of collateral, or any other agreed-upon penalties.If the loan is secured by any assets or collateral, describe them in detail.Specify that the borrower will have full autonomy over the institute's operations, including financial management, hiring, and curriculum.Ensure that the borrower agrees to comply with all applicable laws and regulations related to operating an educational institute.Outline the consequences if the borrower defaults on the loan, including any legal actions you may take to recover the outstanding amount.Include a clause outlining how any disputes will be resolved, whether through arbitration, mediation, or legal action.Specify the governing law of the contract, which would likely be Indian law in this case.Additionally, you may have to consider having the contract translated into Bengali by a qualified translator to ensure clarity and understanding by both parties.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "I am giving interest free loan to a person for establishing an institute in my locality",
    "answer": "Here are the options considering you want your principal amount back in full within 15 months, without any interest or profit:Options with Repayment Guarantee:Direct Loan with Promissory Note:This is a simpler option. You provide a loan of 5 lakh rupees to the Imam. However, unlike a traditional loan, you won't charge interest. A promissory note is a legal document signed by the Imam acknowledging the debt and promising repayment within a specific timeframe (15 months in this case). This document can be helpful if there's a need to enforce repayment through legal means, though it's best to avoid this scenario.Security Deposit:This option involves framing the 5 lakh rupees as a security deposit for the institute's proper establishment and adherence to your initial vision. A legal agreement would outline the terms of the deposit, including its purpose (starting the institute) and the repayment timeframe (15 months). Upon successful establishment and operation for 15 months, the 5 lakh rupees would be returned to you.Important Considerations:Legal Agreements:For both options above,, draft a watertight agreement that protects your interests and ensures the Imam understands the repayment obligations.Guarantor:Consider having a guarantor (another trusted person) co-sign the agreement. This provides an additional layer of security in case the Imam is unable to repay.Alternative Option with Risk Mitigation:Staggered Grant:Instead of a lump sum, consider providing the funds in stages. An initial amount can be provided to kickstart the institute. Subsequent tranches can be released based on achieving pre-defined milestones (e.g., enrollment targets, completion of specific facilities). This approach offers some control over how the funds are used and reduces the risk of losing the entire amount upfront.Remember:While these options offer some safeguards, lending money always carries inherent risk. Carefully evaluate the Imam's credibility and his ability to repay within the timeframe.By discussing these options with the Imam , you can choose the approach that best balances your desire to support the institute with protecting your principal amount.Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighCourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

You can also specify that the loan will be disbursed in stages.Within the contract, include a section detailing the disbursement schedule. This should outline the specific amounts to be disbursed at each stage, as well as any conditions that need to be met before each disbursement.For each payment made by the borrower, you can create a section in the contract where both parties acknowledge the payment. This could include the date of payment, the amount paid, and any relevant reference numbers (e.g., check number, bank transfer reference). Both parties should sign and date each entry to acknowledge the payment.It's also a good idea to provide the borrower with a receipt for each payment they make. This can be a separate document or part of the contract itself. The receipt should include the same information as the payment record section of the contract.You can keep track of these records digitally or in physical form, depending on your preference. If using digital records, consider storing them securely online or on a password-protected device. If using physical records, keep them in a safe place where they won't be lost or damaged.By including these elements in the contract, you'll have a clear record of each stage of the loan disbursement and repayment process.

    "question": "Withdraw from buying a flat, 3 months after signing Sale Agreement",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Whether you can withdraw from the agreement depends on the terms outlined in the Sale Agreement you signed with the builder. Generally, most Sale Agreements include provisions for cancellation and withdrawal, but they often come with certain conditions and penalties. Regarding the builder's cancellation policy, it's not uncommon for builders to have clauses stating that the entire amount or a portion of it will not be refunded in case of cancellation. However, the legality of such clauses depends on the specific terms and local regulations governing property transactions in Hyderabad. It's advisable to consult with a legal expert or a real estate attorney who can review the agreement and provide guidance on the legality of the cancellation policy. If the builder's cancellation policy states that the entire amount paid will not be refunded, then there's a possibility that you may lose the entire 13 lakhs. Again, this would depend on the specific terms of the agreement and the applicable laws. Your options may include negotiating with the builder for a partial refund, seeking legal advice to understand your rights and options, or exploring alternative solutions such as finding another buyer for your Bangalore plot or finding alternative sources of funding for the flat purchase. It's essential to carefully review the terms of the Sale Agreement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Without the protections offered by legal frameworks, users may become susceptible to fraud or theft, with limited avenues for recovery.2)Many exchanges explicitly prohibit VPN usage in their terms of service.

VPN usage might hinder compliance with know-your-customer (KYC) and AML policies, potentially leading to account verification issues or even suspension.3. **Suspicious Activity:** VPNs might trigger suspicion as they obscure IP addresses, potentially raising red flags for exchanges monitoring for fraudulent or suspicious behavior, leading to account investigations or freezes.3) using a VPN to access an exchange may be considered a form of tax evasion or money laundering.Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98560 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "question": "Repercussions of investment in crypto through banned exchanges using VPN",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Using VPN to bypass restrictions may violate Indian laws and regulations related to crypto currency trading. The Indian government has taken a cautious approach towards crypto currencies and has imposed restrictions on trading and using them. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has issued warnings against dealing with crypto currencies through unauthorized channels, and there may be legal consequences for violating these warnings. Funds held in accounts on these exchanges may be at risk. If the government cracks down on these exchanges or if they face regulatory issues, there is a possibility of losing access to your funds. Since these exchanges operate outside of India's regulatory framework, there may be fewer protections for investors, and disputes or issues with transactions may be more challenging to resolve. If caught, you may face penalties, fines, or other punitive actions from regulatory authorities. The exact punishment can vary depending on the severity of the violation and may include fines, seizure of assets, or legal action. It's essential to understand that while using a VPN might help you bypass restrictions temporarily, it does not guarantee anonymity or protection from legal consequences. Additionally, the crypto currency landscape is constantly evolving, and regulations may change, potentially increasing the risks associated with trading on banned platforms.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "- Legally, the VPN is not been banned in India.- However, as perthe Reserve Bank of India, cryptocurrencies lack underlying value and therefore cannot be considered as currencies.- Further, theoffshore exchanges like Binance, Bitstamp, Kucoin, Huobi, MEXC Global, Kraken, Gate.io, Bitfinex and Bittrex are banned in India  due to their disobedience of Indian anti-money laundering regulations.- Further, 30% crypto tax is levied when trading crypto.

    "question": "I am giving interest free loan to a person for establishing an institute in my locality",
    "answer": "Dear Client,When drafting a contract for this loan arrangement, it's important to be clear and precise to avoid any misunderstandings later on. Here's a basic outline of the contractual conditions you can include:Clearly state the loan amount (5 lakh rupees) and the repayment terms (within 15 months).Specify whether there will be any interest charged on the loan. If there is, clearly outline the interest rate and how it will be calculated. If there is no interest charged mention it.Provide a repayment schedule detailing when and how the borrower will make payments. This could include monthly, quarterly, or lump-sum payments.Define penalties or consequences for late or missed payments. This could include additional interest, forfeiture of collateral, or any other agreed-upon penalties.If the loan is secured by any assets or collateral, describe them in detail.Specify that the borrower will have full autonomy over the institute's operations, including financial management, hiring, and curriculum.Ensure that the borrower agrees to comply with all applicable laws and regulations related to operating an educational institute.Outline the consequences if the borrower defaults on the loan, including any legal actions you may take to recover the outstanding amount.Include a clause outlining how any disputes will be resolved, whether through arbitration, mediation, or legal action.Specify the governing law of the contract, which would likely be Indian law in this case.Additionally, you may have to consider having the contract translated into Bengali by a qualified translator to ensure clarity and understanding by both parties.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "I am giving interest free loan to a person for establishing an institute in my locality",
    "answer": "Here are the options considering you want your principal amount back in full within 15 months, without any interest or profit:Options with Repayment Guarantee:Direct Loan with Promissory Note:This is a simpler option. You provide a loan of 5 lakh rupees to the Imam. However, unlike a traditional loan, you won't charge interest. A promissory note is a legal document signed by the Imam acknowledging the debt and promising repayment within a specific timeframe (15 months in this case). This document can be helpful if there's a need to enforce repayment through legal means, though it's best to avoid this scenario.Security Deposit:This option involves framing the 5 lakh rupees as a security deposit for the institute's proper establishment and adherence to your initial vision. A legal agreement would outline the terms of the deposit, including its purpose (starting the institute) and the repayment timeframe (15 months). Upon successful establishment and operation for 15 months, the 5 lakh rupees would be returned to you.Important Considerations:Legal Agreements:For both options above,, draft a watertight agreement that protects your interests and ensures the Imam understands the repayment obligations.Guarantor:Consider having a guarantor (another trusted person) co-sign the agreement. This provides an additional layer of security in case the Imam is unable to repay.Alternative Option with Risk Mitigation:Staggered Grant:Instead of a lump sum, consider providing the funds in stages. An initial amount can be provided to kickstart the institute. Subsequent tranches can be released based on achieving pre-defined milestones (e.g., enrollment targets, completion of specific facilities). This approach offers some control over how the funds are used and reduces the risk of losing the entire amount upfront.Remember:While these options offer some safeguards, lending money always carries inherent risk. Carefully evaluate the Imam's credibility and his ability to repay within the timeframe.By discussing these options with the Imam , you can choose the approach that best balances your desire to support the institute with protecting your principal amount.Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighCourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The initial contract should outline the terms of the loan, including the total amount, interest rate (if any), repayment schedule, and any other relevant terms. You can also specify that the loan will be disbursed in stages.Within the contract, include a section detailing the disbursement schedule. This should outline the specific amounts to be disbursed at each stage, as well as any conditions that need to be met before each disbursement.For each payment made by the borrower, you can create a section in the contract where both parties acknowledge the payment. This could include the date of payment, the amount paid, and any relevant reference numbers (e.g., check number, bank transfer reference). Both parties should sign and date each entry to acknowledge the payment.It's also a good idea to provide the borrower with a receipt for each payment they make. This can be a separate document or part of the contract itself. The receipt should include the same information as the payment record section of the contract.You can keep track of these records digitally or in physical form, depending on your preference. If using digital records, consider storing them securely online or on a password-protected device. If using physical records, keep them in a safe place where they won't be lost or damaged.By including these elements in the contract, you'll have a clear record of each stage of the loan disbursement and repayment process.

    "question": "Purchasing new apartment from builder",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The documents you mentioned, such as the Occupancy Certificate (OC), new building permit, environmental clearance, and the Encumbrance Certificate (EC) for the land, are all crucial in ensuring the legitimacy of the property. Regarding your question about the EC for the specific apartment, it's common for such documents to not be available until the apartments are individually registered. In the absence of an apartment-specific EC, a document on the builder's letterhead confirming that the apartment has not been sold to anyone else and that you are the first buyer can indeed serve as additional proof of ownership. However, it's essential to ensure that the letter from the builder includes all relevant details, such as the apartment number, building name, survey number, and any other identifying information. This letter should also be duly signed and stamped by the builder for authenticity. Overall, while the absence of an apartment-specific EC might seem like a gap, the builder's letter can serve as a valid interim solution until such documentation becomes available.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "While a letter from the builder stating you're the first buyer is a positive sign, it's not sufficient for an Encumbrance Certificate (EC) for the specific apartment. Here's why:An EC typically reflects encumbrances on the land itself, not individual units within a new building. Since the building is under construction, a traditional EC for the apartment might not be available yet.However, there are alternative ways to confirm the property's status:Builder Agreement:Meticulously review the agreement you have with the builder. It should clearly mention the specific apartment you're buying and confirm its free from any encumbrances.Sale Deed with Undertaking:A registered sale deed with an undertaking from the builder can serve as proof of your purchase and guarantee the apartment is free from claims. This undertaking should state that the builder will be responsible for any existing or future encumbrances on the property.You can also apply for Loan from a bank and pay the due diligence fees and you may not opt for taking loan afterwards. The benefit of this will be, that the bank will check everything for you.Here are some additional points to consider:Verify Builder Reputation:Research the builder's reputation in Vizag. Look for online reviews and check with local authorities for any complaints against them.Don't Rely Solely on Verbal Assurances:While a letter from the builder is a good starting point, don't rely solely on their verbal assurances. Get everything documented properly in the sale agreement and undertaking.By taking these steps, you can be more confident that you're buying a property with a clear title and minimizing the risk of future disputes.Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighCourt."
