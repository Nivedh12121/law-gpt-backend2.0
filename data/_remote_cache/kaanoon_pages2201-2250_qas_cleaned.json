    "context": "Asked 2 years ago in Property Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Adoption son rights",
    "answer": "Based on the information you have provided, here are some general points to consider:Adoption Deed: The adoption deed registered in 1955, where your grandfather stated that all the property would be passed on to your father after the death of your grandparents, can be considered as a legal document. It signifies your father's right to inherit the property.Subsequent Will: The will written by your grandfather in 1958, dividing the properties into three parts, could impact the inheritance. However, if the adoption deed clearly stated that all the property would go to your father after the death of your grandparents, the subsequent will may be disputed based on the earlier adoption deed. A lawyer can review both documents to provide specific guidance.Will of Grandmothers: The wills written by your grandmothers, diverting the properties to their relative, may have legal implications. It would be important to assess the validity of these wills and the circumstances under which they were made. Factors such as the mental capacity of your grandmothers, undue influence, and the legal requirements for making a valid will should be considered.Rights of Minor: The fact that your father was a minor at the time of the adoption and subsequent wills may also impact the situation. Depending on the laws in your jurisdiction, special rules may apply to protect the rights of minors in inheritance matters.Undisclosed Properties: If there are properties that were not mentioned in the partition deed but were owned by your grandfather, the rights to those properties would need to be determined. The laws of succession and inheritance in your jurisdiction would apply to these undisclosed properties.Given the complexity of the situation and the need for a detailed analysis of the legal documents involved, it is highly recommended that you consult with a lawyer. They will be able to review the adoption deed, subsequent wills, and any other relevant documents, as well as consider the applicable laws to provide you with the specific advice you need.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Validity of the Partition Deed:A Partition Deed is typically a legal document that divides property among co-owners. Your father's age at the time the deed was executed (around 10) could potentially be a factor in its validity.In many jurisdictions, a minor cannot enter into a legally binding contract. Therefore, the validity of the Partition Deed may be questioned if your father was a minor at the time.Court Permission for Partition Deed Involving a Minor:When a minor is involved in a property transaction, court permission or a guardian's consent may be required to ensure the minor's interests are protected.Whether court permission was obtained at the time of the Partition Deed should be assessed. If it wasn't, this could impact the deed's validity.Location of the Will:The location where a will is written does not necessarily invalidate it. However, the will should generally comply with the legal requirements of the jurisdiction where the properties are located.Limitation and Adverse Possession:The laws regarding adverse possession and property limitations would vary. In some cases, adverse possession may apply if someone openly occupies and uses property for an extended period without the owner's objection.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

With the onus to prove being on the Appellant, it did so, by producing cheques of several amounts, towards the entire consideration of the property. By producing various pieces of evidence, which indicated towards a whole, the court upheld the existence of the oral agreement, based on the scrutiny of the evidence provided.Also, you could send a legal Notice u/s 138 of N.I. Act,1881 to Mr. Iqbal to clear the outstanding amount. 15 days from the date of Legal Notice, you will have to wait for this reply and after the expiry of 15 days, you go ahead and file a PCR, then after the lapse of 30 days cognizance will be taken and the PCR will be converted to a Criminal Case after recording of sworn statement.

    "answer": "Dear Mr. A,Thank you for reaching out to me with your legal concerns. I understand the complexities of the situation you have described and will do my best to provide you with some guidance.Based on the information you have provided, there are a few legal implications that can be considered:Loan Agreement: Although you mentioned that there is no formal written agreement, the WhatsApp messages and audio recordings where Mr. Iqbal acknowledges his commitment to repay the borrowed amount, including the bank interest and profit, can serve as evidence of a verbal agreement. Verbal agreements can be legally binding, and these messages and recordings can be used to support your claim in case of a dispute.Use of Another Individual's Bank Account: Mr. Iqbal's use of Mr. Mohsin's bank account without his knowledge or consent raises concerns. It could potentially involve fraudulent activities, and Mr. Mohsin should be made aware of the situation if he is not already. Mr. Mohsin may choose to take legal action against Mr. Iqbal for any unauthorized use of his bank account.Property Sale and Fund Transfer: The purchase of land under Mr. Mohsin's name and subsequent sale of the property, with the funds being transferred into Mr. Iqbal's wife's account, raises questions about the legality of the transaction. This type of arrangement may be seen as an attempt to evade legal obligations or engage in fraudulent activities. It would be advisable to consult with a lawyer familiar with property and financial laws to further investigate this matter and determine the appropriate course of action.Given the circumstances, I recommend that you consult with a local lawyer who specializes in financial and property law. They will be able to review the specific details of your case, examine the evidence you have, and provide you with tailored advice based on the laws and regulations applicable in your jurisdiction. They can guide you on the best legal avenues available to recover the remaining amount owed to you and address any potential illegal activities that have taken place.Remember to gather and organize all relevant documents and evidence, such as bank statements, transaction records, and any other correspondence that supports your claims. This information will be valuable for your lawyer to assess the situation accurately.I hope this initial guidance helps you understand the potential legal implications and the steps you can take. It is important to consult with a professional lawyer who can provide you with personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

Court may attempt to reconcile the differences between the spouses, however, if this is not possible, the matter proceeds further.Joint Statement on OathAfter going through the contents of the application, Court may order the party's joint statements to be recorded on oath and joint statement are signed by both the parties along with their respective counsels and then First motion is passed.First Motion order is passed, 6 Months Time period is given for the Second MotionAn order on the first motion is passed by the court. After this, a six months cooling period is given to both the parties to a divorce, before they can file the second motion. The maximum period to file for a second motion is 18 months from the date of presentation of the divorce petition in the family court.Second Motion hearing and Final DecreeOnce the parties have decided to go further with the proceedings and appear for the second motion, they proceed with the final hearings. This includes parties appearing and recording of joint statements before the Family Court.Kindly note that the time period to appear for the 2nd motion is 18 months i,e 1.5 years. There is a concept called as condonation of delay and thus your application can be dragged for another 6 months. Yes, I recommend you to go ahead and file the RCR petition, if your wife files a contested divorce. Sometimes, since the maintenance amount, alimony etc., can't be asked as much as in normal divorce, the lawyers of your wife may advice her to go forward and apply for a Sec 13(1)(ia) petition against you. Thus, I strongly recommend that you be a little careful and calculative. Before granting the decree for divorce, the Judge himself will ask you whether you want the matter to be put up for mediation. Do not worry, you yourself ask the Judge to put up the matter before the mediator. May I know why you want to reconcile?In case, the Judge is reluctant to grant date and shows an indication that he is going to grant divorce, you can always go for withdrawing with liberty to file fresh suit.Â  Also note that, if the matter is unattended by both the parties, it is capable of being disposed instead of divorce order. Also, to grant divorce there must be documents, if you have not filed any documents, how can the judge access and pass an appropriate order?Â  The Judges give 60 days time (in some cases 90 days)Â  for mediation process to complete and end. There are catena of cases where the judges have condoned the delay in theÂ  coming forward with the second motion, we can use those in your defence. The withdrawal can happen only if both of you agree, otherwise there will be no withdrawal. One-sided withdrawal is not permitted in the court of law. There is no such provision which allows for conversion of amutual consent divorcepetition to normal petition. She will have to file a fresh suit in case she wants to go for contested divorce under H.M.A 1955.I hope I have answered your questions. In case you have further doubts, do not hesitate to reach out to me for clarification"

For divorce with consent of both parties, both the parties have to remain present for the 2nd motion.(2) Yes, you will get fair chance of hearing to oppose if your wife converts the petition for divorce with consent intoÂ  contested divorce petition.(3) Even if your wife files a petition for contested divorce, there are always scopes for reconciliation. You can make efforts at your personal/family level or through your lawyer for reconciliation.(4) You can attend any hearing and tell the judge that you do not want to pursue the petition for divorce with consent meaning. The judge may either give time for reconciliation or reject the joint petition on ground that one party has withdrawn the consent.If you are not willing to dissolve the marriage, you may approach your wife to sort out the matrimonial disputes/issues and try to convince her to give the marriage another chance to work.Dalbir BhartiAdvocate, Gurgaon41 AnswersTalk to Advocate Dalbir Bharti"

Under the given circumstances, you have only liberty to negotiate the term. Time limit for eviction case cannot be predicted,Â  however, it will take minimum 3 years time if all goes well. There must be Arbitration clause in the agreement and if that would be so then eviction case, which is a civil remedy, would not be maintainable.

    "question": "Adoption son rights",
    "answer": "Based on the information you have provided, here are some general points to consider:Adoption Deed: The adoption deed registered in 1955, where your grandfather stated that all the property would be passed on to your father after the death of your grandparents, can be considered as a legal document. It signifies your father's right to inherit the property.Subsequent Will: The will written by your grandfather in 1958, dividing the properties into three parts, could impact the inheritance. However, if the adoption deed clearly stated that all the property would go to your father after the death of your grandparents, the subsequent will may be disputed based on the earlier adoption deed. A lawyer can review both documents to provide specific guidance.Will of Grandmothers: The wills written by your grandmothers, diverting the properties to their relative, may have legal implications. It would be important to assess the validity of these wills and the circumstances under which they were made. Factors such as the mental capacity of your grandmothers, undue influence, and the legal requirements for making a valid will should be considered.Rights of Minor: The fact that your father was a minor at the time of the adoption and subsequent wills may also impact the situation. Depending on the laws in your jurisdiction, special rules may apply to protect the rights of minors in inheritance matters.Undisclosed Properties: If there are properties that were not mentioned in the partition deed but were owned by your grandfather, the rights to those properties would need to be determined. The laws of succession and inheritance in your jurisdiction would apply to these undisclosed properties.Given the complexity of the situation and the need for a detailed analysis of the legal documents involved, it is highly recommended that you consult with a lawyer. They will be able to review the adoption deed, subsequent wills, and any other relevant documents, as well as consider the applicable laws to provide you with the specific advice you need.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Adoption son rights",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Validity of the Partition Deed:A Partition Deed is typically a legal document that divides property among co-owners. Your father's age at the time the deed was executed (around 10) could potentially be a factor in its validity.In many jurisdictions, a minor cannot enter into a legally binding contract. Therefore, the validity of the Partition Deed may be questioned if your father was a minor at the time.Court Permission for Partition Deed Involving a Minor:When a minor is involved in a property transaction, court permission or a guardian's consent may be required to ensure the minor's interests are protected.Whether court permission was obtained at the time of the Partition Deed should be assessed. If it wasn't, this could impact the deed's validity.Location of the Will:The location where a will is written does not necessarily invalidate it. However, the will should generally comply with the legal requirements of the jurisdiction where the properties are located.Limitation and Adverse Possession:The laws regarding adverse possession and property limitations would vary. In some cases, adverse possession may apply if someone openly occupies and uses property for an extended period without the owner's objection.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

You can go forward with the drafting of the legal agreement now and the agreement should contain the terms and conditions with which you handed over the amount to Mr. Iqbal.Under the Indian Contract Act, an agreement need not be written, it may be oral. The problem with oral agreement is that the burden is on you to prove that there existed an agreement between you and Mr. Iqbal.Kindly find the appropriate case law herewith. I have extracted the relevant segment from the Judgement. In the case ofS.V. Narayanaswamy vs. Savithramma2013R.F.A. No. 1163 of 2002 c/w R.F.A.No.1164 of 2002 Karnataka High Court,the Appellant sought to prove the existence of a oral agreement, which was vehemently claimed to exist, with respect to sale of property. With the onus to prove being on the Appellant, it did so, by producing cheques of several amounts, towards the entire consideration of the property. By producing various pieces of evidence, which indicated towards a whole, the court upheld the existence of the oral agreement, based on the scrutiny of the evidence provided.Also, you could send a legal Notice u/s 138 of N.I. Act,1881 to Mr. Iqbal to clear the outstanding amount. 15 days from the date of Legal Notice, you will have to wait for this reply and after the expiry of 15 days, you go ahead and file a PCR, then after the lapse of 30 days cognizance will be taken and the PCR will be converted to a Criminal Case after recording of sworn statement. I can help you draft the legal notice and we would also move for specific performance of the oral agreement basing our contention on the above case law, under Specific Relief Act,1963.Sanmathi S.

    "answer": "Dear Mr. A,Thank you for reaching out to me with your legal concerns. I understand the complexities of the situation you have described and will do my best to provide you with some guidance.Based on the information you have provided, there are a few legal implications that can be considered:Loan Agreement: Although you mentioned that there is no formal written agreement, the WhatsApp messages and audio recordings where Mr. Iqbal acknowledges his commitment to repay the borrowed amount, including the bank interest and profit, can serve as evidence of a verbal agreement. Verbal agreements can be legally binding, and these messages and recordings can be used to support your claim in case of a dispute.Use of Another Individual's Bank Account: Mr. Iqbal's use of Mr. Mohsin's bank account without his knowledge or consent raises concerns. It could potentially involve fraudulent activities, and Mr. Mohsin should be made aware of the situation if he is not already. Mr. Mohsin may choose to take legal action against Mr. Iqbal for any unauthorized use of his bank account.Property Sale and Fund Transfer: The purchase of land under Mr. Mohsin's name and subsequent sale of the property, with the funds being transferred into Mr. Iqbal's wife's account, raises questions about the legality of the transaction. This type of arrangement may be seen as an attempt to evade legal obligations or engage in fraudulent activities. It would be advisable to consult with a lawyer familiar with property and financial laws to further investigate this matter and determine the appropriate course of action.Given the circumstances, I recommend that you consult with a local lawyer who specializes in financial and property law. They will be able to review the specific details of your case, examine the evidence you have, and provide you with tailored advice based on the laws and regulations applicable in your jurisdiction. They can guide you on the best legal avenues available to recover the remaining amount owed to you and address any potential illegal activities that have taken place.Remember to gather and organize all relevant documents and evidence, such as bank statements, transaction records, and any other correspondence that supports your claims. This information will be valuable for your lawyer to assess the situation accurately.I hope this initial guidance helps you understand the potential legal implications and the steps you can take. It is important to consult with a professional lawyer who can provide you with personalized advice based on your specific circumstances. They will be in the best position to guide you through the legal process.Wishing you the best of luck in resolving this matter satisfactorily.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "context": "Asked 2 years ago in Property Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Adoption son rights",
    "answer": "Based on the information you have provided, here are some general points to consider:Adoption Deed: The adoption deed registered in 1955, where your grandfather stated that all the property would be passed on to your father after the death of your grandparents, can be considered as a legal document. It signifies your father's right to inherit the property.Subsequent Will: The will written by your grandfather in 1958, dividing the properties into three parts, could impact the inheritance. However, if the adoption deed clearly stated that all the property would go to your father after the death of your grandparents, the subsequent will may be disputed based on the earlier adoption deed. A lawyer can review both documents to provide specific guidance.Will of Grandmothers: The wills written by your grandmothers, diverting the properties to their relative, may have legal implications. It would be important to assess the validity of these wills and the circumstances under which they were made. Factors such as the mental capacity of your grandmothers, undue influence, and the legal requirements for making a valid will should be considered.Rights of Minor: The fact that your father was a minor at the time of the adoption and subsequent wills may also impact the situation. Depending on the laws in your jurisdiction, special rules may apply to protect the rights of minors in inheritance matters.Undisclosed Properties: If there are properties that were not mentioned in the partition deed but were owned by your grandfather, the rights to those properties would need to be determined. The laws of succession and inheritance in your jurisdiction would apply to these undisclosed properties.Given the complexity of the situation and the need for a detailed analysis of the legal documents involved, it is highly recommended that you consult with a lawyer. They will be able to review the adoption deed, subsequent wills, and any other relevant documents, as well as consider the applicable laws to provide you with the specific advice you need.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Adoption son rights",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Validity of the Partition Deed:A Partition Deed is typically a legal document that divides property among co-owners. Your father's age at the time the deed was executed (around 10) could potentially be a factor in its validity.In many jurisdictions, a minor cannot enter into a legally binding contract. Therefore, the validity of the Partition Deed may be questioned if your father was a minor at the time.Court Permission for Partition Deed Involving a Minor:When a minor is involved in a property transaction, court permission or a guardian's consent may be required to ensure the minor's interests are protected.Whether court permission was obtained at the time of the Partition Deed should be assessed. If it wasn't, this could impact the deed's validity.Location of the Will:The location where a will is written does not necessarily invalidate it. However, the will should generally comply with the legal requirements of the jurisdiction where the properties are located.Limitation and Adverse Possession:The laws regarding adverse possession and property limitations would vary. In some cases, adverse possession may apply if someone openly occupies and uses property for an extended period without the owner's objection.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Adoption son rights",
    "answer": "Based on the information you have provided, here are some general points to consider:Adoption Deed: The adoption deed registered in 1955, where your grandfather stated that all the property would be passed on to your father after the death of your grandparents, can be considered as a legal document. It signifies your father's right to inherit the property.Subsequent Will: The will written by your grandfather in 1958, dividing the properties into three parts, could impact the inheritance. However, if the adoption deed clearly stated that all the property would go to your father after the death of your grandparents, the subsequent will may be disputed based on the earlier adoption deed. A lawyer can review both documents to provide specific guidance.Will of Grandmothers: The wills written by your grandmothers, diverting the properties to their relative, may have legal implications. It would be important to assess the validity of these wills and the circumstances under which they were made. Factors such as the mental capacity of your grandmothers, undue influence, and the legal requirements for making a valid will should be considered.Rights of Minor: The fact that your father was a minor at the time of the adoption and subsequent wills may also impact the situation. Depending on the laws in your jurisdiction, special rules may apply to protect the rights of minors in inheritance matters.Undisclosed Properties: If there are properties that were not mentioned in the partition deed but were owned by your grandfather, the rights to those properties would need to be determined. The laws of succession and inheritance in your jurisdiction would apply to these undisclosed properties.Given the complexity of the situation and the need for a detailed analysis of the legal documents involved, it is highly recommended that you consult with a lawyer. They will be able to review the adoption deed, subsequent wills, and any other relevant documents, as well as consider the applicable laws to provide you with the specific advice you need.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Adoption son rights",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Validity of the Partition Deed:A Partition Deed is typically a legal document that divides property among co-owners. Your father's age at the time the deed was executed (around 10) could potentially be a factor in its validity.In many jurisdictions, a minor cannot enter into a legally binding contract. Therefore, the validity of the Partition Deed may be questioned if your father was a minor at the time.Court Permission for Partition Deed Involving a Minor:When a minor is involved in a property transaction, court permission or a guardian's consent may be required to ensure the minor's interests are protected.Whether court permission was obtained at the time of the Partition Deed should be assessed. If it wasn't, this could impact the deed's validity.Location of the Will:The location where a will is written does not necessarily invalidate it. However, the will should generally comply with the legal requirements of the jurisdiction where the properties are located.Limitation and Adverse Possession:The laws regarding adverse possession and property limitations would vary. In some cases, adverse possession may apply if someone openly occupies and uses property for an extended period without the owner's objection.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Executing court cannot go into the merit of the case.

Further in the given case law the court itself has said thatÂ judgement is applicable to awards wherein the arbitral proceeding commenced post the 2015 amendment to the Arbitration Act. It does not deal with proceedings having been initiated pre the 2015 amendment and concluding post the 2015 amendment. So your conception of law is incorrect.

    "answer": "Unilateral appointment is alsonot allowedbecause any party who has an interest in the outcome of the dispute should not be allowed to preside over as an arbitrator for that dispute.There has been plethora of cases where High Courts and Supreme Court has set aside the arbitral award on the ground of unilateral appointment of arbitrator. The reason behind such setting aside is that appointment of arbitrator by one party alone without giving opportunity to the other party shall have an element of bias and partiality.On one hand, where parties are given autonomy to agree on the procedure to appoint an arbitrator under Section 11(2), on the other hand, it is not correct to say that the same is not an absolute right of the party. The right of the parties to agree on the procedure to appoint the arbitrator is now subject to reasonable restriction, and one such instance of reasonable restriction is the unilateral appointment of arbitrator.You can file a petition to set aside the award in the appellate courtT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Clarification about court judgment regarding arbitration",
    "answer": "The Supreme Court has given rationale behind such appointment in decisions likePerkinsandTRF Ltd.Further, it has become important for parties to draft the dispute resolution clause cautiously and should keep in mind that unilateral appointment is not allowed under the garb of party autonomy.The Court has observed that if one party has the exclusive right to appoint the arbitrator, then his choice will always have an element of bias. The relevant extract of the Court's observation is as follows:The reason is clear that whatever advantage a party may derive by nominating an arbitrator of its choice would get counter balanced by equal power with the other party. But, in a case where only one party has a right to appoint a sole arbitrator, its choice will always have an element of exclusivity in determining or charting the course for dispute resolution. Naturally, the person who has an interest in the outcome or decision of the dispute must not have the power to appoint a sole arbitrator. That has to be taken as the essence of the amendments brought in by the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015 (Act 3 of 2016).\"T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Adoption son rights",
    "answer": "Based on the information you have provided, here are some general points to consider:Adoption Deed: The adoption deed registered in 1955, where your grandfather stated that all the property would be passed on to your father after the death of your grandparents, can be considered as a legal document. It signifies your father's right to inherit the property.Subsequent Will: The will written by your grandfather in 1958, dividing the properties into three parts, could impact the inheritance. However, if the adoption deed clearly stated that all the property would go to your father after the death of your grandparents, the subsequent will may be disputed based on the earlier adoption deed. A lawyer can review both documents to provide specific guidance.Will of Grandmothers: The wills written by your grandmothers, diverting the properties to their relative, may have legal implications. It would be important to assess the validity of these wills and the circumstances under which they were made. Factors such as the mental capacity of your grandmothers, undue influence, and the legal requirements for making a valid will should be considered.Rights of Minor: The fact that your father was a minor at the time of the adoption and subsequent wills may also impact the situation. Depending on the laws in your jurisdiction, special rules may apply to protect the rights of minors in inheritance matters.Undisclosed Properties: If there are properties that were not mentioned in the partition deed but were owned by your grandfather, the rights to those properties would need to be determined. The laws of succession and inheritance in your jurisdiction would apply to these undisclosed properties.Given the complexity of the situation and the need for a detailed analysis of the legal documents involved, it is highly recommended that you consult with a lawyer. They will be able to review the adoption deed, subsequent wills, and any other relevant documents, as well as consider the applicable laws to provide you with the specific advice you need.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Adoption son rights",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Validity of the Partition Deed:A Partition Deed is typically a legal document that divides property among co-owners. Your father's age at the time the deed was executed (around 10) could potentially be a factor in its validity.In many jurisdictions, a minor cannot enter into a legally binding contract. Therefore, the validity of the Partition Deed may be questioned if your father was a minor at the time.Court Permission for Partition Deed Involving a Minor:When a minor is involved in a property transaction, court permission or a guardian's consent may be required to ensure the minor's interests are protected.Whether court permission was obtained at the time of the Partition Deed should be assessed. If it wasn't, this could impact the deed's validity.Location of the Will:The location where a will is written does not necessarily invalidate it. However, the will should generally comply with the legal requirements of the jurisdiction where the properties are located.Limitation and Adverse Possession:The laws regarding adverse possession and property limitations would vary. In some cases, adverse possession may apply if someone openly occupies and uses property for an extended period without the owner's objection.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, the judge has also mentioned that you can challenge these sections during the trial. Your lawyer can evaluate the evidence and present your defense against these charges during the trial proceedings.Bail Cancellation and Chances of Getting Bail Again: The cancellation of bail may have been based on the judge's assessment of the evidence and other factors in the case.

    "answer": "On the basis of the limited information made available by you the answers are as under:(1) Yes, the ex-parte judgement can be set aside if she proves the exceptional circumstances which prevented her from attending the hearings or that she had not received the information/summonses.(2) The issue of maintenance shall be decided by the Court in case the judgement is set aside and it is heard again.(3) In case the ex-pate judgement is not set aside and it is in force then she will have to follow the directions given by the Court in the judgement and if there are directions that she cannot take your son out of city or country without your knowledge then she cannot take him away. If the judgement is set aside then she will have to follow the directions of the court given during the pendency of the case or on conclusion of the case.(4) No, after the divorce she cannot have any claim on your property. However, she can approach the court to attach your property to realize the alimony or amount of maintenance, if not given to her as per the court orders.(5) As the time limit of appeal has already passed and the judgement has become effective, she can be asked to move out of your house. But you need to take care while doing so. It should be done either amicably or with the intervention of the court otherwise she might make some other complaint of physical assault etc against you.Â  If the ex-parte judgement is aside or during the hearing any orders are issued to maintain status quo, i.e. the situation prior to ex-parte judgement, then she will continue to enjoy all rights as your wife till the case is finally decided.Dalbir BhartiAdvocate, Gurgaon41 AnswersTalk to Advocate Dalbir Bharti"

Executing court cannot go into the merit of the case.

It does not deal with proceedings having been initiated pre the 2015 amendment and concluding post the 2015 amendment. So your conception of law is incorrect.

    "answer": "Unilateral appointment is alsonot allowedbecause any party who has an interest in the outcome of the dispute should not be allowed to preside over as an arbitrator for that dispute.There has been plethora of cases where High Courts and Supreme Court has set aside the arbitral award on the ground of unilateral appointment of arbitrator. The reason behind such setting aside is that appointment of arbitrator by one party alone without giving opportunity to the other party shall have an element of bias and partiality.On one hand, where parties are given autonomy to agree on the procedure to appoint an arbitrator under Section 11(2), on the other hand, it is not correct to say that the same is not an absolute right of the party. The right of the parties to agree on the procedure to appoint the arbitrator is now subject to reasonable restriction, and one such instance of reasonable restriction is the unilateral appointment of arbitrator.You can file a petition to set aside the award in the appellate courtT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "The Supreme Court has given rationale behind such appointment in decisions likePerkinsandTRF Ltd.Further, it has become important for parties to draft the dispute resolution clause cautiously and should keep in mind that unilateral appointment is not allowed under the garb of party autonomy.The Court has observed that if one party has the exclusive right to appoint the arbitrator, then his choice will always have an element of bias. The relevant extract of the Court's observation is as follows:The reason is clear that whatever advantage a party may derive by nominating an arbitrator of its choice would get counter balanced by equal power with the other party. But, in a case where only one party has a right to appoint a sole arbitrator, its choice will always have an element of exclusivity in determining or charting the course for dispute resolution. Naturally, the person who has an interest in the outcome or decision of the dispute must not have the power to appoint a sole arbitrator. That has to be taken as the essence of the amendments brought in by the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015 (Act 3 of 2016).\"T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

Your lawyer will be able to guide you through the process and present the necessary evidence to support your bail application.Reinstatement of Sections 325 and 323: The decision to reinstate sections 325 and 323 by the judge may have been based on the opposition's arguments or other factors presented during the proceedings. The judge may have considered that there is enough material to warrant the inclusion of these sections in the chargesheet. However, the judge has also mentioned that you can challenge these sections during the trial. Your lawyer can evaluate the evidence and present your defense against these charges during the trial proceedings.Bail Cancellation and Chances of Getting Bail Again: The cancellation of bail may have been based on the judge's assessment of the evidence and other factors in the case. When applying for bail again, your lawyer can present the evidence that supports your defense, such as mobile phone location records and CCTV footage, to demonstrate that you were not present at the place of the alleged incident. The chances of obtaining bail will depend on the specific facts and circumstances of your case and the discretion of the court.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Executing court cannot go into the merit of the case. An award exist and is enforceable till the same is not declared invalid or set aside by a competent court, so a party to Arbitration donot have power to decide the validity of an award. The application of given case law depends upon the facts and merit of the case. So the facts and merit of your case is required to be exsmined in order to examine the application of given case law. Further in the given case law the court itself has said thatÂ judgement is applicable to awards wherein the arbitral proceeding commenced post the 2015 amendment to the Arbitration Act. It does not deal with proceedings having been initiated pre the 2015 amendment and concluding post the 2015 amendment. So your conception of law is incorrect.

    "answer": "Unilateral appointment is alsonot allowedbecause any party who has an interest in the outcome of the dispute should not be allowed to preside over as an arbitrator for that dispute.There has been plethora of cases where High Courts and Supreme Court has set aside the arbitral award on the ground of unilateral appointment of arbitrator. The reason behind such setting aside is that appointment of arbitrator by one party alone without giving opportunity to the other party shall have an element of bias and partiality.On one hand, where parties are given autonomy to agree on the procedure to appoint an arbitrator under Section 11(2), on the other hand, it is not correct to say that the same is not an absolute right of the party. The right of the parties to agree on the procedure to appoint the arbitrator is now subject to reasonable restriction, and one such instance of reasonable restriction is the unilateral appointment of arbitrator.You can file a petition to set aside the award in the appellate courtT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Clarification about court judgment regarding arbitration",
    "answer": "The Supreme Court has given rationale behind such appointment in decisions likePerkinsandTRF Ltd.Further, it has become important for parties to draft the dispute resolution clause cautiously and should keep in mind that unilateral appointment is not allowed under the garb of party autonomy.The Court has observed that if one party has the exclusive right to appoint the arbitrator, then his choice will always have an element of bias. The relevant extract of the Court's observation is as follows:The reason is clear that whatever advantage a party may derive by nominating an arbitrator of its choice would get counter balanced by equal power with the other party. But, in a case where only one party has a right to appoint a sole arbitrator, its choice will always have an element of exclusivity in determining or charting the course for dispute resolution. Naturally, the person who has an interest in the outcome or decision of the dispute must not have the power to appoint a sole arbitrator. That has to be taken as the essence of the amendments brought in by the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015 (Act 3 of 2016).\"T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Pagdi house - can married daughter claim rights",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,RIGHTS OF PAGDI HOLDERQ1. What is Pagdi system in Mumbai?Ans.The Pagdi system is a pre-independence rental law that gives the tenant certain ownership rights over the rented property, including the right to sub-let the property or even sells it while giving a share to the original owner.Q2. Is the Pagdi system legal in India nowAns.While there are efforts to modernize or abolish the archaic Pagdi system altogether, the system was made legal as per the Maharashtra Rent Control Act of 1999 and came into effect in the year 2000.Q3. What happens if my owner wants to sell the Pagdi property Iâm renting?Ans.If the original owners choose to sell the building with its land to a new real estate developer, you as a tenant will be given a substantial percentage of the current sale amount to vacate the premises.Q4. Can I save on taxes on the sale of a Pagdi property I am renting?Ans.The amount received from the sale of the Pagdi property is a capital asset and you can save tax on such long-term capital gains by reinvesting in a new home.Q5. Can I get a home loan on a Pagdi property?Ans.Getting a home loan on a property under the Pagdi System can be difficult, as many ownership issues remain prevalent with old properties. If you want the property rights transferred to your name, you need to establish your ownership rights for the banks to approve your loan application.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, Bangalore6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar"

    "answer": "The two conditions make it almostimpossible for a Hindu couple married in India to get a legally valid divorce froma foreign court since no foreign court is an acceptable one under Hindu MarriageÂ Act and also because no foreign court is likely to consider the provisions ofHindu Marriage Actbefore granting divorce.The exceptions that Supreme Court has permitted to the above rule laid by it are asfollows in a case where husband has filed for divorce in a foreign land:A) The wife must be domiciled and permanently resident of that foreign land ANDthe foreign court should decide the case based onHindu Marriage Act; ORB) The wife voluntarily and effectively attends the court proceedings and conteststhe claim on grounds of divorce as permitted underHindu Marriage Act; ORC) The wife consents to grant of divorce.To sum up one can say that exceptions aside, a Hindu couple married in India mustseek divorce from an Indian court only.The two notable exceptions (when a foreign decree of divorce is valid) are (a) whenthe couple decides to takedivorce by mutual consentOR (b) when the person who iscontesting divorce attends divorce proceedings and the foreign court grants divorceon grounds that are permitted grounds of divorce underHindu Marriage Act.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

Every individual has his/her private life and hence, they have the full right to do whatever they want to under those boundations.- Further, the Kolkata High Court addressed the issue whether sex toys sold in India comes under the charges of âobscenityâ. The Court held that the charges on obscenity cannot be held as they were not legally sustainable. Just because the toy brings out sexual desires, it cannot be labeled as âobsceneâ.- Since, you got notice from Custom Department; hence youÂ should give the reply of the show cause notice to the department and appear for personal hearing, and thereby declare before them that the said items are for personal use and not for sale to other persons.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

But, no statement has been mentioned regarding the âBan on Sex Toys in India- Further,Â keeping sex toys at home for personal use, is not an offence unless the individual is private about its usage and functioning. Every individual has his/her private life and hence, they have the full right to do whatever they want to under those boundations.- Further, the Kolkata High Court addressed the issue whether sex toys sold in India comes under the charges of âobscenityâ. The Court held that the charges on obscenity cannot be held as they were not legally sustainable. Just because the toy brings out sexual desires, it cannot be labeled as âobsceneâ.- Since, you got notice from Custom Department; hence youÂ should give the reply of the show cause notice to the department and appear for personal hearing, and thereby declare before them that the said items are for personal use and not for sale to other persons.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "- Section 292 of the IPC prevents the sale of any material or product that is âobsceneâ in nature in India. But, no statement has been mentioned regarding the âBan on Sex Toys in India- Further,Â keeping sex toys at home for personal use, is not an offence unless the individual is private about its usage and functioning. Every individual has his/her private life and hence, they have the full right to do whatever they want to under those boundations.- Further, the Kolkata High Court addressed the issue whether sex toys sold in India comes under the charges of âobscenityâ. The Court held that the charges on obscenity cannot be held as they were not legally sustainable. Just because the toy brings out sexual desires, it cannot be labeled as âobsceneâ.- Since, you got notice from Custom Department; hence youÂ should give the reply of the show cause notice to the department and appear for personal hearing, and thereby declare before them that the said items are for personal use and not for sale to other persons.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Pagdi house - can married daughter claim rights",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,RIGHTS OF PAGDI HOLDERQ1. What is Pagdi system in Mumbai?Ans.The Pagdi system is a pre-independence rental law that gives the tenant certain ownership rights over the rented property, including the right to sub-let the property or even sells it while giving a share to the original owner.Q2. Is the Pagdi system legal in India nowAns.While there are efforts to modernize or abolish the archaic Pagdi system altogether, the system was made legal as per the Maharashtra Rent Control Act of 1999 and came into effect in the year 2000.Q3. What happens if my owner wants to sell the Pagdi property Iâm renting?Ans.If the original owners choose to sell the building with its land to a new real estate developer, you as a tenant will be given a substantial percentage of the current sale amount to vacate the premises.Q4. Can I save on taxes on the sale of a Pagdi property I am renting?Ans.The amount received from the sale of the Pagdi property is a capital asset and you can save tax on such long-term capital gains by reinvesting in a new home.Q5. Can I get a home loan on a Pagdi property?Ans.Getting a home loan on a property under the Pagdi System can be difficult, as many ownership issues remain prevalent with old properties. If you want the property rights transferred to your name, you need to establish your ownership rights for the banks to approve your loan application.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, Bangalore6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar"

Employers are required to provide a safe and non-discriminatory work environment, adhere to reasonable working hours, and follow relevant labor regulations.Regarding your concerns:Transfer and Posting: Employers generally have the right to transfer employees to different locations as per the terms and conditions of employment. However, the frequency and distance of transfers may need to be reasonable and in line with the employment contract and local labor laws. It's advisable to review your employment contract and consult with an employment lawyer to understand the specific provisions related to transfers.Work Environment: Employers are expected to provide a safe and healthy work environment for their employees. If you believe that the workplace is toxic or if there are disciplinary rules that are unreasonable or violate labor laws, you may have grounds for complaint. It's recommended to document any incidents or issues and consult with an employment lawyer to discuss potential actions.Bond and Notice Period: The enforceability of bonds and notice periods can vary based on the specific terms and conditions of the agreement, as well as local labor laws. Some courts in India have held that bond clauses are illegal, while others have upheld their validity in certain circumstances. It's important to review the terms of the bond and notice period, consult with an employment lawyer, and understand the legal implications before making any decisions.Please note that this information is general in nature and may not apply specifically to your situation.

If the judgement is set aside then she will have to follow the directions of the court given during the pendency of the case or on conclusion of the case.(4) No, after the divorce she cannot have any claim on your property.

As per law a person can bequeath his owned property only. Further the period of limitation to invoke gift is three years only so gift made in 2008 could alsoÂ  not be invoked in 2013. Once gift is made by you and your daughter in law has accepted the gift under some rituals and ceremonies then your daughter in law has become absolute owner and after expiry of three years such gift cannot be invoked.

However, I am not a lawyer, and the specific laws and regulations regarding unregistered trusts can vary depending on the jurisdiction.In general, a registered trust holds more legal weight and credibility compared to an unregistered trust. An unregistered trust may face challenges in asserting its rights and carrying out certain activities, especially if it involves property transactions or commercial use.In your case, if the unregistered trust is not willing to use the property as a function hall as you desire, it would be advisable to consult with a lawyer who specializes in property and trust law. They can review the specific details of the trust and the property ownership, and provide advice on the legal options available to you.The lawyer may assess whether the trust has the legal authority to use the property for commercial purposes or whether it is limited to certain specified purposes. They can also guide you on potential legal remedies, such as seeking an injunction or legal action to protect your rights and interests, or exploring options for resolving the dispute through negotiation or mediation.It's important to consult with a qualified legal professional who can provide advice based on the specific laws and regulations applicable in your jurisdiction and the details of your case.

    "answer": "Dear Sir,It is a petty case and summons case as such you may manage to get it closed as early as possible on a single day and thereafter you can get police clearance certificate. You may read the following article also.======================================================================================Significance of a Police Clearance Certificate (PCC) in a pending Accident CaseA Police Clearance Certificate (PCC) is an official document issued by the Indian Police or government authority in India. It acknowledges any criminal records that an individual may have against their name and, if such records are clear, it issues a clearance certificate, which may be required for Indian or foreign citizens who are currently or have resided in India for the following reasons:1.Pursuing professional positions that need independence;2.Looking to relocate or obtain visas for other countries;3.Taking care of an organization's demand;A PCC from India does not have the time of legitimacy to back up its assertion. For the most part, it is legal for six months.Significance of PCCA valid Police Clearance Certificate, whether for employment, study, or travel, indicates that the individualhas no criminal convictions throughout their time or stay in the country. Assume the individual was involved in criminal activity or were apprehended due to a law violation in any manner. In that instance, specific notices from the concerned country will appear on their PCC, including the infringement details. Therefore, possessing a Police Clearance Certificate demonstrates their morality and prudence as guests or residents. Employers and travel specialists may raise concerns if theycannot provide PCC, implying that they are unlikely to be well-behaved citizens of the country.Definition of Petty case as per Karnataka Police ActPetty casesâPetty offenceâ meansany offence punishable only with fine not exceeding one thousand rupees, but does not include any offence so punishable under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1931, or under any other law which provides for convicting the accused person in his absence on a plea of guilty.Many sections in the Motor Vehicle Act are compoundable. It means if you commit a traffic violation, are booked for the same, and if the offence is compoundable, you can pay fine and get the case closed. Since you have paid fine, doesnât seem it would affect you in anyway.Alternative Remedies to come out of pending Moto Vehicle Accident Cases:Alternatively if offences are punishable under sections of 278, 279 and 304A ofIndian Penal Code, then the accused may approach the Honâble High Court by filing quashing petition under section 482 ofCriminal Procedure Codeby convincing the complainant and thus such case may be quashed getting clear acquittal for getting PCC.Components affecting PCC1) HavingÂ a substantial criminal record: If a personÂ hasÂ been punished or incarcerated, theirÂ PCC will reflect this. It is essential to note that beingÂ held for more than a year may affectÂ police checks. Additionally, outstanding advances or service bills would make obtaining a PCC more difficult.2) Association with a criminal organization: If a person isÂ a member of an association, club, or sorority and hasÂ a criminal past, this may impact the credibility of theirÂ PCC. Any contribution to the gathering, especially those involving criminal activity, may arouse suspicions.3) Record of unethical behaviour: A person'sÂ lengthy-time records demonstrate theirÂ upstanding reputation as a resident. If the experts believe that theyÂ are not decent or may threaten the country in any way, shape, or form, they are authorized to rejectÂ a police leeway declaration. Individuals seeking an Indian PCC can be divided into the following categories according to their nationality and present residence:a)Indian citizens residing in India;b)Indian nationals residing outside of India;c)Nationals from other countries who have settled in India;d)Indian citizens residing in India.For Indian citizens living in India, the Indian government has modified the PCC application process to a self-improved approach in which individuals may apply for a PCC online through the Passport Seva Kendra (PSK).Impact of Traffic Violations on PCCIn the case ofBiju T.C. vs The Station House Officer[1],the Kerala High Court ruled thatpolice officers could not refuse to issue a Police Clearance Certificate (PCC) to a citizenbased on his involvement in a criminal case and that the PCC must be given after considering the case's nuances. Justice K VinodChandran issued the decision after reviewing an appeal filed by T.C.Biju of Airport Nagar in Vappalassery, Ernakulam. Biju is a taxi driver employed by Cochin International Airport Ltd (CIAL), and CIAL has requested that he construct a PCC to continue working there.As a result, Biju documented a request before the Nedumbassery police headquarters sub-monitor to get the PCC. Despite this, PCC was denied to him because he was involved in a criminal case. Following this, Biju filed an appeal before the high court, questioning the Police's denial of PCC and designating the sub-overseer and Ernakulam country S.P. as inverse responsible for the situation.In contrast to the Police's argument that PCC cannot be granted to people involved in criminal proceedings, the court ruled that if the applicant is engaged in wrongdoing, authentication must be provided specifying the nature of the crime the solicitor is involved in. The police authorities cannot refuse the applicant's testimony.Minor traffic offences (such as speeding and running a stop sign or red light) are often dealt with separately from more severelaw violations. Minor tiny criminal offences are punished less harshly, and the judicial procedures are less formal. Furthermore, the municipal court, which hears minor traffic violations, is separate from the criminal court in many jurisdictions.PCC in case of Pending Accident CaseIn the case ofThe State of Arunachal Pradesh vsRamchandraRabidas[2], the Supreme Court ruled that a person who commits offences under the Motor Vehicles Act, such as speeding and reckless driving, can also be charged under theIndian Penal Codebecause both statutes operate independently. It went on to say that, as India's mechanization accelerates, the number of street traffic accidents and fatalities will rise. A panel of Justices InduMalhotra and SanjivKhanna overturned a December 22, 2008 judgement of the Gauhati High Court holding that an individual was arrested for over-speeding, dangerous driving, and other connected offences under the Motor Vehicles Act could not be charged under the IPC. While, according to Section 6 of the Passports Act, 1967, an individual's identity application may be denied if they have a criminal past or have proceedings pending. It is possible to ensure that they are available for the preliminary duration. If they were involved in a criminal investigation, but the accusations against them were dropped, they may be required to submit an endorsement stating the same. It will also cover circumstances when warrants have been issued in their name.In any event, Commissioner of Police Dr K Venkatesham warned in 2018 that traffic offenders in Pune would not receive a police declaration (PCC), which is required to obtain a visa. PCC is also required by many firms when employing new employees.Venkatesham stated that they were compiling a list of traffic offenders and would forward their information to the appropriate authorities, adding that such individuals would not be given a PCC.ConclusionRoad accidents have been a significant source of concern in India; therefore,individuals should double-check and follow traffic laws. A Police Clearance Certificate is essential since it demonstrates that a person does not have a criminal record and also assists an individual in establishing their innocence. However, the procedure of obtaining a PCC certificate is complex, so it is always advisable to contact a professional who can lawfully get such a certificate. In criminal cases, where the hearing is ongoing in court, the Police will refrain from immediately giving a PCC for obtaining a visa until the judgment has been given and the accused has been acquitted.*****[1]WP(C).No.14360 of 2015.[2][2] Criminal Appeal No. 905 of 2010.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, Bangalore6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar"

    "answer": "It depends on what terms and conditions RWA was formed and took over the project from the builder. Normally there is clear mention of the pending things and an agreement is signed or undertaking is given by the builder to complete the project in stipulated time limit. If it is so, then you residents may ask the RWA to pursue the matter with the builder or approach the govt authorities/courts to enforce the terms and conditions. Not paying the maintenance charges is not the solution. It may incur interest on the pending amount or may lead to discontinuation of facilities like electricity, water etc.You may approach the relevant govt authorities for completion of the project and for other remedial action.

    "question": "Heir certificate/process to sell property in India",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. You know that as per Section 2(h) of Indian Succession Act, 1925 provides that Will means the legal declaration of the intention of a person with respect to his property, which he desires to take effect after his death Will has been defined in Corpus Juris Secundum as A âWillâ is the legal declaration of a manâs intention, which he wills to be performed after his death, or an instrument by which a person makes a disposition of his property to take effect after his death.You can apply for probate of Will initially. The word âProbateâ means to prove or validate something. It is a procedure for court approval of the Will as the valid and last Will of the deceased testator. According to the Indian Succession Act, 1925, âProbate of will, when granted establishes the will from the death of the testator, and renders valid all intermediate acts of the executor as such.âIt means that when a Will is probated, it gets officially certified with a seal of the court and provides the authority to the executor to appropriately distribute the assets of deceased testator and also to pay off bills and creditors from that estate.The procedure for probating of will is divided into four simple stages:1. The first step involves making of application to the District Judge through a probate petition which must be duly signed and verified by or on behalf of the applicant. The probate petition should be in a prescribed format under Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.2. The second step is to send the application to the High Court, under whose jurisdiction property falls. Then a lawyer shall prepare the application, in some cases lower court can also accept the application.3. One needs to submit certain documents that can verify the genuineness of the will, death certificate and other documents. These will prove that the testator had free will.4. When the court receives the application, it verifies all the details. Then it invites the nearest kin of the deceased for claiming the probate. Finally, it showcases the invitation letter at prominent places for invitation of any objection. If after 30 days, the court files no objection, the issuance of the probate is complete.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "question": "Heir certificate/process to sell property in India",
    "answer": "If your father had written Will in USA which would include the properties left behind in the USA also then you can get the Will probated by a court of USA.A will can be executed anywhere without any restrictions subject to the due procedure of the law of the country.With reference to wills executed outside India, in respect of which a foreign probate has also been obtained, the requirement of Section 213(1) of the Indian SuccessionÂ  Act , 1925, would be satisfied by obtaining under Section 228(1) of the Act an ancillary probate. Otherwise, the procedural requirement of the lex fori enacted under Section 213(1) of the Act may not be satisfied and if it is only with a view to enable parties claiming under a will executed outside India to make claims with reference to properties situated in India, the procedure under Section 228 of the Act has been prescribed.In India, Wills made in other jurisdiction are not automatically enforceable.Under the Act, an ancillary probate can be granted to authenticate a foreign will. A foreign will, once proved and deposited in a court of competent jurisdiction, or a properly authenticated copy of the will and letters of administration will be recognised by the Indian Courts. Otherwise, if the Court deems fit then it will take the evidence into account and will examine the petitioner upon oath to ensure the veracity of the will.An executor or legatee cannot claim their right under the will unless probate or letters of administration of the will are obtained.If the Will was written in India and if the properties are situated in a place other than Bombay or Madras or Calcutta, probate would not be necessary, but you can get the details of the family tree or surviving members of the family of deceased duly attested by a notary of that country, in order to succeed to the estates, based on which all the beneficiaries should apply jointly for mutation of the property to their name by enclosing the copy of the Will (probate of Will if already obtained).Once the property is mutated then all the shareholders can sell the property jointly by executing a joint sale deed in favor of the prospective buyer."

The application for the heirship certificate usually needs to be made in the appropriate court within that jurisdiction.Application: Prepare an application for the heirship certificate, including details such as the deceased's name, date of death, place of residence, and details of legal heirs (including their names, addresses, and relationships).Supporting Documents: Gather supporting documents that may be required, which can include:Death certificate of the deceased.Copy of the Will, if available.Identity proof and address proof of the legal heirs.Affidavits from the legal heirs stating their relationship with the deceased and their rights to the property.Any other documents as required by the court.Affidavits and Declarations: The legal heirs may need to provide affidavits and declarations stating their relationship to the deceased and their entitlement to the property.Publication and Notice: The court may require publication of a notice in a local newspaper and serving notice to other legal heirs and interested parties, giving them an opportunity to raise objections if any.Court Process: Attend the court proceedings and provide any additional information or documentation as required by the court.Please note that the process and specific requirements for obtaining an heirship certificate can vary based on the jurisdiction and the individual circumstances.

    "question": "Need PCC for UK visa but section 188 case pending",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,It is a petty case and summons case as such you may manage to get it closed as early as possible on a single day and thereafter you can get police clearance certificate. You may read the following article also.======================================================================================Significance of a Police Clearance Certificate (PCC) in a pending Accident CaseA Police Clearance Certificate (PCC) is an official document issued by the Indian Police or government authority in India. It acknowledges any criminal records that an individual may have against their name and, if such records are clear, it issues a clearance certificate, which may be required for Indian or foreign citizens who are currently or have resided in India for the following reasons:1.Pursuing professional positions that need independence;2.Looking to relocate or obtain visas for other countries;3.Taking care of an organization's demand;A PCC from India does not have the time of legitimacy to back up its assertion. For the most part, it is legal for six months.Significance of PCCA valid Police Clearance Certificate, whether for employment, study, or travel, indicates that the individualhas no criminal convictions throughout their time or stay in the country. Assume the individual was involved in criminal activity or were apprehended due to a law violation in any manner. In that instance, specific notices from the concerned country will appear on their PCC, including the infringement details. Therefore, possessing a Police Clearance Certificate demonstrates their morality and prudence as guests or residents. Employers and travel specialists may raise concerns if theycannot provide PCC, implying that they are unlikely to be well-behaved citizens of the country.Definition of Petty case as per Karnataka Police ActPetty casesâPetty offenceâ meansany offence punishable only with fine not exceeding one thousand rupees, but does not include any offence so punishable under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1931, or under any other law which provides for convicting the accused person in his absence on a plea of guilty.Many sections in the Motor Vehicle Act are compoundable. It means if you commit a traffic violation, are booked for the same, and if the offence is compoundable, you can pay fine and get the case closed. Since you have paid fine, doesnât seem it would affect you in anyway.Alternative Remedies to come out of pending Moto Vehicle Accident Cases:Alternatively if offences are punishable under sections of 278, 279 and 304A ofIndian Penal Code, then the accused may approach the Honâble High Court by filing quashing petition under section 482 ofCriminal Procedure Codeby convincing the complainant and thus such case may be quashed getting clear acquittal for getting PCC.Components affecting PCC1) HavingÂ a substantial criminal record: If a personÂ hasÂ been punished or incarcerated, theirÂ PCC will reflect this. It is essential to note that beingÂ held for more than a year may affectÂ police checks. Additionally, outstanding advances or service bills would make obtaining a PCC more difficult.2) Association with a criminal organization: If a person isÂ a member of an association, club, or sorority and hasÂ a criminal past, this may impact the credibility of theirÂ PCC. Any contribution to the gathering, especially those involving criminal activity, may arouse suspicions.3) Record of unethical behaviour: A person'sÂ lengthy-time records demonstrate theirÂ upstanding reputation as a resident. If the experts believe that theyÂ are not decent or may threaten the country in any way, shape, or form, they are authorized to rejectÂ a police leeway declaration. Individuals seeking an Indian PCC can be divided into the following categories according to their nationality and present residence:a)Indian citizens residing in India;b)Indian nationals residing outside of India;c)Nationals from other countries who have settled in India;d)Indian citizens residing in India.For Indian citizens living in India, the Indian government has modified the PCC application process to a self-improved approach in which individuals may apply for a PCC online through the Passport Seva Kendra (PSK).Impact of Traffic Violations on PCCIn the case ofBiju T.C. vs The Station House Officer[1],the Kerala High Court ruled thatpolice officers could not refuse to issue a Police Clearance Certificate (PCC) to a citizenbased on his involvement in a criminal case and that the PCC must be given after considering the case's nuances. Justice K VinodChandran issued the decision after reviewing an appeal filed by T.C.Biju of Airport Nagar in Vappalassery, Ernakulam. Biju is a taxi driver employed by Cochin International Airport Ltd (CIAL), and CIAL has requested that he construct a PCC to continue working there.As a result, Biju documented a request before the Nedumbassery police headquarters sub-monitor to get the PCC. Despite this, PCC was denied to him because he was involved in a criminal case. Following this, Biju filed an appeal before the high court, questioning the Police's denial of PCC and designating the sub-overseer and Ernakulam country S.P. as inverse responsible for the situation.In contrast to the Police's argument that PCC cannot be granted to people involved in criminal proceedings, the court ruled that if the applicant is engaged in wrongdoing, authentication must be provided specifying the nature of the crime the solicitor is involved in. The police authorities cannot refuse the applicant's testimony.Minor traffic offences (such as speeding and running a stop sign or red light) are often dealt with separately from more severelaw violations. Minor tiny criminal offences are punished less harshly, and the judicial procedures are less formal. Furthermore, the municipal court, which hears minor traffic violations, is separate from the criminal court in many jurisdictions.PCC in case of Pending Accident CaseIn the case ofThe State of Arunachal Pradesh vsRamchandraRabidas[2], the Supreme Court ruled that a person who commits offences under the Motor Vehicles Act, such as speeding and reckless driving, can also be charged under theIndian Penal Codebecause both statutes operate independently. It went on to say that, as India's mechanization accelerates, the number of street traffic accidents and fatalities will rise. A panel of Justices InduMalhotra and SanjivKhanna overturned a December 22, 2008 judgement of the Gauhati High Court holding that an individual was arrested for over-speeding, dangerous driving, and other connected offences under the Motor Vehicles Act could not be charged under the IPC. While, according to Section 6 of the Passports Act, 1967, an individual's identity application may be denied if they have a criminal past or have proceedings pending. It is possible to ensure that they are available for the preliminary duration. If they were involved in a criminal investigation, but the accusations against them were dropped, they may be required to submit an endorsement stating the same. It will also cover circumstances when warrants have been issued in their name.In any event, Commissioner of Police Dr K Venkatesham warned in 2018 that traffic offenders in Pune would not receive a police declaration (PCC), which is required to obtain a visa. PCC is also required by many firms when employing new employees.Venkatesham stated that they were compiling a list of traffic offenders and would forward their information to the appropriate authorities, adding that such individuals would not be given a PCC.ConclusionRoad accidents have been a significant source of concern in India; therefore,individuals should double-check and follow traffic laws. A Police Clearance Certificate is essential since it demonstrates that a person does not have a criminal record and also assists an individual in establishing their innocence. However, the procedure of obtaining a PCC certificate is complex, so it is always advisable to contact a professional who can lawfully get such a certificate. In criminal cases, where the hearing is ongoing in court, the Police will refrain from immediately giving a PCC for obtaining a visa until the judgment has been given and the accused has been acquitted.*****[1]WP(C).No.14360 of 2015.[2][2] Criminal Appeal No. 905 of 2010.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, Bangalore6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar"

What is Pagdi system in Mumbai?Ans.The Pagdi system is a pre-independence rental law that gives the tenant certain ownership rights over the rented property, including the right to sub-let the property or even sells it while giving a share to the original owner.Q2. Is the Pagdi system legal in India nowAns.While there are efforts to modernize or abolish the archaic Pagdi system altogether, the system was made legal as per the Maharashtra Rent Control Act of 1999 and came into effect in the year 2000.Q3. What happens if my owner wants to sell the Pagdi property Iâm renting?Ans.If the original owners choose to sell the building with its land to a new real estate developer, you as a tenant will be given a substantial percentage of the current sale amount to vacate the premises.Q4. Can I save on taxes on the sale of a Pagdi property I am renting?Ans.The amount received from the sale of the Pagdi property is a capital asset and you can save tax on such long-term capital gains by reinvesting in a new home.Q5. Can I get a home loan on a Pagdi property?Ans.Getting a home loan on a property under the Pagdi System can be difficult, as many ownership issues remain prevalent with old properties.

    "answer": "Dear client,When including a clause in a lease agreement to protect yourself from legal situations related to injuries or accidents during the daycare's operation, it's important to consult with a qualified attorney who specializes in real estate and contract law. They can provide specific advice based on your jurisdiction and local regulations. Nevertheless, here's some general language that you could consider including:Indemnification Clause: This clause would state that the tenant agrees to indemnify and hold you (the landlord) harmless from any claims, damages, injuries, or losses that may occur on the premises, including those related to the daycare's operations.Release of Liability: Include a provision where the tenant and any parents/guardians of the children attending the daycare release you from any liability for injuries or accidents that may occur on the property. This provision may need to be reviewed by a lawyer to ensure it is enforceable in your jurisdiction.Insurance Requirement: Specify that the tenant must maintain adequate liability insurance coverage for their daycare operation and provide you with proof of insurance. This insurance should cover any accidents, injuries, or damages that may occur.Compliance with Regulations: Require the tenant to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and licensing requirements related to operating a daycare facility, including maintaining appropriate safety standards.Remember, it's crucial to consult with a legal professional to ensure that the clauses are suitable for your specific situation and comply with local laws. They can help you draft the necessary language and provide guidance on any additional protections you may need to include in the lease agreement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Need PCC for UK visa but section 188 case pending",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,It is a petty case and summons case as such you may manage to get it closed as early as possible on a single day and thereafter you can get police clearance certificate. You may read the following article also.======================================================================================Significance of a Police Clearance Certificate (PCC) in a pending Accident CaseA Police Clearance Certificate (PCC) is an official document issued by the Indian Police or government authority in India. It acknowledges any criminal records that an individual may have against their name and, if such records are clear, it issues a clearance certificate, which may be required for Indian or foreign citizens who are currently or have resided in India for the following reasons:1.Pursuing professional positions that need independence;2.Looking to relocate or obtain visas for other countries;3.Taking care of an organization's demand;A PCC from India does not have the time of legitimacy to back up its assertion. For the most part, it is legal for six months.Significance of PCCA valid Police Clearance Certificate, whether for employment, study, or travel, indicates that the individualhas no criminal convictions throughout their time or stay in the country. Assume the individual was involved in criminal activity or were apprehended due to a law violation in any manner. In that instance, specific notices from the concerned country will appear on their PCC, including the infringement details. Therefore, possessing a Police Clearance Certificate demonstrates their morality and prudence as guests or residents. Employers and travel specialists may raise concerns if theycannot provide PCC, implying that they are unlikely to be well-behaved citizens of the country.Definition of Petty case as per Karnataka Police ActPetty casesâPetty offenceâ meansany offence punishable only with fine not exceeding one thousand rupees, but does not include any offence so punishable under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1931, or under any other law which provides for convicting the accused person in his absence on a plea of guilty.Many sections in the Motor Vehicle Act are compoundable. It means if you commit a traffic violation, are booked for the same, and if the offence is compoundable, you can pay fine and get the case closed. Since you have paid fine, doesnât seem it would affect you in anyway.Alternative Remedies to come out of pending Moto Vehicle Accident Cases:Alternatively if offences are punishable under sections of 278, 279 and 304A ofIndian Penal Code, then the accused may approach the Honâble High Court by filing quashing petition under section 482 ofCriminal Procedure Codeby convincing the complainant and thus such case may be quashed getting clear acquittal for getting PCC.Components affecting PCC1) HavingÂ a substantial criminal record: If a personÂ hasÂ been punished or incarcerated, theirÂ PCC will reflect this. It is essential to note that beingÂ held for more than a year may affectÂ police checks. Additionally, outstanding advances or service bills would make obtaining a PCC more difficult.2) Association with a criminal organization: If a person isÂ a member of an association, club, or sorority and hasÂ a criminal past, this may impact the credibility of theirÂ PCC. Any contribution to the gathering, especially those involving criminal activity, may arouse suspicions.3) Record of unethical behaviour: A person'sÂ lengthy-time records demonstrate theirÂ upstanding reputation as a resident. If the experts believe that theyÂ are not decent or may threaten the country in any way, shape, or form, they are authorized to rejectÂ a police leeway declaration. Individuals seeking an Indian PCC can be divided into the following categories according to their nationality and present residence:a)Indian citizens residing in India;b)Indian nationals residing outside of India;c)Nationals from other countries who have settled in India;d)Indian citizens residing in India.For Indian citizens living in India, the Indian government has modified the PCC application process to a self-improved approach in which individuals may apply for a PCC online through the Passport Seva Kendra (PSK).Impact of Traffic Violations on PCCIn the case ofBiju T.C. vs The Station House Officer[1],the Kerala High Court ruled thatpolice officers could not refuse to issue a Police Clearance Certificate (PCC) to a citizenbased on his involvement in a criminal case and that the PCC must be given after considering the case's nuances. Justice K VinodChandran issued the decision after reviewing an appeal filed by T.C.Biju of Airport Nagar in Vappalassery, Ernakulam. Biju is a taxi driver employed by Cochin International Airport Ltd (CIAL), and CIAL has requested that he construct a PCC to continue working there.As a result, Biju documented a request before the Nedumbassery police headquarters sub-monitor to get the PCC. Despite this, PCC was denied to him because he was involved in a criminal case. Following this, Biju filed an appeal before the high court, questioning the Police's denial of PCC and designating the sub-overseer and Ernakulam country S.P. as inverse responsible for the situation.In contrast to the Police's argument that PCC cannot be granted to people involved in criminal proceedings, the court ruled that if the applicant is engaged in wrongdoing, authentication must be provided specifying the nature of the crime the solicitor is involved in. The police authorities cannot refuse the applicant's testimony.Minor traffic offences (such as speeding and running a stop sign or red light) are often dealt with separately from more severelaw violations. Minor tiny criminal offences are punished less harshly, and the judicial procedures are less formal. Furthermore, the municipal court, which hears minor traffic violations, is separate from the criminal court in many jurisdictions.PCC in case of Pending Accident CaseIn the case ofThe State of Arunachal Pradesh vsRamchandraRabidas[2], the Supreme Court ruled that a person who commits offences under the Motor Vehicles Act, such as speeding and reckless driving, can also be charged under theIndian Penal Codebecause both statutes operate independently. It went on to say that, as India's mechanization accelerates, the number of street traffic accidents and fatalities will rise. A panel of Justices InduMalhotra and SanjivKhanna overturned a December 22, 2008 judgement of the Gauhati High Court holding that an individual was arrested for over-speeding, dangerous driving, and other connected offences under the Motor Vehicles Act could not be charged under the IPC. While, according to Section 6 of the Passports Act, 1967, an individual's identity application may be denied if they have a criminal past or have proceedings pending. It is possible to ensure that they are available for the preliminary duration. If they were involved in a criminal investigation, but the accusations against them were dropped, they may be required to submit an endorsement stating the same. It will also cover circumstances when warrants have been issued in their name.In any event, Commissioner of Police Dr K Venkatesham warned in 2018 that traffic offenders in Pune would not receive a police declaration (PCC), which is required to obtain a visa. PCC is also required by many firms when employing new employees.Venkatesham stated that they were compiling a list of traffic offenders and would forward their information to the appropriate authorities, adding that such individuals would not be given a PCC.ConclusionRoad accidents have been a significant source of concern in India; therefore,individuals should double-check and follow traffic laws. A Police Clearance Certificate is essential since it demonstrates that a person does not have a criminal record and also assists an individual in establishing their innocence. However, the procedure of obtaining a PCC certificate is complex, so it is always advisable to contact a professional who can lawfully get such a certificate. In criminal cases, where the hearing is ongoing in court, the Police will refrain from immediately giving a PCC for obtaining a visa until the judgment has been given and the accused has been acquitted.*****[1]WP(C).No.14360 of 2015.[2][2] Criminal Appeal No. 905 of 2010.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, Bangalore6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar"

it debunks that the piece of land of the plaintiff has been fraudulently and illegally transferred in the name of defendant Nos. 2 to 6 but they have done nothing and linger on the matter on one pretext or the other.That the above-stated entries, mutation, sale deed, power of attorney, and all type of transactions, alienation, and entries of the revenue record are unjust, illegal, unauthorized, void, null, void ab-initio and are the result of misrepresentation, forgery, fraud, malice, ulterior motives, collusion with the revenue authorities concern and are in effect upon the

intends to further alienate the land, take forcible possession, raises construction and change the nature of the land.That the cause of action firstly accrued when the defendants committed fraud, forgery, misrepresentation and change the entries in the revenue record and secondly when in the month of May 2008, when the plaintiff got the knowledge of the said fraud, forgery, misrepresentation, change in entries in the revenue record which continues time by time and finally a week ago when the defendants finally refused to accede the genuine request of the plaintiff, the same is still continuing.That the property is situated within the territorial limits of this Honorable Court, cause of action also accrued here, the revenue authorities fall under the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, hence this Honorable Court has the jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate upon the matter.That the value of the suit for cancellation of documents for the purpose of court fee and jurisdiction is fixed as Rs. 20,000/- which is exempted from the levy of the court fee.That the plaintiff is ready to affix the appropriate Court fee, however, Rs. 20/- is affixed upon the

    "question": "Pagdi house - can married daughter claim rights",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,RIGHTS OF PAGDI HOLDERQ1. What is Pagdi system in Mumbai?Ans.The Pagdi system is a pre-independence rental law that gives the tenant certain ownership rights over the rented property, including the right to sub-let the property or even sells it while giving a share to the original owner.Q2. Is the Pagdi system legal in India nowAns.While there are efforts to modernize or abolish the archaic Pagdi system altogether, the system was made legal as per the Maharashtra Rent Control Act of 1999 and came into effect in the year 2000.Q3. What happens if my owner wants to sell the Pagdi property Iâm renting?Ans.If the original owners choose to sell the building with its land to a new real estate developer, you as a tenant will be given a substantial percentage of the current sale amount to vacate the premises.Q4. Can I save on taxes on the sale of a Pagdi property I am renting?Ans.The amount received from the sale of the Pagdi property is a capital asset and you can save tax on such long-term capital gains by reinvesting in a new home.Q5. Can I get a home loan on a Pagdi property?Ans.Getting a home loan on a property under the Pagdi System can be difficult, as many ownership issues remain prevalent with old properties. If you want the property rights transferred to your name, you need to establish your ownership rights for the banks to approve your loan application.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, Bangalore6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar"

    "question": "Need PCC for UK visa but section 188 case pending",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,It is a petty case and summons case as such you may manage to get it closed as early as possible on a single day and thereafter you can get police clearance certificate. You may read the following article also.======================================================================================Significance of a Police Clearance Certificate (PCC) in a pending Accident CaseA Police Clearance Certificate (PCC) is an official document issued by the Indian Police or government authority in India. It acknowledges any criminal records that an individual may have against their name and, if such records are clear, it issues a clearance certificate, which may be required for Indian or foreign citizens who are currently or have resided in India for the following reasons:1.Pursuing professional positions that need independence;2.Looking to relocate or obtain visas for other countries;3.Taking care of an organization's demand;A PCC from India does not have the time of legitimacy to back up its assertion. For the most part, it is legal for six months.Significance of PCCA valid Police Clearance Certificate, whether for employment, study, or travel, indicates that the individualhas no criminal convictions throughout their time or stay in the country. Assume the individual was involved in criminal activity or were apprehended due to a law violation in any manner. In that instance, specific notices from the concerned country will appear on their PCC, including the infringement details. Therefore, possessing a Police Clearance Certificate demonstrates their morality and prudence as guests or residents. Employers and travel specialists may raise concerns if theycannot provide PCC, implying that they are unlikely to be well-behaved citizens of the country.Definition of Petty case as per Karnataka Police ActPetty casesâPetty offenceâ meansany offence punishable only with fine not exceeding one thousand rupees, but does not include any offence so punishable under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1931, or under any other law which provides for convicting the accused person in his absence on a plea of guilty.Many sections in the Motor Vehicle Act are compoundable. It means if you commit a traffic violation, are booked for the same, and if the offence is compoundable, you can pay fine and get the case closed. Since you have paid fine, doesnât seem it would affect you in anyway.Alternative Remedies to come out of pending Moto Vehicle Accident Cases:Alternatively if offences are punishable under sections of 278, 279 and 304A ofIndian Penal Code, then the accused may approach the Honâble High Court by filing quashing petition under section 482 ofCriminal Procedure Codeby convincing the complainant and thus such case may be quashed getting clear acquittal for getting PCC.Components affecting PCC1) HavingÂ a substantial criminal record: If a personÂ hasÂ been punished or incarcerated, theirÂ PCC will reflect this. It is essential to note that beingÂ held for more than a year may affectÂ police checks. Additionally, outstanding advances or service bills would make obtaining a PCC more difficult.2) Association with a criminal organization: If a person isÂ a member of an association, club, or sorority and hasÂ a criminal past, this may impact the credibility of theirÂ PCC. Any contribution to the gathering, especially those involving criminal activity, may arouse suspicions.3) Record of unethical behaviour: A person'sÂ lengthy-time records demonstrate theirÂ upstanding reputation as a resident. If the experts believe that theyÂ are not decent or may threaten the country in any way, shape, or form, they are authorized to rejectÂ a police leeway declaration. Individuals seeking an Indian PCC can be divided into the following categories according to their nationality and present residence:a)Indian citizens residing in India;b)Indian nationals residing outside of India;c)Nationals from other countries who have settled in India;d)Indian citizens residing in India.For Indian citizens living in India, the Indian government has modified the PCC application process to a self-improved approach in which individuals may apply for a PCC online through the Passport Seva Kendra (PSK).Impact of Traffic Violations on PCCIn the case ofBiju T.C. vs The Station House Officer[1],the Kerala High Court ruled thatpolice officers could not refuse to issue a Police Clearance Certificate (PCC) to a citizenbased on his involvement in a criminal case and that the PCC must be given after considering the case's nuances. Justice K VinodChandran issued the decision after reviewing an appeal filed by T.C.Biju of Airport Nagar in Vappalassery, Ernakulam. Biju is a taxi driver employed by Cochin International Airport Ltd (CIAL), and CIAL has requested that he construct a PCC to continue working there.As a result, Biju documented a request before the Nedumbassery police headquarters sub-monitor to get the PCC. Despite this, PCC was denied to him because he was involved in a criminal case. Following this, Biju filed an appeal before the high court, questioning the Police's denial of PCC and designating the sub-overseer and Ernakulam country S.P. as inverse responsible for the situation.In contrast to the Police's argument that PCC cannot be granted to people involved in criminal proceedings, the court ruled that if the applicant is engaged in wrongdoing, authentication must be provided specifying the nature of the crime the solicitor is involved in. The police authorities cannot refuse the applicant's testimony.Minor traffic offences (such as speeding and running a stop sign or red light) are often dealt with separately from more severelaw violations. Minor tiny criminal offences are punished less harshly, and the judicial procedures are less formal. Furthermore, the municipal court, which hears minor traffic violations, is separate from the criminal court in many jurisdictions.PCC in case of Pending Accident CaseIn the case ofThe State of Arunachal Pradesh vsRamchandraRabidas[2], the Supreme Court ruled that a person who commits offences under the Motor Vehicles Act, such as speeding and reckless driving, can also be charged under theIndian Penal Codebecause both statutes operate independently. It went on to say that, as India's mechanization accelerates, the number of street traffic accidents and fatalities will rise. A panel of Justices InduMalhotra and SanjivKhanna overturned a December 22, 2008 judgement of the Gauhati High Court holding that an individual was arrested for over-speeding, dangerous driving, and other connected offences under the Motor Vehicles Act could not be charged under the IPC. While, according to Section 6 of the Passports Act, 1967, an individual's identity application may be denied if they have a criminal past or have proceedings pending. It is possible to ensure that they are available for the preliminary duration. If they were involved in a criminal investigation, but the accusations against them were dropped, they may be required to submit an endorsement stating the same. It will also cover circumstances when warrants have been issued in their name.In any event, Commissioner of Police Dr K Venkatesham warned in 2018 that traffic offenders in Pune would not receive a police declaration (PCC), which is required to obtain a visa. PCC is also required by many firms when employing new employees.Venkatesham stated that they were compiling a list of traffic offenders and would forward their information to the appropriate authorities, adding that such individuals would not be given a PCC.ConclusionRoad accidents have been a significant source of concern in India; therefore,individuals should double-check and follow traffic laws. A Police Clearance Certificate is essential since it demonstrates that a person does not have a criminal record and also assists an individual in establishing their innocence. However, the procedure of obtaining a PCC certificate is complex, so it is always advisable to contact a professional who can lawfully get such a certificate. In criminal cases, where the hearing is ongoing in court, the Police will refrain from immediately giving a PCC for obtaining a visa until the judgment has been given and the accused has been acquitted.*****[1]WP(C).No.14360 of 2015.[2][2] Criminal Appeal No. 905 of 2010.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, Bangalore6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar"

What is Pagdi system in Mumbai?Ans.The Pagdi system is a pre-independence rental law that gives the tenant certain ownership rights over the rented property, including the right to sub-let the property or even sells it while giving a share to the original owner.Q2. Is the Pagdi system legal in India nowAns.While there are efforts to modernize or abolish the archaic Pagdi system altogether, the system was made legal as per the Maharashtra Rent Control Act of 1999 and came into effect in the year 2000.Q3. What happens if my owner wants to sell the Pagdi property Iâm renting?Ans.If the original owners choose to sell the building with its land to a new real estate developer, you as a tenant will be given a substantial percentage of the current sale amount to vacate the premises.Q4. Can I save on taxes on the sale of a Pagdi property I am renting?Ans.The amount received from the sale of the Pagdi property is a capital asset and you can save tax on such long-term capital gains by reinvesting in a new home.Q5. Can I get a home loan on a Pagdi property?Ans.Getting a home loan on a property under the Pagdi System can be difficult, as many ownership issues remain prevalent with old properties.

___ dated ____ against the consideration amount of Rs. 35,000/- and the said mutation was sanctioned in favor of the said TJ.That is the month of May 2008 when the plaintiff went to the office of the Halqa Patwari, it came into the knowledge of the plaintiff that the defendant No. 1 with the connivance of the revenue authorities got entered frivolous and forged entries in the revenue record by way of amending the share, transferred by the plaintiff 20/4115 equal to ___ Kanal to 220/4115 share equal to ___ Kanals of land illegally, fraudulently and dishonestly and subsequently got sanctioned the

forgery and fraud with the connivance of the revenue authorities.That after coming into the knowledge of the plaintiff, the plaintiff immediately contacted the defendants/revenue authorities whereby it debunks that the piece of land of the plaintiff has been fraudulently and illegally transferred in the name of defendant Nos. 2 to 6 but they have done nothing and linger on the matter on one pretext or the other.That the above-stated entries, mutation, sale deed, power of attorney, and all type of transactions, alienation, and entries of the revenue record are unjust, illegal, unauthorized, void, null, void ab-initio and are the result of misrepresentation, forgery, fraud, malice, ulterior motives, collusion with the revenue authorities concern and are in effect upon the rights of the plaintiff and are liable to be set-aside, canceled, corrected, according to the actual ownership of the plaintiff in the land mentioned above and share transferred in favor of the defendant No. 1 i.e. 20/4115 equal to _ Kanal only.That a glaring fraud is spelled out from a cursory glance of the relevant documents, hence the mutations, etc are liable to be canceled, set-aside, and corrected in accordance with the law.That the defendant No. 7 has been made party as the defendants No. 8 to 10 are subordinate to him and he is responsible for their acts and deeds etc and is authorized to correct the entries in accordance with the law.That the said act on the part of the revenue authorities as well as defendants No. 1 to 6 is unjust, illegal, unauthorized, void, null, void ab-initio and is the result of misrepresentation, forgery, fraud, malice, ulterior motives, and ineffective upon the rights of the plaintiff and to deprive the plaintiff of his valuable land.That the plaintiff asked the revenue authorities as well as defendant No. 1 to 6 to admit the rights and title of the plaintiff and withdrew from their illegal claims but the defendants have refused to accede the genuine request of the plaintiff, hence this suit.That now it also came into the knowledge of the plaintiff that the defendants No. 1 to 6 with the connivance of the revenue authorities intends to further alienate the land, take forcible possession, raises construction and change the nature of the land.That the cause of action firstly accrued when the defendants committed fraud, forgery, misrepresentation and change the entries in the revenue record and secondly when in the month of May 2008, when the plaintiff got the knowledge of the said fraud, forgery, misrepresentation, change in entries in the revenue record which continues time by time and finally a week ago when the defendants finally refused to accede the genuine request of the plaintiff, the same is still continuing.That the property is situated within the territorial limits of this Honorable Court, cause of action also accrued here, the revenue authorities fall under the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, hence this Honorable Court has the jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate upon the matter.That the value of the suit for cancellation of documents for the purpose of court fee and jurisdiction is fixed as Rs. 20,000/- which is exempted from the levy of the court fee.That the plaintiff is ready to affix the appropriate Court fee, however, Rs. 20/- is affixed upon the

    "answer": "In the event of termination or resignation, it is usually the case the competitors try to poach an employee from the previous employerIn some instances, the employer may want to not disclose his business practices to competitors. It can also happen that confidentiality is required for a certain transaction or work. The employer has every right to ask the employee to sign an NDA in such instances. The employer can offer or not offer any consideration for signing such NDA.The party demanding NDA should inform why NDA is there and what confidentiality information covers. Further, he should also indicate the manner of signing the NDA. Once signed, the NDA becomes enforceable against signee.However you are not obligated to sign the NDA post resignation especially after completion of the notice period.If this NDA was not a condition or terms of employment, you can refuse to sign the same post resignation.If the employer is withholding the F&F settlement or relieving letter or experience letter, you can take legal action as per procedures of law to recover/procure them.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

From theÂ  date of OC to five months you can register the property and he can allow to impose penalty onlyÂ  after 5 months only. Suppose if you register theÂ  property in the 6th month, the builder can impose penalty only 1 month not from the date of OC.Further like that above, the builder can't impose penalty during COVID period and travel restrictions.It is better you can register the property in your name as per the builder terms and thereafter you can approach the Court either RERA ( projected in registered under RERA) or Consumer Forum.

    "answer": "- The Government had direct the public not to move from house during the corona-virus outbreak, and due to this reasons all the services has been stopped.- Hence your delay of approaching the builder for registration is caused by the Force Majeure, and not malafidely , which is out of your reach and control.- Since you have entered into a contract after signing an agreement with the builder and thereby you bond yourself with the clauses mentioned therein.- As per law,Â A breach of contract occurs when one party fails to fulfill its agreement according to the terms of the contract, and the other party fulfills its obligations, the performing party is entitled to legal remedies for breach of contract.- But, if the breach inevitably occurs due to something neither party has control over such as a natural disaster that affects one or both party of the contract , or the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, then it will not come under the definition of the Breach of contract.- Hence, the said builder cannot charge any penalty from you legally- You can send a legal notice after narrating the reasons of delay, and if no positive response then file a compliant against the builder before the consumer forum .Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Heir certificate/process to sell property in India",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. You know that as per Section 2(h) of Indian Succession Act, 1925 provides that Will means the legal declaration of the intention of a person with respect to his property, which he desires to take effect after his death Will has been defined in Corpus Juris Secundum as A âWillâ is the legal declaration of a manâs intention, which he wills to be performed after his death, or an instrument by which a person makes a disposition of his property to take effect after his death.You can apply for probate of Will initially. The word âProbateâ means to prove or validate something. It is a procedure for court approval of the Will as the valid and last Will of the deceased testator. According to the Indian Succession Act, 1925, âProbate of will, when granted establishes the will from the death of the testator, and renders valid all intermediate acts of the executor as such.âIt means that when a Will is probated, it gets officially certified with a seal of the court and provides the authority to the executor to appropriately distribute the assets of deceased testator and also to pay off bills and creditors from that estate.The procedure for probating of will is divided into four simple stages:1. The first step involves making of application to the District Judge through a probate petition which must be duly signed and verified by or on behalf of the applicant. The probate petition should be in a prescribed format under Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.2. The second step is to send the application to the High Court, under whose jurisdiction property falls. Then a lawyer shall prepare the application, in some cases lower court can also accept the application.3. One needs to submit certain documents that can verify the genuineness of the will, death certificate and other documents. These will prove that the testator had free will.4. When the court receives the application, it verifies all the details. Then it invites the nearest kin of the deceased for claiming the probate. Finally, it showcases the invitation letter at prominent places for invitation of any objection. If after 30 days, the court files no objection, the issuance of the probate is complete.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "question": "Heir certificate/process to sell property in India",
    "answer": "If your father had written Will in USA which would include the properties left behind in the USA also then you can get the Will probated by a court of USA.A will can be executed anywhere without any restrictions subject to the due procedure of the law of the country.With reference to wills executed outside India, in respect of which a foreign probate has also been obtained, the requirement of Section 213(1) of the Indian SuccessionÂ  Act , 1925, would be satisfied by obtaining under Section 228(1) of the Act an ancillary probate. Otherwise, the procedural requirement of the lex fori enacted under Section 213(1) of the Act may not be satisfied and if it is only with a view to enable parties claiming under a will executed outside India to make claims with reference to properties situated in India, the procedure under Section 228 of the Act has been prescribed.In India, Wills made in other jurisdiction are not automatically enforceable.Under the Act, an ancillary probate can be granted to authenticate a foreign will. A foreign will, once proved and deposited in a court of competent jurisdiction, or a properly authenticated copy of the will and letters of administration will be recognised by the Indian Courts. Otherwise, if the Court deems fit then it will take the evidence into account and will examine the petitioner upon oath to ensure the veracity of the will.An executor or legatee cannot claim their right under the will unless probate or letters of administration of the will are obtained.If the Will was written in India and if the properties are situated in a place other than Bombay or Madras or Calcutta, probate would not be necessary, but you can get the details of the family tree or surviving members of the family of deceased duly attested by a notary of that country, in order to succeed to the estates, based on which all the beneficiaries should apply jointly for mutation of the property to their name by enclosing the copy of the Will (probate of Will if already obtained).Once the property is mutated then all the shareholders can sell the property jointly by executing a joint sale deed in favor of the prospective buyer."

If the deceased person has resided that place less than 6 months only , then a report can be obtained by the Tehsildar from the Tehsildar where the deceased was resided for more than one year.- Since, you want to sell that property , then you should apply for mutation before the revenue officer in the name of all legal heirs , and there is not requirement for LR certificate , if Will is available.-Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "Dear client,I'm not a legal expert, but I can provide some general information based on common practices. In India, an heirship certificate (also known as a succession certificate) can be obtained to establish the legal heirs of a deceased person and their respective shares in the estate. The certificate helps in transferring the assets of the deceased, including property, to the rightful heirs.To obtain an heirship certificate, you may need to follow these general steps:Jurisdiction: Determine the jurisdiction where the deceased's property is located. The application for the heirship certificate usually needs to be made in the appropriate court within that jurisdiction.Application: Prepare an application for the heirship certificate, including details such as the deceased's name, date of death, place of residence, and details of legal heirs (including their names, addresses, and relationships).Supporting Documents: Gather supporting documents that may be required, which can include:Death certificate of the deceased.Copy of the Will, if available.Identity proof and address proof of the legal heirs.Affidavits from the legal heirs stating their relationship with the deceased and their rights to the property.Any other documents as required by the court.Affidavits and Declarations: The legal heirs may need to provide affidavits and declarations stating their relationship to the deceased and their entitlement to the property.Publication and Notice: The court may require publication of a notice in a local newspaper and serving notice to other legal heirs and interested parties, giving them an opportunity to raise objections if any.Court Process: Attend the court proceedings and provide any additional information or documentation as required by the court.Please note that the process and specific requirements for obtaining an heirship certificate can vary based on the jurisdiction and the individual circumstances.

owner in possession of property bearing Khasra Nos. ___ owner of ___ Kanals __ Marlas and ____ owner of ___ Kanals ___ Marlas total measuring ____ Kanals ___ Marlas situated at Mauza Mohri Khatran, Tehsil and District Rawalpindi.That out of the above said total land measuring ___ Kanals ___ Marlas, the plaintiff sold a share 20/4115 measuring ___ Kanal to one Mr. TJ son of KUR vide Mutation No. ___ dated ____ against the consideration amount of Rs. 35,000/- and the said mutation was sanctioned in favor of the said TJ.That is the month of May 2008 when the plaintiff went to the office of the Halqa Patwari, it came into the knowledge of the plaintiff that the defendant No. 1 with the connivance of the revenue authorities got entered frivolous and forged entries in the revenue record by way of amending the share, transferred by the plaintiff 20/4115 equal to ___ Kanal to 220/4115 share equal to ___ Kanals of land illegally, fraudulently and dishonestly and subsequently got sanctioned the

Sub Registrar Rural, Rawalpindi._____ in favor of defendant No. 5 vide registered sale deed No. ____ dated ______._____ in favor of defendant No. 6.illegally, unlawfully, fraudulently, by way of forgery and fraud with the connivance of the revenue authorities.That after coming into the knowledge of the plaintiff, the plaintiff immediately contacted the defendants/revenue authorities whereby it debunks that the piece of land of the plaintiff has been fraudulently and illegally transferred in the name of defendant Nos. 2 to 6 but they have done nothing and linger on the matter on one pretext or the other.That the above-stated entries, mutation, sale deed, power of attorney, and all type of transactions, alienation, and entries of the revenue record are unjust, illegal, unauthorized, void, null, void ab-initio and are the result of misrepresentation, forgery, fraud, malice, ulterior motives, collusion with the revenue authorities concern and are in effect upon the rights of the plaintiff and are liable to be set-aside, canceled, corrected, according to the actual ownership of the plaintiff in the land mentioned above and share transferred in favor of the defendant No. 1 i.e. 20/4115 equal to _ Kanal only.That a glaring fraud is spelled out from a cursory glance of the relevant documents, hence the mutations, etc are liable to be canceled, set-aside, and corrected in accordance with the law.That the defendant No. 7 has been made party as the defendants No. 8 to 10 are subordinate to him and he is responsible for their acts and deeds etc and is authorized to correct the entries in accordance with the law.That the said act on the part of the revenue authorities as well as defendants No. 1 to 6 is unjust, illegal, unauthorized, void, null, void ab-initio and is the result of misrepresentation, forgery, fraud, malice, ulterior motives, and ineffective upon the rights of the plaintiff and to deprive the plaintiff of his valuable land.That the plaintiff asked the revenue authorities as well as defendant No. 1 to 6 to admit the rights and title of the plaintiff and withdrew from their illegal claims but the defendants have refused to accede the genuine request of the plaintiff, hence this suit.That now it also came into the knowledge of the plaintiff that the defendants No. 1 to 6 with the connivance of the revenue authorities intends to further alienate the land, take forcible possession, raises construction and change the nature of the land.That the cause of action firstly accrued when the defendants committed fraud, forgery, misrepresentation and change the entries in the revenue record and secondly when in the month of May 2008, when the plaintiff got the knowledge of the said fraud, forgery, misrepresentation, change in entries in the revenue record which continues time by time and finally a week ago when the defendants finally refused to accede the genuine request of the plaintiff, the same is still continuing.That the property is situated within the territorial limits of this Honorable Court, cause of action also accrued here, the revenue authorities fall under the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, hence this Honorable Court has the jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate upon the matter.That the value of the suit for cancellation of documents for the purpose of court fee and jurisdiction is fixed as Rs. 20,000/- which is exempted from the levy of the court fee.That the plaintiff is ready to affix the appropriate Court fee, however, Rs. 20/- is affixed upon the

If it is so, then you residents may ask the RWA to pursue the matter with the builder or approach the govt authorities/courts to enforce the terms and conditions.

Suppose if you register theÂ  property in the 6th month, the builder can impose penalty only 1 month not from the date of OC.Further like that above, the builder can't impose penalty during COVID period and travel restrictions.It is better you can register the property in your name as per the builder terms and thereafter you can approach the Court either RERA ( projected in registered under RERA) or Consumer Forum.

    "question": "Heir certificate/process to sell property in India",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. You know that as per Section 2(h) of Indian Succession Act, 1925 provides that Will means the legal declaration of the intention of a person with respect to his property, which he desires to take effect after his death Will has been defined in Corpus Juris Secundum as A âWillâ is the legal declaration of a manâs intention, which he wills to be performed after his death, or an instrument by which a person makes a disposition of his property to take effect after his death.You can apply for probate of Will initially. The word âProbateâ means to prove or validate something. It is a procedure for court approval of the Will as the valid and last Will of the deceased testator. According to the Indian Succession Act, 1925, âProbate of will, when granted establishes the will from the death of the testator, and renders valid all intermediate acts of the executor as such.âIt means that when a Will is probated, it gets officially certified with a seal of the court and provides the authority to the executor to appropriately distribute the assets of deceased testator and also to pay off bills and creditors from that estate.The procedure for probating of will is divided into four simple stages:1. The first step involves making of application to the District Judge through a probate petition which must be duly signed and verified by or on behalf of the applicant. The probate petition should be in a prescribed format under Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.2. The second step is to send the application to the High Court, under whose jurisdiction property falls. Then a lawyer shall prepare the application, in some cases lower court can also accept the application.3. One needs to submit certain documents that can verify the genuineness of the will, death certificate and other documents. These will prove that the testator had free will.4. When the court receives the application, it verifies all the details. Then it invites the nearest kin of the deceased for claiming the probate. Finally, it showcases the invitation letter at prominent places for invitation of any objection. If after 30 days, the court files no objection, the issuance of the probate is complete.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "question": "Heir certificate/process to sell property in India",
    "answer": "If your father had written Will in USA which would include the properties left behind in the USA also then you can get the Will probated by a court of USA.A will can be executed anywhere without any restrictions subject to the due procedure of the law of the country.With reference to wills executed outside India, in respect of which a foreign probate has also been obtained, the requirement of Section 213(1) of the Indian SuccessionÂ  Act , 1925, would be satisfied by obtaining under Section 228(1) of the Act an ancillary probate. Otherwise, the procedural requirement of the lex fori enacted under Section 213(1) of the Act may not be satisfied and if it is only with a view to enable parties claiming under a will executed outside India to make claims with reference to properties situated in India, the procedure under Section 228 of the Act has been prescribed.In India, Wills made in other jurisdiction are not automatically enforceable.Under the Act, an ancillary probate can be granted to authenticate a foreign will. A foreign will, once proved and deposited in a court of competent jurisdiction, or a properly authenticated copy of the will and letters of administration will be recognised by the Indian Courts. Otherwise, if the Court deems fit then it will take the evidence into account and will examine the petitioner upon oath to ensure the veracity of the will.An executor or legatee cannot claim their right under the will unless probate or letters of administration of the will are obtained.If the Will was written in India and if the properties are situated in a place other than Bombay or Madras or Calcutta, probate would not be necessary, but you can get the details of the family tree or surviving members of the family of deceased duly attested by a notary of that country, in order to succeed to the estates, based on which all the beneficiaries should apply jointly for mutation of the property to their name by enclosing the copy of the Will (probate of Will if already obtained).Once the property is mutated then all the shareholders can sell the property jointly by executing a joint sale deed in favor of the prospective buyer."

The certificate helps in transferring the assets of the deceased, including property, to the rightful heirs.To obtain an heirship certificate, you may need to follow these general steps:Jurisdiction: Determine the jurisdiction where the deceased's property is located. The application for the heirship certificate usually needs to be made in the appropriate court within that jurisdiction.Application: Prepare an application for the heirship certificate, including details such as the deceased's name, date of death, place of residence, and details of legal heirs (including their names, addresses, and relationships).Supporting Documents: Gather supporting documents that may be required, which can include:Death certificate of the deceased.Copy of the Will, if available.Identity proof and address proof of the legal heirs.Affidavits from the legal heirs stating their relationship with the deceased and their rights to the property.Any other documents as required by the court.Affidavits and Declarations: The legal heirs may need to provide affidavits and declarations stating their relationship to the deceased and their entitlement to the property.Publication and Notice: The court may require publication of a notice in a local newspaper and serving notice to other legal heirs and interested parties, giving them an opportunity to raise objections if any.Court Process: Attend the court proceedings and provide any additional information or documentation as required by the court.Please note that the process and specific requirements for obtaining an heirship certificate can vary based on the jurisdiction and the individual circumstances.

    "question": "Heir certificate/process to sell property in India",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. You know that as per Section 2(h) of Indian Succession Act, 1925 provides that Will means the legal declaration of the intention of a person with respect to his property, which he desires to take effect after his death Will has been defined in Corpus Juris Secundum as A âWillâ is the legal declaration of a manâs intention, which he wills to be performed after his death, or an instrument by which a person makes a disposition of his property to take effect after his death.You can apply for probate of Will initially. The word âProbateâ means to prove or validate something. It is a procedure for court approval of the Will as the valid and last Will of the deceased testator. According to the Indian Succession Act, 1925, âProbate of will, when granted establishes the will from the death of the testator, and renders valid all intermediate acts of the executor as such.âIt means that when a Will is probated, it gets officially certified with a seal of the court and provides the authority to the executor to appropriately distribute the assets of deceased testator and also to pay off bills and creditors from that estate.The procedure for probating of will is divided into four simple stages:1. The first step involves making of application to the District Judge through a probate petition which must be duly signed and verified by or on behalf of the applicant. The probate petition should be in a prescribed format under Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.2. The second step is to send the application to the High Court, under whose jurisdiction property falls. Then a lawyer shall prepare the application, in some cases lower court can also accept the application.3. One needs to submit certain documents that can verify the genuineness of the will, death certificate and other documents. These will prove that the testator had free will.4. When the court receives the application, it verifies all the details. Then it invites the nearest kin of the deceased for claiming the probate. Finally, it showcases the invitation letter at prominent places for invitation of any objection. If after 30 days, the court files no objection, the issuance of the probate is complete.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "question": "Heir certificate/process to sell property in India",
    "answer": "If your father had written Will in USA which would include the properties left behind in the USA also then you can get the Will probated by a court of USA.A will can be executed anywhere without any restrictions subject to the due procedure of the law of the country.With reference to wills executed outside India, in respect of which a foreign probate has also been obtained, the requirement of Section 213(1) of the Indian SuccessionÂ  Act , 1925, would be satisfied by obtaining under Section 228(1) of the Act an ancillary probate. Otherwise, the procedural requirement of the lex fori enacted under Section 213(1) of the Act may not be satisfied and if it is only with a view to enable parties claiming under a will executed outside India to make claims with reference to properties situated in India, the procedure under Section 228 of the Act has been prescribed.In India, Wills made in other jurisdiction are not automatically enforceable.Under the Act, an ancillary probate can be granted to authenticate a foreign will. A foreign will, once proved and deposited in a court of competent jurisdiction, or a properly authenticated copy of the will and letters of administration will be recognised by the Indian Courts. Otherwise, if the Court deems fit then it will take the evidence into account and will examine the petitioner upon oath to ensure the veracity of the will.An executor or legatee cannot claim their right under the will unless probate or letters of administration of the will are obtained.If the Will was written in India and if the properties are situated in a place other than Bombay or Madras or Calcutta, probate would not be necessary, but you can get the details of the family tree or surviving members of the family of deceased duly attested by a notary of that country, in order to succeed to the estates, based on which all the beneficiaries should apply jointly for mutation of the property to their name by enclosing the copy of the Will (probate of Will if already obtained).Once the property is mutated then all the shareholders can sell the property jointly by executing a joint sale deed in favor of the prospective buyer."

    "answer": "In the event of termination or resignation, it is usually the case the competitors try to poach an employee from the previous employerIn some instances, the employer may want to not disclose his business practices to competitors. It can also happen that confidentiality is required for a certain transaction or work. The employer has every right to ask the employee to sign an NDA in such instances. The employer can offer or not offer any consideration for signing such NDA.The party demanding NDA should inform why NDA is there and what confidentiality information covers. Further, he should also indicate the manner of signing the NDA. Once signed, the NDA becomes enforceable against signee.However you are not obligated to sign the NDA post resignation especially after completion of the notice period.If this NDA was not a condition or terms of employment, you can refuse to sign the same post resignation.If the employer is withholding the F&F settlement or relieving letter or experience letter, you can take legal action as per procedures of law to recover/procure them.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Prevent PG creation",
    "answer": "Dear client,The specific legalities and regulations regarding your situation may vary depending on the laws in your jurisdiction, so it's important to consult with a local legal professional for accurate advice. However, I can offer some general suggestions that might be helpful.Check local building codes and regulations: Research the local building codes and regulations that govern residential properties in your area. Look for any restrictions or guidelines related to the conversion of residential properties into PG accommodations. This information can provide you with an understanding of whether the owner's plans comply with the regulations.Review the property's deed and zoning regulations: Examine the property's deed and any applicable zoning regulations. These documents may outline the permitted uses of the property and any restrictions that may apply. It is possible that converting the property into a PG accommodation might violate these rules.Consult a lawyer: Seek advice from a lawyer who specializes in property and real estate law. They will be able to review your specific situation, including any relevant local laws and regulations, and provide you with appropriate guidance.Discuss concerns with the owner: It may be helpful to have a conversation with the owner about your concerns. Explain your worries regarding the noise, security, and loss of privacy that may arise from converting the property into a PG accommodation. See if you can reach a mutual understanding or come up with alternative solutions that could address your concerns.Gather support from neighbors: While you mentioned that some neighbors might be hesitant to sign a letter of complaint, it may still be worth trying to gather support. Speak with your neighbors and explain your concerns. If they share similar worries, they might be willing to sign the letter or offer their support in other ways.Engage with the colony's governing body: If the colony president has asked you to write a letter, it indicates that they are open to addressing the issue. Follow the president's instructions and draft a formal letter outlining your concerns. Submit the letter along with any supporting evidence, such as photographs or recordings of the noise disturbances, if available.Remember that this advice is general in nature, and it's crucial to consult with a legal professional who can provide guidance based on the specific laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

He either agrees to transfer or can at this time, decline transfer. Once an inmate agrees to transfer, the foreign country is notified and a schedule for the inmate's transfer is established.An inmate must be approved by both the US and the foreign country in order for an inmate to be transferred to his or her country of citizenship.From the above it can be noted that you being a Bangladeshi citizen, not eligible for transfer to India as an inmate.As far as Asylum is concerned:India does not have any specific legislation dealing with the problem of refugees and asylum seekers. At present, refugees were treated as par with the foreigners and all laws applied to foreigners were also applied to them.An asylum seeker is a person who has left their country and is seeking protection from persecution and serious human rights violations in another country, but who hasn't yet been legally recognized as a refugee and is waiting to receive a decision on their asylum claim. Seeking asylum is a human right.However in your case the chances for getting asylum in India is very bleakÂ  specially on the basis of the fact that you married an US Citizen.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

If it is so, then you residents may ask the RWA to pursue the matter with the builder or approach the govt authorities/courts to enforce the terms and conditions. Not paying the maintenance charges is not the solution. It may incur interest on the pending amount or may lead to discontinuation of facilities like electricity, water etc.You may approach the relevant govt authorities for completion of the project and for other remedial action.

    "question": "Mutual divorce 2nd motion not attended",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,First let me explain to you the process formutual consent divorce!Process For FilingDivorce By Mutual ConsentFiling of the Petition in the Family CourtJoint petition for dissolution of marriage for a decree of divorce is presented to the Family Court by both the spouses on the ground stating that they have not been able to reconcile the differences and live together. Thus, have mutually agreed to dissolve the marriage or they have been living separately for a period of one year or more. This petition has to be signed by both the parties.Appearance before the Family Court Judge for First Motion for DivorceBoth the parties will enter their appearance in the Court along with their legal counsels. Family Court Judge will go through the contents of the petition along with all the documents presented in the Court. Court may attempt to reconcile the differences between the spouses, however, if this is not possible, the matter proceeds further.Joint Statement on OathAfter going through the contents of the application, Court may order the party's joint statements to be recorded on oath and joint statement are signed by both the parties along with their respective counsels and then First motion is passed.First Motion order is passed, 6 Months Time period is given for the Second MotionAn order on the first motion is passed by the court. After this, a six months cooling period is given to both the parties to a divorce, before they can file the second motion. The maximum period to file for a second motion is 18 months from the date of presentation of the divorce petition in the family court.Second Motion hearing and Final DecreeOnce the parties have decided to go further with the proceedings and appear for the second motion, they proceed with the final hearings. This includes parties appearing and recording of joint statements before the Family Court.Kindly note that the time period to appear for the 2nd motion is 18 months i,e 1.5 years. There is a concept called as condonation of delay and thus your application can be dragged for another 6 months. Yes, I recommend you to go ahead and file the RCR petition, if your wife files a contested divorce. Sometimes, since the maintenance amount, alimony etc., can't be asked as much as in normal divorce, the lawyers of your wife may advice her to go forward and apply for a Sec 13(1)(ia) petition against you. Thus, I strongly recommend that you be a little careful and calculative. Before granting the decree for divorce, the Judge himself will ask you whether you want the matter to be put up for mediation. Do not worry, you yourself ask the Judge to put up the matter before the mediator. May I know why you want to reconcile?In case, the Judge is reluctant to grant date and shows an indication that he is going to grant divorce, you can always go for withdrawing with liberty to file fresh suit.Â  Also note that, if the matter is unattended by both the parties, it is capable of being disposed instead of divorce order. Also, to grant divorce there must be documents, if you have not filed any documents, how can the judge access and pass an appropriate order?Â  The Judges give 60 days time (in some cases 90 days)Â  for mediation process to complete and end. There are catena of cases where the judges have condoned the delay in theÂ  coming forward with the second motion, we can use those in your defence. The withdrawal can happen only if both of you agree, otherwise there will be no withdrawal. One-sided withdrawal is not permitted in the court of law. There is no such provision which allows for conversion of amutual consent divorcepetition to normal petition. She will have to file a fresh suit in case she wants to go for contested divorce under H.M.A 1955.I hope I have answered your questions. In case you have further doubts, do not hesitate to reach out to me for clarification"

    "answer": "On the basis of the limited information made available by you the answers are as under:(1) Yes, the ex-parte judgement can be set aside if she proves the exceptional circumstances which prevented her from attending the hearings or that she had not received the information/summonses.(2) The issue of maintenance shall be decided by the Court in case the judgement is set aside and it is heard again.(3) In case the ex-pate judgement is not set aside and it is in force then she will have to follow the directions given by the Court in the judgement and if there are directions that she cannot take your son out of city or country without your knowledge then she cannot take him away. If the judgement is set aside then she will have to follow the directions of the court given during the pendency of the case or on conclusion of the case.(4) No, after the divorce she cannot have any claim on your property. However, she can approach the court to attach your property to realize the alimony or amount of maintenance, if not given to her as per the court orders.(5) As the time limit of appeal has already passed and the judgement has become effective, she can be asked to move out of your house. But you need to take care while doing so. It should be done either amicably or with the intervention of the court otherwise she might make some other complaint of physical assault etc against you.Â  If the ex-parte judgement is aside or during the hearing any orders are issued to maintain status quo, i.e. the situation prior to ex-parte judgement, then she will continue to enjoy all rights as your wife till the case is finally decided.Dalbir BhartiAdvocate, Gurgaon41 AnswersTalk to Advocate Dalbir Bharti"

Since in 2008 you had already gift property to daughter in law hence in 2013 when you made WILL, you were not the owner of the property so your WILL which was already under pressure is infractous, null and void. As per law a person can bequeath his owned property only. Further the period of limitation to invoke gift is three years only so gift made in 2008 could alsoÂ  not be invoked in 2013. Once gift is made by you and your daughter in law has accepted the gift under some rituals and ceremonies then your daughter in law has become absolute owner and after expiry of three years such gift cannot be invoked.

    "question": "Section 30 of Land Acquisition Act",
    "answer": "Failure to file a reply within the given time frame does not automatically result in an ex parte decision. An ex parte decision typically occurs when one party is absent or fails to participate in the proceedings. In your case, since the HUDA has not filed a reply, it may indicate a delay or oversight on their part. The court will likely take note of this and may grant additional time or take appropriate action to ensure a fair process. It's important to consult with your lawyer to understand the implications of the HUDA's lack of response and how it may affect the proceedings.The time it takes for the court to release the money in your favor can vary depending on various factors, including the court's workload, administrative procedures, and the efficiency of the legal system. Since both respondent number 1 and 2 have already provided written statements in support of releasing the amount to you, it strengthens your case.

    "question": "Section 30 of Land Acquisition Act",
    "answer": "Failure to file a reply within the given time frame does not automatically result in an ex parte decision. An ex parte decision typically occurs when one party is absent or fails to participate in the proceedings. In your case, since the HUDA has not filed a reply, it may indicate a delay or oversight on their part. The court will likely take note of this and may grant additional time or take appropriate action to ensure a fair process. It's important to consult with your lawyer to understand the implications of the HUDA's lack of response and how it may affect the proceedings.The time it takes for the court to release the money in your favor can vary depending on various factors, including the court's workload, administrative procedures, and the efficiency of the legal system. Since both respondent number 1 and 2 have already provided written statements in support of releasing the amount to you, it strengthens your case.

    "answer": "The Office of Enforcement Operations and the foreign country make the final determination on a Treaty Transfer. Several factors will determine whether or not an inmate is eligible, examples include:The inmate must be a citizen or national of a foreign country having a treaty relationship with the United States. In the instance of inmates who claim dual citizenship, it will be the responsibility of the inmate to provide proof of citizenship or nationality for the foreign country.The inmate must not be committed for a military offense.The inmate must not be sentenced to the death penalty.The inmate must not be committed for a political offense.The inmate must have at least six months remaining on his current sentence at the time of his request. (Certain countries may require a longer period).The inmate will be scheduled for a verification of consent hearing before a magistrate judge. He either agrees to transfer or can at this time, decline transfer. Once an inmate agrees to transfer, the foreign country is notified and a schedule for the inmate's transfer is established.An inmate must be approved by both the US and the foreign country in order for an inmate to be transferred to his or her country of citizenship.From the above it can be noted that you being a Bangladeshi citizen, not eligible for transfer to India as an inmate.As far as Asylum is concerned:India does not have any specific legislation dealing with the problem of refugees and asylum seekers. At present, refugees were treated as par with the foreigners and all laws applied to foreigners were also applied to them.An asylum seeker is a person who has left their country and is seeking protection from persecution and serious human rights violations in another country, but who hasn't yet been legally recognized as a refugee and is waiting to receive a decision on their asylum claim. Seeking asylum is a human right.However in your case the chances for getting asylum in India is very bleakÂ  specially on the basis of the fact that you married an US Citizen.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "1. After due date has passed away can the seller force the buyer to buy the property even though due date passed away due to his tenants delaying to vacate.yes the seller can require your brother to purchase. time was never an essence of the contract as the completion of the sale was predicated on the tenants vacating the property. there is a delay of only 5 days and so no heavens would fall loose if the sale could not be completed on 15.10.21. Had there been an unconscionsenable delay then your brother would have been justified to refuse to complete the sale and seek refund of his advance2. What should a buyer do if the seller denies to return his advance amount given at time of sale agreement.file a suit and prove in the court that the purchaser is entitled to refund3. Can the seller take legal action against buyer and force the buyer to buy his property even though the deal is delayed due to negligence of seller(due to his tenants late vacating property).yes the seller can, the delay in vacating of the property by his tenants notwithstanding4. What legal rights does the buyer have in this case and how does he get his advance payment back from seller.buyer has to show and prove what legal injury did he suffer due to the alleged delay. buyer has to prove this in a suit to be filed by him against seller for refund of money5. There was no clause mentioning tenants staying in the property at time so sale agreement. But my brother has call recording with tenant of seller on 15 oct 2021 stating that he still has not vacated the property by the end of 15 oct 2021. Can this be used as an evidence.do you mean to say that your brother was totally unaware about there being tenants on the property? did he not take even an inspection considering that this was his first house purchase? this does not sound convincing at all!6. What if the seller doesnât return buyer advance money and put his property on rent or sell it to another buyer.seller has the right to forfeit the advance because buyer is backing out of the deal. if you want the refund you will have to file a suit.7. Whose side will jurisdiction take in this matter when the buyer is suffering loss of his advance money being head by the seller.Can still the jurisdiction force the buyer to buy the property even though now the buyer has no interest to buy it, but this sale deed got cancelled due to delay by the fault of seller.that the court will decide. cannot be predicted.Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

Can the seller enjoy fruit of renting his property till litigation against him is going on for returning back advance money to buyer in court of law.Or can buyer get stay order from court so that seller cannot put his property on rent or sell it to someone else till buyer gets back his advance money with interest.buyer backs out of the deal. then he has problem with the seller selling his property to someone else and also against renting of the property. no court will grant such a stay to the buyer. that would amount to miscarriage of justice.3.

    "question": "If seller delays due date of sale agreement and buyer denies to buy property thereafter",
    "answer": "Dear clientBuyer's obligations: If the due date specified in the sale agreement has passed, and the seller has not fulfilled their obligation to vacate the property, the buyer may have grounds to cancel the agreement. The buyer cannot be forced to buy the property if the seller has not met the terms of the agreement.Seeking the return of advance amount: If the seller refuses to return the advance amount despite the buyer's request, the buyer may consider sending a legal notice through an attorney demanding the return of the advance payment. If the seller still refuses to return the money, the buyer may have to file a lawsuit to recover the advance amount.Legal action by the seller: The seller may potentially take legal action against the buyer if they believe the buyer breached the terms of the agreement. However, if the buyer can prove that the delay in completing the deal was due to the seller's inability to vacate the property, the buyer may have a valid defense against any legal action taken by the seller.Buyer's legal rights: The buyer may have legal rights to seek a refund of the advance payment if the seller has failed to fulfill their obligations as per the sale agreement. The specific legal remedies and options available to the buyer may depend on the laws of the jurisdiction where the property is located. It's crucial to consult with a local attorney who can advise you on the best course of action.Call recording as evidence: The call recording you mentioned may be considered as evidence in court to support the buyer's claim that the seller did not vacate the property within the specified time. However, the admissibility and weight given to this evidence will depend on the rules of evidence in your jurisdiction and the court's discretion.Seller's actions: If the seller proceeds to rent or sell the property to another buyer while the dispute over the advance payment is ongoing, it may complicate the legal proceedings. In such cases, the buyer's attorney may seek an injunction or a stay order from the court to prevent the seller from disposing of the property until the matter is resolved.Jurisdiction's decision: The decision of the court will depend on the specific facts and evidence presented by both parties. If the buyer can establish that the seller breached the terms of the agreement and failed to vacate the property within the specified time, the court may be more likely to rule in favor of the buyer, potentially ordering the return of the advance payment.These are general guidelines, and the outcome may vary based on the specific laws and circumstances of your case.

    "answer": "Failure to file a reply within the given time frame does not automatically result in an ex parte decision. An ex parte decision typically occurs when one party is absent or fails to participate in the proceedings. In your case, since the HUDA has not filed a reply, it may indicate a delay or oversight on their part. The court will likely take note of this and may grant additional time or take appropriate action to ensure a fair process. It's important to consult with your lawyer to understand the implications of the HUDA's lack of response and how it may affect the proceedings.The time it takes for the court to release the money in your favor can vary depending on various factors, including the court's workload, administrative procedures, and the efficiency of the legal system. Since both respondent number 1 and 2 have already provided written statements in support of releasing the amount to you, it strengthens your case.

These processes can help resolve the dispute without going to court, potentially saving time and costs.Report to labor authorities: If applicable, report the non-payment of salaries to the labor authorities or relevant government agency in your jurisdiction. They may be able to assist in resolving the dispute or provide guidance on further steps to take.Remember, labor laws vary by jurisdiction, so it's important to consult with a local employment lawyer who can provide advice based on the specific laws and regulations in your area.

In this case, IA 787, which was filed in the year 2022, has been dismissed by the court.An interlocutory application is a request or motion filed by one party during the course of a legal proceeding, seeking a specific order or direction from the court. It is a procedural step taken within the larger legal case.When an IA is dismissed, it means that the court has rejected the application and the relief sought by the party filing it. The court may have found the application to be without merit or not supported by sufficient evidence, or it may have determined that the relief requested is not appropriate in the given circumstances.The dismissal of an IA does not necessarily determine the final outcome of the overall divorce proceeding. It simply means that the specific application has been denied. The divorce case may still continue, and other issues and applications can be addressed separately.It is advisable to consult with your legal counsel or the concerned court for further clarification and to understand the impact of the dismissal on your particular case.

    "question": "Ways to Partition Co-ownership property between Brothers",
    "answer": "Dear client,While a partition suit is ongoing, it is generally advisable for co-owners to seek court permission before selling their share. Without court permission or without withdrawing the pending suit, selling their share may not be legally permissible.Sending a registered post to the registrar informing them about the attempted sale is a step to document the situation and raise awareness, but it may not automatically prevent the co-owners from selling their share.If the co-owners sell their share to a third party, and if that third party poses a threat or attempts to disturb your father's management of the property, it may be necessary to take legal action to protect your father's rights and interests. Your father may need to consult with a lawyer to explore available legal remedies.If your uncles are unwilling to sell their share to your father and insist on selling it to a third party, your father's options may be limited. However, he can consult with a lawyer to discuss the specifics of the case and explore any potential legal avenues or arguments that may be available to protect his interests.The rights and obligations of the parties involved, including your father's management of the property, would depend on the specific terms and conditions outlined in any existing agreements or court orders, as well as applicable property laws. A lawyer can provide advice on the rights and responsibilities of all parties involved and help protect your father's interests.To obtain an order of injunction to prevent your uncles from selling their share, your father would need to file a legal application in the court where the partition suit is pending. The application would need to outline the reasons and grounds for seeking the injunction. A lawyer can assist in preparing and filing the necessary application and presenting the case before the court.It is essential for your father to consult with an experienced lawyer who specializes in property and civil litigation. The lawyer can review the specific details of the case, provide tailored advice, and guide your father on the best course of action to protect his interests in the ongoing partition suit.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Ways to Partition Co-ownership property between Brothers",
    "answer": "Dear client,After a case settles, the court might take some administrative steps. These may include drafting a final decree based on the terms of the settlement, ensuring all necessary documentation is in order, and recording the agreement officially.Â It's generally safe to get a vakalat from your current advocate and involve a new lawyer to obtain the final decree. However, to avoid any issues, it's crucial to clearly communicate with both the current and new lawyer about your intentions and ensure a smooth transition. Your previous advocate should not cause harm to the decree, but having a new lawyer involved can ensure the process moves forward smoothly. If your current advocate refuses to cooperate or provide the necessary documents, you have the right to engage a new lawyer to assist in obtaining the final decree. Your new lawyer can represent you in this matter without the need for the previous advocate's vakalatnama. The final decree might have been drafted or is in the process of being prepared by the court after the settlement. However, access to the draft decree might require specific procedures or permission from the court. Normally, once the stamp duty is paid, the final decree can be issued. In some cases, individuals can directly request copies of court orders or decrees by applying to the court clerk's office or the relevant court authority. This might involve formal procedures and potentially some fees, but it's usually possible to obtain copies of court documents, including the final decree, by following the correct protocol.

    "answer": "Dear Sir,Cancelling a Gift:Section 126 provides two modes of revocation of Gift:-Revocation by mutual agreement:- A gift may be revoked upon the happening of an event which is not dependent on the donor where the donor and donee may agree. The revocation must be in express form and not of a wish or desire.Revocation by rescission:- The gift is a transfer of ownership without any exchange of money or any consideration which is made voluntarily. So, where there is no free consent of the parties, the gift can be revoked or if it is obtained by coercion, undue influence or fraud then the gift is voidable.CASEâS. Sarojini Amma v. Velayudhan Pillai Sreekumar2018 SCC OnLine SC 2200ââIn this case, the Supreme Court observed that there was no completed gift of the property which is in question to the respondent by the appellant and the appellant had right in cancelling the deed.âConclusion:TheTransfer of Property Act, 1882 lays down provisions relating to gift deed and cancellation of the gift deed. Any person who is the real owner of the property can transfer his or her property to anyone by way of gift. A gift deed actually says that any person who is the owner of the property can transfer the property to another person without any consideration. Similarly, there are provisions for cancellation of the gift deed as well.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, Bangalore6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar"

    "answer": "The proceeding for enforcement of the order under Section 128, therefore, cannot be assailed on the ground that the same would be barred by limitation as provided under the proviso to Section 125(3) of the Code.It may, therefore, be deduced that the scope of Section 125(3) and 128 of the Code being different and the first proviso to Section 125(3) creating an interdict only on issuance of warrant for recovery under Section 125(3), the said period of limitation of one year cannot be held to create a fetter on the right to claim enforcement under Section 128.One of the main issues that came up for the courtâs consideration was whether the limitation prescribed under the proviso to Section 125(3) doesnât create any bar on claiming arrears of maintenance or it limit the entitlement.Limitation of one year and section 128:âSection125(3) of the code would have to be held to be confined to the section which precedes it.âSection 128 of the Code provides for enforcement of the order of maintenance against the person against whom the order of maintenance has been made. The enforcement of the order of maintenance under Section 128 can only be made upon the liability being satisfied by making actual payment of the amount of maintenance, which is due. The entitlement to claim enforcement of the order of maintenance under Section 128 by seeking discharge of the liability as per terms of the order of maintenance granted under Section 125, therefore cannot be held to be extinguished in terms of the one year limitation prescribed under the first proviso to Section 125(3).T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

Having considered the said provision of the Code we do not find that the same creates a bar or in any way affects the entitlement of a claimant to arrears of maintenance. What the proviso contemplates is that the procedure for recovery maintenance under Section 125(3), namely, by construing the same to be a levy of a fine and the detention of the defaulter in custody would not be available to a claimant who had slept over his/her rights and has not approached the court within a period of one year commencing from the date on which the entitlement to receive maintenance has accrued.

    "question": "Resigning from LLP without LLP agreement",
    "answer": "Dear client,To proceed with the resignation procedure in your situation, you can follow these steps:Communicate your resignation: Notify the remaining LLP director(s) and other relevant parties, in writing, about your decision to resign as a director of the LLP. Clearly state your intention to disassociate yourself from the LLP and its operations.Check the LLP Agreement: Review the LLP Agreement to understand the provisions related to resignation and appointment of directors. If the agreement has not been signed or filed on the MCA portal, it may be easier to proceed with the resignation process.Resignation documentation: Prepare a formal resignation letter stating your intent to resign as a director of the LLP. Include the effective date of resignation. Sign the letter digitally, if possible, or scan a physical copy and send it to the other director(s) via email.Update records with the Registrar of Companies (RoC): As the LLP agreement has not been filed on the MCA portal, it may not be necessary to file any specific form for your resignation. However, you should inform the remaining LLP director(s) to update the LLP records with the RoC and remove your name as a director from the LLP. They may need to file the necessary forms, such as Form LLP-3 (for appointment, cessation, or change in designation of partners), to reflect the changes in the LLP.Update other authorities: Notify other relevant authorities, such as the tax authorities, banks, and any other government departments, about your resignation and provide them with the updated LLP details, removing your name as a director.It is strongly advised to consult with a professional, such as a qualified chartered accountant or company secretary, who can guide you through the specific requirements and procedures based on the laws and regulations applicable in your jurisdiction.Please note that this is general information and should not be considered as legal advice.

    "answer": "1. After due date has passed away can the seller force the buyer to buy the property even though due date passed away due to his tenants delaying to vacate.yes the seller can require your brother to purchase. time was never an essence of the contract as the completion of the sale was predicated on the tenants vacating the property. there is a delay of only 5 days and so no heavens would fall loose if the sale could not be completed on 15.10.21. Had there been an unconscionsenable delay then your brother would have been justified to refuse to complete the sale and seek refund of his advance2. What should a buyer do if the seller denies to return his advance amount given at time of sale agreement.file a suit and prove in the court that the purchaser is entitled to refund3. Can the seller take legal action against buyer and force the buyer to buy his property even though the deal is delayed due to negligence of seller(due to his tenants late vacating property).yes the seller can, the delay in vacating of the property by his tenants notwithstanding4. What legal rights does the buyer have in this case and how does he get his advance payment back from seller.buyer has to show and prove what legal injury did he suffer due to the alleged delay. buyer has to prove this in a suit to be filed by him against seller for refund of money5. There was no clause mentioning tenants staying in the property at time so sale agreement. But my brother has call recording with tenant of seller on 15 oct 2021 stating that he still has not vacated the property by the end of 15 oct 2021. Can this be used as an evidence.do you mean to say that your brother was totally unaware about there being tenants on the property? did he not take even an inspection considering that this was his first house purchase? this does not sound convincing at all!6. What if the seller doesnât return buyer advance money and put his property on rent or sell it to another buyer.seller has the right to forfeit the advance because buyer is backing out of the deal. if you want the refund you will have to file a suit.7. Whose side will jurisdiction take in this matter when the buyer is suffering loss of his advance money being head by the seller.Can still the jurisdiction force the buyer to buy the property even though now the buyer has no interest to buy it, but this sale deed got cancelled due to delay by the fault of seller.that the court will decide. cannot be predicted.Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

What if in the court of law the seller says that he is ready to sell the property, than can the buyer be forced to buy the property in case buyer fails to prove that seller delayed the property deal or if seller says that it was a minor delay of 5 days to vacate the property.I mean if neither parties can prove each other fault than on what grounds does court of law decide.it all depends on the court determining whether time was of the essence of the contract or not2. Can the seller enjoy fruit of renting his property till litigation against him is going on for returning back advance money to buyer in court of law.Or can buyer get stay order from court so that seller cannot put his property on rent or sell it to someone else till buyer gets back his advance money with interest.buyer backs out of the deal. then he has problem with the seller selling his property to someone else and also against renting of the property. no court will grant such a stay to the buyer. that would amount to miscarriage of justice.3. The sale agreement clause stated that buyer gets double the amount of advance money in case seller doesnât sell the property within stipulated time.

    "question": "If seller delays due date of sale agreement and buyer denies to buy property thereafter",
    "answer": "Dear clientBuyer's obligations: If the due date specified in the sale agreement has passed, and the seller has not fulfilled their obligation to vacate the property, the buyer may have grounds to cancel the agreement. The buyer cannot be forced to buy the property if the seller has not met the terms of the agreement.Seeking the return of advance amount: If the seller refuses to return the advance amount despite the buyer's request, the buyer may consider sending a legal notice through an attorney demanding the return of the advance payment. If the seller still refuses to return the money, the buyer may have to file a lawsuit to recover the advance amount.Legal action by the seller: The seller may potentially take legal action against the buyer if they believe the buyer breached the terms of the agreement. However, if the buyer can prove that the delay in completing the deal was due to the seller's inability to vacate the property, the buyer may have a valid defense against any legal action taken by the seller.Buyer's legal rights: The buyer may have legal rights to seek a refund of the advance payment if the seller has failed to fulfill their obligations as per the sale agreement. The specific legal remedies and options available to the buyer may depend on the laws of the jurisdiction where the property is located. It's crucial to consult with a local attorney who can advise you on the best course of action.Call recording as evidence: The call recording you mentioned may be considered as evidence in court to support the buyer's claim that the seller did not vacate the property within the specified time. However, the admissibility and weight given to this evidence will depend on the rules of evidence in your jurisdiction and the court's discretion.Seller's actions: If the seller proceeds to rent or sell the property to another buyer while the dispute over the advance payment is ongoing, it may complicate the legal proceedings. In such cases, the buyer's attorney may seek an injunction or a stay order from the court to prevent the seller from disposing of the property until the matter is resolved.Jurisdiction's decision: The decision of the court will depend on the specific facts and evidence presented by both parties. If the buyer can establish that the seller breached the terms of the agreement and failed to vacate the property within the specified time, the court may be more likely to rule in favor of the buyer, potentially ordering the return of the advance payment.These are general guidelines, and the outcome may vary based on the specific laws and circumstances of your case. It's essential to consult with a qualified attorney who can evaluate your situation and provide you with accurate legal advice.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, I am not a lawyer, and the specific laws and regulations regarding unregistered trusts can vary depending on the jurisdiction.In general, a registered trust holds more legal weight and credibility compared to an unregistered trust. An unregistered trust may face challenges in asserting its rights and carrying out certain activities, especially if it involves property transactions or commercial use.In your case, if the unregistered trust is not willing to use the property as a function hall as you desire, it would be advisable to consult with a lawyer who specializes in property and trust law. They can review the specific details of the trust and the property ownership, and provide advice on the legal options available to you.The lawyer may assess whether the trust has the legal authority to use the property for commercial purposes or whether it is limited to certain specified purposes. They can also guide you on potential legal remedies, such as seeking an injunction or legal action to protect your rights and interests, or exploring options for resolving the dispute through negotiation or mediation.It's important to consult with a qualified legal professional who can provide advice based on the specific laws and regulations applicable in your jurisdiction and the details of your case.

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. Hon'ble Supreme Court has elaborately dealt with this subject on several occasions and has issued comprehensive directions to deal such situations. It is to be followed in such cases by the municipal authorities and in case there is any violation of the said directions, the affected person is at liberty to take up the matter before courts.Better would be in your case to ask for interim direction of stay from Consumer Forum and legally speaking judges in Consumer Forum are aware of such tactics of builder and they usually pass the decision in favour of consumers. Even if at all Writ Petition is filed, then the builder would certainly challenge the order in Hon'ble Supreme Court. Writ Petition cannot be filed against private entity. If your builder is getting some funding from government then only Writ Petition would be maintainable.Â Article 12 ofConstitution of Indiasays that \"The 'State' Includes the Government and Parliament of India and the Government and the Legislature of each of the States and all local and other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India.\" Therefore, Writ Petition can only be filed against State.In Sunil Batra v. Delhi Administration, the Supreme Court held that the right to life included the right to lead a healthy life so as to enjoy all faculties of the human body in their prime conditions. It would even include the right to protection of a person's tradition, culture, heritage and all that gives meaning to a man's life. It includes the right to live in peace, to sleep in peace and the right to repose and health.My team can help you in drafting the petition and legal representation if required.

This documentation will be important for any legal proceedings or complaints you may initiate.Contact the police: If you believe that the demolition is unlawful or unauthorized, you can consider filing a police complaint.

    "question": "Can I file and complete the mutual consent divorce while being in the USA?",
    "answer": "When both parties were in India & married in India according to any of the Indian forms of marriage then the dissolution of such a marriage should be done through the Indian Family Court of the competent jurisdiction where the marriage took place, where either of the parties usually reside, or where both parties last resided together.Who wish to take advantage of Indian laws and the legal system to avoid facing up to any foreign judicial system. Indian Marriage solemnized in India according to Indian matrimonial laws, then the Indian courts will have territorial jurisdiction to hear & decide matters relating to this marriage & the foreign court's decision may or may not be acceptable in India; hence, the best course is to get this marriage dissolved according to the Indian court's decree of divorce.Procedure in Mutual DivorceIn all, there are two court appearances in a mutual divorceFirst A joint petition signed by both parties is filed in court. Secondly, in the first motion, the statements of both parties are recorded and then signed on paper before the Honourable Court.Thirdly The 6 month period is given for reconciliation, (the honourable court gives a chance to the couple to change their mind)Fourthly, 6 months after the first motion or at the end of the reconciliation period if both parties still don't agree to come together. Then the parties may appear for the second motion for the final hearing.A divorce decree will be granted as the Honourable court may deem fit.Formalities to be complied with(a) A petition is to be presented jointly by the parties to the marriage.(b) The parties have been living separately for a period not less than one year. It is doubtful whether it was intended by the legislators that the parties have lived separately by mutual consent or by force of circumstances or situations.But it does not seem necessary for the court to go into that matter provided the condition of separate living under the same roof of the matrimonial home or in separate residence by the parties is satisfied. Unless the consent of any of the parties to such a petition is vitiated by coercion, fraud or undue influence, the court ought not to travel beyond the statutory condition of its jurisdiction.(c) The parties have failed for any reason whatsoever to live together. In other words, no reconciliation or adjustment is possible between them.(d) The parties have freely consented to the agreement of dissolution of marriage.(e) The parties are at liberty to withdraw the petition. It seems that the petition may be withdrawn even at the instance of one party in the course of six months from the date of presentation of the petition. But when a joint motion is taken by the parties after the lapse of six months but before the expiration of eighteen months from the date of presentation of the petition for making an inquiry, the unilateral right of a party to withdraw the petition appears to be barred. But in Sureshta Devi v Om Prakash it has been held that a party to a petition fordivorce by mutual consentcan unilaterally withdraw his or her consent.(f) The court must be satisfied as to the averments in the petition after making an inquiry and after hearing the parties which are initiated by a joint motion of the expiry of six months from the presentation of the petition. The expression \"after hearing the parties\" appearing in sub-section (2) of Section 28 of the Act does not require the presence of the parties before the court. Affidavit evidence is sufficient for this purpose by virtue of Section 40 of the Act which attracts the Â­ Code of Civil Procedure 1908 and which provides in Order 19 for proof of any point by affidavits.In a mutual divorce, you choose an advocate and ask him to prepare a mutual divorce petition and send it to you through email. Signed the petition and sent it by courier after putting your signature on it and having it attested by a notary in the US. Ask your wife to put the signature in the same, and then he can file it before the family court at Ernakulam. After six months, the case will call, you may attend, and on the same day, the case will consider, your application and allow.If both parties are in US the same time you can also file divorce in US court .Generally amutual consent divorcegranted by foreign Court is considered as valid, legal and binding in Indian Courts by virtue of section 13 and 14 of Code of Civil Procedure and also on account of comity of Nations. Such decree of divorce granted by foreign Courts need not to be validated in Indian Courts. However, as a matter of abundant precaution, one can approach to the Indian Court for declaring that divorce is valid and binding.Ajay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

    "answer": "The Office of Enforcement Operations and the foreign country make the final determination on a Treaty Transfer. Several factors will determine whether or not an inmate is eligible, examples include:The inmate must be a citizen or national of a foreign country having a treaty relationship with the United States. In the instance of inmates who claim dual citizenship, it will be the responsibility of the inmate to provide proof of citizenship or nationality for the foreign country.The inmate must not be committed for a military offense.The inmate must not be sentenced to the death penalty.The inmate must not be committed for a political offense.The inmate must have at least six months remaining on his current sentence at the time of his request. (Certain countries may require a longer period).The inmate will be scheduled for a verification of consent hearing before a magistrate judge. He either agrees to transfer or can at this time, decline transfer. Once an inmate agrees to transfer, the foreign country is notified and a schedule for the inmate's transfer is established.An inmate must be approved by both the US and the foreign country in order for an inmate to be transferred to his or her country of citizenship.From the above it can be noted that you being a Bangladeshi citizen, not eligible for transfer to India as an inmate.As far as Asylum is concerned:India does not have any specific legislation dealing with the problem of refugees and asylum seekers. At present, refugees were treated as par with the foreigners and all laws applied to foreigners were also applied to them.An asylum seeker is a person who has left their country and is seeking protection from persecution and serious human rights violations in another country, but who hasn't yet been legally recognized as a refugee and is waiting to receive a decision on their asylum claim. Seeking asylum is a human right.However in your case the chances for getting asylum in India is very bleakÂ  specially on the basis of the fact that you married an US Citizen.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "- As per Muslim Law, the right of inheritance of property comes only after the death of a person.- Further, any child born into a Muslim family does not get his right to property on his birth.- Further, distribution of property can be made in two ways, firstly per capita or per strip distribution.- Per â Capita distribution method is used in the Sunni law, and according to this method, the estate left over by the ancestors gets equally distributed among the heirs. Therefore, the share of each person depends on the number of heirs.- Per strip distribution method is used in the Shia law, and according to this method, the property gets distributed among the heirs according to the strip they belong to, and hence the quantum of their inheritance also depends upon the branch and the number of persons that belong to the branch.-Â Further, there is no distinction between the right of men and women; each has right over the said property.- However, a female will get half of the male share.- Hence, out of 100% share, share of step mother will be 12.5%. and the remaining 87.5% will be distributed between sons and daughters.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Distribution of property share among sister brother and mother as per Muslim rules",
    "answer": "Dear client,inheritance laws can vary depending on the specific interpretation and application of Islamic law in different jurisdictions. It is important to consult with a qualified lawyer who specializes in Islamic inheritance law to get accurate advice tailored to your specific situation.In Islamic law, the distribution of property among heirs is governed by the rules of inheritance outlined in the Quran. The shares of the heirs are determined based on specific rules and principles. Generally, the distribution of shares in the case of a deceased person leaving behind children and a spouse (including a stepmother) would be as follows:The surviving spouse is entitled to a share of the deceased's estate. The specific share depends on various factors, such as whether the deceased has children or parents. In some cases, the spouse may be entitled to 1/8th or 1/4th of the estate, but this can vary.The children, including both sons and daughters, are entitled to a share of the remaining estate. The shares of the children can vary depending on factors such as the presence of other heirs. In some cases, sons may receive double the share of daughters, but again, this can vary depending on the specific circumstances.It's important to note that the specific shares and distribution can be influenced by various factors, including the presence of other heirs, debts, and the specific laws of the jurisdiction you are in. Additionally, it's common for families to agree on alternative distribution arrangements through wills or mutual agreements.To ensure a fair and proper distribution of the estate among all the heirs, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer who specializes in Islamic inheritance law. They will be able to assess your specific situation, take into account the relevant laws and principles, and guide you through the process of distributing the property among all the heirs according to Islamic law and the laws of your jurisdiction.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Power of attorney for selling property with joint title",
    "answer": "Dear client,The cost and process of registering a Power of Attorney (PoA) can vary based on the location and the specific requirements of the authorities involved. Generally, when a PoA is executed in favor of a blood relative, the stamp duty and registration charges may be lower compared to when it is executed in favor of a non-blood relative. However, the exact charges and requirements can vary between different states in India. It is advisable to consult with a lawyer or visit the appropriate registrar office to get accurate information about the specific charges and process in the PCMC jurisdiction.If you choose the option for either of you to travel to India and execute separate PoAs, the process would involve drafting the PoA document, getting it notarized, and then registering it with the appropriate registrar office. The PoA can be registered in the city where the property is located (Pune in your case) or any other place in Maharashtra. The time required for registration can vary, but it is typically a matter of a few days to a couple of weeks. The registration process may involve submitting the necessary documents, paying the registration fees, and appearing before the registrar for the formalities. It is advisable to consult with a lawyer to understand the specific requirements and timeline for registering the PoA in your situation.If you both give a PoA to your respective fathers, it would be considered a valid arrangement within the blood relationship. The PoA documents can be prepared separately, with one PoA giving power to your father and another PoA giving power to your wife's father. It is important to clearly mention the scope of the power given, including the authority to sell the property. However, it is recommended to consult with a lawyer to ensure that the PoA documents are drafted correctly and comply with the relevant laws and requirements.Another option to consider is engaging the services of a trusted attorney or a reliable power of attorney agent in India who can act on your behalf for the sale of the property. This option may require careful selection and due diligence to ensure that the person or entity appointed as the power of attorney agent can represent your interests effectively.Regarding the validity of the PoA, it can vary based on the terms specified in the document. It is advisable to consult with a lawyer to ensure that the PoA is valid for the necessary duration and covers the period required for completing the property sale process.Please note that the information provided here is general in nature, and it's crucial to consult with a qualified attorney who can provide you with advice specific to your case. They will be able to review the details of your situation, consider the relevant laws and regulations, and guide you through the process of executing and registering the PoA and selling the property in India.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If both suits involve the same cause of action and the same parties, the second suit may be stayed or consolidated with the first suit under Section 10 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC). You should discuss this matter with your lawyer, who can file the appropriate application to the court to request the stay of the second suit.The granting of a temporary injunction depends on various factors, including the merits of the case and the balance of convenience. If the other party can prove that there is a possibility of irreparable harm or loss if the injunction is not granted, they may be successful in obtaining temporary injunction relief. However, your lawyer will be in a better position to assess the strength of their argument and provide guidance on how to respond effectively.Possession can be established in various ways, and it is not always necessary for someone to be physically staying inside the house. However, having someone present at the property, even as a watchman or caretaker, can help demonstrate that you are in possession and taking steps to protect your property. You should discuss the best approach with your lawyer, taking into account the specific circumstances and risks involved.Blocking the front gate with a car may provide an additional physical barrier, but it's important to consider the legal implications and potential consequences. Blocking the gate could be seen as an obstruction, and it may not be advisable without proper legal authorization.

    "answer": "In general, when dealing with a criminal case, it's important to consider the potential consequences of any agreements or statements made to the police or other parties involved. If you agree to a settlement with the new buyers and provide a written statement indicating that you will withdraw the 156(3) case, it may have implications for your ability to pursue a criminal case in the future.By agreeing to a settlement, you may be effectively acknowledging that a resolution has been reached, and it could be difficult to later argue for the registration of an FIR if the new buyers fail to fulfill their part of the agreement. It may weaken your position in claiming that a criminal offense has taken place.Before making any decisions or providing any written statements, it is highly recommended to consult with your lawyer. They can review the specifics of your case, the proposed settlement, and provide advice on the potential consequences and risks involved.

    "answer": "First set of queries:The presumption of summons being served may vary depending on the specific rules and procedures followed by the civil court in your jurisdiction. It's best to consult with your lawyer regarding this matter to understand the local rules and how they apply to your case.Again, the treatment of court vacation in relation to the filing of a written statement can depend on local rules and procedures. Typically, court vacations are excluded from the calculation of time limits. It's essential to consult with your lawyer to understand the specific rules applicable to your case.If you have already requested the relief of permanent injunction in your own suit, it may not be necessary to file a counterclaim for the same relief in their suit. Your lawyer can guide you on whether it's appropriate to include it as a counterclaim or if it should be pursued solely in your own suit.Whether to ask for consolidation of the suits or file a rejection of plaint application is a strategic decision that should be discussed with your lawyer. They will be familiar with the specific circumstances of your case and can advise you on the best course of action.Falsely stating facts in a suit can be a serious matter, but the decision to initiate a criminal case would depend on the specific laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. It's advisable to consult with your lawyer and possibly involve the police or appropriate authorities if there is evidence of fraudulent statements.Second set of queries:Once the FIR is lodged, it would be best to consult with your lawyer regarding the appropriate course of action. They can guide you on whether to inform the magistrate or file an application to withdraw the 156(3) application.The contents of the FIR should ideally include all relevant details and allegations. If you have suspicions or additional information that you believe is relevant, it's generally advisable to include them in your statement. Your lawyer can provide more specific guidance based on the laws and practices in your jurisdiction.Contacting the IO to provide your statement or inquire about the progress of the investigation may be a reasonable step. However, it's important to follow the guidance of your lawyer, who can advise you on the best way to proceed in your specific case.The status of arrests and the appropriate follow-up procedures can vary depending on the laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. Your lawyer would be the best person to guide you on the appropriate actions and who can provide updates on the progress of the case.Third set of queries:If you withdraw the 156(3) application after the FIR is registered, it may be possible to file a subsequent 156(3) application if you are dissatisfied with the police investigation. However, the availability and maintainability of such an application would depend on the specific laws and procedures in your jurisdiction.

    "question": "Registered plot vs token money issue",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. As you know that once a home purchase deal is finalised between a buyer and a seller, a formal process is initiated to conclude it legally. This starts with the buyer paying the seller a small portion of the transaction value, to show his genuine intentions. This payment, in Indian real estate parlance, is commonly known as the âtoken amountâ.There are bright chances of legal disputes in your situation. However, you can send a legal notice to the builder to comply with the terms you agreed upon and to claim compensation. Any of the parties cannot back off from settled terms of the contract.Â The courts have unqualified jurisdiction to award compensation in case of breach of contract, but the compensation must be reasonable. The aggrieved party is entitled to receive compensation from the defaulting party.All legal action can only be taken once notice has been served upon the entity or individual you wish to take to court. It is this process that legalises bringing a matter to court. The intimation sent is known as a legal draft. A legal notice is, therefore, a formal communication to a person or an entity, informing the other party of your intention to undertake legal proceedings against them.This notice, when sent, conveys your intention before the legal proceedings and thus, makes the party aware of your grievance. Many times, a legal notice served will bring the other party to heel, and the problem is often resolved out of court, well before it goes to trial, with fruitful discussions on both sides.However, if the other party is still unheeding the grievance, one can always start the court proceedings after the prescribed interval as stated by law. The bottom line is that legal notice can serve as a point of reference to embark upon negotiations between two parties and save both the time, effort, and money that is usually spent in court cases.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear client,Based on the information you provided, it appears that the builder may have engaged in fraudulent or unethical behavior by accepting token money for the same plot of land from another buyer before selling it to you. This raises concerns about the builder's actions and potentially indicates a breach of trust.In this situation, there could be potential legal disputes between you, the other buyer, and the builder. The specific legal remedies available to you may depend on the laws and regulations governing property transactions in your jurisdiction, as well as the terms and conditions of your agreement with the builder.Here are some precautionary steps you may consider taking:Gather and organize all relevant documents: Collect and secure all documents related to your transaction, such as the sales deed, payment receipts, correspondence with the builder, and any other supporting evidence. These documents will be important if legal action becomes necessary.Consult with a property lawyer: Seek advice from a qualified property lawyer in your jurisdiction who can review your documents, understand the specific laws that apply to your case, and provide you with legal guidance tailored to your situation.Communicate with the builder in writing: It's essential to maintain clear and documented communication with the builder. Send a written notice to the builder, clearly stating your position that you do not wish to sell the plot and reminding them of your legal rights as the registered owner.Consider filing a complaint: If you believe that the builder has engaged in fraudulent or unethical practices, you may consider filing a complaint with the appropriate regulatory authorities or consumer protection agencies in your jurisdiction. A legal professional can advise you on the best course of action in this regard.Explore negotiation or mediation: Depending on the circumstances, you may wish to explore the possibility of resolving the dispute through negotiation or mediation. This could involve discussions with the other buyer, the builder, or both, facilitated by a neutral third party. However, the feasibility of this option will depend on the willingness of all parties involved to engage in such a process.Remember, the information provided here is general in nature, and it's important to consult with a qualified property lawyer who can provide you with advice tailored to your specific situation. They will be able to assess the details of your case and guide you through the legal process, if necessary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Review the society's bylaws or governing documents to determine the extent of the seller's responsibility for maintenance dues.Examine the sale agreement: Carefully review the sale agreement between you and the seller. It should outline the terms and conditions agreed upon, including any provisions regarding maintenance dues and responsibilities. If the verbal agreement to have the seller pay the maintenance dues is not documented in the sale agreement, it may be challenging to enforce.Consult a real estate attorney: Seek legal advice from a real estate attorney who can review the relevant documents, including the sale agreement and the society's bylaws. They will be able to provide guidance on the legal options available to you and help determine the best course of action.Negotiate with the seller: Try to communicate and negotiate with the seller to find a mutually acceptable solution. If there was a verbal agreement between you and the seller, you may consider seeking mediation or alternative dispute resolution to resolve the issue.Engage the society: Discuss the situation with the society's management committee or office bearers. Provide them with all the relevant documentation and seek clarification on their policies and procedures for maintenance dues. They may be able to provide guidance or assistance in resolving the matter.Remember, the specific laws and regulations governing maintenance dues and obligations may vary depending on your jurisdiction and the rules of the society or homeowners association. It's crucial to consult with a qualified attorney who can provide advice based on the applicable laws and your specific circumstances.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Section 30 of Land Acquisition Act",
    "answer": "Failure to file a reply within the given time frame does not automatically result in an ex parte decision. An ex parte decision typically occurs when one party is absent or fails to participate in the proceedings. In your case, since the HUDA has not filed a reply, it may indicate a delay or oversight on their part. The court will likely take note of this and may grant additional time or take appropriate action to ensure a fair process. It's important to consult with your lawyer to understand the implications of the HUDA's lack of response and how it may affect the proceedings.The time it takes for the court to release the money in your favor can vary depending on various factors, including the court's workload, administrative procedures, and the efficiency of the legal system. Since both respondent number 1 and 2 have already provided written statements in support of releasing the amount to you, it strengthens your case. However, the actual timeline for the court's decision may depend on the specific circumstances of your case and the processes followed by the court.Saksham JainAdvocate, Hapur11 AnswersTalk to Advocate Saksham Jain"

    "question": "Can part payment of cheque and DD be accepted during Sale",
    "answer": "Dear client,Accepting payment in the form of cheques and demand drafts (DDs) is a common practice in real estate transactions. However, it's important to ensure that you follow the applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.Regarding the acceptance of 70 lakhs in cheque and DD, it seems permissible based on the clause you provided from the Agreement to Sale (ATS). The ATS states that the balance payment can be made by D.D/ CHEQUE/RTGS.In such cases, it is generally advisable to follow these steps:Deposit the cheque into your bank account and ensure that it is cleared before proceeding with the transaction. This helps ensure that the funds are available and reduces the risk of bounced or dishonored cheques.Verify the authenticity and validity of the demand draft before accepting it. Ensure that it is issued by a reputable bank and contains accurate information.Retain records of the cheque deposit, clearance, and the demand draft for your reference and documentation purposes.To be certain about the legal requirements and procedures specific to your jurisdiction, it's important to consult with a qualified legal professional who specializes in real estate law. They will be able to review the terms of the agreement, provide guidance on accepting payments, and ensure compliance with local laws and regulations.Note that real estate laws and regulations can vary depending on your jurisdiction, so it's essential to seek specific legal advice tailored to your situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "The Office of Enforcement Operations and the foreign country make the final determination on a Treaty Transfer. Several factors will determine whether or not an inmate is eligible, examples include:The inmate must be a citizen or national of a foreign country having a treaty relationship with the United States. In the instance of inmates who claim dual citizenship, it will be the responsibility of the inmate to provide proof of citizenship or nationality for the foreign country.The inmate must not be committed for a military offense.The inmate must not be sentenced to the death penalty.The inmate must not be committed for a political offense.The inmate must have at least six months remaining on his current sentence at the time of his request. (Certain countries may require a longer period).The inmate will be scheduled for a verification of consent hearing before a magistrate judge. He either agrees to transfer or can at this time, decline transfer. Once an inmate agrees to transfer, the foreign country is notified and a schedule for the inmate's transfer is established.An inmate must be approved by both the US and the foreign country in order for an inmate to be transferred to his or her country of citizenship.From the above it can be noted that you being a Bangladeshi citizen, not eligible for transfer to India as an inmate.As far as Asylum is concerned:India does not have any specific legislation dealing with the problem of refugees and asylum seekers. At present, refugees were treated as par with the foreigners and all laws applied to foreigners were also applied to them.An asylum seeker is a person who has left their country and is seeking protection from persecution and serious human rights violations in another country, but who hasn't yet been legally recognized as a refugee and is waiting to receive a decision on their asylum claim. Seeking asylum is a human right.However in your case the chances for getting asylum in India is very bleakÂ  specially on the basis of the fact that you married an US Citizen.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear client,In this situation, it seems that you and a group of residents are willing to form a separate committee to address the pending tasks and development work in the society. Here are some suggestions for better execution and a legal approach:Separate Bank Account: You can approach the society association and request permission to open a separate bank account specifically for collecting contributions towards the pending tasks. It should be in the name of the society, and the account should be operated transparently and responsibly.Independence of the Committee: When forming the committee, it would be beneficial to draft clear guidelines or bylaws that outline its purpose, powers, and responsibilities. This will help ensure the committee's independence and minimize the need for frequent approval from the society association.Agreement and Responsibility: It is advisable to have a written agreement or memorandum of understanding among the committee members, clearly stating their responsibilities and obligations. This can include provisions for individual liability in case of any deviations or financial mismanagement.Project Timeline: As you mentioned that the tasks will take approximately three years to complete, it is essential to have a well-defined project timeline and periodically update the residents on the progress.Collaboration with Builder and Society Association: It is positive that the builder is supporting your initiative. It may also be beneficial to maintain open communication with the society association to avoid any conflicts or misunderstandings. Seek their cooperation and support, emphasizing that the goal is to enhance the society's amenities for the benefit of all residents.It's important to note that the specific legal requirements and procedures may vary depending on the laws and regulations applicable to your location. Therefore, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer who specializes in property law or cooperative housing society matters.

    "answer": "If you do not want to continue with your employment then you should have tendered resignation instead of abstaining from work without any valid reason.If the management is not considering your request to post you in a place near your home town, you can always send yor resignation letter even by post.You have signed the employment bond, employment offer letter accepting the terms and conditions of employment including three months notice period to resign, if you do not comply with the conditions, then it can be termed as breach of conditions of employment.The employment bonds are agreements between employee and employer where it contains the terms and conditions of employment. The employment bond contains a clause whichrequires the employee to serve the employer compulsorily for a specific period of time or else refund the amount specified as bond value.n India,Â employment bonds are considered 'legal' when a reasonable penalty is enforced in case of violation. Since 'reasonable penalty' is subject to interpretation, the Indian Judiciary preserves the employee's interest over that of the employer.Should the Employee fail to pay the amount a suit may be filed in the Court of appropriate jurisdiction to recover the amount dueAn employment contract holds admissibility in a court of law as evidence in a trial. This implies that for an employment contract to be legally valid, it must be legitimately drafted. Any agreements that are illegal or against the law are considered null and void.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

Employers are required to provide a safe and non-discriminatory work environment, adhere to reasonable working hours, and follow relevant labor regulations.Regarding your concerns:Transfer and Posting: Employers generally have the right to transfer employees to different locations as per the terms and conditions of employment. However, the frequency and distance of transfers may need to be reasonable and in line with the employment contract and local labor laws. It's advisable to review your employment contract and consult with an employment lawyer to understand the specific provisions related to transfers.Work Environment: Employers are expected to provide a safe and healthy work environment for their employees. If you believe that the workplace is toxic or if there are disciplinary rules that are unreasonable or violate labor laws, you may have grounds for complaint. It's recommended to document any incidents or issues and consult with an employment lawyer to discuss potential actions.Bond and Notice Period: The enforceability of bonds and notice periods can vary based on the specific terms and conditions of the agreement, as well as local labor laws. Some courts in India have held that bond clauses are illegal, while others have upheld their validity in certain circumstances. It's important to review the terms of the bond and notice period, consult with an employment lawyer, and understand the legal implications before making any decisions.Please note that this information is general in nature and may not apply specifically to your situation.

    "question": "Heir certificate/process to sell property in India",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. You know that as per Section 2(h) of Indian Succession Act, 1925 provides that Will means the legal declaration of the intention of a person with respect to his property, which he desires to take effect after his death Will has been defined in Corpus Juris Secundum as A âWillâ is the legal declaration of a manâs intention, which he wills to be performed after his death, or an instrument by which a person makes a disposition of his property to take effect after his death.You can apply for probate of Will initially. The word âProbateâ means to prove or validate something. It is a procedure for court approval of the Will as the valid and last Will of the deceased testator. According to the Indian Succession Act, 1925, âProbate of will, when granted establishes the will from the death of the testator, and renders valid all intermediate acts of the executor as such.âIt means that when a Will is probated, it gets officially certified with a seal of the court and provides the authority to the executor to appropriately distribute the assets of deceased testator and also to pay off bills and creditors from that estate.The procedure for probating of will is divided into four simple stages:1. The first step involves making of application to the District Judge through a probate petition which must be duly signed and verified by or on behalf of the applicant. The probate petition should be in a prescribed format under Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.2. The second step is to send the application to the High Court, under whose jurisdiction property falls. Then a lawyer shall prepare the application, in some cases lower court can also accept the application.3. One needs to submit certain documents that can verify the genuineness of the will, death certificate and other documents. These will prove that the testator had free will.4. When the court receives the application, it verifies all the details. Then it invites the nearest kin of the deceased for claiming the probate. Finally, it showcases the invitation letter at prominent places for invitation of any objection. If after 30 days, the court files no objection, the issuance of the probate is complete.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "question": "Heir certificate/process to sell property in India",
    "answer": "If your father had written Will in USA which would include the properties left behind in the USA also then you can get the Will probated by a court of USA.A will can be executed anywhere without any restrictions subject to the due procedure of the law of the country.With reference to wills executed outside India, in respect of which a foreign probate has also been obtained, the requirement of Section 213(1) of the Indian SuccessionÂ  Act , 1925, would be satisfied by obtaining under Section 228(1) of the Act an ancillary probate. Otherwise, the procedural requirement of the lex fori enacted under Section 213(1) of the Act may not be satisfied and if it is only with a view to enable parties claiming under a will executed outside India to make claims with reference to properties situated in India, the procedure under Section 228 of the Act has been prescribed.In India, Wills made in other jurisdiction are not automatically enforceable.Under the Act, an ancillary probate can be granted to authenticate a foreign will. A foreign will, once proved and deposited in a court of competent jurisdiction, or a properly authenticated copy of the will and letters of administration will be recognised by the Indian Courts. Otherwise, if the Court deems fit then it will take the evidence into account and will examine the petitioner upon oath to ensure the veracity of the will.An executor or legatee cannot claim their right under the will unless probate or letters of administration of the will are obtained.If the Will was written in India and if the properties are situated in a place other than Bombay or Madras or Calcutta, probate would not be necessary, but you can get the details of the family tree or surviving members of the family of deceased duly attested by a notary of that country, in order to succeed to the estates, based on which all the beneficiaries should apply jointly for mutation of the property to their name by enclosing the copy of the Will (probate of Will if already obtained).Once the property is mutated then all the shareholders can sell the property jointly by executing a joint sale deed in favor of the prospective buyer."

    "question": "Alimony",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard.In case of Rajnesh v. Neha & Anr, Hon'ble Supreme Court stated that there can be no straitjacket formula for fixing such a quantum. Stressing upon the importance of maintaining a careful and just balance between all relevant factors, the Court held that the maintenance amount awarded must be reasonable and realistic. It directed the Courts to take cognizance of the fact that maintenance awarded to the applicant should neither be so extravagant that it becomes oppressive and unbearable for the respondent, nor should it be so meagre that it drives the applicant to penury.In addition to the statutory guidance, the Court laid down the following indicative factors to be considered before determining the quantum of maintenance (a) the status of the parties; (b) reasonable needs of the wife and dependent children; (c) whether the applicant is educated and professionally qualified; (d) whether the applicant has any independent source of income; (e) whether the income is sufficient to enable the applicant to maintain the same standard of living as she was accustomed to in her matrimonial home; (f) whether the applicant was employed prior to her marriage; (g) whether she was working during the subsistence of the marriage; (h) whether the wife was required to sacrifice her employment opportunities for nurturing the family, child rearing, and looking after adult members of the family; (i) reasonable costs of litigation for a non-working wife.Apart from the aforesaid factors set out hereinabove, the Court laid down certain additional factors for determining the quantum of maintenance payable. These are inter alia as follows:Age and employment of parties;Duration of marriage;Maintenance of minor children; andSerious disability or ill health of a spouse, child /children from the marriage or dependent relative who require constant care and recurrent expenditure, would also be a relevant consideration while quantifying maintenance.The aforesaid factors are not exhaustive, and the concerned Court can exercise its discretion to consider any other factor/s, which may be necessary or relevant in the facts and circumstances of a particular case.Further, in case of Manokaran vs. M.Devaki where it was held that Grant of maintenance to the wife working and earning more that her husband is improper and the same cannot be said that the wife was not having sufficient independent income.She can demand alimony, however, depending on the facts and circumstances you mentioned it can be denied if defended properly. It can be claimed for child as well. Maintenance amount can be reduced if passed against him in appellate Courts since she is presently working and she will have to submit an affidavit in Court about her present financial status.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete facts.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

Whether alimony would be awarded and the specific amount would depend on the specific laws and regulations of your jurisdiction, as well as the unique circumstances of the case.When it comes to child support, the primary concern is the best interests of the child. The financial resources and ability of both parents to contribute to the child's upbringing are taken into consideration. It's possible that the daughter-in-law could seek child support from your sister's son for the care and upbringing of their child.Given the complexity of your situation and the potential legal implications, it's highly recommended to seek professional legal advice.

    "question": "Police closing the FIR with C Summary report. Any impact on me?",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. Please understand that in case of Uma Shankar Gopalika Vs. State of Bihar and Another reported in (2005) 10 SCC 336 it was held by Hon'ble Supreme Court that it is a well-established principle of law that every breach of contract or every dispute under an agreement does not amount to the offence of cheating. It would amount to cheating only in those cases where there was any deception played at the very inception. To establish the offence of cheating, the accused should be shown to have had fraudulent or dishonest intention at the time of making promise or representation.However, if in your case you can prove anyhow through some documentary evidence that fraudulent or dishonest intention was there at the beginning of the transaction, then you can file a protest petition so as to challenge the c-summary report which you are entitled to. C-summary report is issued when the offence committed looks to be of civil nature.If the protest petition is accepted then the Magistrate takes cognizance of the matter under section 190 ofCode of Criminal Procedureand issues notice.Action can be taken against you if the other side press for it for defamation. Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "question": "Police closing the FIR with C Summary report. Any impact on me?",
    "answer": "Dear client,A \"C summary\" report, also known as a closure report, is typically filed by the police when they conclude that a criminal case does not have enough evidence to proceed further. It means that the police have determined that the case does not require further investigation or prosecution.If the police have filed a closure report in your case, it indicates that they do not believe there is sufficient evidence to pursue criminal charges. However, this does not prevent you from pursuing your claim in a civil court.Regarding the possibility of the accused filing a counter FIR or a defamation suit against you, it's important to understand that anyone can file a complaint or lawsuit. However, the success of such a complaint or lawsuit depends on the merits of the case and the evidence presented. If you have valid evidence to support your claim and have acted in good faith, it may help in defending against any potential counterclaims.To address your concerns, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer who specializes in criminal law and defamation cases. They will be able to review the specifics of your situation, assess the potential risks, and provide you with the most accurate legal advice based on the relevant laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.It's important to remember that the information provided here is general in nature and may not apply directly to your specific case.

    "question": "Name change of sellerâs father in gift deed",
    "answer": "Dear client,I am not a legal professional, but I can provide some general information that may be helpful. In this situation, it appears that there is an inconsistency in the father's name mentioned in the gift deed compared to the other documents related to the property. To rectify this discrepancy, it may be advisable for Ramesh Chand to consider executing a rectification deed.A rectification deed is a legal document used to correct errors or omissions in a previous deed or document. It can help in ensuring that the correct information is reflected in the property records. The specific requirements for executing a rectification deed, including the stamp duty charges, can vary depending on the jurisdiction and local laws. It is recommended to consult with a lawyer who specializes in property law to understand the exact process and applicable stamp duty charges in your specific location.Registering the property without rectifying the discrepancy in the father's name may pose potential issues in the future, as it could lead to complications in the title and ownership records. It is generally advisable to address any discrepancies or errors to maintain the accuracy and clarity of property documentation.To ensure that the property transaction is conducted smoothly and with legal certainty, it is recommended that both the buyer and seller consult with their respective legal representatives. They can review the specific details and provide guidance on the appropriate steps to take, including the execution of a rectification deed if necessary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

After due date has passed away can the seller force the buyer to buy the property even though due date passed away due to his tenants delaying to vacate.yes the seller can require your brother to purchase. time was never an essence of the contract as the completion of the sale was predicated on the tenants vacating the property. there is a delay of only 5 days and so no heavens would fall loose if the sale could not be completed on 15.10.21.

    "question": "If seller delays due date of sale agreement and buyer denies to buy property thereafter",
    "answer": "Dear clientBuyer's obligations: If the due date specified in the sale agreement has passed, and the seller has not fulfilled their obligation to vacate the property, the buyer may have grounds to cancel the agreement. The buyer cannot be forced to buy the property if the seller has not met the terms of the agreement.Seeking the return of advance amount: If the seller refuses to return the advance amount despite the buyer's request, the buyer may consider sending a legal notice through an attorney demanding the return of the advance payment. If the seller still refuses to return the money, the buyer may have to file a lawsuit to recover the advance amount.Legal action by the seller: The seller may potentially take legal action against the buyer if they believe the buyer breached the terms of the agreement. However, if the buyer can prove that the delay in completing the deal was due to the seller's inability to vacate the property, the buyer may have a valid defense against any legal action taken by the seller.Buyer's legal rights: The buyer may have legal rights to seek a refund of the advance payment if the seller has failed to fulfill their obligations as per the sale agreement. The specific legal remedies and options available to the buyer may depend on the laws of the jurisdiction where the property is located. It's crucial to consult with a local attorney who can advise you on the best course of action.Call recording as evidence: The call recording you mentioned may be considered as evidence in court to support the buyer's claim that the seller did not vacate the property within the specified time. However, the admissibility and weight given to this evidence will depend on the rules of evidence in your jurisdiction and the court's discretion.Seller's actions: If the seller proceeds to rent or sell the property to another buyer while the dispute over the advance payment is ongoing, it may complicate the legal proceedings. In such cases, the buyer's attorney may seek an injunction or a stay order from the court to prevent the seller from disposing of the property until the matter is resolved.Jurisdiction's decision: The decision of the court will depend on the specific facts and evidence presented by both parties. If the buyer can establish that the seller breached the terms of the agreement and failed to vacate the property within the specified time, the court may be more likely to rule in favor of the buyer, potentially ordering the return of the advance payment.These are general guidelines, and the outcome may vary based on the specific laws and circumstances of your case.

    "answer": "Failure to file a reply within the given time frame does not automatically result in an ex parte decision. An ex parte decision typically occurs when one party is absent or fails to participate in the proceedings. In your case, since the HUDA has not filed a reply, it may indicate a delay or oversight on their part. The court will likely take note of this and may grant additional time or take appropriate action to ensure a fair process. It's important to consult with your lawyer to understand the implications of the HUDA's lack of response and how it may affect the proceedings.The time it takes for the court to release the money in your favor can vary depending on various factors, including the court's workload, administrative procedures, and the efficiency of the legal system. Since both respondent number 1 and 2 have already provided written statements in support of releasing the amount to you, it strengthens your case.

    "answer": "Demand of land lord is illegal. Being tenant, you have every right to enjoy the tenanted premises. There is no reason for the increase. Since there is a registered lease hence parties are bound by terms of lease. Tenancy is not affected by any fluctuation in rent in the market. Demand of hike by landlord is illegal. Your tenancy is intact for 22 moths in terms of lease, however, details are required to be examined. Donot agree for any increase in rent as your right is intact. Landlord cannot evict you. Rest can be suggested after examining agreements etc in detail.Siddharth SrivastavaAdvocate, Delhi1537 AnswersTalk to Advocate Siddharth Srivastava"

    "answer": "A leave and license agreementÂ is a legal document that binds the licensor in terms of the security amount, rent amount, stay duration, and other payables for the use of the property. These points cannot be changed once the agreement is signed by both parties.Licensor can able to retain its right to terminate the agreement binding upon the licensee and the licensor, by issuing him a notice for the same default.The License can be renewed with a fresh agreement that must be signed at least 2 months prior to the Expiration of the said License for renewal. The standard escalation during renewal will be 5%.A Leave and License Agreement is notorious for being convenient to the landlord against the advantages it offers to the tenant. However, equipped with the right content of clauses, both can turn the tide to each otherâs convenience.However this will not entitle the landlord to demand exorbitant rent that too in the middle of the agreement more than the amount agreed in the agreement.You can refuse to pay the hiked amount and refuse to vacate the premises till the expiration of the agreement period.Let him approach court which can be challenged properly.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear client,When including a clause in a lease agreement to protect yourself from legal situations related to injuries or accidents during the daycare's operation, it's important to consult with a qualified attorney who specializes in real estate and contract law. They can provide specific advice based on your jurisdiction and local regulations. Nevertheless, here's some general language that you could consider including:Indemnification Clause: This clause would state that the tenant agrees to indemnify and hold you (the landlord) harmless from any claims, damages, injuries, or losses that may occur on the premises, including those related to the daycare's operations.Release of Liability: Include a provision where the tenant and any parents/guardians of the children attending the daycare release you from any liability for injuries or accidents that may occur on the property. This provision may need to be reviewed by a lawyer to ensure it is enforceable in your jurisdiction.Insurance Requirement: Specify that the tenant must maintain adequate liability insurance coverage for their daycare operation and provide you with proof of insurance. This insurance should cover any accidents, injuries, or damages that may occur.Compliance with Regulations: Require the tenant to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and licensing requirements related to operating a daycare facility, including maintaining appropriate safety standards.Remember, it's crucial to consult with a legal professional to ensure that the clauses are suitable for your specific situation and comply with local laws. They can help you draft the necessary language and provide guidance on any additional protections you may need to include in the lease agreement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In this case, IA 787, which was filed in the year 2022, has been dismissed by the court.An interlocutory application is a request or motion filed by one party during the course of a legal proceeding, seeking a specific order or direction from the court. It is a procedural step taken within the larger legal case.When an IA is dismissed, it means that the court has rejected the application and the relief sought by the party filing it. The court may have found the application to be without merit or not supported by sufficient evidence, or it may have determined that the relief requested is not appropriate in the given circumstances.The dismissal of an IA does not necessarily determine the final outcome of the overall divorce proceeding. It simply means that the specific application has been denied. The divorce case may still continue, and other issues and applications can be addressed separately.It is advisable to consult with your legal counsel or the concerned court for further clarification and to understand the impact of the dismissal on your particular case.

    "answer": "The Office of Enforcement Operations and the foreign country make the final determination on a Treaty Transfer. Several factors will determine whether or not an inmate is eligible, examples include:The inmate must be a citizen or national of a foreign country having a treaty relationship with the United States. In the instance of inmates who claim dual citizenship, it will be the responsibility of the inmate to provide proof of citizenship or nationality for the foreign country.The inmate must not be committed for a military offense.The inmate must not be sentenced to the death penalty.The inmate must not be committed for a political offense.The inmate must have at least six months remaining on his current sentence at the time of his request. (Certain countries may require a longer period).The inmate will be scheduled for a verification of consent hearing before a magistrate judge. He either agrees to transfer or can at this time, decline transfer. Once an inmate agrees to transfer, the foreign country is notified and a schedule for the inmate's transfer is established.An inmate must be approved by both the US and the foreign country in order for an inmate to be transferred to his or her country of citizenship.From the above it can be noted that you being a Bangladeshi citizen, not eligible for transfer to India as an inmate.As far as Asylum is concerned:India does not have any specific legislation dealing with the problem of refugees and asylum seekers. At present, refugees were treated as par with the foreigners and all laws applied to foreigners were also applied to them.An asylum seeker is a person who has left their country and is seeking protection from persecution and serious human rights violations in another country, but who hasn't yet been legally recognized as a refugee and is waiting to receive a decision on their asylum claim. Seeking asylum is a human right.However in your case the chances for getting asylum in India is very bleakÂ  specially on the basis of the fact that you married an US Citizen.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Is it allowed for any resident of society to block common free space",
    "answer": "Dear client,I'm not a legal expert, but I can provide you with some general suggestions for addressing the issue you described. It's important to consult with a local lawyer who specializes in property and neighbor disputes to get specific advice based on the laws and regulations in your jurisdiction. Here are a few options you could consider:Review the governing documents: Examine the governing documents of your residential complex, such as the bylaws, covenants, or rules and regulations. These documents may outline specific guidelines regarding the use of common spaces, balconies, or exteriors of the building. If the neighbor's blockage violates these rules, it could provide a basis for action.Mediation or arbitration: Explore the possibility of mediation or arbitration to resolve the dispute. This involves engaging a neutral third party who can facilitate discussions between you and your neighbor in order to find a mutually acceptable solution. Mediation or arbitration can be less formal and costly compared to litigation, and it may help in reaching a resolution.Send a legal notice: Consult with a lawyer to draft and send a legal notice to your neighbor, informing them of the violation and requesting them to remove the blockage within a specified timeframe. A legal notice can often convey the seriousness of the matter and prompt action.File a complaint with local authorities: If the blockage poses health or safety risks, you may consider filing a complaint with the appropriate local authorities, such as the municipal corporation or health department. They may have regulations or guidelines in place that govern such issues, and they can initiate an investigation or enforcement action if necessary.Seek a court order: As a last resort, if all other options fail, you may consider filing a lawsuit in a civil court. Consult with a lawyer to assess the strength of your case and determine if legal action is appropriate. The court may issue an order requiring your neighbor to remove the blockage and restore the common space.Remember that the specific legal options available to you may depend on the laws and regulations in your jurisdiction, as well as the specific circumstances of the situation. It's crucial to consult with a legal professional to understand the best course of action based on the applicable laws and your specific case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This involves engaging a neutral third party who can facilitate discussions between you and your neighbor in order to find a mutually acceptable solution. Mediation or arbitration can be less formal and costly compared to litigation, and it may help in reaching a resolution.Send a legal notice: Consult with a lawyer to draft and send a legal notice to your neighbor, informing them of the violation and requesting them to remove the blockage within a specified timeframe. A legal notice can often convey the seriousness of the matter and prompt action.File a complaint with local authorities: If the blockage poses health or safety risks, you may consider filing a complaint with the appropriate local authorities, such as the municipal corporation or health department. They may have regulations or guidelines in place that govern such issues, and they can initiate an investigation or enforcement action if necessary.Seek a court order: As a last resort, if all other options fail, you may consider filing a lawsuit in a civil court. Consult with a lawyer to assess the strength of your case and determine if legal action is appropriate. The court may issue an order requiring your neighbor to remove the blockage and restore the common space.Remember that the specific legal options available to you may depend on the laws and regulations in your jurisdiction, as well as the specific circumstances of the situation. It's crucial to consult with a legal professional to understand the best course of action based on the applicable laws and your specific case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "The said common area is common for all and do not belong to any particular member/owner for the complex.You have all the rights to use this common area without disturbing other members of the association.Similarly if someone indulges in the illegal activity of blocking the common area, and if the association is not taking any action on this despite making a complaint, you may issue a legal notice to the association and to the arrogant neighbor too.If this is not fetching you the desired results you may file a complaint against the society with the deputy registrar o cooperative societies to intervene and provide relief as per law.You can also plan to escalate the matter to the civil court or cooperative court with a suit for mandatory injunction against the neighbor if you still don't find any relief anywhere.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

They will be able to provide you with guidance tailored to your circumstances.When you are nominated as the beneficiary of a bank account, you generally have the right to access and withdraw the funds in the account upon the death of the account holder. However, it's important to follow the legal procedures and requirements in your jurisdiction.Here are a few general considerations:Disclosure of death: In most cases, it is required to inform the bank about the death of the account holder. The bank will then take necessary steps to freeze the account and prevent unauthorized transactions.Legal requirements: Depending on the jurisdiction and the specific circumstances, there may be legal requirements to follow when it comes to handling the assets of a deceased person. This may include obtaining a probate or letters of administration, which establish your authority to manage and distribute the assets according to the terms of the will.Compliance with the will: If your father has left a valid will and has bequeathed his assets to your son, it's important to ensure that you are following the provisions of the will. This may involve transferring the assets or funds to your son's name in accordance with the legal procedures.Consult a lawyer: Given the complexity and potential legal implications, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer who specializes in inheritance and banking laws in your jurisdiction. They can review your specific situation, advise you on the applicable laws and regulations, and guide you through the legal process.

    "question": "Transfer of funds",
    "answer": "Your question is not clear. You say that you transferred the funds from your father's account without informing the bank about his death. Does it mean that you used some of his already already signed cheques or you are also a joint account holder. The fact that the bank has allowed the transfer indicates that you must have used either his cheques or you have exercised the authority as joint account holder. As you have written that your father has willed all his assets in favour of your son, so legally speaking your son is the rightful owner of all bank balances after the death of your father. You as his nominee can withdraw the funds but you cannot utilize the funds for your own benefits. The funds need to be given to your son who has a will of your father.

    "question": "Mutual divorce 2nd motion not attended",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,First let me explain to you the process formutual consent divorce!Process For FilingDivorce By Mutual ConsentFiling of the Petition in the Family CourtJoint petition for dissolution of marriage for a decree of divorce is presented to the Family Court by both the spouses on the ground stating that they have not been able to reconcile the differences and live together. Thus, have mutually agreed to dissolve the marriage or they have been living separately for a period of one year or more. This petition has to be signed by both the parties.Appearance before the Family Court Judge for First Motion for DivorceBoth the parties will enter their appearance in the Court along with their legal counsels. Family Court Judge will go through the contents of the petition along with all the documents presented in the Court. Court may attempt to reconcile the differences between the spouses, however, if this is not possible, the matter proceeds further.Joint Statement on OathAfter going through the contents of the application, Court may order the party's joint statements to be recorded on oath and joint statement are signed by both the parties along with their respective counsels and then First motion is passed.First Motion order is passed, 6 Months Time period is given for the Second MotionAn order on the first motion is passed by the court. After this, a six months cooling period is given to both the parties to a divorce, before they can file the second motion. The maximum period to file for a second motion is 18 months from the date of presentation of the divorce petition in the family court.Second Motion hearing and Final DecreeOnce the parties have decided to go further with the proceedings and appear for the second motion, they proceed with the final hearings. This includes parties appearing and recording of joint statements before the Family Court.Kindly note that the time period to appear for the 2nd motion is 18 months i,e 1.5 years. There is a concept called as condonation of delay and thus your application can be dragged for another 6 months. Yes, I recommend you to go ahead and file the RCR petition, if your wife files a contested divorce. Sometimes, since the maintenance amount, alimony etc., can't be asked as much as in normal divorce, the lawyers of your wife may advice her to go forward and apply for a Sec 13(1)(ia) petition against you. Thus, I strongly recommend that you be a little careful and calculative. Before granting the decree for divorce, the Judge himself will ask you whether you want the matter to be put up for mediation. Do not worry, you yourself ask the Judge to put up the matter before the mediator. May I know why you want to reconcile?In case, the Judge is reluctant to grant date and shows an indication that he is going to grant divorce, you can always go for withdrawing with liberty to file fresh suit.Â  Also note that, if the matter is unattended by both the parties, it is capable of being disposed instead of divorce order. Also, to grant divorce there must be documents, if you have not filed any documents, how can the judge access and pass an appropriate order?Â  The Judges give 60 days time (in some cases 90 days)Â  for mediation process to complete and end. There are catena of cases where the judges have condoned the delay in theÂ  coming forward with the second motion, we can use those in your defence. The withdrawal can happen only if both of you agree, otherwise there will be no withdrawal. One-sided withdrawal is not permitted in the court of law. There is no such provision which allows for conversion of amutual consent divorcepetition to normal petition. She will have to file a fresh suit in case she wants to go for contested divorce under H.M.A 1955.I hope I have answered your questions. In case you have further doubts, do not hesitate to reach out to me for clarification"

    "question": "Can a landlord ask to vacate premise / increase exorbitant rent in between the agreement term",
    "answer": "A leave and license agreementÂ is a legal document that binds the licensor in terms of the security amount, rent amount, stay duration, and other payables for the use of the property. These points cannot be changed once the agreement is signed by both parties.Licensor can able to retain its right to terminate the agreement binding upon the licensee and the licensor, by issuing him a notice for the same default.The License can be renewed with a fresh agreement that must be signed at least 2 months prior to the Expiration of the said License for renewal. The standard escalation during renewal will be 5%.A Leave and License Agreement is notorious for being convenient to the landlord against the advantages it offers to the tenant. However, equipped with the right content of clauses, both can turn the tide to each otherâs convenience.However this will not entitle the landlord to demand exorbitant rent that too in the middle of the agreement more than the amount agreed in the agreement.You can refuse to pay the hiked amount and refuse to vacate the premises till the expiration of the agreement period.Let him approach court which can be challenged properly.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Is it allowed for any resident of society to block common free space",
    "answer": "Dear client,I'm not a legal expert, but I can provide you with some general suggestions for addressing the issue you described. It's important to consult with a local lawyer who specializes in property and neighbor disputes to get specific advice based on the laws and regulations in your jurisdiction. Here are a few options you could consider:Review the governing documents: Examine the governing documents of your residential complex, such as the bylaws, covenants, or rules and regulations. These documents may outline specific guidelines regarding the use of common spaces, balconies, or exteriors of the building. If the neighbor's blockage violates these rules, it could provide a basis for action.Mediation or arbitration: Explore the possibility of mediation or arbitration to resolve the dispute. This involves engaging a neutral third party who can facilitate discussions between you and your neighbor in order to find a mutually acceptable solution. Mediation or arbitration can be less formal and costly compared to litigation, and it may help in reaching a resolution.Send a legal notice: Consult with a lawyer to draft and send a legal notice to your neighbor, informing them of the violation and requesting them to remove the blockage within a specified timeframe. A legal notice can often convey the seriousness of the matter and prompt action.File a complaint with local authorities: If the blockage poses health or safety risks, you may consider filing a complaint with the appropriate local authorities, such as the municipal corporation or health department. They may have regulations or guidelines in place that govern such issues, and they can initiate an investigation or enforcement action if necessary.Seek a court order: As a last resort, if all other options fail, you may consider filing a lawsuit in a civil court. Consult with a lawyer to assess the strength of your case and determine if legal action is appropriate. The court may issue an order requiring your neighbor to remove the blockage and restore the common space.Remember that the specific legal options available to you may depend on the laws and regulations in your jurisdiction, as well as the specific circumstances of the situation. It's crucial to consult with a legal professional to understand the best course of action based on the applicable laws and your specific case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,The specific legalities and regulations regarding your situation may vary depending on the laws in your jurisdiction, so it's important to consult with a local legal professional for accurate advice. However, I can offer some general suggestions that might be helpful.Check local building codes and regulations: Research the local building codes and regulations that govern residential properties in your area. Look for any restrictions or guidelines related to the conversion of residential properties into PG accommodations. This information can provide you with an understanding of whether the owner's plans comply with the regulations.Review the property's deed and zoning regulations: Examine the property's deed and any applicable zoning regulations. These documents may outline the permitted uses of the property and any restrictions that may apply. It is possible that converting the property into a PG accommodation might violate these rules.Consult a lawyer: Seek advice from a lawyer who specializes in property and real estate law. They will be able to review your specific situation, including any relevant local laws and regulations, and provide you with appropriate guidance.Discuss concerns with the owner: It may be helpful to have a conversation with the owner about your concerns. Explain your worries regarding the noise, security, and loss of privacy that may arise from converting the property into a PG accommodation. See if you can reach a mutual understanding or come up with alternative solutions that could address your concerns.Gather support from neighbors: While you mentioned that some neighbors might be hesitant to sign a letter of complaint, it may still be worth trying to gather support. Speak with your neighbors and explain your concerns. If they share similar worries, they might be willing to sign the letter or offer their support in other ways.Engage with the colony's governing body: If the colony president has asked you to write a letter, it indicates that they are open to addressing the issue. Follow the president's instructions and draft a formal letter outlining your concerns. Submit the letter along with any supporting evidence, such as photographs or recordings of the noise disturbances, if available.Remember that this advice is general in nature, and it's crucial to consult with a legal professional who can provide guidance based on the specific laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Mutual divorce 2nd motion not attended",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,First let me explain to you the process formutual consent divorce!Process For FilingDivorce By Mutual ConsentFiling of the Petition in the Family CourtJoint petition for dissolution of marriage for a decree of divorce is presented to the Family Court by both the spouses on the ground stating that they have not been able to reconcile the differences and live together. Thus, have mutually agreed to dissolve the marriage or they have been living separately for a period of one year or more. This petition has to be signed by both the parties.Appearance before the Family Court Judge for First Motion for DivorceBoth the parties will enter their appearance in the Court along with their legal counsels. Family Court Judge will go through the contents of the petition along with all the documents presented in the Court. Court may attempt to reconcile the differences between the spouses, however, if this is not possible, the matter proceeds further.Joint Statement on OathAfter going through the contents of the application, Court may order the party's joint statements to be recorded on oath and joint statement are signed by both the parties along with their respective counsels and then First motion is passed.First Motion order is passed, 6 Months Time period is given for the Second MotionAn order on the first motion is passed by the court. After this, a six months cooling period is given to both the parties to a divorce, before they can file the second motion. The maximum period to file for a second motion is 18 months from the date of presentation of the divorce petition in the family court.Second Motion hearing and Final DecreeOnce the parties have decided to go further with the proceedings and appear for the second motion, they proceed with the final hearings. This includes parties appearing and recording of joint statements before the Family Court.Kindly note that the time period to appear for the 2nd motion is 18 months i,e 1.5 years. There is a concept called as condonation of delay and thus your application can be dragged for another 6 months. Yes, I recommend you to go ahead and file the RCR petition, if your wife files a contested divorce. Sometimes, since the maintenance amount, alimony etc., can't be asked as much as in normal divorce, the lawyers of your wife may advice her to go forward and apply for a Sec 13(1)(ia) petition against you. Thus, I strongly recommend that you be a little careful and calculative. Before granting the decree for divorce, the Judge himself will ask you whether you want the matter to be put up for mediation. Do not worry, you yourself ask the Judge to put up the matter before the mediator. May I know why you want to reconcile?In case, the Judge is reluctant to grant date and shows an indication that he is going to grant divorce, you can always go for withdrawing with liberty to file fresh suit.Â  Also note that, if the matter is unattended by both the parties, it is capable of being disposed instead of divorce order. Also, to grant divorce there must be documents, if you have not filed any documents, how can the judge access and pass an appropriate order?Â  The Judges give 60 days time (in some cases 90 days)Â  for mediation process to complete and end. There are catena of cases where the judges have condoned the delay in theÂ  coming forward with the second motion, we can use those in your defence. The withdrawal can happen only if both of you agree, otherwise there will be no withdrawal. One-sided withdrawal is not permitted in the court of law. There is no such provision which allows for conversion of amutual consent divorcepetition to normal petition. She will have to file a fresh suit in case she wants to go for contested divorce under H.M.A 1955.I hope I have answered your questions. In case you have further doubts, do not hesitate to reach out to me for clarification"

You can make efforts at your personal/family level or through your lawyer for reconciliation.(4) You can attend any hearing and tell the judge that you do not want to pursue the petition for divorce with consent meaning. The judge may either give time for reconciliation or reject the joint petition on ground that one party has withdrawn the consent.If you are not willing to dissolve the marriage, you may approach your wife to sort out the matrimonial disputes/issues and try to convince her to give the marriage another chance to work.Dalbir BhartiAdvocate, Gurgaon41 AnswersTalk to Advocate Dalbir Bharti"

The bank will then take necessary steps to freeze the account and prevent unauthorized transactions.Legal requirements: Depending on the jurisdiction and the specific circumstances, there may be legal requirements to follow when it comes to handling the assets of a deceased person. This may include obtaining a probate or letters of administration, which establish your authority to manage and distribute the assets according to the terms of the will.Compliance with the will: If your father has left a valid will and has bequeathed his assets to your son, it's important to ensure that you are following the provisions of the will.

    "answer": "Your question is not clear. You say that you transferred the funds from your father's account without informing the bank about his death. Does it mean that you used some of his already already signed cheques or you are also a joint account holder. The fact that the bank has allowed the transfer indicates that you must have used either his cheques or you have exercised the authority as joint account holder. As you have written that your father has willed all his assets in favour of your son, so legally speaking your son is the rightful owner of all bank balances after the death of your father. You as his nominee can withdraw the funds but you cannot utilize the funds for your own benefits. The funds need to be given to your son who has a will of your father.

    "question": "Mutual divorce 2nd motion not attended",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,First let me explain to you the process formutual consent divorce!Process For FilingDivorce By Mutual ConsentFiling of the Petition in the Family CourtJoint petition for dissolution of marriage for a decree of divorce is presented to the Family Court by both the spouses on the ground stating that they have not been able to reconcile the differences and live together. Thus, have mutually agreed to dissolve the marriage or they have been living separately for a period of one year or more. This petition has to be signed by both the parties.Appearance before the Family Court Judge for First Motion for DivorceBoth the parties will enter their appearance in the Court along with their legal counsels. Family Court Judge will go through the contents of the petition along with all the documents presented in the Court. Court may attempt to reconcile the differences between the spouses, however, if this is not possible, the matter proceeds further.Joint Statement on OathAfter going through the contents of the application, Court may order the party's joint statements to be recorded on oath and joint statement are signed by both the parties along with their respective counsels and then First motion is passed.First Motion order is passed, 6 Months Time period is given for the Second MotionAn order on the first motion is passed by the court. After this, a six months cooling period is given to both the parties to a divorce, before they can file the second motion. The maximum period to file for a second motion is 18 months from the date of presentation of the divorce petition in the family court.Second Motion hearing and Final DecreeOnce the parties have decided to go further with the proceedings and appear for the second motion, they proceed with the final hearings. This includes parties appearing and recording of joint statements before the Family Court.Kindly note that the time period to appear for the 2nd motion is 18 months i,e 1.5 years. There is a concept called as condonation of delay and thus your application can be dragged for another 6 months. Yes, I recommend you to go ahead and file the RCR petition, if your wife files a contested divorce. Sometimes, since the maintenance amount, alimony etc., can't be asked as much as in normal divorce, the lawyers of your wife may advice her to go forward and apply for a Sec 13(1)(ia) petition against you. Thus, I strongly recommend that you be a little careful and calculative. Before granting the decree for divorce, the Judge himself will ask you whether you want the matter to be put up for mediation. Do not worry, you yourself ask the Judge to put up the matter before the mediator. May I know why you want to reconcile?In case, the Judge is reluctant to grant date and shows an indication that he is going to grant divorce, you can always go for withdrawing with liberty to file fresh suit.Â  Also note that, if the matter is unattended by both the parties, it is capable of being disposed instead of divorce order. Also, to grant divorce there must be documents, if you have not filed any documents, how can the judge access and pass an appropriate order?Â  The Judges give 60 days time (in some cases 90 days)Â  for mediation process to complete and end. There are catena of cases where the judges have condoned the delay in theÂ  coming forward with the second motion, we can use those in your defence. The withdrawal can happen only if both of you agree, otherwise there will be no withdrawal. One-sided withdrawal is not permitted in the court of law. There is no such provision which allows for conversion of amutual consent divorcepetition to normal petition. She will have to file a fresh suit in case she wants to go for contested divorce under H.M.A 1955.I hope I have answered your questions. In case you have further doubts, do not hesitate to reach out to me for clarification"

    "answer": "Dear client,The specific legalities and regulations regarding your situation may vary depending on the laws in your jurisdiction, so it's important to consult with a local legal professional for accurate advice. However, I can offer some general suggestions that might be helpful.Check local building codes and regulations: Research the local building codes and regulations that govern residential properties in your area. Look for any restrictions or guidelines related to the conversion of residential properties into PG accommodations. This information can provide you with an understanding of whether the owner's plans comply with the regulations.Review the property's deed and zoning regulations: Examine the property's deed and any applicable zoning regulations. These documents may outline the permitted uses of the property and any restrictions that may apply. It is possible that converting the property into a PG accommodation might violate these rules.Consult a lawyer: Seek advice from a lawyer who specializes in property and real estate law. They will be able to review your specific situation, including any relevant local laws and regulations, and provide you with appropriate guidance.Discuss concerns with the owner: It may be helpful to have a conversation with the owner about your concerns. Explain your worries regarding the noise, security, and loss of privacy that may arise from converting the property into a PG accommodation. See if you can reach a mutual understanding or come up with alternative solutions that could address your concerns.Gather support from neighbors: While you mentioned that some neighbors might be hesitant to sign a letter of complaint, it may still be worth trying to gather support. Speak with your neighbors and explain your concerns. If they share similar worries, they might be willing to sign the letter or offer their support in other ways.Engage with the colony's governing body: If the colony president has asked you to write a letter, it indicates that they are open to addressing the issue. Follow the president's instructions and draft a formal letter outlining your concerns. Submit the letter along with any supporting evidence, such as photographs or recordings of the noise disturbances, if available.Remember that this advice is general in nature, and it's crucial to consult with a legal professional who can provide guidance based on the specific laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. Hon'ble Supreme Court has elaborately dealt with this subject on several occasions and has issued comprehensive directions to deal such situations. It is to be followed in such cases by the municipal authorities and in case there is any violation of the said directions, the affected person is at liberty to take up the matter before courts.Better would be in your case to ask for interim direction of stay from Consumer Forum and legally speaking judges in Consumer Forum are aware of such tactics of builder and they usually pass the decision in favour of consumers. Even if at all Writ Petition is filed, then the builder would certainly challenge the order in Hon'ble Supreme Court. Writ Petition cannot be filed against private entity. If your builder is getting some funding from government then only Writ Petition would be maintainable.Â Article 12 ofConstitution of Indiasays that \"The 'State' Includes the Government and Parliament of India and the Government and the Legislature of each of the States and all local and other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India.\" Therefore, Writ Petition can only be filed against State.In Sunil Batra v. Delhi Administration, the Supreme Court held that the right to life included the right to lead a healthy life so as to enjoy all faculties of the human body in their prime conditions. It would even include the right to protection of a person's tradition, culture, heritage and all that gives meaning to a man's life. It includes the right to live in peace, to sleep in peace and the right to repose and health.My team can help you in drafting the petition and legal representation if required.

    "question": "Is it allowed for any resident of society to block common free space",
    "answer": "Dear client,I'm not a legal expert, but I can provide you with some general suggestions for addressing the issue you described. It's important to consult with a local lawyer who specializes in property and neighbor disputes to get specific advice based on the laws and regulations in your jurisdiction. Here are a few options you could consider:Review the governing documents: Examine the governing documents of your residential complex, such as the bylaws, covenants, or rules and regulations. These documents may outline specific guidelines regarding the use of common spaces, balconies, or exteriors of the building. If the neighbor's blockage violates these rules, it could provide a basis for action.Mediation or arbitration: Explore the possibility of mediation or arbitration to resolve the dispute. This involves engaging a neutral third party who can facilitate discussions between you and your neighbor in order to find a mutually acceptable solution. Mediation or arbitration can be less formal and costly compared to litigation, and it may help in reaching a resolution.Send a legal notice: Consult with a lawyer to draft and send a legal notice to your neighbor, informing them of the violation and requesting them to remove the blockage within a specified timeframe. A legal notice can often convey the seriousness of the matter and prompt action.File a complaint with local authorities: If the blockage poses health or safety risks, you may consider filing a complaint with the appropriate local authorities, such as the municipal corporation or health department. They may have regulations or guidelines in place that govern such issues, and they can initiate an investigation or enforcement action if necessary.Seek a court order: As a last resort, if all other options fail, you may consider filing a lawsuit in a civil court. Consult with a lawyer to assess the strength of your case and determine if legal action is appropriate. The court may issue an order requiring your neighbor to remove the blockage and restore the common space.Remember that the specific legal options available to you may depend on the laws and regulations in your jurisdiction, as well as the specific circumstances of the situation.

    "question": "Mutual divorce 2nd motion not attended",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,First let me explain to you the process formutual consent divorce!Process For FilingDivorce By Mutual ConsentFiling of the Petition in the Family CourtJoint petition for dissolution of marriage for a decree of divorce is presented to the Family Court by both the spouses on the ground stating that they have not been able to reconcile the differences and live together. Thus, have mutually agreed to dissolve the marriage or they have been living separately for a period of one year or more. This petition has to be signed by both the parties.Appearance before the Family Court Judge for First Motion for DivorceBoth the parties will enter their appearance in the Court along with their legal counsels. Family Court Judge will go through the contents of the petition along with all the documents presented in the Court. Court may attempt to reconcile the differences between the spouses, however, if this is not possible, the matter proceeds further.Joint Statement on OathAfter going through the contents of the application, Court may order the party's joint statements to be recorded on oath and joint statement are signed by both the parties along with their respective counsels and then First motion is passed.First Motion order is passed, 6 Months Time period is given for the Second MotionAn order on the first motion is passed by the court. After this, a six months cooling period is given to both the parties to a divorce, before they can file the second motion. The maximum period to file for a second motion is 18 months from the date of presentation of the divorce petition in the family court.Second Motion hearing and Final DecreeOnce the parties have decided to go further with the proceedings and appear for the second motion, they proceed with the final hearings. This includes parties appearing and recording of joint statements before the Family Court.Kindly note that the time period to appear for the 2nd motion is 18 months i,e 1.5 years. There is a concept called as condonation of delay and thus your application can be dragged for another 6 months. Yes, I recommend you to go ahead and file the RCR petition, if your wife files a contested divorce. Sometimes, since the maintenance amount, alimony etc., can't be asked as much as in normal divorce, the lawyers of your wife may advice her to go forward and apply for a Sec 13(1)(ia) petition against you. Thus, I strongly recommend that you be a little careful and calculative. Before granting the decree for divorce, the Judge himself will ask you whether you want the matter to be put up for mediation. Do not worry, you yourself ask the Judge to put up the matter before the mediator. May I know why you want to reconcile?In case, the Judge is reluctant to grant date and shows an indication that he is going to grant divorce, you can always go for withdrawing with liberty to file fresh suit.Â  Also note that, if the matter is unattended by both the parties, it is capable of being disposed instead of divorce order. Also, to grant divorce there must be documents, if you have not filed any documents, how can the judge access and pass an appropriate order?Â  The Judges give 60 days time (in some cases 90 days)Â  for mediation process to complete and end. There are catena of cases where the judges have condoned the delay in theÂ  coming forward with the second motion, we can use those in your defence. The withdrawal can happen only if both of you agree, otherwise there will be no withdrawal. One-sided withdrawal is not permitted in the court of law. There is no such provision which allows for conversion of amutual consent divorcepetition to normal petition. She will have to file a fresh suit in case she wants to go for contested divorce under H.M.A 1955.I hope I have answered your questions. In case you have further doubts, do not hesitate to reach out to me for clarification"

For divorce with consent of both parties, both the parties have to remain present for the 2nd motion.(2) Yes, you will get fair chance of hearing to oppose if your wife converts the petition for divorce with consent intoÂ  contested divorce petition.(3) Even if your wife files a petition for contested divorce, there are always scopes for reconciliation. You can make efforts at your personal/family level or through your lawyer for reconciliation.(4) You can attend any hearing and tell the judge that you do not want to pursue the petition for divorce with consent meaning. The judge may either give time for reconciliation or reject the joint petition on ground that one party has withdrawn the consent.If you are not willing to dissolve the marriage, you may approach your wife to sort out the matrimonial disputes/issues and try to convince her to give the marriage another chance to work.Dalbir BhartiAdvocate, Gurgaon41 AnswersTalk to Advocate Dalbir Bharti"

    "question": "Heir certificate/process to sell property in India",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. You know that as per Section 2(h) of Indian Succession Act, 1925 provides that Will means the legal declaration of the intention of a person with respect to his property, which he desires to take effect after his death Will has been defined in Corpus Juris Secundum as A âWillâ is the legal declaration of a manâs intention, which he wills to be performed after his death, or an instrument by which a person makes a disposition of his property to take effect after his death.You can apply for probate of Will initially. The word âProbateâ means to prove or validate something. It is a procedure for court approval of the Will as the valid and last Will of the deceased testator. According to the Indian Succession Act, 1925, âProbate of will, when granted establishes the will from the death of the testator, and renders valid all intermediate acts of the executor as such.âIt means that when a Will is probated, it gets officially certified with a seal of the court and provides the authority to the executor to appropriately distribute the assets of deceased testator and also to pay off bills and creditors from that estate.The procedure for probating of will is divided into four simple stages:1. The first step involves making of application to the District Judge through a probate petition which must be duly signed and verified by or on behalf of the applicant. The probate petition should be in a prescribed format under Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.2. The second step is to send the application to the High Court, under whose jurisdiction property falls. Then a lawyer shall prepare the application, in some cases lower court can also accept the application.3. One needs to submit certain documents that can verify the genuineness of the will, death certificate and other documents. These will prove that the testator had free will.4. When the court receives the application, it verifies all the details. Then it invites the nearest kin of the deceased for claiming the probate. Finally, it showcases the invitation letter at prominent places for invitation of any objection. If after 30 days, the court files no objection, the issuance of the probate is complete.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "question": "Heir certificate/process to sell property in India",
    "answer": "If your father had written Will in USA which would include the properties left behind in the USA also then you can get the Will probated by a court of USA.A will can be executed anywhere without any restrictions subject to the due procedure of the law of the country.With reference to wills executed outside India, in respect of which a foreign probate has also been obtained, the requirement of Section 213(1) of the Indian SuccessionÂ  Act , 1925, would be satisfied by obtaining under Section 228(1) of the Act an ancillary probate. Otherwise, the procedural requirement of the lex fori enacted under Section 213(1) of the Act may not be satisfied and if it is only with a view to enable parties claiming under a will executed outside India to make claims with reference to properties situated in India, the procedure under Section 228 of the Act has been prescribed.In India, Wills made in other jurisdiction are not automatically enforceable.Under the Act, an ancillary probate can be granted to authenticate a foreign will. A foreign will, once proved and deposited in a court of competent jurisdiction, or a properly authenticated copy of the will and letters of administration will be recognised by the Indian Courts. Otherwise, if the Court deems fit then it will take the evidence into account and will examine the petitioner upon oath to ensure the veracity of the will.An executor or legatee cannot claim their right under the will unless probate or letters of administration of the will are obtained.If the Will was written in India and if the properties are situated in a place other than Bombay or Madras or Calcutta, probate would not be necessary, but you can get the details of the family tree or surviving members of the family of deceased duly attested by a notary of that country, in order to succeed to the estates, based on which all the beneficiaries should apply jointly for mutation of the property to their name by enclosing the copy of the Will (probate of Will if already obtained).Once the property is mutated then all the shareholders can sell the property jointly by executing a joint sale deed in favor of the prospective buyer."

To establish the offence of cheating, the accused should be shown to have had fraudulent or dishonest intention at the time of making promise or representation.However, if in your case you can prove anyhow through some documentary evidence that fraudulent or dishonest intention was there at the beginning of the transaction, then you can file a protest petition so as to challenge the c-summary report which you are entitled to.

    "question": "Police closing the FIR with C Summary report. Any impact on me?",
    "answer": "Dear client,A \"C summary\" report, also known as a closure report, is typically filed by the police when they conclude that a criminal case does not have enough evidence to proceed further. It means that the police have determined that the case does not require further investigation or prosecution.If the police have filed a closure report in your case, it indicates that they do not believe there is sufficient evidence to pursue criminal charges. However, this does not prevent you from pursuing your claim in a civil court.Regarding the possibility of the accused filing a counter FIR or a defamation suit against you, it's important to understand that anyone can file a complaint or lawsuit. However, the success of such a complaint or lawsuit depends on the merits of the case and the evidence presented. If you have valid evidence to support your claim and have acted in good faith, it may help in defending against any potential counterclaims.To address your concerns, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer who specializes in criminal law and defamation cases. They will be able to review the specifics of your situation, assess the potential risks, and provide you with the most accurate legal advice based on the relevant laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.It's important to remember that the information provided here is general in nature and may not apply directly to your specific case.

    "question": "Prevent PG creation",
    "answer": "Dear client,The specific legalities and regulations regarding your situation may vary depending on the laws in your jurisdiction, so it's important to consult with a local legal professional for accurate advice. However, I can offer some general suggestions that might be helpful.Check local building codes and regulations: Research the local building codes and regulations that govern residential properties in your area. Look for any restrictions or guidelines related to the conversion of residential properties into PG accommodations. This information can provide you with an understanding of whether the owner's plans comply with the regulations.Review the property's deed and zoning regulations: Examine the property's deed and any applicable zoning regulations. These documents may outline the permitted uses of the property and any restrictions that may apply. It is possible that converting the property into a PG accommodation might violate these rules.Consult a lawyer: Seek advice from a lawyer who specializes in property and real estate law. They will be able to review your specific situation, including any relevant local laws and regulations, and provide you with appropriate guidance.Discuss concerns with the owner: It may be helpful to have a conversation with the owner about your concerns. Explain your worries regarding the noise, security, and loss of privacy that may arise from converting the property into a PG accommodation. See if you can reach a mutual understanding or come up with alternative solutions that could address your concerns.Gather support from neighbors: While you mentioned that some neighbors might be hesitant to sign a letter of complaint, it may still be worth trying to gather support. Speak with your neighbors and explain your concerns. If they share similar worries, they might be willing to sign the letter or offer their support in other ways.Engage with the colony's governing body: If the colony president has asked you to write a letter, it indicates that they are open to addressing the issue. Follow the president's instructions and draft a formal letter outlining your concerns. Submit the letter along with any supporting evidence, such as photographs or recordings of the noise disturbances, if available.Remember that this advice is general in nature, and it's crucial to consult with a legal professional who can provide guidance based on the specific laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,I'm not a legal expert, but I can provide you with some general suggestions for addressing the issue you described. It's important to consult with a local lawyer who specializes in property and neighbor disputes to get specific advice based on the laws and regulations in your jurisdiction. Here are a few options you could consider:Review the governing documents: Examine the governing documents of your residential complex, such as the bylaws, covenants, or rules and regulations. These documents may outline specific guidelines regarding the use of common spaces, balconies, or exteriors of the building. If the neighbor's blockage violates these rules, it could provide a basis for action.Mediation or arbitration: Explore the possibility of mediation or arbitration to resolve the dispute. This involves engaging a neutral third party who can facilitate discussions between you and your neighbor in order to find a mutually acceptable solution. Mediation or arbitration can be less formal and costly compared to litigation, and it may help in reaching a resolution.Send a legal notice: Consult with a lawyer to draft and send a legal notice to your neighbor, informing them of the violation and requesting them to remove the blockage within a specified timeframe. A legal notice can often convey the seriousness of the matter and prompt action.File a complaint with local authorities: If the blockage poses health or safety risks, you may consider filing a complaint with the appropriate local authorities, such as the municipal corporation or health department. They may have regulations or guidelines in place that govern such issues, and they can initiate an investigation or enforcement action if necessary.Seek a court order: As a last resort, if all other options fail, you may consider filing a lawsuit in a civil court. Consult with a lawyer to assess the strength of your case and determine if legal action is appropriate. The court may issue an order requiring your neighbor to remove the blockage and restore the common space.Remember that the specific legal options available to you may depend on the laws and regulations in your jurisdiction, as well as the specific circumstances of the situation.

To establish the offence of cheating, the accused should be shown to have had fraudulent or dishonest intention at the time of making promise or representation.However, if in your case you can prove anyhow through some documentary evidence that fraudulent or dishonest intention was there at the beginning of the transaction, then you can file a protest petition so as to challenge the c-summary report which you are entitled to. C-summary report is issued when the offence committed looks to be of civil nature.If the protest petition is accepted then the Magistrate takes cognizance of the matter under section 190 ofCode of Criminal Procedureand issues notice.Action can be taken against you if the other side press for it for defamation. Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "question": "Police closing the FIR with C Summary report. Any impact on me?",
    "answer": "Dear client,A \"C summary\" report, also known as a closure report, is typically filed by the police when they conclude that a criminal case does not have enough evidence to proceed further. It means that the police have determined that the case does not require further investigation or prosecution.If the police have filed a closure report in your case, it indicates that they do not believe there is sufficient evidence to pursue criminal charges. However, this does not prevent you from pursuing your claim in a civil court.Regarding the possibility of the accused filing a counter FIR or a defamation suit against you, it's important to understand that anyone can file a complaint or lawsuit. However, the success of such a complaint or lawsuit depends on the merits of the case and the evidence presented. If you have valid evidence to support your claim and have acted in good faith, it may help in defending against any potential counterclaims.To address your concerns, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer who specializes in criminal law and defamation cases. They will be able to review the specifics of your situation, assess the potential risks, and provide you with the most accurate legal advice based on the relevant laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.It's important to remember that the information provided here is general in nature and may not apply directly to your specific case.

    "answer": "Dear client,I am not a legal professional, but I can provide some general information that may be helpful. In this situation, it appears that there is an inconsistency in the father's name mentioned in the gift deed compared to the other documents related to the property. To rectify this discrepancy, it may be advisable for Ramesh Chand to consider executing a rectification deed.A rectification deed is a legal document used to correct errors or omissions in a previous deed or document. It can help in ensuring that the correct information is reflected in the property records. The specific requirements for executing a rectification deed, including the stamp duty charges, can vary depending on the jurisdiction and local laws. It is recommended to consult with a lawyer who specializes in property law to understand the exact process and applicable stamp duty charges in your specific location.Registering the property without rectifying the discrepancy in the father's name may pose potential issues in the future, as it could lead to complications in the title and ownership records. It is generally advisable to address any discrepancies or errors to maintain the accuracy and clarity of property documentation.To ensure that the property transaction is conducted smoothly and with legal certainty, it is recommended that both the buyer and seller consult with their respective legal representatives. They can review the specific details and provide guidance on the appropriate steps to take, including the execution of a rectification deed if necessary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The revocation must be in express form and not of a wish or desire.Revocation by rescission:- The gift is a transfer of ownership without any exchange of money or any consideration which is made voluntarily. So, where there is no free consent of the parties, the gift can be revoked or if it is obtained by coercion, undue influence or fraud then the gift is voidable.CASEâS. Sarojini Amma v.

Any person who is the real owner of the property can transfer his or her property to anyone by way of gift.

    "answer": "Dear client,I'm not a legal expert, but I can provide you with some general suggestions for addressing the issue you described. It's important to consult with a local lawyer who specializes in property and neighbor disputes to get specific advice based on the laws and regulations in your jurisdiction. Here are a few options you could consider:Review the governing documents: Examine the governing documents of your residential complex, such as the bylaws, covenants, or rules and regulations. These documents may outline specific guidelines regarding the use of common spaces, balconies, or exteriors of the building. If the neighbor's blockage violates these rules, it could provide a basis for action.Mediation or arbitration: Explore the possibility of mediation or arbitration to resolve the dispute. This involves engaging a neutral third party who can facilitate discussions between you and your neighbor in order to find a mutually acceptable solution. Mediation or arbitration can be less formal and costly compared to litigation, and it may help in reaching a resolution.Send a legal notice: Consult with a lawyer to draft and send a legal notice to your neighbor, informing them of the violation and requesting them to remove the blockage within a specified timeframe. A legal notice can often convey the seriousness of the matter and prompt action.File a complaint with local authorities: If the blockage poses health or safety risks, you may consider filing a complaint with the appropriate local authorities, such as the municipal corporation or health department. They may have regulations or guidelines in place that govern such issues, and they can initiate an investigation or enforcement action if necessary.Seek a court order: As a last resort, if all other options fail, you may consider filing a lawsuit in a civil court. Consult with a lawyer to assess the strength of your case and determine if legal action is appropriate. The court may issue an order requiring your neighbor to remove the blockage and restore the common space.Remember that the specific legal options available to you may depend on the laws and regulations in your jurisdiction, as well as the specific circumstances of the situation. It's crucial to consult with a legal professional to understand the best course of action based on the applicable laws and your specific case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Heir certificate/process to sell property in India",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. You know that as per Section 2(h) of Indian Succession Act, 1925 provides that Will means the legal declaration of the intention of a person with respect to his property, which he desires to take effect after his death Will has been defined in Corpus Juris Secundum as A âWillâ is the legal declaration of a manâs intention, which he wills to be performed after his death, or an instrument by which a person makes a disposition of his property to take effect after his death.You can apply for probate of Will initially. The word âProbateâ means to prove or validate something. It is a procedure for court approval of the Will as the valid and last Will of the deceased testator. According to the Indian Succession Act, 1925, âProbate of will, when granted establishes the will from the death of the testator, and renders valid all intermediate acts of the executor as such.âIt means that when a Will is probated, it gets officially certified with a seal of the court and provides the authority to the executor to appropriately distribute the assets of deceased testator and also to pay off bills and creditors from that estate.The procedure for probating of will is divided into four simple stages:1. The first step involves making of application to the District Judge through a probate petition which must be duly signed and verified by or on behalf of the applicant. The probate petition should be in a prescribed format under Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.2. The second step is to send the application to the High Court, under whose jurisdiction property falls. Then a lawyer shall prepare the application, in some cases lower court can also accept the application.3. One needs to submit certain documents that can verify the genuineness of the will, death certificate and other documents. These will prove that the testator had free will.4. When the court receives the application, it verifies all the details. Then it invites the nearest kin of the deceased for claiming the probate. Finally, it showcases the invitation letter at prominent places for invitation of any objection. If after 30 days, the court files no objection, the issuance of the probate is complete.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "question": "Heir certificate/process to sell property in India",
    "answer": "If your father had written Will in USA which would include the properties left behind in the USA also then you can get the Will probated by a court of USA.A will can be executed anywhere without any restrictions subject to the due procedure of the law of the country.With reference to wills executed outside India, in respect of which a foreign probate has also been obtained, the requirement of Section 213(1) of the Indian SuccessionÂ  Act , 1925, would be satisfied by obtaining under Section 228(1) of the Act an ancillary probate. Otherwise, the procedural requirement of the lex fori enacted under Section 213(1) of the Act may not be satisfied and if it is only with a view to enable parties claiming under a will executed outside India to make claims with reference to properties situated in India, the procedure under Section 228 of the Act has been prescribed.In India, Wills made in other jurisdiction are not automatically enforceable.Under the Act, an ancillary probate can be granted to authenticate a foreign will. A foreign will, once proved and deposited in a court of competent jurisdiction, or a properly authenticated copy of the will and letters of administration will be recognised by the Indian Courts. Otherwise, if the Court deems fit then it will take the evidence into account and will examine the petitioner upon oath to ensure the veracity of the will.An executor or legatee cannot claim their right under the will unless probate or letters of administration of the will are obtained.If the Will was written in India and if the properties are situated in a place other than Bombay or Madras or Calcutta, probate would not be necessary, but you can get the details of the family tree or surviving members of the family of deceased duly attested by a notary of that country, in order to succeed to the estates, based on which all the beneficiaries should apply jointly for mutation of the property to their name by enclosing the copy of the Will (probate of Will if already obtained).Once the property is mutated then all the shareholders can sell the property jointly by executing a joint sale deed in favor of the prospective buyer."

Please understand that in case of Uma Shankar Gopalika Vs.

It would amount to cheating only in those cases where there was any deception played at the very inception. To establish the offence of cheating, the accused should be shown to have had fraudulent or dishonest intention at the time of making promise or representation.However, if in your case you can prove anyhow through some documentary evidence that fraudulent or dishonest intention was there at the beginning of the transaction, then you can file a protest petition so as to challenge the c-summary report which you are entitled to. C-summary report is issued when the offence committed looks to be of civil nature.If the protest petition is accepted then the Magistrate takes cognizance of the matter under section 190 ofCode of Criminal Procedureand issues notice.Action can be taken against you if the other side press for it for defamation.

    "answer": "Dear client,A \"C summary\" report, also known as a closure report, is typically filed by the police when they conclude that a criminal case does not have enough evidence to proceed further. It means that the police have determined that the case does not require further investigation or prosecution.If the police have filed a closure report in your case, it indicates that they do not believe there is sufficient evidence to pursue criminal charges. However, this does not prevent you from pursuing your claim in a civil court.Regarding the possibility of the accused filing a counter FIR or a defamation suit against you, it's important to understand that anyone can file a complaint or lawsuit. However, the success of such a complaint or lawsuit depends on the merits of the case and the evidence presented.

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. As you know that once a home purchase deal is finalised between a buyer and a seller, a formal process is initiated to conclude it legally. This starts with the buyer paying the seller a small portion of the transaction value, to show his genuine intentions. This payment, in Indian real estate parlance, is commonly known as the âtoken amountâ.There are bright chances of legal disputes in your situation. However, you can send a legal notice to the builder to comply with the terms you agreed upon and to claim compensation. Any of the parties cannot back off from settled terms of the contract.Â The courts have unqualified jurisdiction to award compensation in case of breach of contract, but the compensation must be reasonable. The aggrieved party is entitled to receive compensation from the defaulting party.All legal action can only be taken once notice has been served upon the entity or individual you wish to take to court. It is this process that legalises bringing a matter to court. The intimation sent is known as a legal draft. A legal notice is, therefore, a formal communication to a person or an entity, informing the other party of your intention to undertake legal proceedings against them.This notice, when sent, conveys your intention before the legal proceedings and thus, makes the party aware of your grievance. Many times, a legal notice served will bring the other party to heel, and the problem is often resolved out of court, well before it goes to trial, with fruitful discussions on both sides.However, if the other party is still unheeding the grievance, one can always start the court proceedings after the prescribed interval as stated by law. The bottom line is that legal notice can serve as a point of reference to embark upon negotiations between two parties and save both the time, effort, and money that is usually spent in court cases.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "question": "Registered plot vs token money issue",
    "answer": "Dear client,Based on the information you provided, it appears that the builder may have engaged in fraudulent or unethical behavior by accepting token money for the same plot of land from another buyer before selling it to you. This raises concerns about the builder's actions and potentially indicates a breach of trust.In this situation, there could be potential legal disputes between you, the other buyer, and the builder. The specific legal remedies available to you may depend on the laws and regulations governing property transactions in your jurisdiction, as well as the terms and conditions of your agreement with the builder.Here are some precautionary steps you may consider taking:Gather and organize all relevant documents: Collect and secure all documents related to your transaction, such as the sales deed, payment receipts, correspondence with the builder, and any other supporting evidence. These documents will be important if legal action becomes necessary.Consult with a property lawyer: Seek advice from a qualified property lawyer in your jurisdiction who can review your documents, understand the specific laws that apply to your case, and provide you with legal guidance tailored to your situation.Communicate with the builder in writing: It's essential to maintain clear and documented communication with the builder. Send a written notice to the builder, clearly stating your position that you do not wish to sell the plot and reminding them of your legal rights as the registered owner.Consider filing a complaint: If you believe that the builder has engaged in fraudulent or unethical practices, you may consider filing a complaint with the appropriate regulatory authorities or consumer protection agencies in your jurisdiction. A legal professional can advise you on the best course of action in this regard.Explore negotiation or mediation: Depending on the circumstances, you may wish to explore the possibility of resolving the dispute through negotiation or mediation. This could involve discussions with the other buyer, the builder, or both, facilitated by a neutral third party. However, the feasibility of this option will depend on the willingness of all parties involved to engage in such a process.Remember, the information provided here is general in nature, and it's important to consult with a qualified property lawyer who can provide you with advice tailored to your specific situation. They will be able to assess the details of your case and guide you through the legal process, if necessary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. Please understand that in case of Uma Shankar Gopalika Vs. State of Bihar and Another reported in (2005) 10 SCC 336 it was held by Hon'ble Supreme Court that it is a well-established principle of law that every breach of contract or every dispute under an agreement does not amount to the offence of cheating. It would amount to cheating only in those cases where there was any deception played at the very inception. To establish the offence of cheating, the accused should be shown to have had fraudulent or dishonest intention at the time of making promise or representation.However, if in your case you can prove anyhow through some documentary evidence that fraudulent or dishonest intention was there at the beginning of the transaction, then you can file a protest petition so as to challenge the c-summary report which you are entitled to. C-summary report is issued when the offence committed looks to be of civil nature.If the protest petition is accepted then the Magistrate takes cognizance of the matter under section 190 ofCode of Criminal Procedureand issues notice.Action can be taken against you if the other side press for it for defamation.

It means that the police have determined that the case does not require further investigation or prosecution.If the police have filed a closure report in your case, it indicates that they do not believe there is sufficient evidence to pursue criminal charges. However, this does not prevent you from pursuing your claim in a civil court.Regarding the possibility of the accused filing a counter FIR or a defamation suit against you, it's important to understand that anyone can file a complaint or lawsuit. However, the success of such a complaint or lawsuit depends on the merits of the case and the evidence presented.

They will be able to review the specifics of your situation, assess the potential risks, and provide you with the most accurate legal advice based on the relevant laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.It's important to remember that the information provided here is general in nature and may not apply directly to your specific case.

    "question": "Transfer of funds",
    "answer": "Your question is not clear. You say that you transferred the funds from your father's account without informing the bank about his death. Does it mean that you used some of his already already signed cheques or you are also a joint account holder. The fact that the bank has allowed the transfer indicates that you must have used either his cheques or you have exercised the authority as joint account holder. As you have written that your father has willed all his assets in favour of your son, so legally speaking your son is the rightful owner of all bank balances after the death of your father. You as his nominee can withdraw the funds but you cannot utilize the funds for your own benefits. The funds need to be given to your son who has a will of your father. Nothing can be said about the complaint lodged by your sister as it is not clear what are the ground of making the complaint.Dalbir BhartiAdvocate, Gurgaon41 AnswersTalk to Advocate Dalbir Bharti"
