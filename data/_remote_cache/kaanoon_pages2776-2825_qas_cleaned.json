When any business or profession carried on by a firm has been discontinued, or where a firm is dissolved, an Assessing Officer would assess the total income of the partnership firm as if no such dissolution or discontinuance has taken place. The process of dissolving a partnership firm involves the sale or disposal of all the assets of the firm, a final settlement of all of its liabilities, and the settling of the accounts.Goodwill is the assets of the company.It is essential to note that for cases where the dissolution occurs through a court of law, it is only possible when the partnership deed is registered.The primary reason for a dissolution of a partnership firm by a court of law is when the partnership firm or the partners involved participate in misconduct. Any partner or partners misbehaving with other members of the firm or not taking into consideration the signed agreement of that formed the partnership will find themselves ousted by their partners through a court case.A partnership agreement that is registered is a document that legally binds all the partners after they have signed it.

    "answer": "The Supreme Court has held that Section 14(1) of theHindu Succession Actdoes not bar the bequeathing of a limited estate to a female by way of a Will; butif the limited estate is given to the wife for her maintenance, then it would mature into an absolute estate under Section 14(1) of the Act.A wife becomes absolute owner of property willed to her for “maintenance” by her husband and can do whatever she wants with it.It is equally well settled that the claim of Hindu widow to be maintained is not a mere formality which is to be exercised as a matter of concession, grace or gratis but is a valuable, spiritual and moral right.”Section 14(1) of theHindu Succession Act, 1956 says a female Hindu shall be the full owner (not a limited owner) of any property possessed/held by her.Explanation to Section 14(1) says such property includes both movable and immovable property acquired by her by inheritance or in lieu of maintenance or by gift or in any other manner including stridhana.Now coming to your case;This property consisting 250 sq. yards was bequeathed by your uncle in favor of your father, if that is the case, your father becomes an absolute owner of this property by the virtue of the Will.As the trial court has already dismissed her case, it may not be maintainable in high court, but it is not known that what case has been filed by your aunt before the trial court and what was the actual reason that the trial court dismissed her suit.One way your aunt's assertion that your grandmother'slimited estate given as maintenance would mature into an absolute estate under Section 14(1) of the Act.Your father and his brother acquired the property of your grandmother on their own leaving behind the female siblings of your father.Therefore your father's brother was entitled to only one fourth share in your grandmother's property who is reported to have died intestate.Therefore the transfer of this property by a testamentary disposition in favor of your father by your deceased uncle shall be legally valid only insofar ass his share in that property and not the entire 250 sq. yards.Whatever, your father's brother has already transferred his share of property to your father, hence his wife cannot claim any share in that property which is not existing on the date of death of her husband.Your paternal aunts are entitled to one fourth share each in that property hence if they are willing to transfer their share in that property they can execute a registered release deed relinquishing their rights in  the property.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Yes, you may ask the court to award you costs for every adjournment if you feel that the adjournments were caused due to the other party or their lawyer's delay or misconduct. The court has the discretion to award costs in such situations, but it will depend on the specific facts and circumstances of your case. You may want to discuss this with your lawyer and request them to make a plea for costs on every adjournment in court.Regarding checking court records, you can request your lawyer to provide you with a copy of the court attendance sheet for each hearing. This sheet will typically have the details of the lawyers and parties present in court on that day. You can also request your lawyer to provide you with updates after each hearing, including whether they attended the hearing and what transpired in court.

In this case, IA 787, which was filed in the year 2022, has been dismissed by the court.An interlocutory application is a request or motion filed by one party during the course of a legal proceeding, seeking a specific order or direction from the court. It is a procedural step taken within the larger legal case.When an IA is dismissed, it means that the court has rejected the application and the relief sought by the party filing it. The court may have found the application to be without merit or not supported by sufficient evidence, or it may have determined that the relief requested is not appropriate in the given circumstances.The dismissal of an IA does not necessarily determine the final outcome of the overall divorce proceeding. It simply means that the specific application has been denied. The divorce case may still continue, and other issues and applications can be addressed separately.It is advisable to consult with your legal counsel or the concerned court for further clarification and to understand the impact of the dismissal on your particular case. They will be able to provide you with specific guidance and advice based on the details of your divorce proceedings.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can limited rights become Full rights if female dies but never claimed full rights in her life.",
    "answer": "The Supreme Court has held that Section 14(1) of theHindu Succession Actdoes not bar the bequeathing of a limited estate to a female by way of a Will; butif the limited estate is given to the wife for her maintenance, then it would mature into an absolute estate under Section 14(1) of the Act.A wife becomes absolute owner of property willed to her for “maintenance” by her husband and can do whatever she wants with it.It is equally well settled that the claim of Hindu widow to be maintained is not a mere formality which is to be exercised as a matter of concession, grace or gratis but is a valuable, spiritual and moral right.”Section 14(1) of theHindu Succession Act, 1956 says a female Hindu shall be the full owner (not a limited owner) of any property possessed/held by her.Explanation to Section 14(1) says such property includes both movable and immovable property acquired by her by inheritance or in lieu of maintenance or by gift or in any other manner including stridhana.Now coming to your case;This property consisting 250 sq. yards was bequeathed by your uncle in favor of your father, if that is the case, your father becomes an absolute owner of this property by the virtue of the Will.As the trial court has already dismissed her case, it may not be maintainable in high court, but it is not known that what case has been filed by your aunt before the trial court and what was the actual reason that the trial court dismissed her suit.One way your aunt's assertion that your grandmother'slimited estate given as maintenance would mature into an absolute estate under Section 14(1) of the Act.Your father and his brother acquired the property of your grandmother on their own leaving behind the female siblings of your father.Therefore your father's brother was entitled to only one fourth share in your grandmother's property who is reported to have died intestate.Therefore the transfer of this property by a testamentary disposition in favor of your father by your deceased uncle shall be legally valid only insofar ass his share in that property and not the entire 250 sq. yards.Whatever, your father's brother has already transferred his share of property to your father, hence his wife cannot claim any share in that property which is not existing on the date of death of her husband.Your paternal aunts are entitled to one fourth share each in that property hence if they are willing to transfer their share in that property they can execute a registered release deed relinquishing their rights in  the property.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

The suit continues to be pending until partition, that is divisionby metes and bounds, takes place by passing a final decree. Anapplication requesting the court to take necessary steps to draw up a finaldecree effecting a division in terms of the preliminary decree, is neitheran application for execution (falling under Article 136 of the LimitationAct) nor an application seeking a fresh relief (falling under Article 137 ofLimitation Act). It is only a reminder to the court to do its duty to appointa Commissioner, get a report, and draw a final decree in the pending suitso that the suit is taken to its logical conclusion.2) In view of the foregoing, we are of the view that the applicationfiled by the plaintiff in this case for drawing up of a final decree, wasrightly held to be not subject to any period of limitation.Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "answer": "From the above notification it can be noted that the tenants are not given permission to cast their votes.However Allahabad high court in the judgment in M/a Designarch infrastructure Ltd vs. Chairman,  GDA (14.11.2013 ALLHC), has stated that a tenant is considered as an apartment owner for participation in AOA  related issues and can participate in the AOA elections both as a voter and a candidate and can become part of board, provided he has entered into a lawful tenancy of more than one year which should survive without a break,  the period between the declaration of AGM declaring the election and expiry of the upcoming Board of Management.A tenant cannot delegate his above rights to any other person.Only the person in whose name tenancy/lease deed is executed can participate in the election.The UP apartment Act section  2 (d) & (e), 3(d) and UP Urban buildings (Regulation of Letting,  Rent and  Eviction) Act, 1972 are some of relevant law in this context.Therefore all the eligible lawful tenants can issue a joint notice to the election committee or the Returning Officer for participating in the ensuing election.If your application is not entertained then you can immediately approach the Registrar of cooperative society with a complaint signed jointly by all aggrieved lawful tenants and seek relief and remedy or can file a suit for injunction to restrain the association from conducting the election without allowing your participation.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "The Supreme Court has held that Section 14(1) of theHindu Succession Actdoes not bar the bequeathing of a limited estate to a female by way of a Will; butif the limited estate is given to the wife for her maintenance, then it would mature into an absolute estate under Section 14(1) of the Act.A wife becomes absolute owner of property willed to her for “maintenance” by her husband and can do whatever she wants with it.It is equally well settled that the claim of Hindu widow to be maintained is not a mere formality which is to be exercised as a matter of concession, grace or gratis but is a valuable, spiritual and moral right.”Section 14(1) of theHindu Succession Act, 1956 says a female Hindu shall be the full owner (not a limited owner) of any property possessed/held by her.Explanation to Section 14(1) says such property includes both movable and immovable property acquired by her by inheritance or in lieu of maintenance or by gift or in any other manner including stridhana.Now coming to your case;This property consisting 250 sq. yards was bequeathed by your uncle in favor of your father, if that is the case, your father becomes an absolute owner of this property by the virtue of the Will.As the trial court has already dismissed her case, it may not be maintainable in high court, but it is not known that what case has been filed by your aunt before the trial court and what was the actual reason that the trial court dismissed her suit.One way your aunt's assertion that your grandmother'slimited estate given as maintenance would mature into an absolute estate under Section 14(1) of the Act.Your father and his brother acquired the property of your grandmother on their own leaving behind the female siblings of your father.Therefore your father's brother was entitled to only one fourth share in your grandmother's property who is reported to have died intestate.Therefore the transfer of this property by a testamentary disposition in favor of your father by your deceased uncle shall be legally valid only insofar ass his share in that property and not the entire 250 sq. yards.Whatever, your father's brother has already transferred his share of property to your father, hence his wife cannot claim any share in that property which is not existing on the date of death of her husband.Your paternal aunts are entitled to one fourth share each in that property hence if they are willing to transfer their share in that property they can execute a registered release deed relinquishing their rights in  the property.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

The suit continues to be pending until partition, that is divisionby metes and bounds, takes place by passing a final decree. Anapplication requesting the court to take necessary steps to draw up a finaldecree effecting a division in terms of the preliminary decree, is neitheran application for execution (falling under Article 136 of the LimitationAct) nor an application seeking a fresh relief (falling under Article 137 ofLimitation Act). It is only a reminder to the court to do its duty to appointa Commissioner, get a report, and draw a final decree in the pending suitso that the suit is taken to its logical conclusion.2) In view of the foregoing, we are of the view that the applicationfiled by the plaintiff in this case for drawing up of a final decree, wasrightly held to be not subject to any period of limitation.Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

The suit continues to be pending until partition, that is divisionby metes and bounds, takes place by passing a final decree. Anapplication requesting the court to take necessary steps to draw up a finaldecree effecting a division in terms of the preliminary decree, is neitheran application for execution (falling under Article 136 of the LimitationAct) nor an application seeking a fresh relief (falling under Article 137 ofLimitation Act).

    "question": "Transfer",
    "answer": "If  your grandfather is the only legal heir on whose name this property was transferred and he is the lone person owning and enjoying the property then he can transfer the property on his name to anyone of his choice, thus if you want this property to be transferred to your name he can transfer the same to your name by Gift under Muslim law.Each and every property that remains within the ownership of an individual can be inherited by his successors. Whenever a Muslim dies, all his property whether acquired by him during his lifetime or inherited from his ancestors can be inherited by his legal heirs.A Muslim is allowed to give away his whole property in his lifetime.Also, the religion of the person to whom the gift is made is irrelevant. The transfer of property through the way of gift is immediate and without consideration. It is an unconditional transfer of property. Although the gift being a property has to be governed by theTransfer of property act, 1882. But Chapter 7 ofTransfer of Property Act1882 does not cover the gift under Muslim law. So, the Muslim Personal law governs the Muslim gift or “Hiba”.This Hiba deed need not be executed by a registered document and also the Hiba can be oral too.You can get the property transferred to your name by Hiba.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

These conditions are as follow:Declaration of gift by the donor.Acceptance of gift by the donee.Transfer of possession by the donor and it’s acceptance by the donee. TheSupreme Court in Mahaboob Saheb's Case- summarized the rules ofMohammadan relating to gifts as stated byMulla\" as follows:-Sec 147 ... \"that writing is not essential to the validity of gift either of moveable or immoveable property\"Sec148 ... \"essential to the validity of a gift that the donor should divest himself completely of all ownership and dominion over the subject-matter of gift\"Sec150 ... For a valid gift there should be delivery of possession of the subject-matter of the gift and taking of possession of the gift   by the donee either actually or  constructively; andSee152... Where the donor isin possession a gift of immovable property of which the donor is in actual possession is not complete, unless the donor physically departs from the premises with all his good and chattels, and the done formally enters into possession.  It is thus clear that the gift need not be . in writing and consequently noregistration is required.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

You have two options.Issue him lawyer's notice seeking original sale deed. Mention that he promised to handover the same on day of registration so that he cannot claim he lost it. Warn him of criminal complaint against him, issue of LOC and extradition, as there is now extradition treaty signed between India and all gulf countries . After that file a complaint in the Court of Magistrate. A direction will be issued to police to register FIR, investigate, produce the accused through LOC, you can even get an extradition order and direction for cancellation of his passport. The proceeding my take time but you can teach him a lesson, if you can wait.Issue public notice, file FIR for loss of original.

    "answer": "You issue a legal notice to the seller intimating your decision to cancel the sale deed for the act of cheating done by him and demand refund of the amount paid towards consideration of sale with interest from the date of payment, failing which you can mention that you will lodge a criminal complaint against him for the offences of cheating, breach of trust and other fraudulent acts.If he is still maintaining silence , you may give a complaint with the local police for the acts of cheating and breach of trust.Firstly it was your fault for not obtaining a legal opinion from a lawyer before making payment towards purchase of this property, hence you may have to undergo the arduous procedures in this regard.At any cost you do not give any complaint for the loss of original document as well as giving a paper publication in a newspaper.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

In this case since the property has been sold to you, you can all the more file the FIR as required by the bankalso please issue the public notices in newspapersat the highest you can file a suit against the vendor to recover the expenses that you had to incur for filing the FIR and publishing the newspaper notice. however the cost of such suit would be far more than the money sought to be recoveredso what has happened has happened. now no use escalating the issue any furthernow you have to comply with the lender's requisitions so that your loan is sanctioned. so plz spend your energy on thati understand your ordeal and the vendor is wrong. but here the circumstances are such that doing anything is like a fait accompliYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "- As per law, without Registration a buyer has no legal right over the property even he has cleared all the dues with the builder, and further cannot sell it to anyone under the Transfer of Property Rights Act.- Since, you want to purchase the said property from him, then you should approach his builder and request him to make changes in the Builder-Buyer Agreement and transfer the ownership rights in your name.- As per rule the builder after collecting processing charges, can register the property in your name. This processing fee is charged to change the Builder-Buyer Agreement.- Further, the FIR and other public notice will not serve the purpose as the property is unregistered.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Demarcation of Land",
    "answer": "Based on the information provided, it appears that there are several legal issues surrounding your father's ownership of the land. It is recommended that you consult with a local property lawyer who can provide you with more specific advice on your situation. However, here are some general points to consider:High Court application for demarcation: While it is possible to file an application in the High Court for demarcation of the land, the success of such an application would depend on the specific circumstances of your case. A property lawyer can advise you on the viability of this option.Filing a civil suit: If the Circle Officer has advised you to file a civil suit, it may be necessary to do so in order to resolve the issue of ownership of the land. You would need to file the suit against the parties who are claiming ownership of the land and seek a declaration of your father's title to the land.Limitation period: The limitation period for filing a suit to establish ownership of land is 12 years from the date when the adverse possession started. In your case, it is unclear when the adverse possession began, so it is important to consult with a lawyer to determine whether the suit would be barred by limitation.Adverse possession: If the occupiers of the land have been in possession of the land for more than 12 years, they may be able to claim ownership of the land through adverse possession. However, if the possession was not lawful or if they obtained possession through fraud or misrepresentation, they may not be able to claim adverse possession. A lawyer can advise you on the specific circumstances of your case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Transfer",
    "answer": "If  your grandfather is the only legal heir on whose name this property was transferred and he is the lone person owning and enjoying the property then he can transfer the property on his name to anyone of his choice, thus if you want this property to be transferred to your name he can transfer the same to your name by Gift under Muslim law.Each and every property that remains within the ownership of an individual can be inherited by his successors. Whenever a Muslim dies, all his property whether acquired by him during his lifetime or inherited from his ancestors can be inherited by his legal heirs.A Muslim is allowed to give away his whole property in his lifetime.Also, the religion of the person to whom the gift is made is irrelevant. The transfer of property through the way of gift is immediate and without consideration. It is an unconditional transfer of property. Although the gift being a property has to be governed by theTransfer of property act, 1882. But Chapter 7 ofTransfer of Property Act1882 does not cover the gift under Muslim law. So, the Muslim Personal law governs the Muslim gift or “Hiba”.This Hiba deed need not be executed by a registered document and also the Hiba can be oral too.You can get the property transferred to your name by Hiba.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

These conditions are as follow:Declaration of gift by the donor.Acceptance of gift by the donee.Transfer of possession by the donor and it’s acceptance by the donee. TheSupreme Court in Mahaboob Saheb's Case- summarized the rules ofMohammadan relating to gifts as stated byMulla\" as follows:-Sec 147 ... \"that writing is not essential to the validity of gift either of moveable or immoveable property\"Sec148 ... \"essential to the validity of a gift that the donor should divest himself completely of all ownership and dominion over the subject-matter of gift\"Sec150 ... For a valid gift there should be delivery of possession of the subject-matter of the gift and taking of possession of the gift   by the donee either actually or  constructively; andSee152... Where the donor isin possession a gift of immovable property of which the donor is in actual possession is not complete, unless the donor physically departs from the premises with all his good and chattels, and the done formally enters into possession.  It is thus clear that the gift need not be . in writing and consequently noregistration is required.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "If  your grandfather is the only legal heir on whose name this property was transferred and he is the lone person owning and enjoying the property then he can transfer the property on his name to anyone of his choice, thus if you want this property to be transferred to your name he can transfer the same to your name by Gift under Muslim law.Each and every property that remains within the ownership of an individual can be inherited by his successors. Whenever a Muslim dies, all his property whether acquired by him during his lifetime or inherited from his ancestors can be inherited by his legal heirs.A Muslim is allowed to give away his whole property in his lifetime.Also, the religion of the person to whom the gift is made is irrelevant. The transfer of property through the way of gift is immediate and without consideration. It is an unconditional transfer of property. Although the gift being a property has to be governed by theTransfer of property act, 1882. But Chapter 7 ofTransfer of Property Act1882 does not cover the gift under Muslim law. So, the Muslim Personal law governs the Muslim gift or “Hiba”.This Hiba deed need not be executed by a registered document and also the Hiba can be oral too.You can get the property transferred to your name by Hiba.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

These conditions are as follow:Declaration of gift by the donor.Acceptance of gift by the donee.Transfer of possession by the donor and it’s acceptance by the donee. TheSupreme Court in Mahaboob Saheb's Case- summarized the rules ofMohammadan relating to gifts as stated byMulla\" as follows:-Sec 147 ... \"that writing is not essential to the validity of gift either of moveable or immoveable property\"Sec148 ... \"essential to the validity of a gift that the donor should divest himself completely of all ownership and dominion over the subject-matter of gift\"Sec150 ... For a valid gift there should be delivery of possession of the subject-matter of the gift and taking of possession of the gift   by the donee either actually or  constructively; andSee152... Where the donor isin possession a gift of immovable property of which the donor is in actual possession is not complete, unless the donor physically departs from the premises with all his good and chattels, and the done formally enters into possession.  It is thus clear that the gift need not be . in writing and consequently noregistration is required.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Demarcation of Land",
    "answer": "Based on the information provided, it appears that there are several legal issues surrounding your father's ownership of the land. It is recommended that you consult with a local property lawyer who can provide you with more specific advice on your situation. However, here are some general points to consider:High Court application for demarcation: While it is possible to file an application in the High Court for demarcation of the land, the success of such an application would depend on the specific circumstances of your case. A property lawyer can advise you on the viability of this option.Filing a civil suit: If the Circle Officer has advised you to file a civil suit, it may be necessary to do so in order to resolve the issue of ownership of the land. You would need to file the suit against the parties who are claiming ownership of the land and seek a declaration of your father's title to the land.Limitation period: The limitation period for filing a suit to establish ownership of land is 12 years from the date when the adverse possession started. In your case, it is unclear when the adverse possession began, so it is important to consult with a lawyer to determine whether the suit would be barred by limitation.Adverse possession: If the occupiers of the land have been in possession of the land for more than 12 years, they may be able to claim ownership of the land through adverse possession. However, if the possession was not lawful or if they obtained possession through fraud or misrepresentation, they may not be able to claim adverse possession. A lawyer can advise you on the specific circumstances of your case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Transfer",
    "answer": "If  your grandfather is the only legal heir on whose name this property was transferred and he is the lone person owning and enjoying the property then he can transfer the property on his name to anyone of his choice, thus if you want this property to be transferred to your name he can transfer the same to your name by Gift under Muslim law.Each and every property that remains within the ownership of an individual can be inherited by his successors. Whenever a Muslim dies, all his property whether acquired by him during his lifetime or inherited from his ancestors can be inherited by his legal heirs.A Muslim is allowed to give away his whole property in his lifetime.Also, the religion of the person to whom the gift is made is irrelevant. The transfer of property through the way of gift is immediate and without consideration. It is an unconditional transfer of property. Although the gift being a property has to be governed by theTransfer of property act, 1882. But Chapter 7 ofTransfer of Property Act1882 does not cover the gift under Muslim law. So, the Muslim Personal law governs the Muslim gift or “Hiba”.This Hiba deed need not be executed by a registered document and also the Hiba can be oral too.You can get the property transferred to your name by Hiba.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

These conditions are as follow:Declaration of gift by the donor.Acceptance of gift by the donee.Transfer of possession by the donor and it’s acceptance by the donee. TheSupreme Court in Mahaboob Saheb's Case- summarized the rules ofMohammadan relating to gifts as stated byMulla\" as follows:-Sec 147 ... \"that writing is not essential to the validity of gift either of moveable or immoveable property\"Sec148 ... \"essential to the validity of a gift that the donor should divest himself completely of all ownership and dominion over the subject-matter of gift\"Sec150 ... For a valid gift there should be delivery of possession of the subject-matter of the gift and taking of possession of the gift   by the donee either actually or  constructively; andSee152... Where the donor isin possession a gift of immovable property of which the donor is in actual possession is not complete, unless the donor physically departs from the premises with all his good and chattels, and the done formally enters into possession.  It is thus clear that the gift need not be . in writing and consequently noregistration is required.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Demarcation of Land",
    "answer": "Based on the information provided, it appears that there are several legal issues surrounding your father's ownership of the land. It is recommended that you consult with a local property lawyer who can provide you with more specific advice on your situation. However, here are some general points to consider:High Court application for demarcation: While it is possible to file an application in the High Court for demarcation of the land, the success of such an application would depend on the specific circumstances of your case. A property lawyer can advise you on the viability of this option.Filing a civil suit: If the Circle Officer has advised you to file a civil suit, it may be necessary to do so in order to resolve the issue of ownership of the land. You would need to file the suit against the parties who are claiming ownership of the land and seek a declaration of your father's title to the land.Limitation period: The limitation period for filing a suit to establish ownership of land is 12 years from the date when the adverse possession started. In your case, it is unclear when the adverse possession began, so it is important to consult with a lawyer to determine whether the suit would be barred by limitation.Adverse possession: If the occupiers of the land have been in possession of the land for more than 12 years, they may be able to claim ownership of the land through adverse possession. However, if the possession was not lawful or if they obtained possession through fraud or misrepresentation, they may not be able to claim adverse possession. A lawyer can advise you on the specific circumstances of your case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It is recommended that you consult with a local property lawyer who can provide you with more specific advice on your situation. However, here are some general points to consider:High Court application for demarcation: While it is possible to file an application in the High Court for demarcation of the land, the success of such an application would depend on the specific circumstances of your case. A property lawyer can advise you on the viability of this option.Filing a civil suit: If the Circle Officer has advised you to file a civil suit, it may be necessary to do so in order to resolve the issue of ownership of the land. You would need to file the suit against the parties who are claiming ownership of the land and seek a declaration of your father's title to the land.Limitation period: The limitation period for filing a suit to establish ownership of land is 12 years from the date when the adverse possession started. In your case, it is unclear when the adverse possession began, so it is important to consult with a lawyer to determine whether the suit would be barred by limitation.Adverse possession: If the occupiers of the land have been in possession of the land for more than 12 years, they may be able to claim ownership of the land through adverse possession. However, if the possession was not lawful or if they obtained possession through fraud or misrepresentation, they may not be able to claim adverse possession.

    "question": "P.O. is on O.D.",
    "answer": "Dear client,The phrase \"IA 787 of 22 is dismissed\" refers to an interlocutory application (IA) filed in a divorce proceeding. In this case, IA 787, which was filed in the year 2022, has been dismissed by the court.An interlocutory application is a request or motion filed by one party during the course of a legal proceeding, seeking a specific order or direction from the court. It is a procedural step taken within the larger legal case.When an IA is dismissed, it means that the court has rejected the application and the relief sought by the party filing it. The court may have found the application to be without merit or not supported by sufficient evidence, or it may have determined that the relief requested is not appropriate in the given circumstances.The dismissal of an IA does not necessarily determine the final outcome of the overall divorce proceeding. It simply means that the specific application has been denied. The divorce case may still continue, and other issues and applications can be addressed separately.It is advisable to consult with your legal counsel or the concerned court for further clarification and to understand the impact of the dismissal on your particular case. They will be able to provide you with specific guidance and advice based on the details of your divorce proceedings.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In this case, IA 787, which was filed in the year 2022, has been dismissed by the court.An interlocutory application is a request or motion filed by one party during the course of a legal proceeding, seeking a specific order or direction from the court. It is a procedural step taken within the larger legal case.When an IA is dismissed, it means that the court has rejected the application and the relief sought by the party filing it. The court may have found the application to be without merit or not supported by sufficient evidence, or it may have determined that the relief requested is not appropriate in the given circumstances.The dismissal of an IA does not necessarily determine the final outcome of the overall divorce proceeding. It simply means that the specific application has been denied. The divorce case may still continue, and other issues and applications can be addressed separately.It is advisable to consult with your legal counsel or the concerned court for further clarification and to understand the impact of the dismissal on your particular case. They will be able to provide you with specific guidance and advice based on the details of your divorce proceedings.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Full & Final Settlement",
    "answer": "The Factories Act 1948 u/s 60 prohibits dual employment. However, this is limited to factory workers and does not govern other sectors of employment. If the employment letter does not forbid dual employment and there is no non-compete clause, an employee can engage in moonlighting.Though moonlighting isn't totally prohibited in India, there are several acts that talk about dual employment.Organizations that are not covered by the Factories Act must specify the stipulation related to double employment by way of dual employment clause in the appointment letter or employee’s agreement or offer letter. The employment agreement must state what restrictions have been placed on double employment and that the employee is prohibited from engaging in additional employment or profession till they’re under their current employer’s services.Therefore in the absence of any such condition in your employment offer letter, you can issue a legal notice to the company demanding three months salary for terminating your services without any valid reason.For recovering your dues from the employer you should not rely upon the oral or email notifications alone, you should write to them directly and send the communication by registered post or resort to send a legal notice through your advocate and demand the dues including the three months salary for terminating your services without any legally valid reason.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Under Muslim Law the marriage contract is not required to be reduced in writing andan oral marriage is also valid.2) Strictly speaking, under the Muslim law there is no requirement of a particular ceremony of solemnization but such ceremonies are not specifically barred as well. But there are some basic tenets of a complete matrimonial contract. This concept would include a proposal of marriage Ijab and the acceptance of the marriage which in technical term is called Qubul. These are the two basic concepts without which a marriage cannot be said to have been performed. The Ijab and Qubul i.e. offer and acceptance has to be reasonably certain for a completed transaction.3) Such offer and acceptance i.e. Ijab and Qubul is required to be made in the presence and hearing of witnesses (shahadat) who must be Muslims and must be competent to contract their own marriages. The witnesses must hear the Ijab and Qubul with clarity. The Ijab and Qubul must be made in the same sitting (majlis-e-wahid) signifying continuity of transaction. If Ijab and Qubul are performed in a legal manner, marriage contract is said to be completed.Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

This must be done in one sitting.(ii) The acceptance must be corresponding to what is being offered.iii) The marriage must be effectively immediate. If the Wali says I will marry her to you after two months, there is no marriage.(iv) The two parties must be legally competent; i.e. they must be sane and adult.(v) The women must not be from the forbidden class.(vi) The consent given must be free consent,. It must not be an outcome of compulsion, duess, coercion or undue influence.Under the Muslim law, a valid marriage is that which has been constituted in accordance with the essential conditions prescribed above.It confers upon the wife; the right of dower, maintenance and residence, imposes on her obligation to be faithful and obedient to her husband, admit sexual intercourse with him & observe Iddat.Registration of marriage in Muslims is compulsory and mandatory, as a Muslim marriage is treated as a civil contract. According to section 3 of Muslim Marriages Registration Act 1981- “Every marriage contracted between Muslims after the commencement of this Act, shall be registered as hereinafter provided, within thirty days from the conclusion of the Nikah Ceremony”. Nikahnama is a type of legal document in Muslim marriages which contains the essential conditions/details of the marriage.In view of above, if your marriage with her had followed the prescribed procedures, she would be entitled to certain rights on you as your legally wedded wife.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

Alternately you can lend the money and evidence that by entering into a loan agreement or obtain a promissory note, so that you can proceed at a later stage as per the oral promise to get a flat registered on your name in lieu of this loan amount.2. The answer for this question is given above.3.

Do not transfer the funds on the basis of gift just to avoid stamp duty in the context of the registration of the sale agreement.A registered sale agreement would protect your interest and a safety for the funds you have transferred to your father.If there was no problem foresaw in this transaction, you would not have got any doubt about this transfer, hence in order to safeguard your money and also to secure the desired flat at a later stage, it is advisable that you enter into  a sale agreement with your father and get it registered through your power of attorney agent so that the sale agreement is recognised as a legally valid document for all future needs.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "-    Filing Criminal case is usual pressure tactic. You have to put your foot down.-    I don’t think police still filed FIR. It will be complaint only. Ask them to lodge FIR to investigate.Mostly police will not file FIR since civil suit is there. Submit your reply stating case details.Submit Auditor reports, no need to worry since auditor reports are there.If FIR then Immediately apply anticipatory Bail.-    Is all properties are included in partition suit. If not then you can ask for dismissal of suit.-    They not gave you offer to buy their share. Because as per law, they have to make offer to your father to buy their share as per market rate.

    "answer": "Dear client,If the trust to which your grandfather gifted the property is not a registered trust, it may have implications on its legal standing and enforceability. However, I am not a lawyer, and the specific laws and regulations regarding unregistered trusts can vary depending on the jurisdiction.In general, a registered trust holds more legal weight and credibility compared to an unregistered trust. An unregistered trust may face challenges in asserting its rights and carrying out certain activities, especially if it involves property transactions or commercial use.In your case, if the unregistered trust is not willing to use the property as a function hall as you desire, it would be advisable to consult with a lawyer who specializes in property and trust law. They can review the specific details of the trust and the property ownership, and provide advice on the legal options available to you.The lawyer may assess whether the trust has the legal authority to use the property for commercial purposes or whether it is limited to certain specified purposes. They can also guide you on potential legal remedies, such as seeking an injunction or legal action to protect your rights and interests, or exploring options for resolving the dispute through negotiation or mediation.It's important to consult with a qualified legal professional who can provide advice based on the specific laws and regulations applicable in your jurisdiction and the details of your case. They will be able to assess the legal standing of the unregistered trust and provide guidance on the best course of action for you to pursue.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Name mismatch in Share certificate",
    "answer": "The society may be in hand in gloves with the seller and the seller seems to be desperate to somehow sell the property which appears to be with defective title to the seller.Why do you hesitate to refer the matter before a local lawyer for a legal opinion?The paltry amount you may spare to obtain legal opinion may save your huge money that may get tangled by buying the title defective property.The society's clarification about this is unreliable because it is not a petty or minor error, it is related to an immovable property, hence the secretary cannot decide to render clarification on his own without the approval of the general or emergency meeting of all the members of the society.Besides if the society decides to give clarification through their letter head, will they then indemnify the buyer against any legal dispute in this regard at a later stage?If this error was detected at the stage where you have not yet bought the property, it is advisable that you get the things made straight before you buy it or you may ignore the idea of buying this defective property.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Following are the ways in which ancestral properties are transferred to legal heirs…By partition of properties among legal hers either through court of by registration of a partition/settlement deed.By registration of gift/relinquishment deeds.By execution of will. If will is executed, property will be transferred to beneficiaries after the demise of testator/will maker.You can choose any of the following means to get the properties transferred in your favour. No permission is required by PIO/NRI for receiving property through partition/gift/will as stipulated by Rule 24. (NDI) from RBI or Income Tax Authority.A will registered abroad with respect to movable and immovable properties in India is valid and enforceable in India.A will executed by NRI can include movable assets like bank FD/insurance claims.There is no tax implication for inheriting, receiving ancestral You need not pay any CGT or other tax.A partition deed and family settlement deed is document registered among legal heirs dividing properties on agreed terms. There is minimum stamp duty on registration of such documents. If the State in which properties are located is known, exact amount of stamp duty and other charges can be known.Parents don’t need any POA from you to transfer properties to you, they can do it directly.It depends in which State the properties are situated.Transfer of properties through will takes place only after death of testator. Gift/relinquishment deed are registered by family members when they are alive.It is safe and better option to get the properties transferred through gift/relinquish deeds as you have to wait till the death of testator to get the properties transferred to you.Mention Section pertains to gifts made by relatives to other relatives. It has nothing to do with transfer of properties among legal heirs.

You can obtain probate of Will through a court from that country, get the certified copy of the court decree apostilled and enforce the Will in India as per the procedures for that in India.2. Yes, the the movable properties also can be bequeathed in the Will.3. There is no tax payable on acquisition of immovable properties through gift deeds.4. It would be better that a registered settlement deed is made to excess avoid stamp duty.5. Power of attorney to your parents cannot help you to inherit the properties from your parents itself.6. The probate of Will would be legally valid process to acquire the property bequeathed through a Will without much legal hassle.7. Don't get confused, the Will is different from gift deed.If your parents want to transfer their property to you they can straightaway execute a registered settlement deed instead of going for a Will and again by transferring the same through a gift deed.8. You can do it.9.

No permission is required by PIO/NRI for receiving property through partition/gift/will as stipulated by Rule 24. (NDI) from RBI or Income Tax Authority.A will registered abroad with respect to movable and immovable properties in India is valid and enforceable in India.A will executed by NRI can include movable assets like bank FD/insurance claims.There is no tax implication for inheriting, receiving ancestral You need not pay any CGT or other tax.A partition deed and family settlement deed is document registered among legal heirs dividing properties on agreed terms. There is minimum stamp duty on registration of such documents. If the State in which properties are located is known, exact amount of stamp duty and other charges can be known.Parents don’t need any POA from you to transfer properties to you, they can do it directly.It depends in which State the properties are situated.Transfer of properties through will takes place only after death of testator. Gift/relinquishment deed are registered by family members when they are alive.It is safe and better option to get the properties transferred through gift/relinquish deeds as you have to wait till the death of testator to get the properties transferred to you.Mention Section pertains to gifts made by relatives to other relatives.

Yes, the the movable properties also can be bequeathed in the Will.3. There is no tax payable on acquisition of immovable properties through gift deeds.4. It would be better that a registered settlement deed is made to excess avoid stamp duty.5. Power of attorney to your parents cannot help you to inherit the properties from your parents itself.6. The probate of Will would be legally valid process to acquire the property bequeathed through a Will without much legal hassle.7. Don't get confused, the Will is different from gift deed.If your parents want to transfer their property to you they can straightaway execute a registered settlement deed instead of going for a Will and again by transferring the same through a gift deed.8. You can do it.9.

    "question": "Inheritance of property from parents (in India) to a US Citizen on OCI",
    "answer": "You cannot acquire agricultural property either by sale or by gift from your parents, though you can inherit agricultural property as a successor in interest/legal heirs after the lifetime of your parents.For inheritance of agricultural property ther is no requirement to obtain permission from RBI, the only condition for such inheritance is that it can be inherited after the lifetime of the owner of the property by virtue of legal heirs to the deceased.You cannot inherit the agricultural property from your parents during their lifetime.Acquiring an agricultural property by a NRI/OCI on lease is also prohibited.If you want to be confirmed about the property to be transferred to your name now itself then you can ask your parents to transfer the same by a testamentary disposition, however it will take effect or can be enforced only after the death of the testator.For your information even the registered Will can be cancelled or modified by the testator during his/her lifetime, therefore there is no guarantee  on that.If the land was bought on your name by a registered sale deed during the time of your minority by age and when you were an Indian citizen, then you do not have to get it transferred to your name because after attaining the age of majority you become an absolute owner and your father's guardianship will become infructuous.So you may revert with more clarity on this point for more proper opinion on this point.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Full & Final Settlement",
    "answer": "The Factories Act 1948 u/s 60 prohibits dual employment. However, this is limited to factory workers and does not govern other sectors of employment. If the employment letter does not forbid dual employment and there is no non-compete clause, an employee can engage in moonlighting.Though moonlighting isn't totally prohibited in India, there are several acts that talk about dual employment.Organizations that are not covered by the Factories Act must specify the stipulation related to double employment by way of dual employment clause in the appointment letter or employee’s agreement or offer letter. The employment agreement must state what restrictions have been placed on double employment and that the employee is prohibited from engaging in additional employment or profession till they’re under their current employer’s services.Therefore in the absence of any such condition in your employment offer letter, you can issue a legal notice to the company demanding three months salary for terminating your services without any valid reason.For recovering your dues from the employer you should not rely upon the oral or email notifications alone, you should write to them directly and send the communication by registered post or resort to send a legal notice through your advocate and demand the dues including the three months salary for terminating your services without any legally valid reason.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

But there are some basic tenets of a complete matrimonial contract. This concept would include a proposal of marriage Ijab and the acceptance of the marriage which in technical term is called Qubul. These are the two basic concepts without which a marriage cannot be said to have been performed. The Ijab and Qubul i.e. offer and acceptance has to be reasonably certain for a completed transaction.3) Such offer and acceptance i.e. Ijab and Qubul is required to be made in the presence and hearing of witnesses (shahadat) who must be Muslims and must be competent to contract their own marriages. The witnesses must hear the Ijab and Qubul with clarity. The Ijab and Qubul must be made in the same sitting (majlis-e-wahid) signifying continuity of transaction.

This must be done in one sitting.(ii) The acceptance must be corresponding to what is being offered.iii) The marriage must be effectively immediate. If the Wali says I will marry her to you after two months, there is no marriage.(iv) The two parties must be legally competent; i.e. they must be sane and adult.(v) The women must not be from the forbidden class.(vi) The consent given must be free consent,. It must not be an outcome of compulsion, duess, coercion or undue influence.Under the Muslim law, a valid marriage is that which has been constituted in accordance with the essential conditions prescribed above.It confers upon the wife; the right of dower, maintenance and residence, imposes on her obligation to be faithful and obedient to her husband, admit sexual intercourse with him & observe Iddat.Registration of marriage in Muslims is compulsory and mandatory, as a Muslim marriage is treated as a civil contract. According to section 3 of Muslim Marriages Registration Act 1981- “Every marriage contracted between Muslims after the commencement of this Act, shall be registered as hereinafter provided, within thirty days from the conclusion of the Nikah Ceremony”. Nikahnama is a type of legal document in Muslim marriages which contains the essential conditions/details of the marriage.In view of above, if your marriage with her had followed the prescribed procedures, she would be entitled to certain rights on you as your legally wedded wife.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Full & Final Settlement",
    "answer": "The Factories Act 1948 u/s 60 prohibits dual employment. However, this is limited to factory workers and does not govern other sectors of employment. If the employment letter does not forbid dual employment and there is no non-compete clause, an employee can engage in moonlighting.Though moonlighting isn't totally prohibited in India, there are several acts that talk about dual employment.Organizations that are not covered by the Factories Act must specify the stipulation related to double employment by way of dual employment clause in the appointment letter or employee’s agreement or offer letter. The employment agreement must state what restrictions have been placed on double employment and that the employee is prohibited from engaging in additional employment or profession till they’re under their current employer’s services.Therefore in the absence of any such condition in your employment offer letter, you can issue a legal notice to the company demanding three months salary for terminating your services without any valid reason.For recovering your dues from the employer you should not rely upon the oral or email notifications alone, you should write to them directly and send the communication by registered post or resort to send a legal notice through your advocate and demand the dues including the three months salary for terminating your services without any legally valid reason.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

But there are some basic tenets of a complete matrimonial contract. This concept would include a proposal of marriage Ijab and the acceptance of the marriage which in technical term is called Qubul. These are the two basic concepts without which a marriage cannot be said to have been performed. The Ijab and Qubul i.e. offer and acceptance has to be reasonably certain for a completed transaction.3) Such offer and acceptance i.e. Ijab and Qubul is required to be made in the presence and hearing of witnesses (shahadat) who must be Muslims and must be competent to contract their own marriages. The witnesses must hear the Ijab and Qubul with clarity. The Ijab and Qubul must be made in the same sitting (majlis-e-wahid) signifying continuity of transaction. If Ijab and Qubul are performed in a legal manner, marriage contract is said to be completed.Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "question": "Verbal nikaah",
    "answer": "Under Muslim Law the marriage contract is not required to be reduced in writing andan oral marriage is also valid.2) Strictly speaking, under the Muslim law there is no requirement of a particular ceremony of solemnization but such ceremonies are not specifically barred as well. But there are some basic tenets of a complete matrimonial contract. This concept would include a proposal of marriage Ijab and the acceptance of the marriage which in technical term is called Qubul. These are the two basic concepts without which a marriage cannot be said to have been performed. The Ijab and Qubul i.e. offer and acceptance has to be reasonably certain for a completed transaction.3) Such offer and acceptance i.e. Ijab and Qubul is required to be made in the presence and hearing of witnesses (shahadat) who must be Muslims and must be competent to contract their own marriages. The witnesses must hear the Ijab and Qubul with clarity. The Ijab and Qubul must be made in the same sitting (majlis-e-wahid) signifying continuity of transaction. If Ijab and Qubul are performed in a legal manner, marriage contract is said to be completed.Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

This must be done in one sitting.(ii) The acceptance must be corresponding to what is being offered.iii) The marriage must be effectively immediate. If the Wali says I will marry her to you after two months, there is no marriage.(iv) The two parties must be legally competent; i.e. they must be sane and adult.(v) The women must not be from the forbidden class.(vi) The consent given must be free consent,. It must not be an outcome of compulsion, duess, coercion or undue influence.Under the Muslim law, a valid marriage is that which has been constituted in accordance with the essential conditions prescribed above.It confers upon the wife; the right of dower, maintenance and residence, imposes on her obligation to be faithful and obedient to her husband, admit sexual intercourse with him & observe Iddat.Registration of marriage in Muslims is compulsory and mandatory, as a Muslim marriage is treated as a civil contract. According to section 3 of Muslim Marriages Registration Act 1981- “Every marriage contracted between Muslims after the commencement of this Act, shall be registered as hereinafter provided, within thirty days from the conclusion of the Nikah Ceremony”. Nikahnama is a type of legal document in Muslim marriages which contains the essential conditions/details of the marriage.In view of above, if your marriage with her had followed the prescribed procedures, she would be entitled to certain rights on you as your legally wedded wife.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Full & Final Settlement",
    "answer": "The Factories Act 1948 u/s 60 prohibits dual employment. However, this is limited to factory workers and does not govern other sectors of employment. If the employment letter does not forbid dual employment and there is no non-compete clause, an employee can engage in moonlighting.Though moonlighting isn't totally prohibited in India, there are several acts that talk about dual employment.Organizations that are not covered by the Factories Act must specify the stipulation related to double employment by way of dual employment clause in the appointment letter or employee’s agreement or offer letter. The employment agreement must state what restrictions have been placed on double employment and that the employee is prohibited from engaging in additional employment or profession till they’re under their current employer’s services.Therefore in the absence of any such condition in your employment offer letter, you can issue a legal notice to the company demanding three months salary for terminating your services without any valid reason.For recovering your dues from the employer you should not rely upon the oral or email notifications alone, you should write to them directly and send the communication by registered post or resort to send a legal notice through your advocate and demand the dues including the three months salary for terminating your services without any legally valid reason.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "From the above notification it can be noted that the tenants are not given permission to cast their votes.However Allahabad high court in the judgment in M/a Designarch infrastructure Ltd vs. Chairman,  GDA (14.11.2013 ALLHC), has stated that a tenant is considered as an apartment owner for participation in AOA  related issues and can participate in the AOA elections both as a voter and a candidate and can become part of board, provided he has entered into a lawful tenancy of more than one year which should survive without a break,  the period between the declaration of AGM declaring the election and expiry of the upcoming Board of Management.A tenant cannot delegate his above rights to any other person.Only the person in whose name tenancy/lease deed is executed can participate in the election.The UP apartment Act section  2 (d) & (e), 3(d) and UP Urban buildings (Regulation of Letting,  Rent and  Eviction) Act, 1972 are some of relevant law in this context.Therefore all the eligible lawful tenants can issue a joint notice to the election committee or the Returning Officer for participating in the ensuing election.If your application is not entertained then you can immediately approach the Registrar of cooperative society with a complaint signed jointly by all aggrieved lawful tenants and seek relief and remedy or can file a suit for injunction to restrain the association from conducting the election without allowing your participation.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

If will is executed, property will be transferred to beneficiaries after the demise of testator/will maker.You can choose any of the following means to get the properties transferred in your favour. No permission is required by PIO/NRI for receiving property through partition/gift/will as stipulated by Rule 24. (NDI) from RBI or Income Tax Authority.A will registered abroad with respect to movable and immovable properties in India is valid and enforceable in India.A will executed by NRI can include movable assets like bank FD/insurance claims.There is no tax implication for inheriting, receiving ancestral You need not pay any CGT or other tax.A partition deed and family settlement deed is document registered among legal heirs dividing properties on agreed terms. There is minimum stamp duty on registration of such documents. If the State in which properties are located is known, exact amount of stamp duty and other charges can be known.Parents don’t need any POA from you to transfer properties to you, they can do it directly.It depends in which State the properties are situated.Transfer of properties through will takes place only after death of testator. Gift/relinquishment deed are registered by family members when they are alive.It is safe and better option to get the properties transferred through gift/relinquish deeds as you have to wait till the death of testator to get the properties transferred to you.Mention Section pertains to gifts made by relatives to other relatives.

The probate of Will would be legally valid process to acquire the property bequeathed through a Will without much legal hassle.7.

    "answer": "Dear client,If the trust to which your grandfather gifted the property is not a registered trust, it may have implications on its legal standing and enforceability. However, I am not a lawyer, and the specific laws and regulations regarding unregistered trusts can vary depending on the jurisdiction.In general, a registered trust holds more legal weight and credibility compared to an unregistered trust. An unregistered trust may face challenges in asserting its rights and carrying out certain activities, especially if it involves property transactions or commercial use.In your case, if the unregistered trust is not willing to use the property as a function hall as you desire, it would be advisable to consult with a lawyer who specializes in property and trust law. They can review the specific details of the trust and the property ownership, and provide advice on the legal options available to you.The lawyer may assess whether the trust has the legal authority to use the property for commercial purposes or whether it is limited to certain specified purposes. They can also guide you on potential legal remedies, such as seeking an injunction or legal action to protect your rights and interests, or exploring options for resolving the dispute through negotiation or mediation.It's important to consult with a qualified legal professional who can provide advice based on the specific laws and regulations applicable in your jurisdiction and the details of your case. They will be able to assess the legal standing of the unregistered trust and provide guidance on the best course of action for you to pursue.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, I am not a lawyer, and the specific laws and regulations regarding unregistered trusts can vary depending on the jurisdiction.In general, a registered trust holds more legal weight and credibility compared to an unregistered trust. An unregistered trust may face challenges in asserting its rights and carrying out certain activities, especially if it involves property transactions or commercial use.In your case, if the unregistered trust is not willing to use the property as a function hall as you desire, it would be advisable to consult with a lawyer who specializes in property and trust law. They can review the specific details of the trust and the property ownership, and provide advice on the legal options available to you.The lawyer may assess whether the trust has the legal authority to use the property for commercial purposes or whether it is limited to certain specified purposes. They can also guide you on potential legal remedies, such as seeking an injunction or legal action to protect your rights and interests, or exploring options for resolving the dispute through negotiation or mediation.It's important to consult with a qualified legal professional who can provide advice based on the specific laws and regulations applicable in your jurisdiction and the details of your case.

    "question": "Selling property to family",
    "answer": "1.  The construction of property is yet to begin, hence you can enter into a sale agreement with your father to purchase a flat as promised by him in return of the funds you had provided him.  Sale deed for non existing structure is not valid. Alternately you can lend the money and evidence that by entering into a loan agreement or obtain a promissory note, so that you can proceed at a later stage as per the oral promise to get a flat registered on your name in lieu of this loan amount.2. The answer for this question is given above.3. The unregistered sale agreement is not enforceable in law especially in case of a dispute in this regard, you may not be able to get the flat registered if he refuses.Hence you and your wife can give a power of attorney deed in favor of any close relative in India to enter into the sale agreement with your father which can be registered through your power agent itself to make the sale agreement valid in the eyes of law..4   You can decide about the quantum of money to be transferred to him based on the market value of the property desirous to buy.5. Do not transfer the funds on the basis of gift just to avoid stamp duty in the context of the registration of the sale agreement.A registered sale agreement would protect your interest and a safety for the funds you have transferred to your father.If there was no problem foresaw in this transaction, you would not have got any doubt about this transfer, hence in order to safeguard your money and also to secure the desired flat at a later stage, it is advisable that you enter into  a sale agreement with your father and get it registered through your power of attorney agent so that the sale agreement is recognised as a legally valid document for all future needs.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

The answer for this question is given above.3.
