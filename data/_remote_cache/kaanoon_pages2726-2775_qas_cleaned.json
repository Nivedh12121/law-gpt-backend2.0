    "question": "Adding name to sale deed",
    "answer": "If the existing co purchasers have no objection against inclusion of your name as a co purchaser then I don't see any reason why the builder would have a problemThe existing co purchasers would not be selling any part of their share to youYou are just being included as a co purchaser with themFor that a supplementary agreement has to be made in which it would be stated that all the terms of the principal agreement would remain same and be binding on all the 3 co purchasers nowSo the builder will be the seller, the existing co purchasers would be the confirming parties and you would be the 3rd joint purchaserThe allotment of the new flat would happen jointly to all the 3 co purchasers under the supplementary agreementThis agreement would not attract any stamp duty since the duty is already paid on the principal agreement and there would be nominal registration feeThe builder is concerned with his money. So whether that is paid by 2 or 3 co purchasers it should hardly matter to himSo whatever contribution you would make towards the sale price to the builder, for that you can claim capital gains tax exemptionIf you go for an assignment of rights by the existing co purchasers to you by paying them certain amount then such assignment would be subject to the main agreement. The builder may ask for a transfer fee in that case.Under the Gift deed option as suggested by the builder I fail to understand how he would then bind you under the terms of the main agreement which would contain many protection clauses in favour of the builderThe gift deed will be between the existing co purchasers and yourself. So how will there be a privity of contract between you and the builder? In case of any breach of the agreement terms the builder cannot sue you as there would be no privity of contract with you. He can only sue his original co purchasers. So his suggestion of gift deed is strangeAlso since no consideration would pass under the gift deed you cannot also claim any capital gains tax exemptionYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "1.  You cannot physically stop her marriage.IOf you came to know about the exparte divorce then you may have to rush to the court to file a set aside petition to set aside the exparte divorce decision.But the court cannot stop her marriage or nullify the remarriage if already done because it is more than one month from the date of passing the orders for exparte divorce.What were you doing all thes one year without knowing her activities, because if at all the divorce was granted one year ago, she certainly would have filed the divorce case at least one and half a year ago, therefore it can be deemed that you were not living together for a period over two years,Therefore it cannot be said that she had given a wrong address to obtain this divorce fraudulently since you might have changed your address in the period of separation which she may not be aware hence she had sent the summons to the address known to her, however this will not stop you from filing a set aside petition, but mere filing the set aside petition will not stop her from going ahead with her proposal to remarry until and unless there is a restrain order from court.In that case you may have to file an application before the court along with your set aside petition seeking to restrain her from marrying again in the course of the court taking decision to set aside the exparte divorce decision.There is no question of she committing an act of bigamy by marrying again especially when she has a divorce decree granted by a court of law.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Section 202 Cr.p.c.  states thus:Any Magistrate, on receipt of a complaint of an offence of which he is authorised to take cognizance or which has been made over to him under section 192, may, if he thinks fit and shall in a case where the accused is residing at a place beyond the area in which he exercises his jurisdiction, postpone the issue of process against the accused, and either inquire into the case himself or direct an investigation to be made by a police officer or by such other person as he thinks fit, for the purpose of deciding whether or not there is sufficient ground for proceeding;1.  The high court already has passed the order dismissing the quash petition for the reasons shown therein, however since the complaint is once again made afresh it will be a new case to which the proposed quash is sought, but it should be pleaded on merits and not on the jurisdictional point of view because the previous judgment is very clear about the jurisdictional aspect.2. High court may not entertain any fresh quash petition on the same grounds just because the charges under other sections were dropped.In fact the plea taken over the jurisdictional point of view seeking to quash the FIR may not be entertained because the case is at the preliminary stage only, if the charge sheet is filed after investigation and you find any lacuna in the investigation or feel that the charges are false then you can file a quash petition to quash the charge sheet on the basis of the contents of the charge sheet alone and not o the jurisdictional point of view, because the investigation has been conducted by the agency and has submitted their final report, therefore the court which is taking cognizance of the offence can be an additional adverse inference over your plea of jurisdictional point.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "376, 307 charges dropped in chargesheet submission and to harass us new complaint filed u/s 420",
    "answer": "Section 202 empowers Magistrate to postpone issue of summons to accused until be directs investigation by police or himself inquires in to the complaint as any offence  is made out or not. Magistrate  is in doubt whether any offence  is made out or not.Having once approached High Court and the High Court having declined to quash FIR, there is very bleak possibility that their petition will be entertained.They can certainly approach High Court for quash of fresh complaint underSection 406, 418 and 420 as it is an after thought.  Complaint is filed to compensate for dropping of charges.Ingredients of offence under Section 376 and 307 are distinct fromSection 498A. The complainant being wife, quash will not be entertained by High Court.Grounds of jurisdiction in 498A is not available now, as law laid down in Jacob v.

    "question": "376, 307 charges dropped in chargesheet submission and to harass us new complaint filed u/s 420",
    "answer": "Section 202 Cr.p.c.  states thus:Any Magistrate, on receipt of a complaint of an offence of which he is authorised to take cognizance or which has been made over to him under section 192, may, if he thinks fit and shall in a case where the accused is residing at a place beyond the area in which he exercises his jurisdiction, postpone the issue of process against the accused, and either inquire into the case himself or direct an investigation to be made by a police officer or by such other person as he thinks fit, for the purpose of deciding whether or not there is sufficient ground for proceeding;1.  The high court already has passed the order dismissing the quash petition for the reasons shown therein, however since the complaint is once again made afresh it will be a new case to which the proposed quash is sought, but it should be pleaded on merits and not on the jurisdictional point of view because the previous judgment is very clear about the jurisdictional aspect.2. High court may not entertain any fresh quash petition on the same grounds just because the charges under other sections were dropped.In fact the plea taken over the jurisdictional point of view seeking to quash the FIR may not be entertained because the case is at the preliminary stage only, if the charge sheet is filed after investigation and you find any lacuna in the investigation or feel that the charges are false then you can file a quash petition to quash the charge sheet on the basis of the contents of the charge sheet alone and not o the jurisdictional point of view, because the investigation has been conducted by the agency and has submitted their final report, therefore the court which is taking cognizance of the offence can be an additional adverse inference over your plea of jurisdictional point.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "1.  You cannot physically stop her marriage.IOf you came to know about the exparte divorce then you may have to rush to the court to file a set aside petition to set aside the exparte divorce decision.But the court cannot stop her marriage or nullify the remarriage if already done because it is more than one month from the date of passing the orders for exparte divorce.What were you doing all thes one year without knowing her activities, because if at all the divorce was granted one year ago, she certainly would have filed the divorce case at least one and half a year ago, therefore it can be deemed that you were not living together for a period over two years,Therefore it cannot be said that she had given a wrong address to obtain this divorce fraudulently since you might have changed your address in the period of separation which she may not be aware hence she had sent the summons to the address known to her, however this will not stop you from filing a set aside petition, but mere filing the set aside petition will not stop her from going ahead with her proposal to remarry until and unless there is a restrain order from court.In that case you may have to file an application before the court along with your set aside petition seeking to restrain her from marrying again in the course of the court taking decision to set aside the exparte divorce decision.There is no question of she committing an act of bigamy by marrying again especially when she has a divorce decree granted by a court of law.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "1.  You cannot physically stop her marriage.IOf you came to know about the exparte divorce then you may have to rush to the court to file a set aside petition to set aside the exparte divorce decision.But the court cannot stop her marriage or nullify the remarriage if already done because it is more than one month from the date of passing the orders for exparte divorce.What were you doing all thes one year without knowing her activities, because if at all the divorce was granted one year ago, she certainly would have filed the divorce case at least one and half a year ago, therefore it can be deemed that you were not living together for a period over two years,Therefore it cannot be said that she had given a wrong address to obtain this divorce fraudulently since you might have changed your address in the period of separation which she may not be aware hence she had sent the summons to the address known to her, however this will not stop you from filing a set aside petition, but mere filing the set aside petition will not stop her from going ahead with her proposal to remarry until and unless there is a restrain order from court.In that case you may have to file an application before the court along with your set aside petition seeking to restrain her from marrying again in the course of the court taking decision to set aside the exparte divorce decision.There is no question of she committing an act of bigamy by marrying again especially when she has a divorce decree granted by a court of law.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "You wanted to avail the benefits adopting short cut methods hence you fell prey to your own fault/mistake.How can you sign the papers without knowing what is written in it?The insurance advisers or the staff may coerce you with attractive offers which may actually not exist.One question to the person about the clarity though their brochures or any other pamphlet would have enlightened you about the fraud that those people are trying to play on yo in order to promote their own business.If the police conditions say that you cannot encash the amount during the lock in period or within a stipulated time period then you cannot get any relief even if you approach court because the insurance company will express their inability to come to yor rescue owing to the conditions that are printed in the policy.This appears to be yearly premium payment and you have paid the first year premium, hence you would be required to pay the premiums for the entire term of the policy in order to get the full maturity benefits, thus if you want to cancel the police, you may have to go through the policy conditions by which you will be entitled to surrender the police after deductions of certain amount as mentioned therein.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "You admit that it is not your house and also admit that your brother only funded for purchase and construction of this house property, your sentimental attachment to this property will not entitle you to have any share in the property as a right.Since you are likely to retire from your employment, you may either buy a small house out of your terminal benefits or better rent a house and stay there instead of creating problems for your brother as well as you.However if you still want to claim a share in the property, you as one of the legal heirs to your deceased father, can file a suit for partition seeking division of property and to permit you to live in that house till the disposal of the suit for partition without interference of your brother, because this property was purchased on your deceased father's name and not on your brother's name though he had fully funded for the purchase of this property.Let him prove the facts before court and retrieve his property if court is passing a judgment in his favor, which would be very difficult.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

Agreement is a mutual understanding between a person who offers to do an act for a consideration to receive something for that from another person who accepts the same for the terms and conditions mutually agreed between the parties. There will be also a clause for violation of the terms and conditions in the agreement. If any one of the parties violates, then the violating party will be liable for the penalty or remedy mentioned in the agreement. Normally, if the violating party is obeying the violation clause, there will also be a litigation clause to claim their remedy as per the terms and conditions of the agreement. The litigation may be either from the appropriate court of laws depending upon the territorial or monetary jurisdiction of the parties to the agreement or with the Arbitration clause in which the Arbitrator will be appointed as per the Arbitration act.KumaresanAdvocate, Coimbatore38 AnswersTalk to Advocate Kumaresan"

So whether that is paid by 2 or 3 co purchasers it should hardly matter to himSo whatever contribution you would make towards the sale price to the builder, for that you can claim capital gains tax exemptionIf you go for an assignment of rights by the existing co purchasers to you by paying them certain amount then such assignment would be subject to the main agreement. The builder may ask for a transfer fee in that case.Under the Gift deed option as suggested by the builder I fail to understand how he would then bind you under the terms of the main agreement which would contain many protection clauses in favour of the builderThe gift deed will be between the existing co purchasers and yourself. So how will there be a privity of contract between you and the builder? In case of any breach of the agreement terms the builder cannot sue you as there would be no privity of contract with you. He can only sue his original co purchasers. So his suggestion of gift deed is strangeAlso since no consideration would pass under the gift deed you cannot also claim any capital gains tax exemptionYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Agreement between insurer and insured is governed by general law of land,” Indian Contract Act,” terms of agreement contrary to  provisions of the Act and not valid and not enforceable. The clause as to lock in period of 5 years is illegal. Any party can rescind the agreement under forcing circumstances. You can very much surrender the police and collect the premium paid with interest. File a complaint in District Consumer Commission seeking withdrawal of policy. District Consumer Commission will issue direction to insurer to do the needful. Proceeding under newConsumer Protection Act, 2019 are very fast. Section 2 (46) of the Act is squarely applicable to your situation.Ravi ShindeAdvocate, Hyderabad4923 Answers42 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ravi Shinde"

    "question": "Insurance policy sold by providing misleading advice",
    "answer": "You wanted to avail the benefits adopting short cut methods hence you fell prey to your own fault/mistake.How can you sign the papers without knowing what is written in it?The insurance advisers or the staff may coerce you with attractive offers which may actually not exist.One question to the person about the clarity though their brochures or any other pamphlet would have enlightened you about the fraud that those people are trying to play on yo in order to promote their own business.If the police conditions say that you cannot encash the amount during the lock in period or within a stipulated time period then you cannot get any relief even if you approach court because the insurance company will express their inability to come to yor rescue owing to the conditions that are printed in the policy.This appears to be yearly premium payment and you have paid the first year premium, hence you would be required to pay the premiums for the entire term of the policy in order to get the full maturity benefits, thus if you want to cancel the police, you may have to go through the policy conditions by which you will be entitled to surrender the police after deductions of certain amount as mentioned therein.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "If the existing co purchasers have no objection against inclusion of your name as a co purchaser then I don't see any reason why the builder would have a problemThe existing co purchasers would not be selling any part of their share to youYou are just being included as a co purchaser with themFor that a supplementary agreement has to be made in which it would be stated that all the terms of the principal agreement would remain same and be binding on all the 3 co purchasers nowSo the builder will be the seller, the existing co purchasers would be the confirming parties and you would be the 3rd joint purchaserThe allotment of the new flat would happen jointly to all the 3 co purchasers under the supplementary agreementThis agreement would not attract any stamp duty since the duty is already paid on the principal agreement and there would be nominal registration feeThe builder is concerned with his money. So whether that is paid by 2 or 3 co purchasers it should hardly matter to himSo whatever contribution you would make towards the sale price to the builder, for that you can claim capital gains tax exemptionIf you go for an assignment of rights by the existing co purchasers to you by paying them certain amount then such assignment would be subject to the main agreement. The builder may ask for a transfer fee in that case.Under the Gift deed option as suggested by the builder I fail to understand how he would then bind you under the terms of the main agreement which would contain many protection clauses in favour of the builderThe gift deed will be between the existing co purchasers and yourself. So how will there be a privity of contract between you and the builder? In case of any breach of the agreement terms the builder cannot sue you as there would be no privity of contract with you. He can only sue his original co purchasers. So his suggestion of gift deed is strangeAlso since no consideration would pass under the gift deed you cannot also claim any capital gains tax exemptionYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

Agreement is a mutual understanding between a person who offers to do an act for a consideration to receive something for that from another person who accepts the same for the terms and conditions mutually agreed between the parties. There will be also a clause for violation of the terms and conditions in the agreement. If any one of the parties violates, then the violating party will be liable for the penalty or remedy mentioned in the agreement. Normally, if the violating party is obeying the violation clause, there will also be a litigation clause to claim their remedy as per the terms and conditions of the agreement. The litigation may be either from the appropriate court of laws depending upon the territorial or monetary jurisdiction of the parties to the agreement or with the Arbitration clause in which the Arbitrator will be appointed as per the Arbitration act.KumaresanAdvocate, Coimbatore38 AnswersTalk to Advocate Kumaresan"

So whether that is paid by 2 or 3 co purchasers it should hardly matter to himSo whatever contribution you would make towards the sale price to the builder, for that you can claim capital gains tax exemptionIf you go for an assignment of rights by the existing co purchasers to you by paying them certain amount then such assignment would be subject to the main agreement. The builder may ask for a transfer fee in that case.Under the Gift deed option as suggested by the builder I fail to understand how he would then bind you under the terms of the main agreement which would contain many protection clauses in favour of the builderThe gift deed will be between the existing co purchasers and yourself. So how will there be a privity of contract between you and the builder? In case of any breach of the agreement terms the builder cannot sue you as there would be no privity of contract with you. He can only sue his original co purchasers. So his suggestion of gift deed is strangeAlso since no consideration would pass under the gift deed you cannot also claim any capital gains tax exemptionYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

The clause as to lock in period of 5 years is illegal. Any party can rescind the agreement under forcing circumstances. You can very much surrender the police and collect the premium paid with interest. File a complaint in District Consumer Commission seeking withdrawal of policy. District Consumer Commission will issue direction to insurer to do the needful. Proceeding under newConsumer Protection Act, 2019 are very fast.

    "answer": "You wanted to avail the benefits adopting short cut methods hence you fell prey to your own fault/mistake.How can you sign the papers without knowing what is written in it?The insurance advisers or the staff may coerce you with attractive offers which may actually not exist.One question to the person about the clarity though their brochures or any other pamphlet would have enlightened you about the fraud that those people are trying to play on yo in order to promote their own business.If the police conditions say that you cannot encash the amount during the lock in period or within a stipulated time period then you cannot get any relief even if you approach court because the insurance company will express their inability to come to yor rescue owing to the conditions that are printed in the policy.This appears to be yearly premium payment and you have paid the first year premium, hence you would be required to pay the premiums for the entire term of the policy in order to get the full maturity benefits, thus if you want to cancel the police, you may have to go through the policy conditions by which you will be entitled to surrender the police after deductions of certain amount as mentioned therein.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "You cannot change date of birth in passport2) you have renewed passport with wrong date of birth3) even if you take legal proceedings court would not pass any orders for change of date of birth in passportOFFICE MEMORANDUM SUBJECT:- Guidelines with regard to change /correctionofdatesofbirthen tries in the pa sport of an applicant already held by him/ her.It may be mentioned that necessary provisions with regard to change/correctionofdatesofbirthin thepassportsare contained in thePassportManual, 2010 and from time to time number of circulars have been issued by the Ministry on this issue.2. It is pertinent to mention that recently, the High Court of Kerala while hearing the WP No. 9073 of 2015 (Jaya Kumar Vs Union of India & others) has delivered a land-mark judgment on the issue ofcorrection/change of entries regardingdate/place ofbirthin thepassport. During the course of arguments, the Court has elaborated upon the fact that the details entered in thePassportcannot be lightly interfered with, that too after many years without any sustainable cause and without any explanation as to why initially such a wrong declaration was made and why now a change is sought that too based on a document which was available with the applicant when the original declaration was made.4. Hence, the core principle of the judgment of the High Court of Kerala is that only the bonafide claims of the applicants for the change/correctionof thedateofbirthin thepassportshould be accepted and that too if the same are submitted by them within a reasonable time limit after the issuance ofpassport. In pursuance of the directions of the High Court, it has been decided that henceforth, all the PIA shall follow the following instructions/ guidelines in order to consider the claims/request the applicant for the change/correctionof entries regarding ofdateofbirthin theirpassports:"

It is pertinent to mention that recently, the High Court of Kerala while hearing the WP No. 9073 of 2015 (Jaya Kumar Vs Union of India & others) has delivered a land-mark judgment on the issue ofcorrection/change of entries regardingdate/place ofbirthin thepassport. During the course of arguments, the Court has elaborated upon the fact that the details entered in thePassportcannot be lightly interfered with, that too after many years without any sustainable cause and without any explanation as to why initially such a wrong declaration was made and why now a change is sought that too based on a document which was available with the applicant when the original declaration was made.4. Hence, the core principle of the judgment of the High Court of Kerala is that only the bonafide claims of the applicants for the change/correctionof thedateofbirthin thepassportshould be accepted and that too if the same are submitted by them within a reasonable time limit after the issuance ofpassport. In pursuance of the directions of the High Court, it has been decided that henceforth, all the PIA shall follow the following instructions/ guidelines in order to consider the claims/request the applicant for the change/correctionof entries regarding ofdateofbirthin theirpassports:"

It is pertinent to mention that recently, the High Court of Kerala while hearing the WP No. 9073 of 2015 (Jaya Kumar Vs Union of India & others) has delivered a land-mark judgment on the issue ofcorrection/change of entries regardingdate/place ofbirthin thepassport. During the course of arguments, the Court has elaborated upon the fact that the details entered in thePassportcannot be lightly interfered with, that too after many years without any sustainable cause and without any explanation as to why initially such a wrong declaration was made and why now a change is sought that too based on a document which was available with the applicant when the original declaration was made.4. Hence, the core principle of the judgment of the High Court of Kerala is that only the bonafide claims of the applicants for the change/correctionof thedateofbirthin thepassportshould be accepted and that too if the same are submitted by them within a reasonable time limit after the issuance ofpassport. In pursuance of the directions of the High Court, it has been decided that henceforth, all the PIA shall follow the following instructions/ guidelines in order to consider the claims/request the applicant for the change/correctionof entries regarding ofdateofbirthin theirpassports:"

    "answer": "1. They have rights to their undivided share in the property and if any buyer is wiling to buy the undivided share of them then there is no legal infirmity in it, however if there is already a suit pending seeking partition then they cannot sell their share in the property on their own without court permission or without withdrawing the pending suit, your father can obtain an order of injunction against them restraining them from selling their unidentified or share of property.2. The arrangement or an amicable settlement and the conditions thereon will depend on the mutually arrived decisions, if you are not conversant with the distribution or division or settlement of amount then you can take the assistance of a local lawyer in yor next meeting and can ask the lawyer to interfere and represent your views and the lawful solutions  so that there is no ambiguity on that in future.3. In an jointly owned property, if one of the shareholders is relinquishing his or her rights in the property, then that particular share shall devolve equally on all the other shareholders, therefore the purpose of one person executing a relinquishment deed will be defeated, hence you better follow the advise of your advocate in this regard.4. If only one of the shareholders is transferring his rights then it would be better that he transfers his share in the property by a registered settlement deed in favor of the other shareholder  properly in order to avoid future legal complications.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Ways to Partition Co-ownership property between Brothers",
    "answer": "Dear client,While a partition suit is ongoing, it is generally advisable for co-owners to seek court permission before selling their share. Without court permission or without withdrawing the pending suit, selling their share may not be legally permissible.Sending a registered post to the registrar informing them about the attempted sale is a step to document the situation and raise awareness, but it may not automatically prevent the co-owners from selling their share.If the co-owners sell their share to a third party, and if that third party poses a threat or attempts to disturb your father's management of the property, it may be necessary to take legal action to protect your father's rights and interests. Your father may need to consult with a lawyer to explore available legal remedies.If your uncles are unwilling to sell their share to your father and insist on selling it to a third party, your father's options may be limited. However, he can consult with a lawyer to discuss the specifics of the case and explore any potential legal avenues or arguments that may be available to protect his interests.The rights and obligations of the parties involved, including your father's management of the property, would depend on the specific terms and conditions outlined in any existing agreements or court orders, as well as applicable property laws. A lawyer can provide advice on the rights and responsibilities of all parties involved and help protect your father's interests.To obtain an order of injunction to prevent your uncles from selling their share, your father would need to file a legal application in the court where the partition suit is pending. The application would need to outline the reasons and grounds for seeking the injunction. A lawyer can assist in preparing and filing the necessary application and presenting the case before the court.It is essential for your father to consult with an experienced lawyer who specializes in property and civil litigation. The lawyer can review the specific details of the case, provide tailored advice, and guide your father on the best course of action to protect his interests in the ongoing partition suit.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,After a case settles, the court might take some administrative steps. These may include drafting a final decree based on the terms of the settlement, ensuring all necessary documentation is in order, and recording the agreement officially. It's generally safe to get a vakalat from your current advocate and involve a new lawyer to obtain the final decree. However, to avoid any issues, it's crucial to clearly communicate with both the current and new lawyer about your intentions and ensure a smooth transition. Your previous advocate should not cause harm to the decree, but having a new lawyer involved can ensure the process moves forward smoothly. If your current advocate refuses to cooperate or provide the necessary documents, you have the right to engage a new lawyer to assist in obtaining the final decree. Your new lawyer can represent you in this matter without the need for the previous advocate's vakalatnama. The final decree might have been drafted or is in the process of being prepared by the court after the settlement. However, access to the draft decree might require specific procedures or permission from the court. Normally, once the stamp duty is paid, the final decree can be issued. In some cases, individuals can directly request copies of court orders or decrees by applying to the court clerk's office or the relevant court authority. This might involve formal procedures and potentially some fees, but it's usually possible to obtain copies of court documents, including the final decree, by following the correct protocol.

    "question": "Can limited rights become Full rights if female dies but never claimed full rights in her life.",
    "answer": "The Supreme Court has held that Section 14(1) of theHindu Succession Actdoes not bar the bequeathing of a limited estate to a female by way of a Will; butif the limited estate is given to the wife for her maintenance, then it would mature into an absolute estate under Section 14(1) of the Act.A wife becomes absolute owner of property willed to her for “maintenance” by her husband and can do whatever she wants with it.It is equally well settled that the claim of Hindu widow to be maintained is not a mere formality which is to be exercised as a matter of concession, grace or gratis but is a valuable, spiritual and moral right.”Section 14(1) of theHindu Succession Act, 1956 says a female Hindu shall be the full owner (not a limited owner) of any property possessed/held by her.Explanation to Section 14(1) says such property includes both movable and immovable property acquired by her by inheritance or in lieu of maintenance or by gift or in any other manner including stridhana.Now coming to your case;This property consisting 250 sq. yards was bequeathed by your uncle in favor of your father, if that is the case, your father becomes an absolute owner of this property by the virtue of the Will.As the trial court has already dismissed her case, it may not be maintainable in high court, but it is not known that what case has been filed by your aunt before the trial court and what was the actual reason that the trial court dismissed her suit.One way your aunt's assertion that your grandmother'slimited estate given as maintenance would mature into an absolute estate under Section 14(1) of the Act.Your father and his brother acquired the property of your grandmother on their own leaving behind the female siblings of your father.Therefore your father's brother was entitled to only one fourth share in your grandmother's property who is reported to have died intestate.Therefore the transfer of this property by a testamentary disposition in favor of your father by your deceased uncle shall be legally valid only insofar ass his share in that property and not the entire 250 sq. yards.Whatever, your father's brother has already transferred his share of property to your father, hence his wife cannot claim any share in that property which is not existing on the date of death of her husband.Your paternal aunts are entitled to one fourth share each in that property hence if they are willing to transfer their share in that property they can execute a registered release deed relinquishing their rights in  the property.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Just because the IO has removed the name of the father in law  from the charge sheet, it cannot be ruled that the said accused has been absolved or discharge from the case.The court has not dismissed the case against him as false, therefore it cannot be said that she has filed the case with false allegations against the father in law also, therefore until he is not proved innocent by a verdict of court, the proposed defamation case to be filed by him may not be maintainable.Besides the FIR is reported to have been lodged in the year 2018, i.e., almost more than 4 years, hence the proposed crimninal defamation case is bred by limitation at this stage.Therefore instead of wasting your time, energy and money over non maintainable defamation case, you may better get him out of the case by either filing a discharge petition before the trial court or a quash petition before high court to quash the case against him alone. .Do not be under any misguidance, because the rumour mongers around you may mislead you with plenty of false information for the reasons known only to them due to which you will be suffering more stress and new court case pressures.  .T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Sale of property in India with foreign probate",
    "answer": "A foreign judgment would not be conclusive if it refuses to recognise the applicable law of India or is in breach of any law in force in India\". A number of courts in India have refused the grant of Ancillary Probate or the grant of Letters of Administration, relying upon this cardinal rule.From an Indian legal perspective, a Foreign Will is one executed outside the territorial jurisdiction of India. An NRI, PIO or Foreigner owning assets in India is not mandatorily required to prepare an Indian Will for a valid bequeath of assets in India, there being no bar as to the nationality or origin of the testator or the beneficiary.For a Foreign Will to be enforced in India, apart from being executed as per the laws of such country, it has to be validated on a two-fold basis. In the first stage, a Probate has to be obtained from the concerned Court or authority in the Foreign country; such order granting a Probate must contain the following observations by the concerned Court or authority:That the Testator has validly signed the Will and that there are no doubts/ suspicions/ uncertainties as to the signature of the Testator on the Will.That the Will is executed by a person competent to make the Will and is free from fraud, coercion and undue influence;That the Will was attested by two witnesses, each of whom has seen the Testator sign the Will;ORIf the Will was signed in the absence of witnesses, each of the witnesses has received from the Testator, a personal acknowledgment of the Testator’s signature;that at least one witness has signed the Will in the presence of the Testator;that the original Will has been submitted and has been retained by the Court or authority in the Foreign country and a Certified Copy thereof is to be issued to the applicant/ beneficiary.The authenticated/ probated copy of the Will and Final Order obtained from the Foreign Court is required to be apostilled and an Apostille Certificate is required to be obtained from a competent authority under the Apostille Convention (Hague Treaty Convention 12). India is also a signatory to this Convention.With reference to wills executed outside India, in respect of which a foreign probate has also been obtained, the requirement of Section 213(1) of the Act would be satisfied by obtaining under Section 228(1) of the Act an ancillary probate. Otherwise, the procedural requirement of the lex fori enacted under Section 213(1) of the Act may not be satisfied and if it is only with a view to enabling parties claiming under a will executed outside India to make claims with reference to properties situated in India, the procedure under Section 228 of the Act has been prescribed.If this is not so, then as the probate obtained in respect of a will executed in a foreign country would be operative only within that country, persons entitled to other properties under the will, which are situated outside the country where the will was executed and the probate also was obtained, would be left without any means to assert their rights there to it must also be remembered that Section 228 of the Act is really in the nature of an enabling provision and when read with Section 270 of the Act, permits the obtaining of an ancillary probate. Section 270 of the Act is enacted on the principle that the presence of personal property of the deceased would be sufficient foundation of jurisdiction for purposes of granting probate.Section 228 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 provides the following:When a will has been proved and deposited in a Court of competent jurisdiction situated beyond the limits of the State, whether within or beyond the limits of India, and a properly authenticated copy of the will is produced, letters of administration may be granted with a copy of such copy annexedOn the probated Foreign Will, an Application for grant of Letters of Administration can also be filed by the Executor or by the Beneficiaries [if no Executor is named in the Will]. Such Letters of Administration are granted under Section 228 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925, granting the administrative rights for the property/ assets to the Executor/ Beneficiary.A foreign judgement would not be conclusive if it refuses to recognise the applicable law of India or is in breach of any law in force in India\". A number of courts in India have refused the grant of Ancillary Probate or the grant of Letters of Administration, relying upon this cardinal rule.Wills made in other jurisdictions are not automatically enforceable in India. Under the Act, an ancillary probate can be granted to authenticate a foreign will. A foreign will, once proved and deposited in a court of competent jurisdiction, or a properly authenticated copy of the will and letters of administration will be recognised by the Indian Courts. Otherwise, if the Court deems fit then it will take the evidence into account and will examine the petitioner upon oath to ensure the veracity of the will.Note :Only foreign property would be eligible for probate when issued abroad. If someone wants to benefit from India, they should abide by Indian law. Practically; after the death of your husband, his legal heirs become absolute owners of the property . Sell the property with the consent of all legal heirs OR go to court and spend time; follow the above procedure.Ajay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

    "question": "Sale of property in India with foreign probate",
    "answer": "- As per law, A declares the testator’s wishes regarding the distribution of his assets and possessions after his demise; hence it should be made by the testator in sound disposing mind and without any coercion or undue influence from any person and in the presence of two witnesses.- Further, a foreign Will is a Will which is executed outside India, by an NRI, PIO or a foreigner with respect to his/her properties situated in India, hence any NRI, PIO, or a foreigner possessing estates in India is not mandatorily required to create an Indian Will for his Indian assets and can have a foreign Will for all his assets including the ones in India.- Hence, a foreign executed Will can be validated in India after adopting the following steps:-1. The Will should be probated from the foreign country where is was executed2. The probated copy of the Will along with the Final Order obtained from the Foreign Court should be necessarily apostilled from the appropriate authorities.3. After receiving the apostilled copy of the Probated Will, an application for grant of an Ancillary Probate is required to be filed before the court of competent jurisdiction in India.- This application must be submitted along with the authenticated copy of the Will and the Final Order obtained from the Foreign Court, and this application for grant of Ancillary Probate in India must be applied within 03 years from the grant of a Probate by the Foreign Court.- Since, the said Will is already probated from US court , then you should move an application before the Court in India as I mentioned above.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "Dear client,In response to your first question, if the mutual consent petition clearly states that your wife has waived her right to alimony and maintenance and will not claim any movable or immovable property from now and in the future, then she cannot ask for any money during the second motion. The terms agreed to in the mutual consent petition are binding on both parties and cannot be changed unilaterally.Regarding your second question, either party can withdraw the mutual consent petition without the consent of the other before the second motion is granted. However, once the second motion is granted, the petition cannot be withdrawn. If one party wishes to withdraw the petition after the second motion has been granted, they would have to file a separate petition under the applicable law.If your wife asks for money later, which is not written and agreed upon in the mutual consent petition, then you may have legal options to protect your interests. You could approach the court with an application seeking enforcement of the terms agreed upon in the mutual consent petition. Alternatively, you could file a separate petition under the applicable law seeking a declaration that the terms of the mutual consent petition are final and binding, and that your wife cannot make any further claims.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The court  fee paid in the court towards the MOU is not considered as stamp duty, the stamp duty has to be paid to the registrar office.As far as the partnership firm is concerned it stands dissolved by an order of the court or an arbitrator.But on the basis of the MOU arrived between the partners and has got an approval you people are entitled to a share as mentioned therein hence the bank cannot insist you to reconstitute a new partnership firm or deed, the bank has to obey the court order if the bank is a party to the case before court.2. The answer to your second question is available in the MOU itself, hence no opinion can be rendered beyond that.3. The MOU has been recognised by court in its order and has passed an order to that effect hence the MOU shall be the base and guidelines in connection with all such further actions.4. No comments5. The second option is the one which is legally viable and valid.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "My wife wants mutual divorce and saying she will not ask for any alimony",
    "answer": "Dear client,In response to your first question, if the mutual consent petition clearly states that your wife has waived her right to alimony and maintenance and will not claim any movable or immovable property from now and in the future, then she cannot ask for any money during the second motion. The terms agreed to in the mutual consent petition are binding on both parties and cannot be changed unilaterally.Regarding your second question, either party can withdraw the mutual consent petition without the consent of the other before the second motion is granted. However, once the second motion is granted, the petition cannot be withdrawn. If one party wishes to withdraw the petition after the second motion has been granted, they would have to file a separate petition under the applicable law.If your wife asks for money later, which is not written and agreed upon in the mutual consent petition, then you may have legal options to protect your interests. You could approach the court with an application seeking enforcement of the terms agreed upon in the mutual consent petition. Alternatively, you could file a separate petition under the applicable law seeking a declaration that the terms of the mutual consent petition are final and binding, and that your wife cannot make any further claims.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The arrangement or an amicable settlement and the conditions thereon will depend on the mutually arrived decisions, if you are not conversant with the distribution or division or settlement of amount then you can take the assistance of a local lawyer in yor next meeting and can ask the lawyer to interfere and represent your views and the lawful solutions  so that there is no ambiguity on that in future.3. In an jointly owned property, if one of the shareholders is relinquishing his or her rights in the property, then that particular share shall devolve equally on all the other shareholders, therefore the purpose of one person executing a relinquishment deed will be defeated, hence you better follow the advise of your advocate in this regard.4. If only one of the shareholders is transferring his rights then it would be better that he transfers his share in the property by a registered settlement deed in favor of the other shareholder  properly in order to avoid future legal complications.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Ways to Partition Co-ownership property between Brothers",
    "answer": "Dear client,While a partition suit is ongoing, it is generally advisable for co-owners to seek court permission before selling their share. Without court permission or without withdrawing the pending suit, selling their share may not be legally permissible.Sending a registered post to the registrar informing them about the attempted sale is a step to document the situation and raise awareness, but it may not automatically prevent the co-owners from selling their share.If the co-owners sell their share to a third party, and if that third party poses a threat or attempts to disturb your father's management of the property, it may be necessary to take legal action to protect your father's rights and interests. Your father may need to consult with a lawyer to explore available legal remedies.If your uncles are unwilling to sell their share to your father and insist on selling it to a third party, your father's options may be limited. However, he can consult with a lawyer to discuss the specifics of the case and explore any potential legal avenues or arguments that may be available to protect his interests.The rights and obligations of the parties involved, including your father's management of the property, would depend on the specific terms and conditions outlined in any existing agreements or court orders, as well as applicable property laws. A lawyer can provide advice on the rights and responsibilities of all parties involved and help protect your father's interests.To obtain an order of injunction to prevent your uncles from selling their share, your father would need to file a legal application in the court where the partition suit is pending. The application would need to outline the reasons and grounds for seeking the injunction. A lawyer can assist in preparing and filing the necessary application and presenting the case before the court.It is essential for your father to consult with an experienced lawyer who specializes in property and civil litigation. The lawyer can review the specific details of the case, provide tailored advice, and guide your father on the best course of action to protect his interests in the ongoing partition suit.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,After a case settles, the court might take some administrative steps. These may include drafting a final decree based on the terms of the settlement, ensuring all necessary documentation is in order, and recording the agreement officially. It's generally safe to get a vakalat from your current advocate and involve a new lawyer to obtain the final decree. However, to avoid any issues, it's crucial to clearly communicate with both the current and new lawyer about your intentions and ensure a smooth transition. Your previous advocate should not cause harm to the decree, but having a new lawyer involved can ensure the process moves forward smoothly. If your current advocate refuses to cooperate or provide the necessary documents, you have the right to engage a new lawyer to assist in obtaining the final decree. Your new lawyer can represent you in this matter without the need for the previous advocate's vakalatnama. The final decree might have been drafted or is in the process of being prepared by the court after the settlement. However, access to the draft decree might require specific procedures or permission from the court. Normally, once the stamp duty is paid, the final decree can be issued. In some cases, individuals can directly request copies of court orders or decrees by applying to the court clerk's office or the relevant court authority. This might involve formal procedures and potentially some fees, but it's usually possible to obtain copies of court documents, including the final decree, by following the correct protocol.

In an jointly owned property, if one of the shareholders is relinquishing his or her rights in the property, then that particular share shall devolve equally on all the other shareholders, therefore the purpose of one person executing a relinquishment deed will be defeated, hence you better follow the advise of your advocate in this regard.4.

    "question": "Ways to Partition Co-ownership property between Brothers",
    "answer": "Dear client,While a partition suit is ongoing, it is generally advisable for co-owners to seek court permission before selling their share. Without court permission or without withdrawing the pending suit, selling their share may not be legally permissible.Sending a registered post to the registrar informing them about the attempted sale is a step to document the situation and raise awareness, but it may not automatically prevent the co-owners from selling their share.If the co-owners sell their share to a third party, and if that third party poses a threat or attempts to disturb your father's management of the property, it may be necessary to take legal action to protect your father's rights and interests. Your father may need to consult with a lawyer to explore available legal remedies.If your uncles are unwilling to sell their share to your father and insist on selling it to a third party, your father's options may be limited. However, he can consult with a lawyer to discuss the specifics of the case and explore any potential legal avenues or arguments that may be available to protect his interests.The rights and obligations of the parties involved, including your father's management of the property, would depend on the specific terms and conditions outlined in any existing agreements or court orders, as well as applicable property laws. A lawyer can provide advice on the rights and responsibilities of all parties involved and help protect your father's interests.To obtain an order of injunction to prevent your uncles from selling their share, your father would need to file a legal application in the court where the partition suit is pending. The application would need to outline the reasons and grounds for seeking the injunction. A lawyer can assist in preparing and filing the necessary application and presenting the case before the court.It is essential for your father to consult with an experienced lawyer who specializes in property and civil litigation. The lawyer can review the specific details of the case, provide tailored advice, and guide your father on the best course of action to protect his interests in the ongoing partition suit.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,After a case settles, the court might take some administrative steps. These may include drafting a final decree based on the terms of the settlement, ensuring all necessary documentation is in order, and recording the agreement officially. It's generally safe to get a vakalat from your current advocate and involve a new lawyer to obtain the final decree. However, to avoid any issues, it's crucial to clearly communicate with both the current and new lawyer about your intentions and ensure a smooth transition. Your previous advocate should not cause harm to the decree, but having a new lawyer involved can ensure the process moves forward smoothly. If your current advocate refuses to cooperate or provide the necessary documents, you have the right to engage a new lawyer to assist in obtaining the final decree. Your new lawyer can represent you in this matter without the need for the previous advocate's vakalatnama. The final decree might have been drafted or is in the process of being prepared by the court after the settlement. However, access to the draft decree might require specific procedures or permission from the court. Normally, once the stamp duty is paid, the final decree can be issued. In some cases, individuals can directly request copies of court orders or decrees by applying to the court clerk's office or the relevant court authority. This might involve formal procedures and potentially some fees, but it's usually possible to obtain copies of court documents, including the final decree, by following the correct protocol.

The terms agreed to in the mutual consent petition are binding on both parties and cannot be changed unilaterally.Regarding your second question, either party can withdraw the mutual consent petition without the consent of the other before the second motion is granted. However, once the second motion is granted, the petition cannot be withdrawn. If one party wishes to withdraw the petition after the second motion has been granted, they would have to file a separate petition under the applicable law.If your wife asks for money later, which is not written and agreed upon in the mutual consent petition, then you may have legal options to protect your interests. You could approach the court with an application seeking enforcement of the terms agreed upon in the mutual consent petition. Alternatively, you could file a separate petition under the applicable law seeking a declaration that the terms of the mutual consent petition are final and binding, and that your wife cannot make any further claims.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The terms agreed to in the mutual consent petition are binding on both parties and cannot be changed unilaterally.Regarding your second question, either party can withdraw the mutual consent petition without the consent of the other before the second motion is granted. However, once the second motion is granted, the petition cannot be withdrawn. If one party wishes to withdraw the petition after the second motion has been granted, they would have to file a separate petition under the applicable law.If your wife asks for money later, which is not written and agreed upon in the mutual consent petition, then you may have legal options to protect your interests. You could approach the court with an application seeking enforcement of the terms agreed upon in the mutual consent petition. Alternatively, you could file a separate petition under the applicable law seeking a declaration that the terms of the mutual consent petition are final and binding, and that your wife cannot make any further claims.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The terms agreed to in the mutual consent petition are binding on both parties and cannot be changed unilaterally.Regarding your second question, either party can withdraw the mutual consent petition without the consent of the other before the second motion is granted. However, once the second motion is granted, the petition cannot be withdrawn. If one party wishes to withdraw the petition after the second motion has been granted, they would have to file a separate petition under the applicable law.If your wife asks for money later, which is not written and agreed upon in the mutual consent petition, then you may have legal options to protect your interests. You could approach the court with an application seeking enforcement of the terms agreed upon in the mutual consent petition. Alternatively, you could file a separate petition under the applicable law seeking a declaration that the terms of the mutual consent petition are final and binding, and that your wife cannot make any further claims.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "My wife wants mutual divorce and saying she will not ask for any alimony",
    "answer": "Dear client,In response to your first question, if the mutual consent petition clearly states that your wife has waived her right to alimony and maintenance and will not claim any movable or immovable property from now and in the future, then she cannot ask for any money during the second motion. The terms agreed to in the mutual consent petition are binding on both parties and cannot be changed unilaterally.Regarding your second question, either party can withdraw the mutual consent petition without the consent of the other before the second motion is granted. However, once the second motion is granted, the petition cannot be withdrawn. If one party wishes to withdraw the petition after the second motion has been granted, they would have to file a separate petition under the applicable law.If your wife asks for money later, which is not written and agreed upon in the mutual consent petition, then you may have legal options to protect your interests. You could approach the court with an application seeking enforcement of the terms agreed upon in the mutual consent petition. Alternatively, you could file a separate petition under the applicable law seeking a declaration that the terms of the mutual consent petition are final and binding, and that your wife cannot make any further claims.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Sale of property in India with foreign probate",
    "answer": "A foreign judgment would not be conclusive if it refuses to recognise the applicable law of India or is in breach of any law in force in India\". A number of courts in India have refused the grant of Ancillary Probate or the grant of Letters of Administration, relying upon this cardinal rule.From an Indian legal perspective, a Foreign Will is one executed outside the territorial jurisdiction of India. An NRI, PIO or Foreigner owning assets in India is not mandatorily required to prepare an Indian Will for a valid bequeath of assets in India, there being no bar as to the nationality or origin of the testator or the beneficiary.For a Foreign Will to be enforced in India, apart from being executed as per the laws of such country, it has to be validated on a two-fold basis. In the first stage, a Probate has to be obtained from the concerned Court or authority in the Foreign country; such order granting a Probate must contain the following observations by the concerned Court or authority:That the Testator has validly signed the Will and that there are no doubts/ suspicions/ uncertainties as to the signature of the Testator on the Will.That the Will is executed by a person competent to make the Will and is free from fraud, coercion and undue influence;That the Will was attested by two witnesses, each of whom has seen the Testator sign the Will;ORIf the Will was signed in the absence of witnesses, each of the witnesses has received from the Testator, a personal acknowledgment of the Testator’s signature;that at least one witness has signed the Will in the presence of the Testator;that the original Will has been submitted and has been retained by the Court or authority in the Foreign country and a Certified Copy thereof is to be issued to the applicant/ beneficiary.The authenticated/ probated copy of the Will and Final Order obtained from the Foreign Court is required to be apostilled and an Apostille Certificate is required to be obtained from a competent authority under the Apostille Convention (Hague Treaty Convention 12). India is also a signatory to this Convention.With reference to wills executed outside India, in respect of which a foreign probate has also been obtained, the requirement of Section 213(1) of the Act would be satisfied by obtaining under Section 228(1) of the Act an ancillary probate. Otherwise, the procedural requirement of the lex fori enacted under Section 213(1) of the Act may not be satisfied and if it is only with a view to enabling parties claiming under a will executed outside India to make claims with reference to properties situated in India, the procedure under Section 228 of the Act has been prescribed.If this is not so, then as the probate obtained in respect of a will executed in a foreign country would be operative only within that country, persons entitled to other properties under the will, which are situated outside the country where the will was executed and the probate also was obtained, would be left without any means to assert their rights there to it must also be remembered that Section 228 of the Act is really in the nature of an enabling provision and when read with Section 270 of the Act, permits the obtaining of an ancillary probate. Section 270 of the Act is enacted on the principle that the presence of personal property of the deceased would be sufficient foundation of jurisdiction for purposes of granting probate.Section 228 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 provides the following:When a will has been proved and deposited in a Court of competent jurisdiction situated beyond the limits of the State, whether within or beyond the limits of India, and a properly authenticated copy of the will is produced, letters of administration may be granted with a copy of such copy annexedOn the probated Foreign Will, an Application for grant of Letters of Administration can also be filed by the Executor or by the Beneficiaries [if no Executor is named in the Will]. Such Letters of Administration are granted under Section 228 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925, granting the administrative rights for the property/ assets to the Executor/ Beneficiary.A foreign judgement would not be conclusive if it refuses to recognise the applicable law of India or is in breach of any law in force in India\". A number of courts in India have refused the grant of Ancillary Probate or the grant of Letters of Administration, relying upon this cardinal rule.Wills made in other jurisdictions are not automatically enforceable in India. Under the Act, an ancillary probate can be granted to authenticate a foreign will. A foreign will, once proved and deposited in a court of competent jurisdiction, or a properly authenticated copy of the will and letters of administration will be recognised by the Indian Courts. Otherwise, if the Court deems fit then it will take the evidence into account and will examine the petitioner upon oath to ensure the veracity of the will.Note :Only foreign property would be eligible for probate when issued abroad. If someone wants to benefit from India, they should abide by Indian law. Practically; after the death of your husband, his legal heirs become absolute owners of the property . Sell the property with the consent of all legal heirs OR go to court and spend time; follow the above procedure.Ajay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

    "question": "Sale of property in India with foreign probate",
    "answer": "- As per law, A declares the testator’s wishes regarding the distribution of his assets and possessions after his demise; hence it should be made by the testator in sound disposing mind and without any coercion or undue influence from any person and in the presence of two witnesses.- Further, a foreign Will is a Will which is executed outside India, by an NRI, PIO or a foreigner with respect to his/her properties situated in India, hence any NRI, PIO, or a foreigner possessing estates in India is not mandatorily required to create an Indian Will for his Indian assets and can have a foreign Will for all his assets including the ones in India.- Hence, a foreign executed Will can be validated in India after adopting the following steps:-1. The Will should be probated from the foreign country where is was executed2. The probated copy of the Will along with the Final Order obtained from the Foreign Court should be necessarily apostilled from the appropriate authorities.3. After receiving the apostilled copy of the Probated Will, an application for grant of an Ancillary Probate is required to be filed before the court of competent jurisdiction in India.- This application must be submitted along with the authenticated copy of the Will and the Final Order obtained from the Foreign Court, and this application for grant of Ancillary Probate in India must be applied within 03 years from the grant of a Probate by the Foreign Court.- Since, the said Will is already probated from US court , then you should move an application before the Court in India as I mentioned above.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

The suit continues to be pending until partition, that is divisionby metes and bounds, takes place by passing a final decree. Anapplication requesting the court to take necessary steps to draw up a finaldecree effecting a division in terms of the preliminary decree, is neitheran application for execution (falling under Article 136 of the LimitationAct) nor an application seeking a fresh relief (falling under Article 137 ofLimitation Act).

    "question": "How Tenants can cast there vote behalf of below NOTICE?",
    "answer": "From the above notification it can be noted that the tenants are not given permission to cast their votes.However Allahabad high court in the judgment in M/a Designarch infrastructure Ltd vs. Chairman,  GDA (14.11.2013 ALLHC), has stated that a tenant is considered as an apartment owner for participation in AOA  related issues and can participate in the AOA elections both as a voter and a candidate and can become part of board, provided he has entered into a lawful tenancy of more than one year which should survive without a break,  the period between the declaration of AGM declaring the election and expiry of the upcoming Board of Management.A tenant cannot delegate his above rights to any other person.Only the person in whose name tenancy/lease deed is executed can participate in the election.The UP apartment Act section  2 (d) & (e), 3(d) and UP Urban buildings (Regulation of Letting,  Rent and  Eviction) Act, 1972 are some of relevant law in this context.Therefore all the eligible lawful tenants can issue a joint notice to the election committee or the Returning Officer for participating in the ensuing election.If your application is not entertained then you can immediately approach the Registrar of cooperative society with a complaint signed jointly by all aggrieved lawful tenants and seek relief and remedy or can file a suit for injunction to restrain the association from conducting the election without allowing your participation.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

By IO removing your father's name in the charge sheet, will not mean that the name will be automatically removed fro the FIR also, if she is filling another application before the court objecting to the removal by IO and if the court is satisfied with the averments mentioned in her petition, then your father will also be tried along with the other accused in this case.3. The IO in charge sheet can remove the name of other accused  your father may file quashing petition before high court. The copy of the charge sheet may be a document to be produced before high court to get his name quashed from the case or he can file a separate petition for discharging him from the case on the basis of this removal of his name.However the defamation case in this regard may not be maintainable.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "False fir lodged and name removed in chargesheet by io, inestigating  police",
    "answer": "Just because the IO has removed the name of the father in law  from the charge sheet, it cannot be ruled that the said accused has been absolved or discharge from the case.The court has not dismissed the case against him as false, therefore it cannot be said that she has filed the case with false allegations against the father in law also, therefore until he is not proved innocent by a verdict of court, the proposed defamation case to be filed by him may not be maintainable.Besides the FIR is reported to have been lodged in the year 2018, i.e., almost more than 4 years, hence the proposed crimninal defamation case is bred by limitation at this stage.Therefore instead of wasting your time, energy and money over non maintainable defamation case, you may better get him out of the case by either filing a discharge petition before the trial court or a quash petition before high court to quash the case against him alone. .Do not be under any misguidance, because the rumour mongers around you may mislead you with plenty of false information for the reasons known only to them due to which you will be suffering more stress and new court case pressures.  .T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

By IO removing your father's name in the charge sheet, will not mean that the name will be automatically removed fro the FIR also, if she is filling another application before the court objecting to the removal by IO and if the court is satisfied with the averments mentioned in her petition, then your father will also be tried along with the other accused in this case.3. The IO in charge sheet can remove the name of other accused  your father may file quashing petition before high court. The copy of the charge sheet may be a document to be produced before high court to get his name quashed from the case or he can file a separate petition for discharging him from the case on the basis of this removal of his name.However the defamation case in this regard may not be maintainable.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Just because the IO has removed the name of the father in law  from the charge sheet, it cannot be ruled that the said accused has been absolved or discharge from the case.The court has not dismissed the case against him as false, therefore it cannot be said that she has filed the case with false allegations against the father in law also, therefore until he is not proved innocent by a verdict of court, the proposed defamation case to be filed by him may not be maintainable.Besides the FIR is reported to have been lodged in the year 2018, i.e., almost more than 4 years, hence the proposed crimninal defamation case is bred by limitation at this stage.Therefore instead of wasting your time, energy and money over non maintainable defamation case, you may better get him out of the case by either filing a discharge petition before the trial court or a quash petition before high court to quash the case against him alone. .Do not be under any misguidance, because the rumour mongers around you may mislead you with plenty of false information for the reasons known only to them due to which you will be suffering more stress and new court case pressures.  .T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Sale of property in India with foreign probate",
    "answer": "A foreign judgment would not be conclusive if it refuses to recognise the applicable law of India or is in breach of any law in force in India\". A number of courts in India have refused the grant of Ancillary Probate or the grant of Letters of Administration, relying upon this cardinal rule.From an Indian legal perspective, a Foreign Will is one executed outside the territorial jurisdiction of India. An NRI, PIO or Foreigner owning assets in India is not mandatorily required to prepare an Indian Will for a valid bequeath of assets in India, there being no bar as to the nationality or origin of the testator or the beneficiary.For a Foreign Will to be enforced in India, apart from being executed as per the laws of such country, it has to be validated on a two-fold basis. In the first stage, a Probate has to be obtained from the concerned Court or authority in the Foreign country; such order granting a Probate must contain the following observations by the concerned Court or authority:That the Testator has validly signed the Will and that there are no doubts/ suspicions/ uncertainties as to the signature of the Testator on the Will.That the Will is executed by a person competent to make the Will and is free from fraud, coercion and undue influence;That the Will was attested by two witnesses, each of whom has seen the Testator sign the Will;ORIf the Will was signed in the absence of witnesses, each of the witnesses has received from the Testator, a personal acknowledgment of the Testator’s signature;that at least one witness has signed the Will in the presence of the Testator;that the original Will has been submitted and has been retained by the Court or authority in the Foreign country and a Certified Copy thereof is to be issued to the applicant/ beneficiary.The authenticated/ probated copy of the Will and Final Order obtained from the Foreign Court is required to be apostilled and an Apostille Certificate is required to be obtained from a competent authority under the Apostille Convention (Hague Treaty Convention 12). India is also a signatory to this Convention.With reference to wills executed outside India, in respect of which a foreign probate has also been obtained, the requirement of Section 213(1) of the Act would be satisfied by obtaining under Section 228(1) of the Act an ancillary probate. Otherwise, the procedural requirement of the lex fori enacted under Section 213(1) of the Act may not be satisfied and if it is only with a view to enabling parties claiming under a will executed outside India to make claims with reference to properties situated in India, the procedure under Section 228 of the Act has been prescribed.If this is not so, then as the probate obtained in respect of a will executed in a foreign country would be operative only within that country, persons entitled to other properties under the will, which are situated outside the country where the will was executed and the probate also was obtained, would be left without any means to assert their rights there to it must also be remembered that Section 228 of the Act is really in the nature of an enabling provision and when read with Section 270 of the Act, permits the obtaining of an ancillary probate. Section 270 of the Act is enacted on the principle that the presence of personal property of the deceased would be sufficient foundation of jurisdiction for purposes of granting probate.Section 228 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 provides the following:When a will has been proved and deposited in a Court of competent jurisdiction situated beyond the limits of the State, whether within or beyond the limits of India, and a properly authenticated copy of the will is produced, letters of administration may be granted with a copy of such copy annexedOn the probated Foreign Will, an Application for grant of Letters of Administration can also be filed by the Executor or by the Beneficiaries [if no Executor is named in the Will]. Such Letters of Administration are granted under Section 228 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925, granting the administrative rights for the property/ assets to the Executor/ Beneficiary.A foreign judgement would not be conclusive if it refuses to recognise the applicable law of India or is in breach of any law in force in India\". A number of courts in India have refused the grant of Ancillary Probate or the grant of Letters of Administration, relying upon this cardinal rule.Wills made in other jurisdictions are not automatically enforceable in India. Under the Act, an ancillary probate can be granted to authenticate a foreign will. A foreign will, once proved and deposited in a court of competent jurisdiction, or a properly authenticated copy of the will and letters of administration will be recognised by the Indian Courts. Otherwise, if the Court deems fit then it will take the evidence into account and will examine the petitioner upon oath to ensure the veracity of the will.Note :Only foreign property would be eligible for probate when issued abroad. If someone wants to benefit from India, they should abide by Indian law. Practically; after the death of your husband, his legal heirs become absolute owners of the property . Sell the property with the consent of all legal heirs OR go to court and spend time; follow the above procedure.Ajay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

    "answer": "- As per law, A declares the testator’s wishes regarding the distribution of his assets and possessions after his demise; hence it should be made by the testator in sound disposing mind and without any coercion or undue influence from any person and in the presence of two witnesses.- Further, a foreign Will is a Will which is executed outside India, by an NRI, PIO or a foreigner with respect to his/her properties situated in India, hence any NRI, PIO, or a foreigner possessing estates in India is not mandatorily required to create an Indian Will for his Indian assets and can have a foreign Will for all his assets including the ones in India.- Hence, a foreign executed Will can be validated in India after adopting the following steps:-1. The Will should be probated from the foreign country where is was executed2. The probated copy of the Will along with the Final Order obtained from the Foreign Court should be necessarily apostilled from the appropriate authorities.3. After receiving the apostilled copy of the Probated Will, an application for grant of an Ancillary Probate is required to be filed before the court of competent jurisdiction in India.- This application must be submitted along with the authenticated copy of the Will and the Final Order obtained from the Foreign Court, and this application for grant of Ancillary Probate in India must be applied within 03 years from the grant of a Probate by the Foreign Court.- Since, the said Will is already probated from US court , then you should move an application before the Court in India as I mentioned above.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "the society can put reasonable terms but it cannot totally deny the member from hosting his house for airbnb guestsif leave and license can be allowed then i see no reason why an airbnb guest cannot be allowedin both cases the member grants a license to the licensee/guest to use his premises on mutual termsif the society is denying the permission then you will have escalate the issue with the District Dy. Registrar of Co-operative Societies by writing a complaint letter with copy marked to the society, stating the relevant facts and the unreasonable denial by the society. In my view the society does not have such wide latitude and sweeping powers to deny a member from hosting his house for an airbnb guest, unless that be for valid reasons and in the larger interest of the other members of the society, which larger interest has to be shown and not merely pleaded as an excuse to deny permission.you can also call upon the society to show under which bye-laws is it refusing the permissionas regards your follow up, Sir please note that IT IS HIGHLY UNPROFESSIONAL FOR A LAWYER TO CALL A PROSPECTIVE CLIENT AND YOU REQUIRING THE LAWYERS ON THIS FORUM TO CALL YOU AND TALK TO YOU 'PROFESSIONALLY' IS ALSO HIGHLY INAPPROPRIATE!

After the court is passing the decree annulling your marriage with her, you can issue a legal notice to her asking her to take back her items lying at your house within a time stipulated therein lest the items will be kept on the streets on the date after the expiration of the time given to her.3. Wait for the court to dispose the case in your favor, do not take any hasty decision or they may file a dowry harassment criminal case.4. The legal notice what you are suggested to send after the decree of annulment passed by court will come to you rescue in the event of such a circumstance.5.

    "question": "Sale of property in India with foreign probate",
    "answer": "A foreign judgment would not be conclusive if it refuses to recognise the applicable law of India or is in breach of any law in force in India\". A number of courts in India have refused the grant of Ancillary Probate or the grant of Letters of Administration, relying upon this cardinal rule.From an Indian legal perspective, a Foreign Will is one executed outside the territorial jurisdiction of India. An NRI, PIO or Foreigner owning assets in India is not mandatorily required to prepare an Indian Will for a valid bequeath of assets in India, there being no bar as to the nationality or origin of the testator or the beneficiary.For a Foreign Will to be enforced in India, apart from being executed as per the laws of such country, it has to be validated on a two-fold basis. In the first stage, a Probate has to be obtained from the concerned Court or authority in the Foreign country; such order granting a Probate must contain the following observations by the concerned Court or authority:That the Testator has validly signed the Will and that there are no doubts/ suspicions/ uncertainties as to the signature of the Testator on the Will.That the Will is executed by a person competent to make the Will and is free from fraud, coercion and undue influence;That the Will was attested by two witnesses, each of whom has seen the Testator sign the Will;ORIf the Will was signed in the absence of witnesses, each of the witnesses has received from the Testator, a personal acknowledgment of the Testator’s signature;that at least one witness has signed the Will in the presence of the Testator;that the original Will has been submitted and has been retained by the Court or authority in the Foreign country and a Certified Copy thereof is to be issued to the applicant/ beneficiary.The authenticated/ probated copy of the Will and Final Order obtained from the Foreign Court is required to be apostilled and an Apostille Certificate is required to be obtained from a competent authority under the Apostille Convention (Hague Treaty Convention 12). India is also a signatory to this Convention.With reference to wills executed outside India, in respect of which a foreign probate has also been obtained, the requirement of Section 213(1) of the Act would be satisfied by obtaining under Section 228(1) of the Act an ancillary probate. Otherwise, the procedural requirement of the lex fori enacted under Section 213(1) of the Act may not be satisfied and if it is only with a view to enabling parties claiming under a will executed outside India to make claims with reference to properties situated in India, the procedure under Section 228 of the Act has been prescribed.If this is not so, then as the probate obtained in respect of a will executed in a foreign country would be operative only within that country, persons entitled to other properties under the will, which are situated outside the country where the will was executed and the probate also was obtained, would be left without any means to assert their rights there to it must also be remembered that Section 228 of the Act is really in the nature of an enabling provision and when read with Section 270 of the Act, permits the obtaining of an ancillary probate. Section 270 of the Act is enacted on the principle that the presence of personal property of the deceased would be sufficient foundation of jurisdiction for purposes of granting probate.Section 228 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 provides the following:When a will has been proved and deposited in a Court of competent jurisdiction situated beyond the limits of the State, whether within or beyond the limits of India, and a properly authenticated copy of the will is produced, letters of administration may be granted with a copy of such copy annexedOn the probated Foreign Will, an Application for grant of Letters of Administration can also be filed by the Executor or by the Beneficiaries [if no Executor is named in the Will]. Such Letters of Administration are granted under Section 228 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925, granting the administrative rights for the property/ assets to the Executor/ Beneficiary.A foreign judgement would not be conclusive if it refuses to recognise the applicable law of India or is in breach of any law in force in India\". A number of courts in India have refused the grant of Ancillary Probate or the grant of Letters of Administration, relying upon this cardinal rule.Wills made in other jurisdictions are not automatically enforceable in India. Under the Act, an ancillary probate can be granted to authenticate a foreign will. A foreign will, once proved and deposited in a court of competent jurisdiction, or a properly authenticated copy of the will and letters of administration will be recognised by the Indian Courts. Otherwise, if the Court deems fit then it will take the evidence into account and will examine the petitioner upon oath to ensure the veracity of the will.Note :Only foreign property would be eligible for probate when issued abroad. If someone wants to benefit from India, they should abide by Indian law. Practically; after the death of your husband, his legal heirs become absolute owners of the property . Sell the property with the consent of all legal heirs OR go to court and spend time; follow the above procedure.Ajay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

    "question": "Sale of property in India with foreign probate",
    "answer": "- As per law, A declares the testator’s wishes regarding the distribution of his assets and possessions after his demise; hence it should be made by the testator in sound disposing mind and without any coercion or undue influence from any person and in the presence of two witnesses.- Further, a foreign Will is a Will which is executed outside India, by an NRI, PIO or a foreigner with respect to his/her properties situated in India, hence any NRI, PIO, or a foreigner possessing estates in India is not mandatorily required to create an Indian Will for his Indian assets and can have a foreign Will for all his assets including the ones in India.- Hence, a foreign executed Will can be validated in India after adopting the following steps:-1. The Will should be probated from the foreign country where is was executed2. The probated copy of the Will along with the Final Order obtained from the Foreign Court should be necessarily apostilled from the appropriate authorities.3. After receiving the apostilled copy of the Probated Will, an application for grant of an Ancillary Probate is required to be filed before the court of competent jurisdiction in India.- This application must be submitted along with the authenticated copy of the Will and the Final Order obtained from the Foreign Court, and this application for grant of Ancillary Probate in India must be applied within 03 years from the grant of a Probate by the Foreign Court.- Since, the said Will is already probated from US court , then you should move an application before the Court in India as I mentioned above.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "In order to enforce the sale agreement through court of law, it is mandatory to enter into the same by a registered document.If in case the seller refuses to execute the sale deed for some reason, the buyer can get the same executed through court provided the sale agreement was executed by a registered document.Also, since the sale agreement do not confer title to the buyer, it is deemed that the property has not been transferred by sale. Hence the advance amount paid towards part of sale consideration amount is refundable if the sale agreement is cancelled therefore the part sale consideration paid towards sale agreement will not attract capital gains tax.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Sale of property in India with foreign probate",
    "answer": "A foreign judgment would not be conclusive if it refuses to recognise the applicable law of India or is in breach of any law in force in India\". A number of courts in India have refused the grant of Ancillary Probate or the grant of Letters of Administration, relying upon this cardinal rule.From an Indian legal perspective, a Foreign Will is one executed outside the territorial jurisdiction of India. An NRI, PIO or Foreigner owning assets in India is not mandatorily required to prepare an Indian Will for a valid bequeath of assets in India, there being no bar as to the nationality or origin of the testator or the beneficiary.For a Foreign Will to be enforced in India, apart from being executed as per the laws of such country, it has to be validated on a two-fold basis. In the first stage, a Probate has to be obtained from the concerned Court or authority in the Foreign country; such order granting a Probate must contain the following observations by the concerned Court or authority:That the Testator has validly signed the Will and that there are no doubts/ suspicions/ uncertainties as to the signature of the Testator on the Will.That the Will is executed by a person competent to make the Will and is free from fraud, coercion and undue influence;That the Will was attested by two witnesses, each of whom has seen the Testator sign the Will;ORIf the Will was signed in the absence of witnesses, each of the witnesses has received from the Testator, a personal acknowledgment of the Testator’s signature;that at least one witness has signed the Will in the presence of the Testator;that the original Will has been submitted and has been retained by the Court or authority in the Foreign country and a Certified Copy thereof is to be issued to the applicant/ beneficiary.The authenticated/ probated copy of the Will and Final Order obtained from the Foreign Court is required to be apostilled and an Apostille Certificate is required to be obtained from a competent authority under the Apostille Convention (Hague Treaty Convention 12). India is also a signatory to this Convention.With reference to wills executed outside India, in respect of which a foreign probate has also been obtained, the requirement of Section 213(1) of the Act would be satisfied by obtaining under Section 228(1) of the Act an ancillary probate. Otherwise, the procedural requirement of the lex fori enacted under Section 213(1) of the Act may not be satisfied and if it is only with a view to enabling parties claiming under a will executed outside India to make claims with reference to properties situated in India, the procedure under Section 228 of the Act has been prescribed.If this is not so, then as the probate obtained in respect of a will executed in a foreign country would be operative only within that country, persons entitled to other properties under the will, which are situated outside the country where the will was executed and the probate also was obtained, would be left without any means to assert their rights there to it must also be remembered that Section 228 of the Act is really in the nature of an enabling provision and when read with Section 270 of the Act, permits the obtaining of an ancillary probate. Section 270 of the Act is enacted on the principle that the presence of personal property of the deceased would be sufficient foundation of jurisdiction for purposes of granting probate.Section 228 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 provides the following:When a will has been proved and deposited in a Court of competent jurisdiction situated beyond the limits of the State, whether within or beyond the limits of India, and a properly authenticated copy of the will is produced, letters of administration may be granted with a copy of such copy annexedOn the probated Foreign Will, an Application for grant of Letters of Administration can also be filed by the Executor or by the Beneficiaries [if no Executor is named in the Will]. Such Letters of Administration are granted under Section 228 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925, granting the administrative rights for the property/ assets to the Executor/ Beneficiary.A foreign judgement would not be conclusive if it refuses to recognise the applicable law of India or is in breach of any law in force in India\". A number of courts in India have refused the grant of Ancillary Probate or the grant of Letters of Administration, relying upon this cardinal rule.Wills made in other jurisdictions are not automatically enforceable in India. Under the Act, an ancillary probate can be granted to authenticate a foreign will. A foreign will, once proved and deposited in a court of competent jurisdiction, or a properly authenticated copy of the will and letters of administration will be recognised by the Indian Courts. Otherwise, if the Court deems fit then it will take the evidence into account and will examine the petitioner upon oath to ensure the veracity of the will.Note :Only foreign property would be eligible for probate when issued abroad. If someone wants to benefit from India, they should abide by Indian law. Practically; after the death of your husband, his legal heirs become absolute owners of the property . Sell the property with the consent of all legal heirs OR go to court and spend time; follow the above procedure.Ajay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

    "answer": "- As per law, A declares the testator’s wishes regarding the distribution of his assets and possessions after his demise; hence it should be made by the testator in sound disposing mind and without any coercion or undue influence from any person and in the presence of two witnesses.- Further, a foreign Will is a Will which is executed outside India, by an NRI, PIO or a foreigner with respect to his/her properties situated in India, hence any NRI, PIO, or a foreigner possessing estates in India is not mandatorily required to create an Indian Will for his Indian assets and can have a foreign Will for all his assets including the ones in India.- Hence, a foreign executed Will can be validated in India after adopting the following steps:-1. The Will should be probated from the foreign country where is was executed2. The probated copy of the Will along with the Final Order obtained from the Foreign Court should be necessarily apostilled from the appropriate authorities.3. After receiving the apostilled copy of the Probated Will, an application for grant of an Ancillary Probate is required to be filed before the court of competent jurisdiction in India.- This application must be submitted along with the authenticated copy of the Will and the Final Order obtained from the Foreign Court, and this application for grant of Ancillary Probate in India must be applied within 03 years from the grant of a Probate by the Foreign Court.- Since, the said Will is already probated from US court , then you should move an application before the Court in India as I mentioned above.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

In this case since the property has been sold to you, you can all the more file the FIR as required by the bankalso please issue the public notices in newspapersat the highest you can file a suit against the vendor to recover the expenses that you had to incur for filing the FIR and publishing the newspaper notice. however the cost of such suit would be far more than the money sought to be recoveredso what has happened has happened. now no use escalating the issue any furthernow you have to comply with the lender's requisitions so that your loan is sanctioned. so plz spend your energy on thati understand your ordeal and the vendor is wrong. but here the circumstances are such that doing anything is like a fait accompliYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Dear client,The phrase \"IA 787 of 22 is dismissed\" refers to an interlocutory application (IA) filed in a divorce proceeding. In this case, IA 787, which was filed in the year 2022, has been dismissed by the court.An interlocutory application is a request or motion filed by one party during the course of a legal proceeding, seeking a specific order or direction from the court. It is a procedural step taken within the larger legal case.When an IA is dismissed, it means that the court has rejected the application and the relief sought by the party filing it. The court may have found the application to be without merit or not supported by sufficient evidence, or it may have determined that the relief requested is not appropriate in the given circumstances.The dismissal of an IA does not necessarily determine the final outcome of the overall divorce proceeding. It simply means that the specific application has been denied. The divorce case may still continue, and other issues and applications can be addressed separately.It is advisable to consult with your legal counsel or the concerned court for further clarification and to understand the impact of the dismissal on your particular case. They will be able to provide you with specific guidance and advice based on the details of your divorce proceedings.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

By IO removing your father's name in the charge sheet, will not mean that the name will be automatically removed fro the FIR also, if she is filling another application before the court objecting to the removal by IO and if the court is satisfied with the averments mentioned in her petition, then your father will also be tried along with the other accused in this case.3. The IO in charge sheet can remove the name of other accused  your father may file quashing petition before high court.
