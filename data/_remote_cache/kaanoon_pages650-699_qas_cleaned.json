    "question": "NRI holding indian account and wants buyer to do transaction in it",
    "answer": "TDS on Sale of Property by an NRI:UnderSection 195of theIncome Tax Act, 1961, when a property is purchased from an NRI, the buyer is obligated to deductTDS at 20%onlong-term capital gains(if the property was held for more than 2 years). The 1% TDS rule underSection 194-IAapplies only when both the buyer and seller areresidentsof India.Even if the seller (NRI) uses aresident savings accountfor the transaction and provides a PAN card, he is still treated as an NRI for tax purposes. Thus, a lower TDS rate of 1% cannot be applied in this scenario unless special approvals or tax clearance are obtained.Remittance and Reinvestment in India:The fact that the seller does not intend to remit the money outside India and plans to reinvest it in India does not change the TDS obligations. The tax treatment remains based on the seller'sresidential statusunder the Income Tax Act, not on where the funds are being reinvested.Opening of NRE/NRO Account:The NRI seller is required by law to handle such transactions through anNRO account. Using a regularresident savings accountfor these transactions could raise compliance issues with both theIncome Tax DepartmentandRBI. Even though the seller is providing Indian ID and PAN card, it does not override their NRI status for tax purposes.As a  buyer, you are legally responsible for ensuring the correct TDS is deducted and deposited with the tax authorities. If the correct TDS is not deducted (i.e., 20% for NRI), the tax department can hold thebuyer liablefor any shortfall, including penalties and interest.Shiva BharathyAdvocate, Chennai102 Answers1 ConsultationTalk to Advocate Shiva Bharathy"

Your father passed away in 2013 and your mother in 2022, and presently your sisters are asking for an equal share in the properties.

    "question": "Daughters rights on father property share",
    "answer": "Daughter’s Right in PropertyBackground on Property Rights in IndiaSince medieval times till early 1900, Property Rights in India were governed by laws that differed from religion to religion,These property rights differed from region to region.Property Rights of Hindus before 1956, were governed by customary laws & Shashtric laws, these laws varied in some regions of India on caste basis. Mitakshara School of Thought largely governed the Hindu Property Rights.Property rights of Hindus, Sikh, Jain & Buddhist after 1956, were governed by TheHindu Succession Act, 1956.Property rights of Muslims, were largely governed by the imams , imams relied upon the sources of law which the prophet himself directed, some of which are The Qur'an, Sunna or Ahadis, Ijma & Qiyas. Muslim Law is still largely uncodified, & for the said reason courts rely upon the primary sources of Shia Law & the sources above mentioned. Property Rights of Muslim married under TheSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 are not governed by Muslim Law for the purpose of inheritance, instead it is governed by Indian Succession Act, 1925.Property Rights of Persons of other religions were also customary in past but after 1925, Property Rights are governed by Indian Succession Act, 1925.Daughter’s Right in Property underHindu Succession Act, 1956TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, divided property under to subsets, which were self acquired property & ancestral property. Before The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, ancestral property was inherited as the Survivor-ship rule.As per the survivor-ship rule, coparceners were the persons having right over the ancestral property. As per TheHindu Succession Act, 1956 at that time, coparcners were those who were lenial descendants of the same ancestor, till 3 generations next to holder. The flaw in this provision was that it only allowed the male descendants of an ancestor to become coparceners, and in turn the right in inheriting the property were only given to males. This restricted right to inherit property of any female from Hindu, Sikh, Jain & Buddhist communities.In 2005, to curb this discrimination, The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 amended the provisions of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, including Section 6 of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956.The said amendment deleted the Survivor-ship rule. The said amendment bought Intestate Rule for Ancestral Property or when the person dies without will & Testamentary Rule for Self Acquired Property. According to this, a person can give his or her self acquired property by the way of will(testament) to any person. In the case of ancestral property or when a person dies without will, intestate rules govern the inheritance given to the coparceners. Intestate rule create 4 classes of persons as coparceners, which are to be given equal amount of share in property among the classes. These classes include both male & female members of the family, with daughters included in the Class 1 Persons. This rule made daughters coparceners from birth & gave them equal liability.Confusions in the Implementation of The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, came into force from 9 September, 2005. Soon after the enforcement date, while implementation of the provisions of the said amendment, judicial minds started to ponder over the question, as to whether on 9 September, 2005, it is necessary for the father to be alive for daughter to claim its right in ancestral property?In 2016, the above question was answered for the first time by a Supreme Court Bench in the case of Prakash & Ors. V. Phulavati & Ors. The two judge bench headed by Honourable Justice Anil Dave & Honourable Justice A.K. Goyal, held that for a daughter to claim its right in property, father needs to be alive on 9 September, 2005. As per this judgement, both coparcener and his daughter needs to be alive on 9 September, 2005 for the daughters right in property. This judgement restricted the daughters right in property, where the coparcener has expired before September 9, 2005.In 2018, the above question was again put before a Supreme Court Bench in the case of Danamma& Ors. V. Amar & Ors.. The two judge bench headed by Honourable Justice A.K. Sikri & Honourable Justice Ashok Bhushan, held that for a daughter to claim its right in property, father need not be alive as on September 9, 2005. As per this judgement, even though the coparcener have expired before September 9, 2005 in 2001(in this case), prior to the amendment in TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, the daughter can claim its right in her property. This judgement gave every daughter right to claim its right in the property.The judgments, given in Prakash & Ors. V. Phulavati & Ors & Danamma& Ors. V. Amar & Ors., were giving conflicting opinions and no judgement was able to supersede the other judgement by authority, as both judgments were given by two judge Supreme Court Bench.The confusion created by these two judgments continued till 2020. In 2020, the question as to whether on 9 September, 2005, it is necessary for the father to be alive for daughter to claim its right in ancestral property, was again put before The Supreme Court in the case of Vineeta Sharma V. Rakesh Sharma & Ors. but this time the question was answered by a three judge bench, comprising of Honourable Justice Arun Mishra, Honourable Justice S. Abdul Nazeer & Honourable Justice M.R. Shah. The court held that Daughter’s Right in Coparcenary Property given under Section 6 of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, for daughters born before September 9, 2005 has same rights as for daughters born on or after September 9,2005. The court further said that, the necessity of the father to be alive on September 9, 2005 is irrelevant and not required, as the daughter is alive on the September 9, 2005, she becomes coparcener from the date of amendment,I.e. September 9, 2005. The said amendment to Section 6 of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, give status of coparcener to daughters born before or on or after September 9, 2005 in the same way it grant the status of coparcener to sons. As coparcener status under Section 6 of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, is granted by birth it is not necessary for father of daughters to be alive on the  said date of amendment, I.e. September 9, 2005. This judgement ended the confusion and finally gave daughters their right in property.The above judgement of Vineeta Sharma V. Rakesh Sharma & Ors., were relating to coparcenary/ ancestral property & not the self acquired property of father. Thus, the battle for rights were still not over.In 2022, the question of daughters right in self acquired property was properly answered by the Supreme Court in the case of Arunachala Gounder (Dead) by Lrs V.Ponnusamy & Ors.. The two judge bench headed by Honourable Justice S. Abdul Nazeer & Honourable Justice Krishna Murari, held that  self acquired property of male dying intestate would be inherited by testament, and not secession & daughters will have right to inherit the said property or property obtained in partition in case of male expiring without testament or invalid testament. When female is expired instate without any children, then ancestral property inherited from father, the said property will be inherited by fathers heir in accordance with intestate rules. When a female is expired instate without any children, the ancestral property inherited from husband’s side, the said property will be inherited by husband’s heir in accordance with intestate rules. Thus, with this judgement daughters got their right in property.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, BangaloreAvailable Now6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar NOW!"

    "question": "NRI holding indian account and wants buyer to do transaction in it",
    "answer": "TDS on Sale of Property by an NRI:UnderSection 195of theIncome Tax Act, 1961, when a property is purchased from an NRI, the buyer is obligated to deductTDS at 20%onlong-term capital gains(if the property was held for more than 2 years). The 1% TDS rule underSection 194-IAapplies only when both the buyer and seller areresidentsof India.Even if the seller (NRI) uses aresident savings accountfor the transaction and provides a PAN card, he is still treated as an NRI for tax purposes. Thus, a lower TDS rate of 1% cannot be applied in this scenario unless special approvals or tax clearance are obtained.Remittance and Reinvestment in India:The fact that the seller does not intend to remit the money outside India and plans to reinvest it in India does not change the TDS obligations. The tax treatment remains based on the seller'sresidential statusunder the Income Tax Act, not on where the funds are being reinvested.Opening of NRE/NRO Account:The NRI seller is required by law to handle such transactions through anNRO account. Using a regularresident savings accountfor these transactions could raise compliance issues with both theIncome Tax DepartmentandRBI. Even though the seller is providing Indian ID and PAN card, it does not override their NRI status for tax purposes.As a  buyer, you are legally responsible for ensuring the correct TDS is deducted and deposited with the tax authorities. If the correct TDS is not deducted (i.e., 20% for NRI), the tax department can hold thebuyer liablefor any shortfall, including penalties and interest.Shiva BharathyAdvocate, Chennai102 Answers1 ConsultationTalk to Advocate Shiva Bharathy"

    "context": "Asked 7 months ago in Property Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Daughters rights on father property share",
    "answer": "Daughter’s Right in PropertyBackground on Property Rights in IndiaSince medieval times till early 1900, Property Rights in India were governed by laws that differed from religion to religion,These property rights differed from region to region.Property Rights of Hindus before 1956, were governed by customary laws & Shashtric laws, these laws varied in some regions of India on caste basis. Mitakshara School of Thought largely governed the Hindu Property Rights.Property rights of Hindus, Sikh, Jain & Buddhist after 1956, were governed by TheHindu Succession Act, 1956.Property rights of Muslims, were largely governed by the imams , imams relied upon the sources of law which the prophet himself directed, some of which are The Qur'an, Sunna or Ahadis, Ijma & Qiyas. Muslim Law is still largely uncodified, & for the said reason courts rely upon the primary sources of Shia Law & the sources above mentioned. Property Rights of Muslim married under TheSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 are not governed by Muslim Law for the purpose of inheritance, instead it is governed by Indian Succession Act, 1925.Property Rights of Persons of other religions were also customary in past but after 1925, Property Rights are governed by Indian Succession Act, 1925.Daughter’s Right in Property underHindu Succession Act, 1956TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, divided property under to subsets, which were self acquired property & ancestral property. Before The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, ancestral property was inherited as the Survivor-ship rule.As per the survivor-ship rule, coparceners were the persons having right over the ancestral property. As per TheHindu Succession Act, 1956 at that time, coparcners were those who were lenial descendants of the same ancestor, till 3 generations next to holder. The flaw in this provision was that it only allowed the male descendants of an ancestor to become coparceners, and in turn the right in inheriting the property were only given to males. This restricted right to inherit property of any female from Hindu, Sikh, Jain & Buddhist communities.In 2005, to curb this discrimination, The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 amended the provisions of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, including Section 6 of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956.The said amendment deleted the Survivor-ship rule. The said amendment bought Intestate Rule for Ancestral Property or when the person dies without will & Testamentary Rule for Self Acquired Property. According to this, a person can give his or her self acquired property by the way of will(testament) to any person. In the case of ancestral property or when a person dies without will, intestate rules govern the inheritance given to the coparceners. Intestate rule create 4 classes of persons as coparceners, which are to be given equal amount of share in property among the classes. These classes include both male & female members of the family, with daughters included in the Class 1 Persons. This rule made daughters coparceners from birth & gave them equal liability.Confusions in the Implementation of The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, came into force from 9 September, 2005. Soon after the enforcement date, while implementation of the provisions of the said amendment, judicial minds started to ponder over the question, as to whether on 9 September, 2005, it is necessary for the father to be alive for daughter to claim its right in ancestral property?In 2016, the above question was answered for the first time by a Supreme Court Bench in the case of Prakash & Ors. V. Phulavati & Ors. The two judge bench headed by Honourable Justice Anil Dave & Honourable Justice A.K. Goyal, held that for a daughter to claim its right in property, father needs to be alive on 9 September, 2005. As per this judgement, both coparcener and his daughter needs to be alive on 9 September, 2005 for the daughters right in property. This judgement restricted the daughters right in property, where the coparcener has expired before September 9, 2005.In 2018, the above question was again put before a Supreme Court Bench in the case of Danamma& Ors. V. Amar & Ors.. The two judge bench headed by Honourable Justice A.K. Sikri & Honourable Justice Ashok Bhushan, held that for a daughter to claim its right in property, father need not be alive as on September 9, 2005. As per this judgement, even though the coparcener have expired before September 9, 2005 in 2001(in this case), prior to the amendment in TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, the daughter can claim its right in her property. This judgement gave every daughter right to claim its right in the property.The judgments, given in Prakash & Ors. V. Phulavati & Ors & Danamma& Ors. V. Amar & Ors., were giving conflicting opinions and no judgement was able to supersede the other judgement by authority, as both judgments were given by two judge Supreme Court Bench.The confusion created by these two judgments continued till 2020. In 2020, the question as to whether on 9 September, 2005, it is necessary for the father to be alive for daughter to claim its right in ancestral property, was again put before The Supreme Court in the case of Vineeta Sharma V. Rakesh Sharma & Ors. but this time the question was answered by a three judge bench, comprising of Honourable Justice Arun Mishra, Honourable Justice S. Abdul Nazeer & Honourable Justice M.R. Shah. The court held that Daughter’s Right in Coparcenary Property given under Section 6 of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, for daughters born before September 9, 2005 has same rights as for daughters born on or after September 9,2005. The court further said that, the necessity of the father to be alive on September 9, 2005 is irrelevant and not required, as the daughter is alive on the September 9, 2005, she becomes coparcener from the date of amendment,I.e. September 9, 2005. The said amendment to Section 6 of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, give status of coparcener to daughters born before or on or after September 9, 2005 in the same way it grant the status of coparcener to sons. As coparcener status under Section 6 of TheHindu Succession Act, 1956, is granted by birth it is not necessary for father of daughters to be alive on the  said date of amendment, I.e. September 9, 2005. This judgement ended the confusion and finally gave daughters their right in property.The above judgement of Vineeta Sharma V. Rakesh Sharma & Ors., were relating to coparcenary/ ancestral property & not the self acquired property of father. Thus, the battle for rights were still not over.In 2022, the question of daughters right in self acquired property was properly answered by the Supreme Court in the case of Arunachala Gounder (Dead) by Lrs V.Ponnusamy & Ors.. The two judge bench headed by Honourable Justice S. Abdul Nazeer & Honourable Justice Krishna Murari, held that  self acquired property of male dying intestate would be inherited by testament, and not secession & daughters will have right to inherit the said property or property obtained in partition in case of male expiring without testament or invalid testament. When female is expired instate without any children, then ancestral property inherited from father, the said property will be inherited by fathers heir in accordance with intestate rules. When a female is expired instate without any children, the ancestral property inherited from husband’s side, the said property will be inherited by husband’s heir in accordance with intestate rules. Thus, with this judgement daughters got their right in property.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, BangaloreAvailable Now6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you had taken a travel insurance policy, and when visiting Dubai, you had to spend money for medical expenses. As the treatment was urgent and there were no hospitals nearby, it took place in the hotel. However, now, the travel insurance has been rejected on the basis of no hospitalisation, and hence you want to enquire on the possibility of claiming a settlement for the same. Herein, firstly, it is suggested that you review the terms of the insurance policy taken, that provides clauses on medical treatment, and if the same specifies the place of medical treatment in order to cover such expenses. Secondly, all the documents that pertain to the medical expenses incurred must be gathered to show evidences. Besides, you may also argue on grounds of necessity, and unavailability of hospitals, with relevant evidences, for taking treatment at the hotel. You may also approach the consumer forum to claim compensation and the unfair denial of the insurance company.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, the same was never utilized by him, and further, he also did not pay any maintenance amount. After 12 years, you remarried, and wished to relocate with your child abroad. But, your ex-husband had refused to consent for the same, and subsequently you filed an interim application for relocation, Though the trial was completed, and an order date was set, it was delayed due to a new custody case filed by your ex-husband, by citing the change due to your remarriage, and applicability of Muslim Personal Law. Your ex-husband's brother is also a lawyer, and he has been sending money orders for the child, which was not done previously, and hence, you wish to enquire about the legal remedies available for the dismissal of the new proceedings, and consider the order of the previous case. Herein, since there exists an order from the previous case on custody, this can act as a basis to dismiss the new custody case under the Civil Procedure Code. You may also request for an interim relief seeking to permit for relocation while the case is being adjudicated.

Further, the Assistant Charity Commissioner under §41A, had ordered the recorded trustees to hold election, but they are not allowing 800 members, made in your tenure, to vote, stating that they are illegal members.

If the 800 members had been admitted, in compliance with the rules laid down, then their membership would be considered valid unless they have been disqualified. However, an evidence may be asked for to prove their illegality. With respect to the membership fees, if the members are valid, then there is no need of refund, however, if ruled invalid, their fees may be refunded, but in consideration of the trust's best interest.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, your relative is facing a criminal case in relation tocheque bounce, as he is a guarantor to a loan taken by his friend in a Cooperative Society Bank, wherein the amount came up to Rs. 3,50,000. Presently, the bank has agreed to take back the case if he pays back Rs. 1,50,000, and hence you wish to enquire on the legal course of actions to be taken so that the back does not ask you to pay the remaining amount, and if there is an option to recover the amount paid by you to the bank. Herein, firstly, it is suggested that your relative has a negotiation with a bank for a formal settlement and agreement of only up to Rs. 1,50,000 from your relative, and not ask the remaining Rs. 2,00,000 for thecheque bounce. With respect to the recovery of amount from his friend, your relative may file a suit under the Specific Relief Act or the Indian Contract Act, claiming that your relative is the guarantor and hence, entitled to recover the amount paid for his friend. To prevent from any future course of action, it is recommended that the statement, of bank to release your relative from recovering for further claims, is clearly documented.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

But, your ex-husband had refused to consent for the same, and subsequently you filed an interim application for relocation, Though the trial was completed, and an order date was set, it was delayed due to a new custody case filed by your ex-husband, by citing the change due to your remarriage, and applicability of Muslim Personal Law.

    "question": "Rented restaurant in Delhi. Property owner locked the gate and selling items.",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The actions of the property owner in locking the restaurant and selling its items are illegal even when cases of rent arrears are involved. Due process would be required for obtaining possession of the premises by issuing proper legal notice and eviction suit under the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958 or any agreement governing tenancy. Locking up the premises and the sale of the tenant's property without following a court order can only be referred to as unlawful eviction and isn't permitted either. For example, under BNS, such acts may come within the definition of offences like criminal trespass under Section 329, theft under Section 305, or criminal misappropriation under Section 314. Nothing can be removed from the tenant's property without a court decree, and no one has a right to dispose of your property. You should file a police complaint over the illegal lockout and selling of the items because both civil and criminal law consider these as criminal offences.In addition to this, you can get relief from a civil court, opening the premises by reopening, an injunction against the sale of restaurant items, and damages for losses caused by such illegal action.I hope this explanation meets your needs precisely.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, Shanti Lal is a widower, whose wife has been dead, but he has surviving children. Further, both his mother and father have also been dead, but his wife has a brother and a sister. Now, the query you have is whether Shanti Lal's children can claim their right to property from the maternal side, which is an ancestral property, and not a self-acquired property. Herein, usually the children have the right to inherit their mother's ancestral property, even if the mother has been deceased. TheHindu Succession Act, 1956 governs the inheritance of property, and the share they may claim out of the ancestral property. Furthermore, since Shanti Lal's late wife had a brother and a sister, they would also be entitled to claim a share in the ancestral property, being legal heirs to the ancestral property.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

As the treatment was urgent and there were no hospitals nearby, it took place in the hotel. However, now, the travel insurance has been rejected on the basis of no hospitalisation, and hence you want to enquire on the possibility of claiming a settlement for the same. Herein, firstly, it is suggested that you review the terms of the insurance policy taken, that provides clauses on medical treatment, and if the same specifies the place of medical treatment in order to cover such expenses. Secondly, all the documents that pertain to the medical expenses incurred must be gathered to show evidences. Besides, you may also argue on grounds of necessity, and unavailability of hospitals, with relevant evidences, for taking treatment at the hotel.

However, the same was never utilized by him, and further, he also did not pay any maintenance amount. After 12 years, you remarried, and wished to relocate with your child abroad. But, your ex-husband had refused to consent for the same, and subsequently you filed an interim application for relocation, Though the trial was completed, and an order date was set, it was delayed due to a new custody case filed by your ex-husband, by citing the change due to your remarriage, and applicability of Muslim Personal Law. Your ex-husband's brother is also a lawyer, and he has been sending money orders for the child, which was not done previously, and hence, you wish to enquire about the legal remedies available for the dismissal of the new proceedings, and consider the order of the previous case. Herein, since there exists an order from the previous case on custody, this can act as a basis to dismiss the new custody case under the Civil Procedure Code. You may also request for an interim relief seeking to permit for relocation while the case is being adjudicated.

    "question": "Regarding travel insurance claim",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you had taken a travel insurance policy, and when visiting Dubai, you had to spend money for medical expenses. As the treatment was urgent and there were no hospitals nearby, it took place in the hotel. However, now, the travel insurance has been rejected on the basis of no hospitalisation, and hence you want to enquire on the possibility of claiming a settlement for the same. Herein, firstly, it is suggested that you review the terms of the insurance policy taken, that provides clauses on medical treatment, and if the same specifies the place of medical treatment in order to cover such expenses. Secondly, all the documents that pertain to the medical expenses incurred must be gathered to show evidences. Besides, you may also argue on grounds of necessity, and unavailability of hospitals, with relevant evidences, for taking treatment at the hotel. You may also approach the consumer forum to claim compensation and the unfair denial of the insurance company.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Further, since the window opens inwards to your house, there is no constitution of nuisance or invading into the right of privacy of Supertech. Hence, it is suggested that you confirm with the local building authority and confirm if the house has been remodelled adhering to its rules, and consider for negotiation on the same with Supertech.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Construction of window",
    "answer": "Ideally windows that overlook adjacent homes or gardens or even a vacant site should be avoided. However, in some instances a window to a secondary room, (e.g. hall, bathroom, store room), may be acceptable if there is more than 2m between the properties and obscure glazing is used.The law says that you cannotconstruct a window adjoining the neighbor's wall or property without leaving a set back in his side even though the window doors are opening your side.You can Seek advice from an architect or an  engineer or at least a builder for  adopting appropriate construction methods and take precautions to minimize the potential impact.If you are advised to obtain approvals for renovation due to this from the competent authority, you may not hesitate because that will become an authenticated permission to challenge any legal complication from the neighbor which appears now or is being posed by him  now.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, your father had passed away without leaving a Will for his self-acquired property in Hyderabad, India. You are five siblings in total and each will inherit 1/5th of the share of Property. Your query is whether the property would be treated as Self-acquired or Ancestral Property. Firstly, Self-acquired property is a property which is acquired by an individual during his/her lifetime, from their own resources and not inherited from anyone else. On the other hand, Ancestral Property can be considered as a property that has been inherited from the previous generations, and is further passed on to the further generations. According to theHindu Succession Act, 1956, in the absence of will, the property would be distributed as per the rules laid down in the Act. But with respect to the nature of the property, since the property is your father's self-acquired property, through his own efforts, and as the property has been divided among the siblings, it would retain the nature of being self-acquired property.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, the only concern you have is that, the original of the old document is not present with the present owner, but you had nevertheless received the true copy of that missing document from the Registrar's office for your reference. Herein, though its better to have all the original documents, a missing document does not invalidate the transaction of sale made, as you also obtained a true copy now. Furthermore, according to theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, the seller must have a clear title for the transfer of ownership. Since you have verified the other documents, it validates the transfer. However, there may be disputes that arise in future with regard to the continuity of the title. But, since you have the true copy, it serves as an evidence to the previous ownership.

Employer can't say that the buyout option is not available for the employee. In that case, the HR and CEO can't decide unilaterally to their advantage by forcing the employee to serve the full notice period of three months.2.  If you serve for only two months, the employer can't stop you from receiving relieving letter. However if the company has provided you specialised training by spending huge amount and/or sent you abroad for specialised training at it's cost, then the company will be at advantage.3.  If three months' notice period is mentioned in the offer letter, then buyout option should have been there in the offer letter also.

    "question": "Doubts related to 3 months notice period and relieving letter",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you are working in an IT-Start-up Company, which has specified a notice period of 3 months. But you can serve only for 2 months due to certain constraints. However, the HR and the CEO of the current company are not ready to grant the same, and are also not ready for a buyout option. While you are ready for the Buyout option and pay for the same, they have declined it and told you to serve for a full notice period. But, however, you cannot serve for more than 2 months. With respect to your first query, as to whether they have the right to force you to serve the full notice period of 3 months, as the employment contract stipulates that there is a notice period of 3 months, the company generally has the right to enforce the same upon you. Unless there is an explicit clause stating for the early termination or buyout, the employer may force you to serve the full notice period. With regard to the second query, as to whether, if you serve only 2 months, then will they have the right to stop your reliving letter, although having one and a half years of experience in your current company, yes, there exists a possibility of the same as you have not served the complete notice period. For the third query, according to the Indian Contract Act, 1872, if you fail to fulfil the notice period as stipulated, the employer may have the right to seek damages from you. Henceforth, it is suggested that negotiation sessions may be entered into between you and your employer, to solve the issues and discuss other options.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Doubts related to 3 months notice period and relieving letter",
    "answer": "Resignation/ notice period depends from company to company. As per standing order/ service rule it is generally between 30-90 days and it has to be from both sides. There is no hard a fast rule under any law.A 30 to 90-day notice periodapplies in order to terminate 'workmen' (as defined in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947)There are two types ofnotice period: statutory and contractual. Statutorynoticeis theminimumlegalnoticethat can be given. Employers should give the employee:Is notice period (3 months) legal in India?It can be easily understood that the ambit and scope ofsection 23of the Indian contract act 1872, is vast and therefore the applicability of its provisions is subject to scrutiny by the court of the consideration and object of an agreement and the agreement itself.Therefore, in order to bring a case within the purview of section 23, it is necessary to show that the object of the agreement or consideration of the agreement or the agreement itself is unlawful.I'll keep it short and simple:Either party - employer or employee can terminate the contract by giving sufficient notice or compensating accordingly. In such a case, employer is bound to release the employee without any fuss, assuming that either of the above two conditions are met.So, if your organization doesn't allow you to buyout the notice period, please feel free to knock on the doors of the Indian judiciary.The following key issues should be highlighted:A 30 to 90-day notice period applies in order to terminate ‘workmen’ (as defined in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947) – that is, employees whose role is not primarily supervisory, administrative or managerial) for convenience, with 15 days’ pay due for every year worked. In the case of manufacturing units, plantations and mines with 100 or more workmen, termination for convenience requires prior government approval; in other sectors, it requires only government notification.Termination for cause does not include non-performance – it includes only behaviour which qualifies as misconduct.The ‘last in, first out’ principle requires that the employer first terminate for convenience the last people to join the organisation in the same role. However, this requirement can be contracted out of. When hiring for the same role, workmen who were terminated for convenience should be given the opportunity to re-join the company.State laws generally provide for about 15 days of earned/regular leave a year. Employees also benefit from up to 10 days of sick leave and a possible 10 additional days of ‘casual leave’. This is generally more than what most organisations would ideally like to provide.Most state laws provide for ‘casual leave’ – the employee can opt not to come to work that day without applying for leave in advance. Many organisations find this disruptive.Most state laws restrict women from working at night; if women are to work at night, specific approval must be obtained. This exemption is granted only to limited business sectors (eg, IT sector). Further, the employer must offer door-to-door transport and meet some security-related requirements.Most state laws prescribe overtime for any hours worked beyond 48 hours in a week. However, this is seldom observed.Indian law regulates and in some cases prohibits the use of contract workers. To engage contract workers, the contractor must hold a licence and the employer must be registered as a ‘principal employer’.Non-compete agreements are not enforceable under Indian law, while non-solicitation clauses can be enforced only in limited ways.While the ‘work for hire’ principle applies under the Indian copyright regime, it does not apply under the Indian patent regime; employees must thus provide formal assignments.Indian laws require employers to maintain a plethora of registers and notices. Compliance with such requirements is difficult and full compliance is rare.What do you consider unique to those doing business in your country?Some of the points mentioned above are unique to India. In addition, while Indian employment law is mainly federal in nature, most states have a Shops and Establishments Act. These statutes are similar, but not identical. Further, some states have been permitted to make amendments to central laws, with which are thus applicable in a different manner in such states.Is there any general advice you would give in the employment area?India is heavily regulated in the employment arena. Legal assistance should be obtained with regard to employment contracts and employment terms of service. Practical advice should be sought on best practices and common practices, so that policies are HR friendly and legally compliant. Advice should also be obtained on areas where compliance is difficult, so that employers can adopt positions that balance convenience against risk.Emerging issues/hot topics/proposals for reformAre there any noteworthy proposals for reform in your jurisdiction?As part of the objective to make it easier to do business in India, the government has proposed that the federal labour laws be revised and possibly amalgamated into two or three labour codes. If this is accomplished, the filing requirements will be streamlined. Amendments have also been proposed to some federal laws relating to factories and the use of apprentices. There has been no progress taking these initiatives forward and it appears unlikely that the government will do so.Key amendments to law in recent months include a substantial change to the Maternity Benefit Act 1961 through the Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act 2016. Key features of this amendment include:an increase in paid time off for eligible female employees from 12 weeks to 26 weeks in case a female employee has fewer than two children. If she has two or more children, she is entitled to 12 weeks’ leave;the introduction of the concepts of a 'commissioning mother' and an 'adopting mother', which widens the scope of the law. Such mothers are entitled to 12 weeks’ leave;the option to work from home once the paid maternity leave period has ended, based on an agreement with the employer; andrequiring an establishment with 50 or more employees to set up a crèche facility.Overall, the amendments are progressive in nature. From an employer’s perspective, there will be greater financial implications due to the increased maternity leave payment and also the benefits to be paid to the new categories of eligible female employees.In December 2016 the Employee’s State Insurance Act 1948 was amended, increasing the salary or wages threshold for coverage of an employee to Rs21,000 (approximately $309) per month from the previous wage cap of Rs15,000 (approximately $221) per month. The act applies to commercial establishments and provides for social security insurance for employees in case of sickness. The amendment has led to higher employee coverage under the law.What are the emerging trends in employment law in your jurisdiction?After decades of the government and courts adopting a somewhat socialist mind set, there has been a shift to a more pragmatic, business-friendly approach. The old approach, which focused on unskilled and daily wage workers, has given way to a focus on India’s growing service industry. There is heightened interest in rewriting the employment laws to make them more business friendly. India’s newest employment law on the prevention of sexual harassment is also leading to an increased number of sexual harassment complaints and additional processes to be followed.Another important aspect is the move towards e-governance in the labour law sector. A new web portal launched by the government provides users with a unique labour identification number, facilitating online registration, the filing of self-certified, simplified and single online returns for specific federal laws, and a transparent labour inspection scheme on risk-based criteria. Some concessions have also been provided for start ups in terms of employment law compliances.The employment relationshipCountry specific lawsWhat laws and regulations govern the employment relationship?Some states require that the employer prepare an appointment order for new hires, although this is seldom observed. There are no direct laws dealing with probation on a general basis in India, which is, however, a common practice. The (federal) Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act1946 (which is applicable to workmen), provides for a probationary period of up to three months. Certain states have built in the probation concept indirectly into their local laws, which ranges from three to six months. Ideally, a probation period should not exceed 240 days, as several statutory social welfare laws apply to employees who have worked for such period. The Industrial Disputes Act 1947 (applicable to workmen), prescribes that if certain terms of service change, notice must be given to the employee. It also prescribes requirements for termination for convenience, including notice and compensation.Who do these cover, including categories of worker?There are essentially two types of employer and two types of employee. Employers are either:‘establishments’ – a term which encompasses all employers; or‘factories’ – a term which typically encompasses manufacturing units. Mines are sometimes covered along with factories.Employees are either:‘employees’ – a term which covers all employees in any kind of role; or‘workmen’ (as defined in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947) – that is, employees whose primary role is not supervisory, managerial or administrative.In addition, certain state laws may exclude senior management employees from their scope of application.MisclassificationAre there specific rules regarding employee/contractor classification?Indian law regulates and in some cases prohibits the use of contract workers. To engage contract workers, the contractor must hold a licence and the employer must be registered as a ‘principal employer’.ContractsMust an employment contract be in writing?Except in states which require an appointment order, Indian law does not explicitly require that an employment contract be in writing, although this is the typical practice followed by most employers.Are any terms implied into employment contracts?Certain legal terms are implied in the employment contract. A duty of care, a right to privacy and a duty to maintain confidentiality are implied in the employment contract.Are mandatory arbitration/dispute resolution agreements enforceable?Yes.How can employers make changes to existing employment agreements?Under Indian contract law, a contract requires the consent of both parties. Thus, the employer cannot unilaterally make changes to the employment agreement. Typically, compensation terms are set out in an annex to the agreement, which should provide that these will be subject to change from time to time. Standard terms of employment – such as working hours, vacation, benefits, security procedures and disciplinary procedures – are normally set out in the employment terms of service, rather than in the employment contract. The employment contract should state that these terms of service apply to the employee and will be subject to change from time to time.An employer cannot change specified service conditions (eg, compensation, grade classification and customary concessions) for ‘workmen’ (as defined in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947) without providing 21 days’ prior statutory notice and notice to the labour authorities. This should be considered when implementing changes to an employment agreement.Foreign workersIs a distinction drawn between local and foreign workers?A significant difference between local and foreign employees is evident in the law on provident funds, which is a type of pension. The threshold to qualify, the manner of deduction and the benefits are different for foreign employee, and differ further depending on whether the country of origin has a social service agreement with India. There are no other substantive distinctions between local and foreign employees.RecruitmentAdvertisingWhat are the requirements relating to advertising positions?Under the Employment Exchange (Compulsory Notification of Vacancies) Act, 1959, if the state so requires, a private sector establishment with 25 or more employees must notify vacancies to specific employment exchanges. However, this is seldom observed.Background checksWhat can employers do with regard to background checks and inquiries in relation to the following:(a) Criminal records?While it is possible to conduct criminal background checks, this is extremely difficult in practice because criminal records are not digitised and are not consolidated nationwide. Accordingly, where a criminal background check must be carried out, this is typically done at the police station with jurisdiction over the employee’s current place of residence or anywhere that he or she has lived for a reasonable period.(b) Medical history?Employees’ medical histories cannot be accessed easily, since these are not digitised and there is no repository of medical records. Employee consent is required to disclose medical records to the employer. However, some employers require employees to undergo medical checks and have the diagnostic centre send the report directly to the employer. Subject to certain specific restrictions (eg, pre-employment testing for HIV is not permitted), there is no prohibition against this practice under Indian law.(c) Drug screening?Indian law does not prohibit drug screening.(d) Credit checks?An individual is entitled to obtain information on his or her credit rating. The employer can also access this information, with the employee’s permission and on providing necessary proof of identity. Access to credit rating information is more common in banks and financial institutions.(e) Immigration status?Indian law does not specifically require an employer to check the immigration status of a foreigner. Indian law does not prevent the employer from checking whether a foreign employee holds the necessary visa to work in India. If a foreign individual on an employment visa wishes to change employment to another company, he or she must leave India and apply afresh for a visa. The only exception is where the foreigner is changing jobs between a registered holding company and its subsidiaries or vice versa, or between subsidiaries of a registered holding company. In such case the foreigner may not need to leave India, provided that he or she fulfils specific criteria, including obtaining prior government approval for the change in employment.(f) Social media?There is no bar against conducting background checks through social media.(g) Other?The most common background checks undertaken are of educational qualifications. The employee must consent to this and the employer (or an outsourced provider) will then write to the relevant institution requesting confirmation. The institution may charge a fee for providing this information. Most institutions have a procedure in place in this regard.Wages and working timePayIs there a national minimum wage and, if so, what is it?There is no national minimum wage. However, the central and state governments can issue notifications on minimum wages in specific industries. The federal government has set the recommended minimum wage to Rs176 per day and advised state governments to implement the same.Are there restrictions on working hours?By and large, working up to nine hours a day is permitted, with a weekly limit of 48 to 50 hours. There are laws that restrict women from working at night (between 8:00pm and 6:00am). Some states also have a maximum number of hours of overtime that can be worked.Hours and overtimeWhat are the requirements for meal and rest breaks?Most state laws provide for a break of 30 to 60 minutes after four to five hours of work. In practice, it is typical to provide a one-hour lunch break in an eight-hour day.How should overtime be calculated?Overtime is usually calculated at twice the rate of normal wages. State law defines what the term ‘wages’ covers; this typically includes basic wages plus normal allowances, but excludes any bonus component.What exemptions are there from overtime?There are no exemptions from paying overtime. However, the overtime provisions are seldom observed – generally, companies do not pay overtime when employees stay late to complete their work. It is recommended that employers pay overtime at least when employees are required by the nature of the assignment to work overtime – for example, call centre employees.Is there a minimum paid holiday entitlement?Yes. This varies from state to state, but is generally about 15 days. Most states prescribe up to 10 days of sick leave and some states prescribe another entitlement of up to 10 days of casual leave. In addition, most states prescribe about 10 days of public holidays; four to five of these are mandatory national and state holidays, while the remainder are chosen by the employer from a larger list provided by the state.What are the rules applicable to final pay and deductions from wages?Final pay must be made within two days of the date of termination where the employee’s services are terminated by the employer. In case of the employee’s resignation, the final pay-out can be made as part of the company’s normal payment cycle.Deductions are permitted from an employee’s wages, but only for specified reasons (eg, on account of fines, deductions for damage to or loss of goods expressly entrusted to the employee and recovery of loans or advances). Deductions are generally permitted only up to 50% of the employee’s wages.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, BangaloreAvailable Now6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar NOW!"

    "question": "Gift deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the present scenario, the property in question is a self-acquired property, consisting of a house and an agricultural land that the mother had gifted to her son. However, the son passed away prior to the mother, raising a question on what is the right of the mother on the gifted property. Taking into consideration the provisions of theTransfer of Property Act, and theHindu Succession Act, a gift can be understood as a voluntary transfer of property made from one person to another, without involving any consideration. In relevance to the present case, once the property is gifted, the son would have ownership on that property. However, unless specified in the gift deed, the Property does not revert back to the Mother, but the Property would pass on to the son's legal heirs, in accordance to the aforementioned legislations. This would be distributed between the legal heirs as mentioned under theHindu Succession Act, which includes the Class I heirs as the Mother, Wife and his Children (if any).Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

By this way in above case son if dies before mother definately son's legal heirs as perHindu Succession Actwill claim for that property.But if that son wants to get that property to his wife and son after his death then he can make a will with such content.Notary registration is also will do, but It is always better to register Gift Deed before a Registrar as during the probate problems will not be there.Sheetal PawarAdvocate, Mumbai24 Answers1 ConsultationTalk to Advocate Sheetal Pawar"

    "question": "Gift deed",
    "answer": "1. Once the property is gifted, the person to whom it is gifted becomes an absolute owner of the property. If he predeceases his mother, his legal heirs would get equal share in the property.2. Since mother is also one of the legal heir of son, share of such property would also be devolved in her favour in case the so dies. Son's other legal heirs like kids and wife will get a share too.3. The above two scenario occurs when a person dies intestate i.e. without leaving a will.4. Son has two options to ensure that the property gets passed to his wife and children:a: Execute a will: The wife and children will get the property after the death of the son.b: Execute gift deed or sale deed: The wife and children will get the property immediately on execution.5. Will does not need to be mandatorily registered. Notarisation would also suffice in case of Will. In case of gift deed or sale, deed, registration is mandatory with the concerned sub registrar having jurisdiction.Siddharth JainAdvocate, New Delhi6464 Answers102 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Siddharth Jain"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, your father had passed away without leaving a Will for his self-acquired property in Hyderabad, India. You are five siblings in total and each will inherit 1/5th of the share of Property. Your query is whether the property would be treated as Self-acquired or Ancestral Property. Firstly, Self-acquired property is a property which is acquired by an individual during his/her lifetime, from their own resources and not inherited from anyone else. On the other hand, Ancestral Property can be considered as a property that has been inherited from the previous generations, and is further passed on to the further generations. According to theHindu Succession Act, 1956, in the absence of will, the property would be distributed as per the rules laid down in the Act. But with respect to the nature of the property, since the property is your father's self-acquired property, through his own efforts, and as the property has been divided among the siblings, it would retain the nature of being self-acquired property.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

You have also invested around Rs. 15 Lakhs for building three shops and a floor, paid off your father's loans, covered major medical expenses of your mother and father, and additionally, your elder and middle brother have also borrowed Rs. 2 Lakhs, and 1 Lakh from you for business, covering a total of around Rs. 40 Lakhs.

You husband had been mentally abusive to you, by way of shouting, screaming, and throwing things, affecting your minor kids as well. Presently, you and your kids live alone and are planning to move abroad and settle down there permanently for both of your well-being. You have also mentioned that your husband never visited your kids and you, for about 8 months, and now suddenly, he as started visiting, but does not show interest on your kids. Hence, your query is on where there is any way of taking custody of your kids, allowing to take them with you to abroad without the consent of their father. Herein, according to the Indian Divorce Act, 1869, the custody of the minor children can be taken into consideration, during the divorce proceedings. One of the major points that would be noticed by courts is the welfare of the child, as the primary consideration. Besides, the best interests of the minor children would also be taken into account before deciding on the same. Therefore, even though your husband does not consent for you moving abroad with your children, you may seek court's permission for the same, and on their approval, you may move to abroad with the children.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Children custody and moving abroad with minor kids",
    "answer": "- If you have filed the divorce petition on the ground of mutual consent , then you can settle the dispute of custody of the kid with your husband at the time of divorce.- Further, if you have filed a contested divorce petition then you will have to file a separate custody petition before the family Court for getting permanent custody of the kid without a visitation right.- Further, under the Guardian and Ward Act, , the welfare of the child as the paramount importance, like ethical upbringing of the child, Safe-keeping of the child, Good education , and economic well-being of the guardian.- Hence, to win sole physical and legal custody, you should show the court that awarding you custody is in the best interests of your child due to factors such as your existing relationship with the child, stability of the home life you provide, inability of the father to meet the child's needs; father's lack of involvement in day to day need of the kid.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Construction of window",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you have a house in Meerut, in which, the back wall of the house faces an empty plot part of the Supertech Sports City. While you were doing remodelling of your house, wherein you constructed a window facing the super teach plot, but opening inwards on your house's back wall, Supertech has objected the same and stated that you cannot build a window facing their property, even though the opening is inwards in your house. Therefore, you wish to understand the legal implications involved. Herein, as provided under the Indian Easements Act, 1882, the owner of the property usually has the right to build in any way, and enjoy the property unless it violates the rights of the neighbours. Now, the construction of the window does not directly infringe Supertech's rights. Further, since the window opens inwards to your house, there is no constitution of nuisance or invading into the right of privacy of Supertech. Hence, it is suggested that you confirm with the local building authority and confirm if the house has been remodelled adhering to its rules, and consider for negotiation on the same with Supertech.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Construction of window",
    "answer": "Ideally windows that overlook adjacent homes or gardens or even a vacant site should be avoided. However, in some instances a window to a secondary room, (e.g. hall, bathroom, store room), may be acceptable if there is more than 2m between the properties and obscure glazing is used.The law says that you cannotconstruct a window adjoining the neighbor's wall or property without leaving a set back in his side even though the window doors are opening your side.You can Seek advice from an architect or an  engineer or at least a builder for  adopting appropriate construction methods and take precautions to minimize the potential impact.If you are advised to obtain approvals for renovation due to this from the competent authority, you may not hesitate because that will become an authenticated permission to challenge any legal complication from the neighbor which appears now or is being posed by him  now.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

You are five siblings in total and each will inherit 1/5th of the share of Property. Your query is whether the property would be treated as Self-acquired or Ancestral Property. Firstly, Self-acquired property is a property which is acquired by an individual during his/her lifetime, from their own resources and not inherited from anyone else. On the other hand, Ancestral Property can be considered as a property that has been inherited from the previous generations, and is further passed on to the further generations. According to theHindu Succession Act, 1956, in the absence of will, the property would be distributed as per the rules laid down in the Act. But with respect to the nature of the property, since the property is your father's self-acquired property, through his own efforts, and as the property has been divided among the siblings, it would retain the nature of being self-acquired property.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Mentally unstable coworker making false allegations of harassment",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Herein, you have been working in a Government College, at a teaching position. A female teacher from the Psychology department had made a complaint of sexual harassment with no specifics to the Internal Committee, against four male and three female teachers, including you. This complaint was posted by the teacher on Facebook and WhatsApp and on enquiry by the Internal Committee, oral complaints were made by the teacher that were mostly in relation to the administrative grievances, not of sexual harassment, except one complaint against you wherein it has been alleged that she has heard from someone that there are certain objectionable photos and videos of her in your mobile. When this was further enquired, she confessed to the fact that she hasn't seen any of them by herself and will not reveal the identity of the person who told about the same. Further, no evidence was also presented and the Committee submitted a report with baseless allegations. Now, you want to safeguard yourself against her actions of defaming you, along with others. Here, firstly, it is very significant that the detailed records are maintained of all the communications between you and the Complainant, the internal committee meetings and the social media posts made by her. Further, if the social media posts made are defamatory in nature, you can file a complaint to cease the same, as the claims made are baseless. Hence, it can be claimed that the provisions given under the Protection Under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, are misused by her.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Children custody and moving abroad with minor kids",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you have applied for Divorce and the initial process for the same is going on. You husband had been mentally abusive to you, by way of shouting, screaming, and throwing things, affecting your minor kids as well. Presently, you and your kids live alone and are planning to move abroad and settle down there permanently for both of your well-being. You have also mentioned that your husband never visited your kids and you, for about 8 months, and now suddenly, he as started visiting, but does not show interest on your kids. Hence, your query is on where there is any way of taking custody of your kids, allowing to take them with you to abroad without the consent of their father. Herein, according to the Indian Divorce Act, 1869, the custody of the minor children can be taken into consideration, during the divorce proceedings.

Besides, the best interests of the minor children would also be taken into account before deciding on the same. Therefore, even though your husband does not consent for you moving abroad with your children, you may seek court's permission for the same, and on their approval, you may move to abroad with the children.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, the Property was co-owned by your father and mother with a share of 50% each. However, after the death of your father, you have a query as to what is the procedure of transferring 100% of that Property in the name of your mother. With respect to this, firstly a legal heir certificate is necessary to be obtained that specifies the legal heirs of the deceased. For the same, your father's death certificate and identity proof of the legal heirs is necessary to be submitted. After obtaining the certificate, mutation of property may be done, so as to change the ownership and update the records of the land, in your mother's name. Besides this, considering theHindu Succession Act, 1956, the property of your father would generally devolve upon your mother as a legal heir, being the spouse of your father. Henceforth, in accordance to the laws of India, the land would typically transfer to your mother and other legal heirs, but the other legal heirs may present a no-objection certificate to transfer the complete share of the property.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

While you were doing remodelling of your house, wherein you constructed a window facing the super teach plot, but opening inwards on your house's back wall, Supertech has objected the same and stated that you cannot build a window facing their property, even though the opening is inwards in your house. Therefore, you wish to understand the legal implications involved. Herein, as provided under the Indian Easements Act, 1882, the owner of the property usually has the right to build in any way, and enjoy the property unless it violates the rights of the neighbours. Now, the construction of the window does not directly infringe Supertech's rights. Further, since the window opens inwards to your house, there is no constitution of nuisance or invading into the right of privacy of Supertech. Hence, it is suggested that you confirm with the local building authority and confirm if the house has been remodelled adhering to its rules, and consider for negotiation on the same with Supertech.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "For any kind of partition to happen on a consensual basis through a settlement deed, participation and consent of all the legal heirs is necessary. Thus, 4 of you, cannot do this at the cost of exclusion of your one sister who is demanding 40% share in this property. Though, I understand that by operation of law, you get to inherits 20% stake in this property post demise of your father and are entitled to it; how can you determinewhereis 20% lies in the property without involvement of your 5th sister.I will suggest you the route of filing a partition suit, instead of getting it done mutually since all the parties/legal heirs are not having a mutual consensus.Vibhanshu SrivastavaAdvocate, Lucknow9736 Answers318 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Vibhanshu Srivastava"

    "question": "Inheriting father's self-acquired property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, your father had passed away without leaving a Will for his self-acquired property in Hyderabad, India. You are five siblings in total and each will inherit 1/5th of the share of Property. Your query is whether the property would be treated as Self-acquired or Ancestral Property. Firstly, Self-acquired property is a property which is acquired by an individual during his/her lifetime, from their own resources and not inherited from anyone else. On the other hand, Ancestral Property can be considered as a property that has been inherited from the previous generations, and is further passed on to the further generations. According to theHindu Succession Act, 1956, in the absence of will, the property would be distributed as per the rules laid down in the Act. But with respect to the nature of the property, since the property is your father's self-acquired property, through his own efforts, and as the property has been divided among the siblings, it would retain the nature of being self-acquired property.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This shop had been sold and purchased for four times, and you are buying it with the present owner. The Owner has all the relevant documents and got the due diligence test done as well. However, the only concern you have is that, the original of the old document is not present with the present owner, but you had nevertheless received the true copy of that missing document from the Registrar's office for your reference. Herein, though its better to have all the original documents, a missing document does not invalidate the transaction of sale made, as you also obtained a true copy now. Furthermore, according to theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, the seller must have a clear title for the transfer of ownership. Since you have verified the other documents, it validates the transfer. However, there may be disputes that arise in future with regard to the continuity of the title. But, since you have the true copy, it serves as an evidence to the previous ownership. Hence, you may proceed with the purchase of the shop, but it is suggested that the implications of the missing document have been taken care of at first, so as to protect your interests in the future.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Construction of window",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you have a house in Meerut, in which, the back wall of the house faces an empty plot part of the Supertech Sports City. While you were doing remodelling of your house, wherein you constructed a window facing the super teach plot, but opening inwards on your house's back wall, Supertech has objected the same and stated that you cannot build a window facing their property, even though the opening is inwards in your house. Therefore, you wish to understand the legal implications involved. Herein, as provided under the Indian Easements Act, 1882, the owner of the property usually has the right to build in any way, and enjoy the property unless it violates the rights of the neighbours. Now, the construction of the window does not directly infringe Supertech's rights. Further, since the window opens inwards to your house, there is no constitution of nuisance or invading into the right of privacy of Supertech. Hence, it is suggested that you confirm with the local building authority and confirm if the house has been remodelled adhering to its rules, and consider for negotiation on the same with Supertech.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Construction of window",
    "answer": "Ideally windows that overlook adjacent homes or gardens or even a vacant site should be avoided. However, in some instances a window to a secondary room, (e.g. hall, bathroom, store room), may be acceptable if there is more than 2m between the properties and obscure glazing is used.The law says that you cannotconstruct a window adjoining the neighbor's wall or property without leaving a set back in his side even though the window doors are opening your side.You can Seek advice from an architect or an  engineer or at least a builder for  adopting appropriate construction methods and take precautions to minimize the potential impact.If you are advised to obtain approvals for renovation due to this from the competent authority, you may not hesitate because that will become an authenticated permission to challenge any legal complication from the neighbor which appears now or is being posed by him  now.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Girls family has filed section 85/115 clause 2 and 315 clause 2 BNS how do i get the bail as FIR as been filed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the present situation, you were married on December 7, 2023, and subsequently, your wife left to her home in Rajasthan on July 19, 2024, and kept travelling back and forth. Her father filed a case against you under the mentioned provisions of BNS, and asked for Rs. 50 Lakhs in the out of court settlement. Though you stated that you will not be able to pay the same, they sent police summons to sort the issue. They also told that they would file an FIR, for which you will have to be present after such filing. Therefore you want to get bail for the same as the cases have been filed, and you have an issue in travelling to Rajasthan as you are unemployed and your mother is not well in terms of health. Firstly, if you anticipate that an FIR would be filed against you, as the cases have already been filed, you may opt for applying for an anticipatory bail under Section 482 of BNSS to avoid such arrest. If you are arrested, you can even then apply for a regular bail under 480 of the BNSS, being a non-bailable offence. With respect to maintenance being claimed, it is important that you respond to the summons being sent, however, you can contest the claim by bringing forward your financial position of being unemployed. You may also file for transferring the case to your local jurisdiction, citing the relevant reasons under Section 448 of BNSS.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Each loan is treated independently, and the bank may update its policies or assess the risk differently based on a buyer's profile, regulatory changes, or internal procedures.If the bank denies your loan because you do not possess those specific documents you can1. Clarify the reason why the bank requested to have those documents, and try to solve this problem by discussing alternatives with the bank.2. Approach the bank grievance redressal system and narrate the inconsistency in the requirement of documents.3. File a suit in a civil court if the denial causes undue delay or results in pecuniary loss, but more than that, it is usually resorted to when all else fails.Nonetheless, it has to be remembered that there is no explicit guarantee of the approval of loan applications under the discretion of banks processing the same.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Doubts related to 3 months notice period and relieving letter",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, you are working in an IT-Start-up Company, which has specified a notice period of 3 months. But you can serve only for 2 months due to certain constraints. However, the HR and the CEO of the current company are not ready to grant the same, and are also not ready for a buyout option. While you are ready for the Buyout option and pay for the same, they have declined it and told you to serve for a full notice period. But, however, you cannot serve for more than 2 months. With respect to your first query, as to whether they have the right to force you to serve the full notice period of 3 months, as the employment contract stipulates that there is a notice period of 3 months, the company generally has the right to enforce the same upon you. Unless there is an explicit clause stating for the early termination or buyout, the employer may force you to serve the full notice period. With regard to the second query, as to whether, if you serve only 2 months, then will they have the right to stop your reliving letter, although having one and a half years of experience in your current company, yes, there exists a possibility of the same as you have not served the complete notice period. For the third query, according to the Indian Contract Act, 1872, if you fail to fulfil the notice period as stipulated, the employer may have the right to seek damages from you. Henceforth, it is suggested that negotiation sessions may be entered into between you and your employer, to solve the issues and discuss other options.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "1. Company cannot force an employee to serve the notice period. They cannot withhold the relieving letter even if you fail to serve the agreed notice period. You have every right to get your relieving letter.2. Ordinarily, the repercussion that employee faces in case he fails to serve the notice period is salary deduction of unserved notice period. The exact repercussion could be known after seeing your employment agreement/ appointment letter.3. The recourse is to send them legal demand notice for the same. If they still denies to give you the relieving letter. Prefer a labour complaint in the office of concerned labour commissioner as it is in contravention of section 27 of the Indian contract act which states that no agreement in restraint of trade or profession can be enforced in the court of law.Siddharth JainAdvocate, New Delhi6464 Answers102 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Siddharth Jain"

    "question": "Doubts related to 3 months notice period and relieving letter",
    "answer": "Resignation/ notice period depends from company to company. As per standing order/ service rule it is generally between 30-90 days and it has to be from both sides. There is no hard a fast rule under any law.A 30 to 90-day notice periodapplies in order to terminate 'workmen' (as defined in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947)There are two types ofnotice period: statutory and contractual. Statutorynoticeis theminimumlegalnoticethat can be given. Employers should give the employee:Is notice period (3 months) legal in India?It can be easily understood that the ambit and scope ofsection 23of the Indian contract act 1872, is vast and therefore the applicability of its provisions is subject to scrutiny by the court of the consideration and object of an agreement and the agreement itself.Therefore, in order to bring a case within the purview of section 23, it is necessary to show that the object of the agreement or consideration of the agreement or the agreement itself is unlawful.I'll keep it short and simple:Either party - employer or employee can terminate the contract by giving sufficient notice or compensating accordingly. In such a case, employer is bound to release the employee without any fuss, assuming that either of the above two conditions are met.So, if your organization doesn't allow you to buyout the notice period, please feel free to knock on the doors of the Indian judiciary.The following key issues should be highlighted:A 30 to 90-day notice period applies in order to terminate ‘workmen’ (as defined in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947) – that is, employees whose role is not primarily supervisory, administrative or managerial) for convenience, with 15 days’ pay due for every year worked. In the case of manufacturing units, plantations and mines with 100 or more workmen, termination for convenience requires prior government approval; in other sectors, it requires only government notification.Termination for cause does not include non-performance – it includes only behaviour which qualifies as misconduct.The ‘last in, first out’ principle requires that the employer first terminate for convenience the last people to join the organisation in the same role. However, this requirement can be contracted out of. When hiring for the same role, workmen who were terminated for convenience should be given the opportunity to re-join the company.State laws generally provide for about 15 days of earned/regular leave a year. Employees also benefit from up to 10 days of sick leave and a possible 10 additional days of ‘casual leave’. This is generally more than what most organisations would ideally like to provide.Most state laws provide for ‘casual leave’ – the employee can opt not to come to work that day without applying for leave in advance. Many organisations find this disruptive.Most state laws restrict women from working at night; if women are to work at night, specific approval must be obtained. This exemption is granted only to limited business sectors (eg, IT sector). Further, the employer must offer door-to-door transport and meet some security-related requirements.Most state laws prescribe overtime for any hours worked beyond 48 hours in a week. However, this is seldom observed.Indian law regulates and in some cases prohibits the use of contract workers. To engage contract workers, the contractor must hold a licence and the employer must be registered as a ‘principal employer’.Non-compete agreements are not enforceable under Indian law, while non-solicitation clauses can be enforced only in limited ways.While the ‘work for hire’ principle applies under the Indian copyright regime, it does not apply under the Indian patent regime; employees must thus provide formal assignments.Indian laws require employers to maintain a plethora of registers and notices. Compliance with such requirements is difficult and full compliance is rare.What do you consider unique to those doing business in your country?Some of the points mentioned above are unique to India. In addition, while Indian employment law is mainly federal in nature, most states have a Shops and Establishments Act. These statutes are similar, but not identical. Further, some states have been permitted to make amendments to central laws, with which are thus applicable in a different manner in such states.Is there any general advice you would give in the employment area?India is heavily regulated in the employment arena. Legal assistance should be obtained with regard to employment contracts and employment terms of service. Practical advice should be sought on best practices and common practices, so that policies are HR friendly and legally compliant. Advice should also be obtained on areas where compliance is difficult, so that employers can adopt positions that balance convenience against risk.Emerging issues/hot topics/proposals for reformAre there any noteworthy proposals for reform in your jurisdiction?As part of the objective to make it easier to do business in India, the government has proposed that the federal labour laws be revised and possibly amalgamated into two or three labour codes. If this is accomplished, the filing requirements will be streamlined. Amendments have also been proposed to some federal laws relating to factories and the use of apprentices. There has been no progress taking these initiatives forward and it appears unlikely that the government will do so.Key amendments to law in recent months include a substantial change to the Maternity Benefit Act 1961 through the Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act 2016. Key features of this amendment include:an increase in paid time off for eligible female employees from 12 weeks to 26 weeks in case a female employee has fewer than two children. If she has two or more children, she is entitled to 12 weeks’ leave;the introduction of the concepts of a 'commissioning mother' and an 'adopting mother', which widens the scope of the law. Such mothers are entitled to 12 weeks’ leave;the option to work from home once the paid maternity leave period has ended, based on an agreement with the employer; andrequiring an establishment with 50 or more employees to set up a crèche facility.Overall, the amendments are progressive in nature. From an employer’s perspective, there will be greater financial implications due to the increased maternity leave payment and also the benefits to be paid to the new categories of eligible female employees.In December 2016 the Employee’s State Insurance Act 1948 was amended, increasing the salary or wages threshold for coverage of an employee to Rs21,000 (approximately $309) per month from the previous wage cap of Rs15,000 (approximately $221) per month. The act applies to commercial establishments and provides for social security insurance for employees in case of sickness. The amendment has led to higher employee coverage under the law.What are the emerging trends in employment law in your jurisdiction?After decades of the government and courts adopting a somewhat socialist mind set, there has been a shift to a more pragmatic, business-friendly approach. The old approach, which focused on unskilled and daily wage workers, has given way to a focus on India’s growing service industry. There is heightened interest in rewriting the employment laws to make them more business friendly. India’s newest employment law on the prevention of sexual harassment is also leading to an increased number of sexual harassment complaints and additional processes to be followed.Another important aspect is the move towards e-governance in the labour law sector. A new web portal launched by the government provides users with a unique labour identification number, facilitating online registration, the filing of self-certified, simplified and single online returns for specific federal laws, and a transparent labour inspection scheme on risk-based criteria. Some concessions have also been provided for start ups in terms of employment law compliances.The employment relationshipCountry specific lawsWhat laws and regulations govern the employment relationship?Some states require that the employer prepare an appointment order for new hires, although this is seldom observed. There are no direct laws dealing with probation on a general basis in India, which is, however, a common practice. The (federal) Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act1946 (which is applicable to workmen), provides for a probationary period of up to three months. Certain states have built in the probation concept indirectly into their local laws, which ranges from three to six months. Ideally, a probation period should not exceed 240 days, as several statutory social welfare laws apply to employees who have worked for such period. The Industrial Disputes Act 1947 (applicable to workmen), prescribes that if certain terms of service change, notice must be given to the employee. It also prescribes requirements for termination for convenience, including notice and compensation.Who do these cover, including categories of worker?There are essentially two types of employer and two types of employee. Employers are either:‘establishments’ – a term which encompasses all employers; or‘factories’ – a term which typically encompasses manufacturing units. Mines are sometimes covered along with factories.Employees are either:‘employees’ – a term which covers all employees in any kind of role; or‘workmen’ (as defined in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947) – that is, employees whose primary role is not supervisory, managerial or administrative.In addition, certain state laws may exclude senior management employees from their scope of application.MisclassificationAre there specific rules regarding employee/contractor classification?Indian law regulates and in some cases prohibits the use of contract workers. To engage contract workers, the contractor must hold a licence and the employer must be registered as a ‘principal employer’.ContractsMust an employment contract be in writing?Except in states which require an appointment order, Indian law does not explicitly require that an employment contract be in writing, although this is the typical practice followed by most employers.Are any terms implied into employment contracts?Certain legal terms are implied in the employment contract. A duty of care, a right to privacy and a duty to maintain confidentiality are implied in the employment contract.Are mandatory arbitration/dispute resolution agreements enforceable?Yes.How can employers make changes to existing employment agreements?Under Indian contract law, a contract requires the consent of both parties. Thus, the employer cannot unilaterally make changes to the employment agreement. Typically, compensation terms are set out in an annex to the agreement, which should provide that these will be subject to change from time to time. Standard terms of employment – such as working hours, vacation, benefits, security procedures and disciplinary procedures – are normally set out in the employment terms of service, rather than in the employment contract. The employment contract should state that these terms of service apply to the employee and will be subject to change from time to time.An employer cannot change specified service conditions (eg, compensation, grade classification and customary concessions) for ‘workmen’ (as defined in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947) without providing 21 days’ prior statutory notice and notice to the labour authorities. This should be considered when implementing changes to an employment agreement.Foreign workersIs a distinction drawn between local and foreign workers?A significant difference between local and foreign employees is evident in the law on provident funds, which is a type of pension. The threshold to qualify, the manner of deduction and the benefits are different for foreign employee, and differ further depending on whether the country of origin has a social service agreement with India. There are no other substantive distinctions between local and foreign employees.RecruitmentAdvertisingWhat are the requirements relating to advertising positions?Under the Employment Exchange (Compulsory Notification of Vacancies) Act, 1959, if the state so requires, a private sector establishment with 25 or more employees must notify vacancies to specific employment exchanges. However, this is seldom observed.Background checksWhat can employers do with regard to background checks and inquiries in relation to the following:(a) Criminal records?While it is possible to conduct criminal background checks, this is extremely difficult in practice because criminal records are not digitised and are not consolidated nationwide. Accordingly, where a criminal background check must be carried out, this is typically done at the police station with jurisdiction over the employee’s current place of residence or anywhere that he or she has lived for a reasonable period.(b) Medical history?Employees’ medical histories cannot be accessed easily, since these are not digitised and there is no repository of medical records. Employee consent is required to disclose medical records to the employer. However, some employers require employees to undergo medical checks and have the diagnostic centre send the report directly to the employer. Subject to certain specific restrictions (eg, pre-employment testing for HIV is not permitted), there is no prohibition against this practice under Indian law.(c) Drug screening?Indian law does not prohibit drug screening.(d) Credit checks?An individual is entitled to obtain information on his or her credit rating. The employer can also access this information, with the employee’s permission and on providing necessary proof of identity. Access to credit rating information is more common in banks and financial institutions.(e) Immigration status?Indian law does not specifically require an employer to check the immigration status of a foreigner. Indian law does not prevent the employer from checking whether a foreign employee holds the necessary visa to work in India. If a foreign individual on an employment visa wishes to change employment to another company, he or she must leave India and apply afresh for a visa. The only exception is where the foreigner is changing jobs between a registered holding company and its subsidiaries or vice versa, or between subsidiaries of a registered holding company. In such case the foreigner may not need to leave India, provided that he or she fulfils specific criteria, including obtaining prior government approval for the change in employment.(f) Social media?There is no bar against conducting background checks through social media.(g) Other?The most common background checks undertaken are of educational qualifications. The employee must consent to this and the employer (or an outsourced provider) will then write to the relevant institution requesting confirmation. The institution may charge a fee for providing this information. Most institutions have a procedure in place in this regard.Wages and working timePayIs there a national minimum wage and, if so, what is it?There is no national minimum wage. However, the central and state governments can issue notifications on minimum wages in specific industries. The federal government has set the recommended minimum wage to Rs176 per day and advised state governments to implement the same.Are there restrictions on working hours?By and large, working up to nine hours a day is permitted, with a weekly limit of 48 to 50 hours. There are laws that restrict women from working at night (between 8:00pm and 6:00am). Some states also have a maximum number of hours of overtime that can be worked.Hours and overtimeWhat are the requirements for meal and rest breaks?Most state laws provide for a break of 30 to 60 minutes after four to five hours of work. In practice, it is typical to provide a one-hour lunch break in an eight-hour day.How should overtime be calculated?Overtime is usually calculated at twice the rate of normal wages. State law defines what the term ‘wages’ covers; this typically includes basic wages plus normal allowances, but excludes any bonus component.What exemptions are there from overtime?There are no exemptions from paying overtime. However, the overtime provisions are seldom observed – generally, companies do not pay overtime when employees stay late to complete their work. It is recommended that employers pay overtime at least when employees are required by the nature of the assignment to work overtime – for example, call centre employees.Is there a minimum paid holiday entitlement?Yes. This varies from state to state, but is generally about 15 days. Most states prescribe up to 10 days of sick leave and some states prescribe another entitlement of up to 10 days of casual leave. In addition, most states prescribe about 10 days of public holidays; four to five of these are mandatory national and state holidays, while the remainder are chosen by the employer from a larger list provided by the state.What are the rules applicable to final pay and deductions from wages?Final pay must be made within two days of the date of termination where the employee’s services are terminated by the employer. In case of the employee’s resignation, the final pay-out can be made as part of the company’s normal payment cycle.Deductions are permitted from an employee’s wages, but only for specified reasons (eg, on account of fines, deductions for damage to or loss of goods expressly entrusted to the employee and recovery of loans or advances). Deductions are generally permitted only up to 50% of the employee’s wages.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, BangaloreAvailable Now6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar NOW!"

Your sisters who are willing to transfer their rights over their share in the suit property can execute a registered release deed and file a memo to record the same so that the court will record to confirm your share in the property shall include the released shares of your siblings while allocating your share in the property in the suit for partition.2. As far as the the additional property of 5 acres is concerned, since you have a legally valid registered title document on your name, you need not worry about it and file documentary evidences to establish your title, which the court will not bring it in the common property.  As far as the other property is concerned you may get a registered release deed from your willing siblings in your favor.  you can get their shares transferred even after judgment there is no impediment about it.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Inheriting father's self-acquired property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, your father had passed away without leaving a Will for his self-acquired property in Hyderabad, India. You are five siblings in total and each will inherit 1/5th of the share of Property. Your query is whether the property would be treated as Self-acquired or Ancestral Property. Firstly, Self-acquired property is a property which is acquired by an individual during his/her lifetime, from their own resources and not inherited from anyone else. On the other hand, Ancestral Property can be considered as a property that has been inherited from the previous generations, and is further passed on to the further generations. According to theHindu Succession Act, 1956, in the absence of will, the property would be distributed as per the rules laid down in the Act. But with respect to the nature of the property, since the property is your father's self-acquired property, through his own efforts, and as the property has been divided among the siblings, it would retain the nature of being self-acquired property.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Both of you are not staying together since April, 2024, and your families also did not have contact with each other. In August 2024, though you asked to meet and discuss on the issue, on August 25, 2024, subsequent such meeting, your wife and her family went ahead to file a NC (Non-Cognizable Offence) in Police Station, asking for mutual divorce. Though you gave your consent for the same, in October, they filed a complaint in the NCW Women Cell, for reconciling back with you, which you do not wish to do so. Firstly, under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, if both Parties agree together, you can file a petition for divorce. Secondly, with regard to NCW's role in this, it can mediate the cases involving complaints of domestic issues as well. Though they may push towards reconciliation, you can clearly express your dissent for the same. Furthermore, you can also file a petition in the court, for divorce from your wife, under grounds of Cruelty. In circumstances where your wife's father is threatening you and such threat escalates, you can file a case on grounds of criminal intimidation.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This shop had been sold and purchased for four times, and you are buying it with the present owner. The Owner has all the relevant documents and got the due diligence test done as well. However, the only concern you have is that, the original of the old document is not present with the present owner, but you had nevertheless received the true copy of that missing document from the Registrar's office for your reference. Herein, though its better to have all the original documents, a missing document does not invalidate the transaction of sale made, as you also obtained a true copy now. Furthermore, according to theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, the seller must have a clear title for the transfer of ownership. Since you have verified the other documents, it validates the transfer. However, there may be disputes that arise in future with regard to the continuity of the title. But, since you have the true copy, it serves as an evidence to the previous ownership. Hence, you may proceed with the purchase of the shop, but it is suggested that the implications of the missing document have been taken care of at first, so as to protect your interests in the future.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "As per Hindu Law, ancestral property is the property that has been passed by the family for atleast 4 generations without being divided.As you have stated, the property in question is the self-acquired property of your father then upon his death in case there is no will, the property will be suceeded by his first class legal heirs that will include widow, daughters and sons.So, as you have stated above you all are 5 brothers, so the property will be divided equally among you 5 and son and daughter of your brother will have no birth right over it.Vishek VatsAdvocate, Delhi90 AnswersTalk to Advocate Vishek Vats"

    "question": "Inheriting father's self-acquired property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, your father had passed away without leaving a Will for his self-acquired property in Hyderabad, India. You are five siblings in total and each will inherit 1/5th of the share of Property. Your query is whether the property would be treated as Self-acquired or Ancestral Property. Firstly, Self-acquired property is a property which is acquired by an individual during his/her lifetime, from their own resources and not inherited from anyone else. On the other hand, Ancestral Property can be considered as a property that has been inherited from the previous generations, and is further passed on to the further generations. According to theHindu Succession Act, 1956, in the absence of will, the property would be distributed as per the rules laid down in the Act. But with respect to the nature of the property, since the property is your father's self-acquired property, through his own efforts, and as the property has been divided among the siblings, it would retain the nature of being self-acquired property.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Each loan is treated independently, and the bank may update its policies or assess the risk differently based on a buyer's profile, regulatory changes, or internal procedures.If the bank denies your loan because you do not possess those specific documents you can1. Clarify the reason why the bank requested to have those documents, and try to solve this problem by discussing alternatives with the bank.2. Approach the bank grievance redressal system and narrate the inconsistency in the requirement of documents.3. File a suit in a civil court if the denial causes undue delay or results in pecuniary loss, but more than that, it is usually resorted to when all else fails.Nonetheless, it has to be remembered that there is no explicit guarantee of the approval of loan applications under the discretion of banks processing the same.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Since your mother has won the partition suit, since she has solely held the title, this property must be divided among the legal heirs. If your younger uncle is dodging the sale or accepting a low price, you can go ahead and sell it to the highest bidder, and make him duly serve the notice. Renting out the property without the concerned person's consent can be legally challenged.Considering the ₹30 lakh from your grandmother's account, being the nominee, your uncle is liable to distribute the amount received according to all the heirs. This failure on his part can even attract a civil claim for recovery and possible criminal case by breach of trust underSection 302of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) Act, 2023.

    "question": "Doubts related to 3 months notice period and relieving letter",
    "answer": "Resignation/ notice period depends from company to company. As per standing order/ service rule it is generally between 30-90 days and it has to be from both sides. There is no hard a fast rule under any law.A 30 to 90-day notice periodapplies in order to terminate 'workmen' (as defined in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947)There are two types ofnotice period: statutory and contractual. Statutorynoticeis theminimumlegalnoticethat can be given. Employers should give the employee:Is notice period (3 months) legal in India?It can be easily understood that the ambit and scope ofsection 23of the Indian contract act 1872, is vast and therefore the applicability of its provisions is subject to scrutiny by the court of the consideration and object of an agreement and the agreement itself.Therefore, in order to bring a case within the purview of section 23, it is necessary to show that the object of the agreement or consideration of the agreement or the agreement itself is unlawful.I'll keep it short and simple:Either party - employer or employee can terminate the contract by giving sufficient notice or compensating accordingly. In such a case, employer is bound to release the employee without any fuss, assuming that either of the above two conditions are met.So, if your organization doesn't allow you to buyout the notice period, please feel free to knock on the doors of the Indian judiciary.The following key issues should be highlighted:A 30 to 90-day notice period applies in order to terminate ‘workmen’ (as defined in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947) – that is, employees whose role is not primarily supervisory, administrative or managerial) for convenience, with 15 days’ pay due for every year worked. In the case of manufacturing units, plantations and mines with 100 or more workmen, termination for convenience requires prior government approval; in other sectors, it requires only government notification.Termination for cause does not include non-performance – it includes only behaviour which qualifies as misconduct.The ‘last in, first out’ principle requires that the employer first terminate for convenience the last people to join the organisation in the same role. However, this requirement can be contracted out of. When hiring for the same role, workmen who were terminated for convenience should be given the opportunity to re-join the company.State laws generally provide for about 15 days of earned/regular leave a year. Employees also benefit from up to 10 days of sick leave and a possible 10 additional days of ‘casual leave’. This is generally more than what most organisations would ideally like to provide.Most state laws provide for ‘casual leave’ – the employee can opt not to come to work that day without applying for leave in advance. Many organisations find this disruptive.Most state laws restrict women from working at night; if women are to work at night, specific approval must be obtained. This exemption is granted only to limited business sectors (eg, IT sector). Further, the employer must offer door-to-door transport and meet some security-related requirements.Most state laws prescribe overtime for any hours worked beyond 48 hours in a week. However, this is seldom observed.Indian law regulates and in some cases prohibits the use of contract workers. To engage contract workers, the contractor must hold a licence and the employer must be registered as a ‘principal employer’.Non-compete agreements are not enforceable under Indian law, while non-solicitation clauses can be enforced only in limited ways.While the ‘work for hire’ principle applies under the Indian copyright regime, it does not apply under the Indian patent regime; employees must thus provide formal assignments.Indian laws require employers to maintain a plethora of registers and notices. Compliance with such requirements is difficult and full compliance is rare.What do you consider unique to those doing business in your country?Some of the points mentioned above are unique to India. In addition, while Indian employment law is mainly federal in nature, most states have a Shops and Establishments Act. These statutes are similar, but not identical. Further, some states have been permitted to make amendments to central laws, with which are thus applicable in a different manner in such states.Is there any general advice you would give in the employment area?India is heavily regulated in the employment arena. Legal assistance should be obtained with regard to employment contracts and employment terms of service. Practical advice should be sought on best practices and common practices, so that policies are HR friendly and legally compliant. Advice should also be obtained on areas where compliance is difficult, so that employers can adopt positions that balance convenience against risk.Emerging issues/hot topics/proposals for reformAre there any noteworthy proposals for reform in your jurisdiction?As part of the objective to make it easier to do business in India, the government has proposed that the federal labour laws be revised and possibly amalgamated into two or three labour codes. If this is accomplished, the filing requirements will be streamlined. Amendments have also been proposed to some federal laws relating to factories and the use of apprentices. There has been no progress taking these initiatives forward and it appears unlikely that the government will do so.Key amendments to law in recent months include a substantial change to the Maternity Benefit Act 1961 through the Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act 2016. Key features of this amendment include:an increase in paid time off for eligible female employees from 12 weeks to 26 weeks in case a female employee has fewer than two children. If she has two or more children, she is entitled to 12 weeks’ leave;the introduction of the concepts of a 'commissioning mother' and an 'adopting mother', which widens the scope of the law. Such mothers are entitled to 12 weeks’ leave;the option to work from home once the paid maternity leave period has ended, based on an agreement with the employer; andrequiring an establishment with 50 or more employees to set up a crèche facility.Overall, the amendments are progressive in nature. From an employer’s perspective, there will be greater financial implications due to the increased maternity leave payment and also the benefits to be paid to the new categories of eligible female employees.In December 2016 the Employee’s State Insurance Act 1948 was amended, increasing the salary or wages threshold for coverage of an employee to Rs21,000 (approximately $309) per month from the previous wage cap of Rs15,000 (approximately $221) per month. The act applies to commercial establishments and provides for social security insurance for employees in case of sickness. The amendment has led to higher employee coverage under the law.What are the emerging trends in employment law in your jurisdiction?After decades of the government and courts adopting a somewhat socialist mind set, there has been a shift to a more pragmatic, business-friendly approach. The old approach, which focused on unskilled and daily wage workers, has given way to a focus on India’s growing service industry. There is heightened interest in rewriting the employment laws to make them more business friendly. India’s newest employment law on the prevention of sexual harassment is also leading to an increased number of sexual harassment complaints and additional processes to be followed.Another important aspect is the move towards e-governance in the labour law sector. A new web portal launched by the government provides users with a unique labour identification number, facilitating online registration, the filing of self-certified, simplified and single online returns for specific federal laws, and a transparent labour inspection scheme on risk-based criteria. Some concessions have also been provided for start ups in terms of employment law compliances.The employment relationshipCountry specific lawsWhat laws and regulations govern the employment relationship?Some states require that the employer prepare an appointment order for new hires, although this is seldom observed. There are no direct laws dealing with probation on a general basis in India, which is, however, a common practice. The (federal) Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act1946 (which is applicable to workmen), provides for a probationary period of up to three months. Certain states have built in the probation concept indirectly into their local laws, which ranges from three to six months. Ideally, a probation period should not exceed 240 days, as several statutory social welfare laws apply to employees who have worked for such period. The Industrial Disputes Act 1947 (applicable to workmen), prescribes that if certain terms of service change, notice must be given to the employee. It also prescribes requirements for termination for convenience, including notice and compensation.Who do these cover, including categories of worker?There are essentially two types of employer and two types of employee. Employers are either:‘establishments’ – a term which encompasses all employers; or‘factories’ – a term which typically encompasses manufacturing units. Mines are sometimes covered along with factories.Employees are either:‘employees’ – a term which covers all employees in any kind of role; or‘workmen’ (as defined in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947) – that is, employees whose primary role is not supervisory, managerial or administrative.In addition, certain state laws may exclude senior management employees from their scope of application.MisclassificationAre there specific rules regarding employee/contractor classification?Indian law regulates and in some cases prohibits the use of contract workers. To engage contract workers, the contractor must hold a licence and the employer must be registered as a ‘principal employer’.ContractsMust an employment contract be in writing?Except in states which require an appointment order, Indian law does not explicitly require that an employment contract be in writing, although this is the typical practice followed by most employers.Are any terms implied into employment contracts?Certain legal terms are implied in the employment contract. A duty of care, a right to privacy and a duty to maintain confidentiality are implied in the employment contract.Are mandatory arbitration/dispute resolution agreements enforceable?Yes.How can employers make changes to existing employment agreements?Under Indian contract law, a contract requires the consent of both parties. Thus, the employer cannot unilaterally make changes to the employment agreement. Typically, compensation terms are set out in an annex to the agreement, which should provide that these will be subject to change from time to time. Standard terms of employment – such as working hours, vacation, benefits, security procedures and disciplinary procedures – are normally set out in the employment terms of service, rather than in the employment contract. The employment contract should state that these terms of service apply to the employee and will be subject to change from time to time.An employer cannot change specified service conditions (eg, compensation, grade classification and customary concessions) for ‘workmen’ (as defined in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947) without providing 21 days’ prior statutory notice and notice to the labour authorities. This should be considered when implementing changes to an employment agreement.Foreign workersIs a distinction drawn between local and foreign workers?A significant difference between local and foreign employees is evident in the law on provident funds, which is a type of pension. The threshold to qualify, the manner of deduction and the benefits are different for foreign employee, and differ further depending on whether the country of origin has a social service agreement with India. There are no other substantive distinctions between local and foreign employees.RecruitmentAdvertisingWhat are the requirements relating to advertising positions?Under the Employment Exchange (Compulsory Notification of Vacancies) Act, 1959, if the state so requires, a private sector establishment with 25 or more employees must notify vacancies to specific employment exchanges. However, this is seldom observed.Background checksWhat can employers do with regard to background checks and inquiries in relation to the following:(a) Criminal records?While it is possible to conduct criminal background checks, this is extremely difficult in practice because criminal records are not digitised and are not consolidated nationwide. Accordingly, where a criminal background check must be carried out, this is typically done at the police station with jurisdiction over the employee’s current place of residence or anywhere that he or she has lived for a reasonable period.(b) Medical history?Employees’ medical histories cannot be accessed easily, since these are not digitised and there is no repository of medical records. Employee consent is required to disclose medical records to the employer. However, some employers require employees to undergo medical checks and have the diagnostic centre send the report directly to the employer. Subject to certain specific restrictions (eg, pre-employment testing for HIV is not permitted), there is no prohibition against this practice under Indian law.(c) Drug screening?Indian law does not prohibit drug screening.(d) Credit checks?An individual is entitled to obtain information on his or her credit rating. The employer can also access this information, with the employee’s permission and on providing necessary proof of identity. Access to credit rating information is more common in banks and financial institutions.(e) Immigration status?Indian law does not specifically require an employer to check the immigration status of a foreigner. Indian law does not prevent the employer from checking whether a foreign employee holds the necessary visa to work in India. If a foreign individual on an employment visa wishes to change employment to another company, he or she must leave India and apply afresh for a visa. The only exception is where the foreigner is changing jobs between a registered holding company and its subsidiaries or vice versa, or between subsidiaries of a registered holding company. In such case the foreigner may not need to leave India, provided that he or she fulfils specific criteria, including obtaining prior government approval for the change in employment.(f) Social media?There is no bar against conducting background checks through social media.(g) Other?The most common background checks undertaken are of educational qualifications. The employee must consent to this and the employer (or an outsourced provider) will then write to the relevant institution requesting confirmation. The institution may charge a fee for providing this information. Most institutions have a procedure in place in this regard.Wages and working timePayIs there a national minimum wage and, if so, what is it?There is no national minimum wage. However, the central and state governments can issue notifications on minimum wages in specific industries. The federal government has set the recommended minimum wage to Rs176 per day and advised state governments to implement the same.Are there restrictions on working hours?By and large, working up to nine hours a day is permitted, with a weekly limit of 48 to 50 hours. There are laws that restrict women from working at night (between 8:00pm and 6:00am). Some states also have a maximum number of hours of overtime that can be worked.Hours and overtimeWhat are the requirements for meal and rest breaks?Most state laws provide for a break of 30 to 60 minutes after four to five hours of work. In practice, it is typical to provide a one-hour lunch break in an eight-hour day.How should overtime be calculated?Overtime is usually calculated at twice the rate of normal wages. State law defines what the term ‘wages’ covers; this typically includes basic wages plus normal allowances, but excludes any bonus component.What exemptions are there from overtime?There are no exemptions from paying overtime. However, the overtime provisions are seldom observed – generally, companies do not pay overtime when employees stay late to complete their work. It is recommended that employers pay overtime at least when employees are required by the nature of the assignment to work overtime – for example, call centre employees.Is there a minimum paid holiday entitlement?Yes. This varies from state to state, but is generally about 15 days. Most states prescribe up to 10 days of sick leave and some states prescribe another entitlement of up to 10 days of casual leave. In addition, most states prescribe about 10 days of public holidays; four to five of these are mandatory national and state holidays, while the remainder are chosen by the employer from a larger list provided by the state.What are the rules applicable to final pay and deductions from wages?Final pay must be made within two days of the date of termination where the employee’s services are terminated by the employer. In case of the employee’s resignation, the final pay-out can be made as part of the company’s normal payment cycle.Deductions are permitted from an employee’s wages, but only for specified reasons (eg, on account of fines, deductions for damage to or loss of goods expressly entrusted to the employee and recovery of loans or advances). Deductions are generally permitted only up to 50% of the employee’s wages.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, BangaloreAvailable Now6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar NOW!"

    "answer": "1. Company cannot force an employee to serve the notice period. They cannot withhold the relieving letter even if you fail to serve the agreed notice period. You have every right to get your relieving letter.2. Ordinarily, the repercussion that employee faces in case he fails to serve the notice period is salary deduction of unserved notice period. The exact repercussion could be known after seeing your employment agreement/ appointment letter.3. The recourse is to send them legal demand notice for the same. If they still denies to give you the relieving letter. Prefer a labour complaint in the office of concerned labour commissioner as it is in contravention of section 27 of the Indian contract act which states that no agreement in restraint of trade or profession can be enforced in the court of law.Siddharth JainAdvocate, New Delhi6464 Answers102 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Siddharth Jain"

    "question": "Doubts related to 3 months notice period and relieving letter",
    "answer": "Resignation/ notice period depends from company to company. As per standing order/ service rule it is generally between 30-90 days and it has to be from both sides. There is no hard a fast rule under any law.A 30 to 90-day notice periodapplies in order to terminate 'workmen' (as defined in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947)There are two types ofnotice period: statutory and contractual. Statutorynoticeis theminimumlegalnoticethat can be given. Employers should give the employee:Is notice period (3 months) legal in India?It can be easily understood that the ambit and scope ofsection 23of the Indian contract act 1872, is vast and therefore the applicability of its provisions is subject to scrutiny by the court of the consideration and object of an agreement and the agreement itself.Therefore, in order to bring a case within the purview of section 23, it is necessary to show that the object of the agreement or consideration of the agreement or the agreement itself is unlawful.I'll keep it short and simple:Either party - employer or employee can terminate the contract by giving sufficient notice or compensating accordingly. In such a case, employer is bound to release the employee without any fuss, assuming that either of the above two conditions are met.So, if your organization doesn't allow you to buyout the notice period, please feel free to knock on the doors of the Indian judiciary.The following key issues should be highlighted:A 30 to 90-day notice period applies in order to terminate ‘workmen’ (as defined in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947) – that is, employees whose role is not primarily supervisory, administrative or managerial) for convenience, with 15 days’ pay due for every year worked. In the case of manufacturing units, plantations and mines with 100 or more workmen, termination for convenience requires prior government approval; in other sectors, it requires only government notification.Termination for cause does not include non-performance – it includes only behaviour which qualifies as misconduct.The ‘last in, first out’ principle requires that the employer first terminate for convenience the last people to join the organisation in the same role. However, this requirement can be contracted out of. When hiring for the same role, workmen who were terminated for convenience should be given the opportunity to re-join the company.State laws generally provide for about 15 days of earned/regular leave a year. Employees also benefit from up to 10 days of sick leave and a possible 10 additional days of ‘casual leave’. This is generally more than what most organisations would ideally like to provide.Most state laws provide for ‘casual leave’ – the employee can opt not to come to work that day without applying for leave in advance. Many organisations find this disruptive.Most state laws restrict women from working at night; if women are to work at night, specific approval must be obtained. This exemption is granted only to limited business sectors (eg, IT sector). Further, the employer must offer door-to-door transport and meet some security-related requirements.Most state laws prescribe overtime for any hours worked beyond 48 hours in a week. However, this is seldom observed.Indian law regulates and in some cases prohibits the use of contract workers. To engage contract workers, the contractor must hold a licence and the employer must be registered as a ‘principal employer’.Non-compete agreements are not enforceable under Indian law, while non-solicitation clauses can be enforced only in limited ways.While the ‘work for hire’ principle applies under the Indian copyright regime, it does not apply under the Indian patent regime; employees must thus provide formal assignments.Indian laws require employers to maintain a plethora of registers and notices. Compliance with such requirements is difficult and full compliance is rare.What do you consider unique to those doing business in your country?Some of the points mentioned above are unique to India. In addition, while Indian employment law is mainly federal in nature, most states have a Shops and Establishments Act. These statutes are similar, but not identical. Further, some states have been permitted to make amendments to central laws, with which are thus applicable in a different manner in such states.Is there any general advice you would give in the employment area?India is heavily regulated in the employment arena. Legal assistance should be obtained with regard to employment contracts and employment terms of service. Practical advice should be sought on best practices and common practices, so that policies are HR friendly and legally compliant. Advice should also be obtained on areas where compliance is difficult, so that employers can adopt positions that balance convenience against risk.Emerging issues/hot topics/proposals for reformAre there any noteworthy proposals for reform in your jurisdiction?As part of the objective to make it easier to do business in India, the government has proposed that the federal labour laws be revised and possibly amalgamated into two or three labour codes. If this is accomplished, the filing requirements will be streamlined. Amendments have also been proposed to some federal laws relating to factories and the use of apprentices. There has been no progress taking these initiatives forward and it appears unlikely that the government will do so.Key amendments to law in recent months include a substantial change to the Maternity Benefit Act 1961 through the Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act 2016. Key features of this amendment include:an increase in paid time off for eligible female employees from 12 weeks to 26 weeks in case a female employee has fewer than two children. If she has two or more children, she is entitled to 12 weeks’ leave;the introduction of the concepts of a 'commissioning mother' and an 'adopting mother', which widens the scope of the law. Such mothers are entitled to 12 weeks’ leave;the option to work from home once the paid maternity leave period has ended, based on an agreement with the employer; andrequiring an establishment with 50 or more employees to set up a crèche facility.Overall, the amendments are progressive in nature. From an employer’s perspective, there will be greater financial implications due to the increased maternity leave payment and also the benefits to be paid to the new categories of eligible female employees.In December 2016 the Employee’s State Insurance Act 1948 was amended, increasing the salary or wages threshold for coverage of an employee to Rs21,000 (approximately $309) per month from the previous wage cap of Rs15,000 (approximately $221) per month. The act applies to commercial establishments and provides for social security insurance for employees in case of sickness. The amendment has led to higher employee coverage under the law.What are the emerging trends in employment law in your jurisdiction?After decades of the government and courts adopting a somewhat socialist mind set, there has been a shift to a more pragmatic, business-friendly approach. The old approach, which focused on unskilled and daily wage workers, has given way to a focus on India’s growing service industry. There is heightened interest in rewriting the employment laws to make them more business friendly. India’s newest employment law on the prevention of sexual harassment is also leading to an increased number of sexual harassment complaints and additional processes to be followed.Another important aspect is the move towards e-governance in the labour law sector. A new web portal launched by the government provides users with a unique labour identification number, facilitating online registration, the filing of self-certified, simplified and single online returns for specific federal laws, and a transparent labour inspection scheme on risk-based criteria. Some concessions have also been provided for start ups in terms of employment law compliances.The employment relationshipCountry specific lawsWhat laws and regulations govern the employment relationship?Some states require that the employer prepare an appointment order for new hires, although this is seldom observed. There are no direct laws dealing with probation on a general basis in India, which is, however, a common practice. The (federal) Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act1946 (which is applicable to workmen), provides for a probationary period of up to three months. Certain states have built in the probation concept indirectly into their local laws, which ranges from three to six months. Ideally, a probation period should not exceed 240 days, as several statutory social welfare laws apply to employees who have worked for such period. The Industrial Disputes Act 1947 (applicable to workmen), prescribes that if certain terms of service change, notice must be given to the employee. It also prescribes requirements for termination for convenience, including notice and compensation.Who do these cover, including categories of worker?There are essentially two types of employer and two types of employee. Employers are either:‘establishments’ – a term which encompasses all employers; or‘factories’ – a term which typically encompasses manufacturing units. Mines are sometimes covered along with factories.Employees are either:‘employees’ – a term which covers all employees in any kind of role; or‘workmen’ (as defined in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947) – that is, employees whose primary role is not supervisory, managerial or administrative.In addition, certain state laws may exclude senior management employees from their scope of application.MisclassificationAre there specific rules regarding employee/contractor classification?Indian law regulates and in some cases prohibits the use of contract workers. To engage contract workers, the contractor must hold a licence and the employer must be registered as a ‘principal employer’.ContractsMust an employment contract be in writing?Except in states which require an appointment order, Indian law does not explicitly require that an employment contract be in writing, although this is the typical practice followed by most employers.Are any terms implied into employment contracts?Certain legal terms are implied in the employment contract. A duty of care, a right to privacy and a duty to maintain confidentiality are implied in the employment contract.Are mandatory arbitration/dispute resolution agreements enforceable?Yes.How can employers make changes to existing employment agreements?Under Indian contract law, a contract requires the consent of both parties. Thus, the employer cannot unilaterally make changes to the employment agreement. Typically, compensation terms are set out in an annex to the agreement, which should provide that these will be subject to change from time to time. Standard terms of employment – such as working hours, vacation, benefits, security procedures and disciplinary procedures – are normally set out in the employment terms of service, rather than in the employment contract. The employment contract should state that these terms of service apply to the employee and will be subject to change from time to time.An employer cannot change specified service conditions (eg, compensation, grade classification and customary concessions) for ‘workmen’ (as defined in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947) without providing 21 days’ prior statutory notice and notice to the labour authorities. This should be considered when implementing changes to an employment agreement.Foreign workersIs a distinction drawn between local and foreign workers?A significant difference between local and foreign employees is evident in the law on provident funds, which is a type of pension. The threshold to qualify, the manner of deduction and the benefits are different for foreign employee, and differ further depending on whether the country of origin has a social service agreement with India. There are no other substantive distinctions between local and foreign employees.RecruitmentAdvertisingWhat are the requirements relating to advertising positions?Under the Employment Exchange (Compulsory Notification of Vacancies) Act, 1959, if the state so requires, a private sector establishment with 25 or more employees must notify vacancies to specific employment exchanges. However, this is seldom observed.Background checksWhat can employers do with regard to background checks and inquiries in relation to the following:(a) Criminal records?While it is possible to conduct criminal background checks, this is extremely difficult in practice because criminal records are not digitised and are not consolidated nationwide. Accordingly, where a criminal background check must be carried out, this is typically done at the police station with jurisdiction over the employee’s current place of residence or anywhere that he or she has lived for a reasonable period.(b) Medical history?Employees’ medical histories cannot be accessed easily, since these are not digitised and there is no repository of medical records. Employee consent is required to disclose medical records to the employer. However, some employers require employees to undergo medical checks and have the diagnostic centre send the report directly to the employer. Subject to certain specific restrictions (eg, pre-employment testing for HIV is not permitted), there is no prohibition against this practice under Indian law.(c) Drug screening?Indian law does not prohibit drug screening.(d) Credit checks?An individual is entitled to obtain information on his or her credit rating. The employer can also access this information, with the employee’s permission and on providing necessary proof of identity. Access to credit rating information is more common in banks and financial institutions.(e) Immigration status?Indian law does not specifically require an employer to check the immigration status of a foreigner. Indian law does not prevent the employer from checking whether a foreign employee holds the necessary visa to work in India. If a foreign individual on an employment visa wishes to change employment to another company, he or she must leave India and apply afresh for a visa. The only exception is where the foreigner is changing jobs between a registered holding company and its subsidiaries or vice versa, or between subsidiaries of a registered holding company. In such case the foreigner may not need to leave India, provided that he or she fulfils specific criteria, including obtaining prior government approval for the change in employment.(f) Social media?There is no bar against conducting background checks through social media.(g) Other?The most common background checks undertaken are of educational qualifications. The employee must consent to this and the employer (or an outsourced provider) will then write to the relevant institution requesting confirmation. The institution may charge a fee for providing this information. Most institutions have a procedure in place in this regard.Wages and working timePayIs there a national minimum wage and, if so, what is it?There is no national minimum wage. However, the central and state governments can issue notifications on minimum wages in specific industries. The federal government has set the recommended minimum wage to Rs176 per day and advised state governments to implement the same.Are there restrictions on working hours?By and large, working up to nine hours a day is permitted, with a weekly limit of 48 to 50 hours. There are laws that restrict women from working at night (between 8:00pm and 6:00am). Some states also have a maximum number of hours of overtime that can be worked.Hours and overtimeWhat are the requirements for meal and rest breaks?Most state laws provide for a break of 30 to 60 minutes after four to five hours of work. In practice, it is typical to provide a one-hour lunch break in an eight-hour day.How should overtime be calculated?Overtime is usually calculated at twice the rate of normal wages. State law defines what the term ‘wages’ covers; this typically includes basic wages plus normal allowances, but excludes any bonus component.What exemptions are there from overtime?There are no exemptions from paying overtime. However, the overtime provisions are seldom observed – generally, companies do not pay overtime when employees stay late to complete their work. It is recommended that employers pay overtime at least when employees are required by the nature of the assignment to work overtime – for example, call centre employees.Is there a minimum paid holiday entitlement?Yes. This varies from state to state, but is generally about 15 days. Most states prescribe up to 10 days of sick leave and some states prescribe another entitlement of up to 10 days of casual leave. In addition, most states prescribe about 10 days of public holidays; four to five of these are mandatory national and state holidays, while the remainder are chosen by the employer from a larger list provided by the state.What are the rules applicable to final pay and deductions from wages?Final pay must be made within two days of the date of termination where the employee’s services are terminated by the employer. In case of the employee’s resignation, the final pay-out can be made as part of the company’s normal payment cycle.Deductions are permitted from an employee’s wages, but only for specified reasons (eg, on account of fines, deductions for damage to or loss of goods expressly entrusted to the employee and recovery of loans or advances). Deductions are generally permitted only up to 50% of the employee’s wages.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, BangaloreAvailable Now6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar NOW!"

    "question": "Nomination and succession in Housing society",
    "answer": "1. Your wife who is a co owner will be added as a joint member and not as an associate member2. You can make your wife a nominee as regards your 50% share in the flat3. After your demise your wife cannot become the 100% owner since your 50% share in the flat will go to your wife and your daughter (assuming they are your only heirs). Only in case of your daughter releasing her share (which she would have inherited from you) in favor of your wife, would she become the exclusive owner4. Please note that a nominee only holds the property in trust for the deceased member and does not automatically become the owner of the property upon demise of the owner/member5. You can very well make a Will in respect of your 50% share in the flat in favor of your wife but in all likelihood the society will require such a Will to be probated.6. There is also a possibility of your wife predeceasing you in which event you and your daughter will inherit your wife's 50% share.7. Your requirement of your daughter succeeding to the flat after you and your wife die, is practically not possible, unless both of you die together. So when one spouse dies before the other, the daughter will inherit from the share of the deceased spouse and thus she cannot be excluded until after the demise of both spouse,  unless both of them die together.Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Nomination and succession in Housing society",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Herein, you have jointly purchase a flat with your wife, naming her as the co-owner in the New Co-operative housing society in Mumbai. Now, you have to fill the membership form and the nominee form, wherein, you want your wife's name to be added as an associate member, who will jointly hold the shareholding of the society with you. Further, you also want to add her name as the nominee in the nomination form. With regard to your first query on whether an associate member can be nominated as a nominee of the original member in a cooperative housing society, yes, the same can be done. It can be duly filled in the nomination form. With respect to your second query, as to whether and how your daughter's name of age 17 years can be added as a successor or a nominee, in case of your and your wife's death, though you can nominate your daughter's name, but however, the rights on the same will transfer after she reaches the age of majority, i.e., 18 years of age. The Society, may also require a guardian's name to be appointed for the management of her interest in the property, until she reaches the age of majority. With respect to your third query, to nominate your wife as the sole owner after you, you can specify the same in the nomination form, as your wife being the primary nominee, and your daughter being the successor of the property, when both you and your wife are not present. For your fourth query, since you have prepared a will, it is suggested that your will outlines the transfer and the shares to be held by your wife and daughter being clearly stated as you wish. Further, it is better if your will is registered, as the same may add an advantage on your will being considered legally valid.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Herein, you have been working in a Government College, at a teaching position. A female teacher from the Psychology department had made a complaint of sexual harassment with no specifics to the Internal Committee, against four male and three female teachers, including you. This complaint was posted by the teacher on Facebook and WhatsApp and on enquiry by the Internal Committee, oral complaints were made by the teacher that were mostly in relation to the administrative grievances, not of sexual harassment, except one complaint against you wherein it has been alleged that she has heard from someone that there are certain objectionable photos and videos of her in your mobile. When this was further enquired, she confessed to the fact that she hasn't seen any of them by herself and will not reveal the identity of the person who told about the same. Further, no evidence was also presented and the Committee submitted a report with baseless allegations. Now, you want to safeguard yourself against her actions of defaming you, along with others. Here, firstly, it is very significant that the detailed records are maintained of all the communications between you and the Complainant, the internal committee meetings and the social media posts made by her. Further, if the social media posts made are defamatory in nature, you can file a complaint to cease the same, as the claims made are baseless.

    "question": "How to transfer property to co-owner after one joint owner in deceased",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, the Property was co-owned by your father and mother with a share of 50% each. However, after the death of your father, you have a query as to what is the procedure of transferring 100% of that Property in the name of your mother. With respect to this, firstly a legal heir certificate is necessary to be obtained that specifies the legal heirs of the deceased. For the same, your father's death certificate and identity proof of the legal heirs is necessary to be submitted. After obtaining the certificate, mutation of property may be done, so as to change the ownership and update the records of the land, in your mother's name. Besides this, considering theHindu Succession Act, 1956, the property of your father would generally devolve upon your mother as a legal heir, being the spouse of your father. Henceforth, in accordance to the laws of India, the land would typically transfer to your mother and other legal heirs, but the other legal heirs may present a no-objection certificate to transfer the complete share of the property.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Nomination and succession in Housing society",
    "answer": "1. Your wife who is a co owner will be added as a joint member and not as an associate member2. You can make your wife a nominee as regards your 50% share in the flat3. After your demise your wife cannot become the 100% owner since your 50% share in the flat will go to your wife and your daughter (assuming they are your only heirs). Only in case of your daughter releasing her share (which she would have inherited from you) in favor of your wife, would she become the exclusive owner4. Please note that a nominee only holds the property in trust for the deceased member and does not automatically become the owner of the property upon demise of the owner/member5. You can very well make a Will in respect of your 50% share in the flat in favor of your wife but in all likelihood the society will require such a Will to be probated.6. There is also a possibility of your wife predeceasing you in which event you and your daughter will inherit your wife's 50% share.7. Your requirement of your daughter succeeding to the flat after you and your wife die, is practically not possible, unless both of you die together. So when one spouse dies before the other, the daughter will inherit from the share of the deceased spouse and thus she cannot be excluded until after the demise of both spouse,  unless both of them die together.Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Herein, you have jointly purchase a flat with your wife, naming her as the co-owner in the New Co-operative housing society in Mumbai. Now, you have to fill the membership form and the nominee form, wherein, you want your wife's name to be added as an associate member, who will jointly hold the shareholding of the society with you. Further, you also want to add her name as the nominee in the nomination form. With regard to your first query on whether an associate member can be nominated as a nominee of the original member in a cooperative housing society, yes, the same can be done. It can be duly filled in the nomination form. With respect to your second query, as to whether and how your daughter's name of age 17 years can be added as a successor or a nominee, in case of your and your wife's death, though you can nominate your daughter's name, but however, the rights on the same will transfer after she reaches the age of majority, i.e., 18 years of age. The Society, may also require a guardian's name to be appointed for the management of her interest in the property, until she reaches the age of majority. With respect to your third query, to nominate your wife as the sole owner after you, you can specify the same in the nomination form, as your wife being the primary nominee, and your daughter being the successor of the property, when both you and your wife are not present. For your fourth query, since you have prepared a will, it is suggested that your will outlines the transfer and the shares to be held by your wife and daughter being clearly stated as you wish. Further, it is better if your will is registered, as the same may add an advantage on your will being considered legally valid.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "How to transfer property to co-owner after one joint owner in deceased",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, the Property was co-owned by your father and mother with a share of 50% each. However, after the death of your father, you have a query as to what is the procedure of transferring 100% of that Property in the name of your mother. With respect to this, firstly a legal heir certificate is necessary to be obtained that specifies the legal heirs of the deceased. For the same, your father's death certificate and identity proof of the legal heirs is necessary to be submitted. After obtaining the certificate, mutation of property may be done, so as to change the ownership and update the records of the land, in your mother's name. Besides this, considering theHindu Succession Act, 1956, the property of your father would generally devolve upon your mother as a legal heir, being the spouse of your father. Henceforth, in accordance to the laws of India, the land would typically transfer to your mother and other legal heirs, but the other legal heirs may present a no-objection certificate to transfer the complete share of the property.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, the son passed away prior to the mother, raising a question on what is the right of the mother on the gifted property. Taking into consideration the provisions of theTransfer of Property Act, and theHindu Succession Act, a gift can be understood as a voluntary transfer of property made from one person to another, without involving any consideration. In relevance to the present case, once the property is gifted, the son would have ownership on that property. However, unless specified in the gift deed, the Property does not revert back to the Mother, but the Property would pass on to the son's legal heirs, in accordance to the aforementioned legislations. This would be distributed between the legal heirs as mentioned under theHindu Succession Act, which includes the Class I heirs as the Mother, Wife and his Children (if any).Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The above two scenario occurs when a person dies intestate i.e. without leaving a will.4. Son has two options to ensure that the property gets passed to his wife and children:a: Execute a will: The wife and children will get the property after the death of the son.b: Execute gift deed or sale deed: The wife and children will get the property immediately on execution.5. Will does not need to be mandatorily registered. Notarisation would also suffice in case of Will. In case of gift deed or sale, deed, registration is mandatory with the concerned sub registrar having jurisdiction.Siddharth JainAdvocate, New Delhi6464 Answers102 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Siddharth Jain"

    "answer": "It's completely upto youThe agreement for sale draft has to be in conformity with the model form of agreement as given in ReraHowever the draft can be modified on case to case basis such that any such changes should not be inconsistent with the model format or with the Act and rules framed thereunderAlso some clauses in the draft would be completely contractual between the parties for which the model format would not applySo as a purchaser you have to check whether or not all the representations made by the builder to you are properly captured and recorded in the draft agreementSome builders are rigid and if any changes are made they refuse to accept them by saying that the agreement draft is a standard draft and no changes made by individual purchasers would be entertainedAs regards the fees for vetting the document, every lawyer has his or her own scale of fees.

    "question": "Nomination and succession in Housing society",
    "answer": "1. Your wife who is a co owner will be added as a joint member and not as an associate member2. You can make your wife a nominee as regards your 50% share in the flat3. After your demise your wife cannot become the 100% owner since your 50% share in the flat will go to your wife and your daughter (assuming they are your only heirs). Only in case of your daughter releasing her share (which she would have inherited from you) in favor of your wife, would she become the exclusive owner4. Please note that a nominee only holds the property in trust for the deceased member and does not automatically become the owner of the property upon demise of the owner/member5. You can very well make a Will in respect of your 50% share in the flat in favor of your wife but in all likelihood the society will require such a Will to be probated.6. There is also a possibility of your wife predeceasing you in which event you and your daughter will inherit your wife's 50% share.7. Your requirement of your daughter succeeding to the flat after you and your wife die, is practically not possible, unless both of you die together. So when one spouse dies before the other, the daughter will inherit from the share of the deceased spouse and thus she cannot be excluded until after the demise of both spouse,  unless both of them die together.Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Herein, you have jointly purchase a flat with your wife, naming her as the co-owner in the New Co-operative housing society in Mumbai. Now, you have to fill the membership form and the nominee form, wherein, you want your wife's name to be added as an associate member, who will jointly hold the shareholding of the society with you. Further, you also want to add her name as the nominee in the nomination form. With regard to your first query on whether an associate member can be nominated as a nominee of the original member in a cooperative housing society, yes, the same can be done. It can be duly filled in the nomination form. With respect to your second query, as to whether and how your daughter's name of age 17 years can be added as a successor or a nominee, in case of your and your wife's death, though you can nominate your daughter's name, but however, the rights on the same will transfer after she reaches the age of majority, i.e., 18 years of age. The Society, may also require a guardian's name to be appointed for the management of her interest in the property, until she reaches the age of majority. With respect to your third query, to nominate your wife as the sole owner after you, you can specify the same in the nomination form, as your wife being the primary nominee, and your daughter being the successor of the property, when both you and your wife are not present. For your fourth query, since you have prepared a will, it is suggested that your will outlines the transfer and the shares to be held by your wife and daughter being clearly stated as you wish. Further, it is better if your will is registered, as the same may add an advantage on your will being considered legally valid.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, the Property was co-owned by your father and mother with a share of 50% each. However, after the death of your father, you have a query as to what is the procedure of transferring 100% of that Property in the name of your mother. With respect to this, firstly a legal heir certificate is necessary to be obtained that specifies the legal heirs of the deceased. For the same, your father's death certificate and identity proof of the legal heirs is necessary to be submitted. After obtaining the certificate, mutation of property may be done, so as to change the ownership and update the records of the land, in your mother's name. Besides this, considering theHindu Succession Act, 1956, the property of your father would generally devolve upon your mother as a legal heir, being the spouse of your father. Henceforth, in accordance to the laws of India, the land would typically transfer to your mother and other legal heirs, but the other legal heirs may present a no-objection certificate to transfer the complete share of the property.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Regarding one-time settlement of loan with State Bank of India",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Considering the health and age-related condition and financial condition of your case, it would be a better option to approach the SBI bank for a one-time settlement. According to Indian banking law and RBI guidelines, when the account becomes an NPA on grounds of genuine reasons when the borrowing is not repaid, the bank may provide the option of OTS.However, since your account has not been classified yet as NPA, this might be the reason your plea for the settlement was rejected in the first place. First, you have to ask the bank to restructure the loan considering your health and financial conditions.You can reach the grievance redressal cell of the bank, and lodge a written complaint with the bank regarding how the interest rates on your account are being increased arbitrarily, how your health issues have aggravated, and how things are going financially in the current situation.Also, you must mention to them the amount that has already been paid, which is INR 42,45,445 and make them understand that it is not possible to continue the repayments. If the officials at the bank are persisting with harassment, then report this to the Banking Ombudsman, Reserve Bank of India.The Ombudsman takes complaints on issues related to banking services, including harassment by officers and failure to process your requests appropriately. Other than that, you can even go to court to inform the bank officials of mental harassment and even threats of a lawsuit without first considering good possible solutions.I hope this explanation resolves your doubts effectively. If you still have any further queries regarding this matter, do not hesitate to contact us again.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "- As per the RBI, the bank should give proper time and offers for the settlement of loan amount.,  on the ground of health and sudden loss- If, the bank is not agreed to give time, then don’t worry and let them to start legal action against you.- Firstly, the bank will issue demand notice prior to take legal action from the court. You can reply the same after narrating the whole story of medical expenditures and losses. .- Even, if the bank filed a case before the Court, you will have much time to repay the said loan amount and to settle the matter according his present situation.- If bank official/people are harassing, then you can file a complaint against them before the police and higher official as they cannot harass a defaulter to recover the loan amount.- Further, youcan file a complaint with the RBI against the bank for not responding your letter.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Nomination and succession in Housing society",
    "answer": "1. Your wife who is a co owner will be added as a joint member and not as an associate member2. You can make your wife a nominee as regards your 50% share in the flat3. After your demise your wife cannot become the 100% owner since your 50% share in the flat will go to your wife and your daughter (assuming they are your only heirs). Only in case of your daughter releasing her share (which she would have inherited from you) in favor of your wife, would she become the exclusive owner4. Please note that a nominee only holds the property in trust for the deceased member and does not automatically become the owner of the property upon demise of the owner/member5. You can very well make a Will in respect of your 50% share in the flat in favor of your wife but in all likelihood the society will require such a Will to be probated.6. There is also a possibility of your wife predeceasing you in which event you and your daughter will inherit your wife's 50% share.7. Your requirement of your daughter succeeding to the flat after you and your wife die, is practically not possible, unless both of you die together. So when one spouse dies before the other, the daughter will inherit from the share of the deceased spouse and thus she cannot be excluded until after the demise of both spouse,  unless both of them die together.Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Nomination and succession in Housing society",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Herein, you have jointly purchase a flat with your wife, naming her as the co-owner in the New Co-operative housing society in Mumbai. Now, you have to fill the membership form and the nominee form, wherein, you want your wife's name to be added as an associate member, who will jointly hold the shareholding of the society with you. Further, you also want to add her name as the nominee in the nomination form. With regard to your first query on whether an associate member can be nominated as a nominee of the original member in a cooperative housing society, yes, the same can be done. It can be duly filled in the nomination form. With respect to your second query, as to whether and how your daughter's name of age 17 years can be added as a successor or a nominee, in case of your and your wife's death, though you can nominate your daughter's name, but however, the rights on the same will transfer after she reaches the age of majority, i.e., 18 years of age. The Society, may also require a guardian's name to be appointed for the management of her interest in the property, until she reaches the age of majority. With respect to your third query, to nominate your wife as the sole owner after you, you can specify the same in the nomination form, as your wife being the primary nominee, and your daughter being the successor of the property, when both you and your wife are not present. For your fourth query, since you have prepared a will, it is suggested that your will outlines the transfer and the shares to be held by your wife and daughter being clearly stated as you wish. Further, it is better if your will is registered, as the same may add an advantage on your will being considered legally valid.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If the bank is insisting on repayment of the personal loan then they may not release the car even if you are ready to pay the arrears of EMI amount3. A loan write-off is when a lender recognises that a loan or debt has become uncollectible and removes it from their financial records as an asset.

The lender can continue to pursue debt recovery through legal action or debt collection agencies.4. A bank cannot use another account of a defaulter to recover a personal loan unless they follow a legal process. Lenders can only seize a borrower's assets if they have a court order and follow due process.5.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present Scenario, the Property was co-owned by your father and mother with a share of 50% each. However, after the death of your father, you have a query as to what is the procedure of transferring 100% of that Property in the name of your mother. With respect to this, firstly a legal heir certificate is necessary to be obtained that specifies the legal heirs of the deceased. For the same, your father's death certificate and identity proof of the legal heirs is necessary to be submitted. After obtaining the certificate, mutation of property may be done, so as to change the ownership and update the records of the land, in your mother's name. Besides this, considering theHindu Succession Act, 1956, the property of your father would generally devolve upon your mother as a legal heir, being the spouse of your father. Henceforth, in accordance to the laws of India, the land would typically transfer to your mother and other legal heirs, but the other legal heirs may present a no-objection certificate to transfer the complete share of the property.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This complaint was posted by the teacher on Facebook and WhatsApp and on enquiry by the Internal Committee, oral complaints were made by the teacher that were mostly in relation to the administrative grievances, not of sexual harassment, except one complaint against you wherein it has been alleged that she has heard from someone that there are certain objectionable photos and videos of her in your mobile. When this was further enquired, she confessed to the fact that she hasn't seen any of them by herself and will not reveal the identity of the person who told about the same. Further, no evidence was also presented and the Committee submitted a report with baseless allegations. Now, you want to safeguard yourself against her actions of defaming you, along with others. Here, firstly, it is very significant that the detailed records are maintained of all the communications between you and the Complainant, the internal committee meetings and the social media posts made by her. Further, if the social media posts made are defamatory in nature, you can file a complaint to cease the same, as the claims made are baseless. Hence, it can be claimed that the provisions given under the Protection Under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, are misused by her.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "A bank can seize a vehicle if the borrower defaults on loan repayment EMIs, but they must follow the proper procedure:Lenders typically initiate repossession after 60 to 90 days of missed payments.Lenders must comply with the SARFAESI Act and RBI guidelines.They must also provide reasonable notice to the borrower before selling the asset.Banks and finance companies cannot use recovery agents to forcefully seize vehicles. The Supreme Court has ruled that the recovery process must be in accordance with law and not by use of force.No doubtthe financer has a right to take over the possession of the vehiclebut the contract agreement does not give authority to the financier to take over the possession of the vehicle forcefully.RBI guidelines have emphasised that repossessions clause in the contract should be legally valid, should comply with the provisions of the Indian Contract Act in letter and spirit and banks should ensure that such repossession clause is clearly brought to the notice of the borrower at the time of execution of the contract.You can issue a legal notice to the bank and demand explanation for their unjustified action and also file a criminal complaint agaisnt the agents who seized the vehicle forcibly citing illegal act by the bank agentsT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "1. The bank may furnish NOC only if the entire outstanding loan including the accrued interest has been fully paid and the loan is fully discharged.2. If the bank is insisting on repayment of the personal loan then they may not release the car even if you are ready to pay the arrears of EMI amount3. A loan write-off is when a lender recognises that a loan or debt has become uncollectible and removes it from their financial records as an asset. In other words, the lender acknowledges that they are unlikely to recover the outstanding amount of the loan, and they decide to close the account. However, it doesn't mean the borrower is no longer liable for the debt. The lender can continue to pursue debt recovery through legal action or debt collection agencies.4. A bank cannot use another account of a defaulter to recover a personal loan unless they follow a legal process. Lenders can only seize a borrower's assets if they have a court order and follow due process.5.

These are relevant when giving a petition to have the ex-parte injunction set aside on the 1st of October in the year 2024 be kicked out because under the CPC under Order V, proper service must have been made. You should consider bringing an application for contempt against Judge P.

Although there are concerns that complaints against both judges should be made, it may be more beneficial to aim at the junior judge if you think he is pressured by the first judge.

    "question": "Girls family has filed section 85/115 clause 2 and 315 clause 2 BNS how do i get the bail as FIR as been filed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the present situation, you were married on December 7, 2023, and subsequently, your wife left to her home in Rajasthan on July 19, 2024, and kept travelling back and forth. Her father filed a case against you under the mentioned provisions of BNS, and asked for Rs. 50 Lakhs in the out of court settlement. Though you stated that you will not be able to pay the same, they sent police summons to sort the issue. They also told that they would file an FIR, for which you will have to be present after such filing. Therefore you want to get bail for the same as the cases have been filed, and you have an issue in travelling to Rajasthan as you are unemployed and your mother is not well in terms of health. Firstly, if you anticipate that an FIR would be filed against you, as the cases have already been filed, you may opt for applying for an anticipatory bail under Section 482 of BNSS to avoid such arrest. If you are arrested, you can even then apply for a regular bail under 480 of the BNSS, being a non-bailable offence. With respect to maintenance being claimed, it is important that you respond to the summons being sent, however, you can contest the claim by bringing forward your financial position of being unemployed. You may also file for transferring the case to your local jurisdiction, citing the relevant reasons under Section 448 of BNSS.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Legal Remedies for Challenging CCPD Orders and Retaliation in Workplace for 90% Blind PwD",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Sorry to hear about your condition.According to the RPwD Act, 2016, while filing an appeal against any order passed by the Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities (CCPD), the act does not consist of an appellate provision to appeal against the CCPD’s order. Thus, the conventional legal treatment would be to move to the higher court by filing a writ petition under Article 226 of theConstitution of Indiaand praying for judicial review of the CCPD’s decision. This approach is taken when Challenging quasi-judicial orders that do not provide a statutory right of appeal.A writ petition would enable you to appeal the decision on the different grounds such as illegality, irrationality, or procedural impropriety. The High Court has jurisdiction to consider whether or not the CCPD complied with the law and whether the procedural fairness was complied with or not. CCPD orders are of administrative nature, thus, in case of extreme need you can apply for a writ of certiorari or mandamus depending on the kind of relief you want.In regards to workplace discrimination and retaliation your rights are protected under the RPwD act especially section 20 that deals with nondiscrimination in employment, However,with 90% blindness, finding employment is still a vital challenge. If the CCPD has not provided sufficient relief, the High Court can be contacted for enforcing your rights and for handling the punitive transfer, perhaps for requesting a stay with regard to the transfer in addition to discrimination and retaliation.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present scenario, you got married to your wife in January 2024, however, due to certain compatibility issues, your wife left your home and went to her Parents house. Both of you are not staying together since April, 2024, and your families also did not have contact with each other. In August 2024, though you asked to meet and discuss on the issue, on August 25, 2024, subsequent such meeting, your wife and her family went ahead to file a NC (Non-Cognizable Offence) in Police Station, asking for mutual divorce. Though you gave your consent for the same, in October, they filed a complaint in the NCW Women Cell, for reconciling back with you, which you do not wish to do so. Firstly, under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, if both Parties agree together, you can file a petition for divorce. Secondly, with regard to NCW's role in this, it can mediate the cases involving complaints of domestic issues as well. Though they may push towards reconciliation, you can clearly express your dissent for the same. Furthermore, you can also file a petition in the court, for divorce from your wife, under grounds of Cruelty. In circumstances where your wife's father is threatening you and such threat escalates, you can file a case on grounds of criminal intimidation.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "A bank can seize a vehicle if the borrower defaults on loan repayment EMIs, but they must follow the proper procedure:Lenders typically initiate repossession after 60 to 90 days of missed payments.Lenders must comply with the SARFAESI Act and RBI guidelines.They must also provide reasonable notice to the borrower before selling the asset.Banks and finance companies cannot use recovery agents to forcefully seize vehicles. The Supreme Court has ruled that the recovery process must be in accordance with law and not by use of force.No doubtthe financer has a right to take over the possession of the vehiclebut the contract agreement does not give authority to the financier to take over the possession of the vehicle forcefully.RBI guidelines have emphasised that repossessions clause in the contract should be legally valid, should comply with the provisions of the Indian Contract Act in letter and spirit and banks should ensure that such repossession clause is clearly brought to the notice of the borrower at the time of execution of the contract.You can issue a legal notice to the bank and demand explanation for their unjustified action and also file a criminal complaint agaisnt the agents who seized the vehicle forcibly citing illegal act by the bank agentsT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Assistance required regarding loan and vehicle seizure issue",
    "answer": "1. The bank may furnish NOC only if the entire outstanding loan including the accrued interest has been fully paid and the loan is fully discharged.2. If the bank is insisting on repayment of the personal loan then they may not release the car even if you are ready to pay the arrears of EMI amount3. A loan write-off is when a lender recognises that a loan or debt has become uncollectible and removes it from their financial records as an asset. In other words, the lender acknowledges that they are unlikely to recover the outstanding amount of the loan, and they decide to close the account. However, it doesn't mean the borrower is no longer liable for the debt. The lender can continue to pursue debt recovery through legal action or debt collection agencies.4. A bank cannot use another account of a defaulter to recover a personal loan unless they follow a legal process. Lenders can only seize a borrower's assets if they have a court order and follow due process.5.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present case, your father had bought a land, solely on his name, and passed away, leaving behind three brothers and two sisters, out of which, you, the youngest, and your middle brother are unmarried, and your elder brother and two sisters are married. You have also invested around Rs. 15 Lakhs for building three shops and a floor, paid off your father's loans, covered major medical expenses of your mother and father, and additionally, your elder and middle brother have also borrowed Rs. 2 Lakhs, and 1 Lakh from you for business, covering a total of around Rs. 40 Lakhs. Presently, your elder brother and his wife are causing conflicts making it difficult for you to visit home, and are hindering marriage discussion, which you feel could be a way to get the whole property. Under theHindu Succession Act, 1956, after your father's death, all his legal heirs, including you would be entitled to a share in the Property, and it is not possible for your elder brother and his family disentitle you of the same. Furthermore, for the loans your brother has borrowed from you, the same may be documented for the purposes of recovering them in future or taking legal action for recovery. You can also seek for Mediation to resolve the disputes, as the same is with regard to family and property. Besides, in case such harassment continues, you may also file a civil suit for causing mental distress to you, or for harassment.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Girls family has filed section 85/115 clause 2 and 315 clause 2 BNS how do i get the bail as FIR as been filed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the present situation, you were married on December 7, 2023, and subsequently, your wife left to her home in Rajasthan on July 19, 2024, and kept travelling back and forth. Her father filed a case against you under the mentioned provisions of BNS, and asked for Rs. 50 Lakhs in the out of court settlement. Though you stated that you will not be able to pay the same, they sent police summons to sort the issue. They also told that they would file an FIR, for which you will have to be present after such filing. Therefore you want to get bail for the same as the cases have been filed, and you have an issue in travelling to Rajasthan as you are unemployed and your mother is not well in terms of health. Firstly, if you anticipate that an FIR would be filed against you, as the cases have already been filed, you may opt for applying for an anticipatory bail under Section 482 of BNSS to avoid such arrest. If you are arrested, you can even then apply for a regular bail under 480 of the BNSS, being a non-bailable offence. With respect to maintenance being claimed, it is important that you respond to the summons being sent, however, you can contest the claim by bringing forward your financial position of being unemployed. You may also file for transferring the case to your local jurisdiction, citing the relevant reasons under Section 448 of BNSS.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present scenario, you got married to your wife in January 2024, however, due to certain compatibility issues, your wife left your home and went to her Parents house. Both of you are not staying together since April, 2024, and your families also did not have contact with each other. In August 2024, though you asked to meet and discuss on the issue, on August 25, 2024, subsequent such meeting, your wife and her family went ahead to file a NC (Non-Cognizable Offence) in Police Station, asking for mutual divorce. Though you gave your consent for the same, in October, they filed a complaint in the NCW Women Cell, for reconciling back with you, which you do not wish to do so. Firstly, under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, if both Parties agree together, you can file a petition for divorce. Secondly, with regard to NCW's role in this, it can mediate the cases involving complaints of domestic issues as well. Though they may push towards reconciliation, you can clearly express your dissent for the same. Furthermore, you can also file a petition in the court, for divorce from your wife, under grounds of Cruelty. In circumstances where your wife's father is threatening you and such threat escalates, you can file a case on grounds of criminal intimidation.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Girls family has filed section 85/115 clause 2 and 315 clause 2 BNS how do i get the bail as FIR as been filed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the present situation, you were married on December 7, 2023, and subsequently, your wife left to her home in Rajasthan on July 19, 2024, and kept travelling back and forth. Her father filed a case against you under the mentioned provisions of BNS, and asked for Rs. 50 Lakhs in the out of court settlement. Though you stated that you will not be able to pay the same, they sent police summons to sort the issue. They also told that they would file an FIR, for which you will have to be present after such filing. Therefore you want to get bail for the same as the cases have been filed, and you have an issue in travelling to Rajasthan as you are unemployed and your mother is not well in terms of health. Firstly, if you anticipate that an FIR would be filed against you, as the cases have already been filed, you may opt for applying for an anticipatory bail under Section 482 of BNSS to avoid such arrest. If you are arrested, you can even then apply for a regular bail under 480 of the BNSS, being a non-bailable offence. With respect to maintenance being claimed, it is important that you respond to the summons being sent, however, you can contest the claim by bringing forward your financial position of being unemployed. You may also file for transferring the case to your local jurisdiction, citing the relevant reasons under Section 448 of BNSS.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Pre-emption right",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the present case, the father has transferred his Parts of land (A & B) in favour of his two sons. While one son sold his part of the land to a third party without informing about the same, to the other son, before 1 year 8 months, mutation, i.e., change in the ownership records has also been done already. Hence, you want to file a suit of pre-emption here. While there exists Land Reforms Act for each State, there exists the West Bengal Land Reforms Act, which may be applicable in the instant case, as the property was located in Kolkata, West Bengal. Under this Act, a suit may be filed by the other brother on grounds of being the co-sharer of property, and lack of notice of the sale for the same. Though you would have to inform on your interest to buy the property within 3 months of receiving the notice of transfer, and since you did not receive any such notice, a Suit for pre-emption filed may compel the buyer to sell the property to you, as you will have a priority over other buyers.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the Present scenario, you got married to your wife in January 2024, however, due to certain compatibility issues, your wife left your home and went to her Parents house. Both of you are not staying together since April, 2024, and your families also did not have contact with each other. In August 2024, though you asked to meet and discuss on the issue, on August 25, 2024, subsequent such meeting, your wife and her family went ahead to file a NC (Non-Cognizable Offence) in Police Station, asking for mutual divorce. Though you gave your consent for the same, in October, they filed a complaint in the NCW Women Cell, for reconciling back with you, which you do not wish to do so. Firstly, under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, if both Parties agree together, you can file a petition for divorce. Secondly, with regard to NCW's role in this, it can mediate the cases involving complaints of domestic issues as well. Though they may push towards reconciliation, you can clearly express your dissent for the same. Furthermore, you can also file a petition in the court, for divorce from your wife, under grounds of Cruelty. In circumstances where your wife's father is threatening you and such threat escalates, you can file a case on grounds of criminal intimidation.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Rented restaurant in Delhi. Property owner locked the gate and selling items.",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The actions of the property owner in locking the restaurant and selling its items are illegal even when cases of rent arrears are involved. Due process would be required for obtaining possession of the premises by issuing proper legal notice and eviction suit under the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958 or any agreement governing tenancy. Locking up the premises and the sale of the tenant's property without following a court order can only be referred to as unlawful eviction and isn't permitted either. For example, under BNS, such acts may come within the definition of offences like criminal trespass under Section 329, theft under Section 305, or criminal misappropriation under Section 314. Nothing can be removed from the tenant's property without a court decree, and no one has a right to dispose of your property. You should file a police complaint over the illegal lockout and selling of the items because both civil and criminal law consider these as criminal offences.In addition to this, you can get relief from a civil court, opening the premises by reopening, an injunction against the sale of restaurant items, and damages for losses caused by such illegal action.I hope this explanation meets your needs precisely.

    "question": "Gift deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the present scenario, the property in question is a self-acquired property, consisting of a house and an agricultural land that the mother had gifted to her son. However, the son passed away prior to the mother, raising a question on what is the right of the mother on the gifted property. Taking into consideration the provisions of theTransfer of Property Act, and theHindu Succession Act, a gift can be understood as a voluntary transfer of property made from one person to another, without involving any consideration. In relevance to the present case, once the property is gifted, the son would have ownership on that property. However, unless specified in the gift deed, the Property does not revert back to the Mother, but the Property would pass on to the son's legal heirs, in accordance to the aforementioned legislations. This would be distributed between the legal heirs as mentioned under theHindu Succession Act, which includes the Class I heirs as the Mother, Wife and his Children (if any).Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If he predeceases his mother, his legal heirs would get equal share in the property.2. Since mother is also one of the legal heir of son, share of such property would also be devolved in her favour in case the so dies. Son's other legal heirs like kids and wife will get a share too.3. The above two scenario occurs when a person dies intestate i.e. without leaving a will.4. Son has two options to ensure that the property gets passed to his wife and children:a: Execute a will: The wife and children will get the property after the death of the son.b: Execute gift deed or sale deed: The wife and children will get the property immediately on execution.5.

Both of you are not staying together since April, 2024, and your families also did not have contact with each other. In August 2024, though you asked to meet and discuss on the issue, on August 25, 2024, subsequent such meeting, your wife and her family went ahead to file a NC (Non-Cognizable Offence) in Police Station, asking for mutual divorce. Though you gave your consent for the same, in October, they filed a complaint in the NCW Women Cell, for reconciling back with you, which you do not wish to do so. Firstly, under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, if both Parties agree together, you can file a petition for divorce. Secondly, with regard to NCW's role in this, it can mediate the cases involving complaints of domestic issues as well. Though they may push towards reconciliation, you can clearly express your dissent for the same. Furthermore, you can also file a petition in the court, for divorce from your wife, under grounds of Cruelty.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case it is possible that you may have to pay maintenance during theDomestic Violence(DV) proceedings though your wife may be levelling baseless allegations. Your wife will be able to claim from your income of ₹ 90,000 or any reasonable amount minus the medical bills. While the DV case might be false, and may change maintenance obligations if proven so, it does not necessarily remove you from paying unless a court allows it to do so. As for making home dues, since your wife is capable of earning but decide not to work then this too can be taken to court to try and reduce her maintenance claim. Furthermore, an act can be an act of cruelty in terms of Section 13(1)(ia) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 where false allegations have been made. Once you prove that the allegations made by her are false you can file a defamation case undersection 354of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (previously, Section 499 IPC) or can lodge a complaint under section 246 of BNS (Previously, Section 211 of IPC) for filing a false case. For these legal issues, you should consult a family law attorney to assist you on the matter to avoid further complications.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Maintenance amount will be decided on your income alone. You will be required to file an affidavit declaring your assets and liabilities, the court will decide on that basis.5.

    "question": "Wife files a false 498a case as FIR, false DVC, MC for sake of maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queries1. In the case ofDomestic Violence, if your wife produces before the court photographs of bruises, then that may be taken into consideration, but she has to prove that such injuries have been given to her by you. Mere photographs cannot prove anything against a person, therefore, there is scope for argument against such evidence.2. In cases of maintenance, prima facie evidence may be permitted by the court even without any proper investigation, and an order for interim maintenance can be passed by the judge. You will have to pay maintenance even if you prove her allegations of default to be false, but the amount may be reduced or even disallowed by the court as per its estimation of her needs and your ability to pay.3. If you can show your wife is capable of earning -- by showing past work as a beautician or education -- the court may remit or refuse to award maintenance. The courts, in general, are reluctant to award maintenance if wife has deliberately avoided employment with the sole intention of claiming maintenance.4. Maintenance amount is usually computed on your income and not your parent's. If your monthly salary is ₹90,000 and you have heavy financial commitments like loan repayments or medical and legal charges, the court is likely to consider all these points while deciding an amount for you. The figure can range between 20-30% of your net income with deductions.5. If allegations prove untrue, one could prohibit future maintenance but could not recover past payments.6.a) A police can even file an FIR without investigation in false cases. b) Maintenance can also be granted in false cases. c) Husband protection laws are lesser but exist.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Wife files a false 498a case as FIR, false DVC, MC for sake of maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queries,1. Your child and second wife's case: Visiting your child will not add to complication in the 498A case filed against you by your second wife. This is because child visitation rights are separate, cannot be tagged with that kind of case.2. Right to visit your child: You have the right to visit your child at home or at school, other than that allowed by the conditions of a court order. Hostile behavior by the family of your first wife can be legally controlled through the enforcement of your visitation rights.3. Rights to visit your child: Regardless of whether you ever remarry, nothing impacts on the rights to visit your child from the previous marriage.4. False enrollment in land registration: In case there have been forged engravings in your wife's and father-in-law's land registration you may file a complaint against them. However, the legal significance to your case depends on how you word it legally.5. Income proof: Gather evidence that she earns her money by sending business advertisements and photographs or even client feedback. You can present these in court to prove that she is indeed capable of earning.6. Effect of acting in court: lllCourts do not rely on acting. If your wife cannot properly present her evidence, her exaggerated claims are likely to fall.

In this, a clarification is sought for with respect to the point that, if the panchayat is bifurcated after the 2011 census, population may have changed, and hence which number must be taken to determine the compliance with the road margin criteria. Legally, though there has been no clear bifurcation made on the same in the Notification, until the official census has been taken post 2011, the number of 2011 census has to be used for determining the compliance of road margin.

Associate, Joint or provisional Member.(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in section 22, the society may admitany personas an associate,jointor provisional Member.(2) Right to vote and contest the election shall be subject to the provisions of sub-sections (2), (3) and (4) of section 154B-11.154B-11. Voting rights of Member.(1) No Member of society shall have more than one vote in its affairs:Provided that, every right to vote shall be exercised personally:Provided further that, in the case of an equality of votes, the Chairman shall have a casting vote in the meeting of a society.(2) The Associate Member shall have right to vote with prior written consent of a Member.(3) The provisional Member shall have right to vote.(4) In case of joint Member the person whose name stands first in the share certificate, shall have right to vote. In his absence, the person whose name stands second, and in the absence of both, the person whose name stands next and likewise, who is present and who is not a minor, shall have right to vote.(5) In case of Association of society, authorised Member of member society shall have right to vote.(6) In case of company or firm or any other body corporate or local authority or any legal body constituted under any law for the time being in force, the authorised director or person or any one of the partners as appointed by the firm, shall have right to vote.Section 22 and section 23 sub-sections 1 to 3 have been made applicable to co-operative housing societies by virtue of s.154B(1)Section 22 - Person who may become member(1 ) Subject to the provisions of section 24,no person shall be admitted as a member of a society except the following, that is to say--(a) an individual, who is competent to contract under the Indian Contract Act, 1872;(b) a firm, company or any other body corporate constituted under any law for the time being in force, or a society registered under the societies Registration Act, 1860;(c) a society registered, or deemed to be registered, under this Act;1 [(d) the State Government or the Central Government;](e) a local authority;(f) as public trust registered under any law for the time being in force for the registration of such trusts;8[(g) the depositor or the financial service user] :-----------------(2 )Where a person is refused admission as a member of a society, the decision (with the reasons therefore) shall be communicated to that person within fifteen days of the date of the decision, or within three months 5 [from the date of receipt of the application for admission, whichever is earlier. If the society does not communicate any decision to the applicant within three months from the date of receipt of such application the applicant shall be deemed to have been [admitted] as a member of the society.]7 [If any question arises whether a person has become a deemed member or otherwise, the same shall be decided by the Registrar after giving a reasonable opportunity of being heard to all the concerned parties.]Section 23 - Open membership(1) No society shall, without sufficient cause, refuse admission to membership to any person duly qualified therefor under the provisions of this Act and its by-laws.(2) Any person aggrieved by the decision of a society, refusing him admission to its membership, may appeal to the Registrar 5[within a period of sixty days from the date of the decision of the society]. 3[Every such appeal, as far, as possible, be disposed of by the Registrar within a period of three months from the date of its receipt:Provided that, where such appeal is not so disposed of within the said period of three months, the Registrar shall record the reasons for the delay.](3) The decision of the Registrar in appeal, shall be final and the Registrar shall communicate his decision to the parties within fifteen days from the date thereof.Thus s.154B-1 clause (b) defines who is a Joint Member. It only says that the joint member has share right title and interest in the flat jointly. It nowhere says that the order of names has to be the same as in the instrument of transfer. Thus the only requirement is that the joint member should have a share right etc in the flat jointly with another.u/s 154B-4(1) the society can admit ANY person as the joint member. It does not state that only the person whose name stands second in the instrument of transfer [in your case the gift deed] can be admitted as a joint memberthe voting rights of joint members are also provided in s. 154B-11 (4)thus if the society has communicated its reasons against transfer of membership to the joint names in the order desired by you, then you will have to appeal to the registrar u/s 23(2)and if there is no communication by the society about its refusal to admit the joint members as stated in the application then they would be deemed to become the members of the society by virtue of s.22(2) after the expiry of the statutory period stated thereinYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "context": "Asked 8 months ago in Property Law Religion: Christian",
    "question": "Order of names on Coop Housing Share Certificate vs order of names on Gift Deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Under the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960 and relevant bye-laws, it is the Gift Deed alone that forms the primary document for ownership transfer in a cooperative society which records legal transfer of title. It can be deemed justifiable as the very suggestion by the society to issue the share certificate as mentioned in the Gift Deed is a reflection of the legal status of ownership. The order of the names in the Gift Deed is what reflects the intention of the transferor, and in updating their records, the law compels the society to oblige by the same.While the application form (Appendix 23) allows you to specify the priority of members for listing purposes, for all legal purposes, including ownership, the Gift Deed is paramount. Under the laws governing cooperative housing societies, both are coowners who hold their shares equally, regardless of which one is first and which second on the application form. If the society misreads the application and labels the second-named member as an \"Associate Member,\" they are, in fact, full members with equal rights.If you are still facing problems at any point in the future, remedy may be available through consulting the society registrar or Rule 56 of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Rules, dealing with voting rights, co-members' rights, and election procedures. Your option filled in your application form is also important for administrative reasons, though it will not supersede the legal order of ownership established under the Gift Deed.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Legal Separation",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In India, legal separation as a state of separation without divorce is provided under Section 10 of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, known as judicial separation, or under relevant personal laws of the respective religion of parties. Generally speaking, judicial separation separates spouses but does not declare the marriage legally terminated. You and your husband were separated for 12 years. This is an appropriate reason upon which a petition for judicial separation could be filed. Unlike in the case of divorce, judicial separation keeps the marriage status but permits the parties to the marriage to dwell away from each other. During the process, neither of the parties needs to reside in India in order to file for the proceeding. You can empower a lawyer in India with your Power of Attorney (POA) to represent you. Most courts in India are adopting the change towards online filings. That makes it all the easier for someone based overseas to pursue the process. Once filed, the case proceeds as usual in court and, after obtaining a proper understanding of all the facts, the court is capable of passing a decree of judicial separation.As for the timeline, that varies since it depends on other factors like workload in courts and case complexity, but normally, it takes some months to over a year to be completed.I hope this explanation simplifies the issue for you.

While one son sold his part of the land to a third party without informing about the same, to the other son, before 1 year 8 months, mutation, i.e., change in the ownership records has also been done already. Hence, you want to file a suit of pre-emption here. While there exists Land Reforms Act for each State, there exists the West Bengal Land Reforms Act, which may be applicable in the instant case, as the property was located in Kolkata, West Bengal. Under this Act, a suit may be filed by the other brother on grounds of being the co-sharer of property, and lack of notice of the sale for the same. Though you would have to inform on your interest to buy the property within 3 months of receiving the notice of transfer, and since you did not receive any such notice, a Suit for pre-emption filed may compel the buyer to sell the property to you, as you will have a priority over other buyers.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Rented restaurant in Delhi. Property owner locked the gate and selling items.",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The actions of the property owner in locking the restaurant and selling its items are illegal even when cases of rent arrears are involved. Due process would be required for obtaining possession of the premises by issuing proper legal notice and eviction suit under the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958 or any agreement governing tenancy. Locking up the premises and the sale of the tenant's property without following a court order can only be referred to as unlawful eviction and isn't permitted either. For example, under BNS, such acts may come within the definition of offences like criminal trespass under Section 329, theft under Section 305, or criminal misappropriation under Section 314. Nothing can be removed from the tenant's property without a court decree, and no one has a right to dispose of your property. You should file a police complaint over the illegal lockout and selling of the items because both civil and criminal law consider these as criminal offences.In addition to this, you can get relief from a civil court, opening the premises by reopening, an injunction against the sale of restaurant items, and damages for losses caused by such illegal action.I hope this explanation meets your needs precisely.

    "question": "Gift deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the present scenario, the property in question is a self-acquired property, consisting of a house and an agricultural land that the mother had gifted to her son. However, the son passed away prior to the mother, raising a question on what is the right of the mother on the gifted property. Taking into consideration the provisions of theTransfer of Property Act, and theHindu Succession Act, a gift can be understood as a voluntary transfer of property made from one person to another, without involving any consideration. In relevance to the present case, once the property is gifted, the son would have ownership on that property. However, unless specified in the gift deed, the Property does not revert back to the Mother, but the Property would pass on to the son's legal heirs, in accordance to the aforementioned legislations. This would be distributed between the legal heirs as mentioned under theHindu Succession Act, which includes the Class I heirs as the Mother, Wife and his Children (if any).Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "1. Once the property is gifted, the person to whom it is gifted becomes an absolute owner of the property. If he predeceases his mother, his legal heirs would get equal share in the property.2. Since mother is also one of the legal heir of son, share of such property would also be devolved in her favour in case the so dies. Son's other legal heirs like kids and wife will get a share too.3. The above two scenario occurs when a person dies intestate i.e. without leaving a will.4. Son has two options to ensure that the property gets passed to his wife and children:a: Execute a will: The wife and children will get the property after the death of the son.b: Execute gift deed or sale deed: The wife and children will get the property immediately on execution.5. Will does not need to be mandatorily registered. Notarisation would also suffice in case of Will.

While there exists Land Reforms Act for each State, there exists the West Bengal Land Reforms Act, which may be applicable in the instant case, as the property was located in Kolkata, West Bengal.

    "question": "Legal Separation",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In India, legal separation as a state of separation without divorce is provided under Section 10 of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, known as judicial separation, or under relevant personal laws of the respective religion of parties. Generally speaking, judicial separation separates spouses but does not declare the marriage legally terminated. You and your husband were separated for 12 years. This is an appropriate reason upon which a petition for judicial separation could be filed. Unlike in the case of divorce, judicial separation keeps the marriage status but permits the parties to the marriage to dwell away from each other. During the process, neither of the parties needs to reside in India in order to file for the proceeding. You can empower a lawyer in India with your Power of Attorney (POA) to represent you. Most courts in India are adopting the change towards online filings. That makes it all the easier for someone based overseas to pursue the process. Once filed, the case proceeds as usual in court and, after obtaining a proper understanding of all the facts, the court is capable of passing a decree of judicial separation.As for the timeline, that varies since it depends on other factors like workload in courts and case complexity, but normally, it takes some months to over a year to be completed.I hope this explanation simplifies the issue for you.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Herein, it has been mentioned that, if the local panchayat population, with respect to 2011 census, is less than 3000, then the building must be 220 meters from the State Highway. However, if the population is more than 3000, then compliance with the PWD Road Margin Guidelines would be sufficient. In this, a clarification is sought for with respect to the point that, if the panchayat is bifurcated after the 2011 census, population may have changed, and hence which number must be taken to determine the compliance with the road margin criteria. Legally, though there has been no clear bifurcation made on the same in the Notification, until the official census has been taken post 2011, the number of 2011 census has to be used for determining the compliance of road margin. However, an official clarification may be sought for the same, from the relevant government authorities, to ensure compliance with the regulations.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the present scenario, X is the buyer of the flat, Y is the seller of the flat, and the flat in question is from the Cooperative Group Housing Society (CGHS). Now, initially the Society had 3 unsold flats, and the Sale deed between X and Y did not mention the three flats, and subsequently an issue has arisen as to who is entitled to claim the benefits of the sale proceeds after the society has sold the flats. Legally, since X has purchased the specific flat through a sale deed, and the three flats were not part of the sale, X may not have a claim to make pertaining to the sale proceeds from those flats. However, if the same was previously mentioned in the Sale Deed, the same may be possible. Y, being the original owner, retains the rights to any benefits that have been derived from the unsold flats, until the same has been transferred through any legal written document to another person. This is in compliance with theTransfer of Property Act, 1882.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Inheritance of agricultural by NRI children from resident Himachal Pradesh parents",
    "answer": "Dear Client,As NRIs, on the death of your parents, their natural inheritance would pass on to you as legal heirs under the Hindu Succession Law. However, it is always advisable to formalize the process by having your parents execute a clear will for the transfer of the land to you, thereby avoiding any complexities in the future.Regarding the Himachali status, since the land is in Himachal, non-agriculturists or NRIs may not be allowed to purchase agricultural land in the state. You would require a Himachali Certificate, also known as a bonafide certificate, establishing your Himachal lineage through your parents. These certificates are issued by the concerned Tehsildar's office after documents establishing your family's origins being from Himachal. Your parents' certificates, voter ID, or ration card can work as proof.If to secure the land for the future generations is your desired purpose, then it is best when you are still with your parents to have already documented and registered it.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "context": "Asked 8 months ago in Property Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Partition of agricultural land",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case, this agricultural land appears to be undivided legally because no written agreement exists or a government record confirms that the land has been divided between your family and Ghanshyam's family earlier. According to Indian laws related to property and partition, not having any document with such registration for partition deeds also enhances your position to demand equal and just distribution of your share in the land.Since, no written or registered agreement documents the partition that occurred 50 years ago, the court will most likely treat the land as undivided. That would make it possible to partition the land now through the legal process. Courts generally seek a just division of jointly held property, and because access to the main road is critical to the value of the land, the partition likely will occur on an equal division principle.On the other hand, patwari's kurre also suggests equal shares on the main road.Your case is stronger due to the fact that there is no proof or official document of the government that exists for their claim of initial division.A formal agreement or official record mostly happens in partition-related cases and the absence of such written evidence weakens their case. This is further supported by your argument against their selling the land, as well as Patwari's suggestion to partition in your favor.Cases involving partition might take 2-5 years or even more depending on the complexity of the case and how crowded the judicial schedule is. Therefore, you will want to create all records and proof related to the case as it can go as far as no written agreement before making a case for fair partition; there may also be an injunction that does not allow the sale or transfer of the land until the court finalizes the partition.I hope this explanation meets your needs precisely.

Secondly, the payment of the token advance signifies the buyer's intention to proceed with the purchase. Thirdly, though there has been an initial acknowledgment made, the same cannot be taken as a agreement under the Contract Act, unless it fulfils all the essential elements of the same, including the addition of forfeiture clause, consequences of non-execution of the agreement, and so on. However, it can be taken as a binding document on both parties, as the same has been entered into with their mutual consent. Furthermore, the mention on the 90-days clause, may be that, if the buyer does not pay the agreed-upon amount or execute within the given timeline, the agreement may be considered unfulfilled, thus giving the right to you, to forfeit the token advance, being a common legal practice in case of a default, and find for new prospective buyers after notifying the same to the present buyer on the cancellation due to non-fulfilment of the agreement entered into.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Even though the client of your husband is a US-based company without any Indian connection, remote work would still be viewed as a violation of the conditions of the X visa while staying in India.Employment of any nature is strictly barred under an X visa, or whether the employer is Indian or foreign.He would need to apply for a visa of employment to work in India. Usually, an employment visa is issued for employment purposes from an employer in India; however, in certain instances, it can also be acquired to render services to foreign clients, in particular if the person involved is an independent contractor.That is a gray area in the visa regulations of India; however, seeking conversion of his X visa to an employment visa would best be the legal recourse in order to be valid.Regarding taxes, he would be classified as a tax resident if he stays for a considerable duration. He would thus be subject to taxes in the country on incomes accrued from outside its border, but that would depend on his status as a tax resident and the treaties applicable between India and the US.I hope this explanation assists you in resolving your concerns.

    "question": "Claim over assets of a CGHS of a buyer of a resold flat",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the present scenario, X is the buyer of the flat, Y is the seller of the flat, and the flat in question is from the Cooperative Group Housing Society (CGHS). Now, initially the Society had 3 unsold flats, and the Sale deed between X and Y did not mention the three flats, and subsequently an issue has arisen as to who is entitled to claim the benefits of the sale proceeds after the society has sold the flats. Legally, since X has purchased the specific flat through a sale deed, and the three flats were not part of the sale, X may not have a claim to make pertaining to the sale proceeds from those flats. However, if the same was previously mentioned in the Sale Deed, the same may be possible. Y, being the original owner, retains the rights to any benefits that have been derived from the unsold flats, until the same has been transferred through any legal written document to another person. This is in compliance with theTransfer of Property Act, 1882.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Partition of agricultural land",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case, this agricultural land appears to be undivided legally because no written agreement exists or a government record confirms that the land has been divided between your family and Ghanshyam's family earlier. According to Indian laws related to property and partition, not having any document with such registration for partition deeds also enhances your position to demand equal and just distribution of your share in the land.Since, no written or registered agreement documents the partition that occurred 50 years ago, the court will most likely treat the land as undivided. That would make it possible to partition the land now through the legal process. Courts generally seek a just division of jointly held property, and because access to the main road is critical to the value of the land, the partition likely will occur on an equal division principle.On the other hand, patwari's kurre also suggests equal shares on the main road.Your case is stronger due to the fact that there is no proof or official document of the government that exists for their claim of initial division.A formal agreement or official record mostly happens in partition-related cases and the absence of such written evidence weakens their case. This is further supported by your argument against their selling the land, as well as Patwari's suggestion to partition in your favor.Cases involving partition might take 2-5 years or even more depending on the complexity of the case and how crowded the judicial schedule is. Therefore, you will want to create all records and proof related to the case as it can go as far as no written agreement before making a case for fair partition; there may also be an injunction that does not allow the sale or transfer of the land until the court finalizes the partition.I hope this explanation meets your needs precisely.

Secondly, the payment of the token advance signifies the buyer's intention to proceed with the purchase. Thirdly, though there has been an initial acknowledgment made, the same cannot be taken as a agreement under the Contract Act, unless it fulfils all the essential elements of the same, including the addition of forfeiture clause, consequences of non-execution of the agreement, and so on. However, it can be taken as a binding document on both parties, as the same has been entered into with their mutual consent. Furthermore, the mention on the 90-days clause, may be that, if the buyer does not pay the agreed-upon amount or execute within the given timeline, the agreement may be considered unfulfilled, thus giving the right to you, to forfeit the token advance, being a common legal practice in case of a default, and find for new prospective buyers after notifying the same to the present buyer on the cancellation due to non-fulfilment of the agreement entered into.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Considering the health and age-related condition and financial condition of your case, it would be a better option to approach the SBI bank for a one-time settlement. According to Indian banking law and RBI guidelines, when the account becomes an NPA on grounds of genuine reasons when the borrowing is not repaid, the bank may provide the option of OTS.However, since your account has not been classified yet as NPA, this might be the reason your plea for the settlement was rejected in the first place. First, you have to ask the bank to restructure the loan considering your health and financial conditions.You can reach the grievance redressal cell of the bank, and lodge a written complaint with the bank regarding how the interest rates on your account are being increased arbitrarily, how your health issues have aggravated, and how things are going financially in the current situation.Also, you must mention to them the amount that has already been paid, which is INR 42,45,445 and make them understand that it is not possible to continue the repayments. If the officials at the bank are persisting with harassment, then report this to the Banking Ombudsman, Reserve Bank of India.The Ombudsman takes complaints on issues related to banking services, including harassment by officers and failure to process your requests appropriately. Other than that, you can even go to court to inform the bank officials of mental harassment and even threats of a lawsuit without first considering good possible solutions.I hope this explanation resolves your doubts effectively.

A case already pending under the provisions of the concerned court requires notice to the said court regarding the renewal of a passport and obtaining permission therefrom. Even though you have a stay order on the FIR and are allowed to travel abroad, this exempts you not to getting permission for passport renewal.File an application in the court where your case is pending seeking permission to renew your passport with reasons and an explanation of the circumstances. Such permission by courts generally remains valid unless there is a strong reason to reject the permission. Meanwhile, you should state that you have an already pending case and anticipatory bail for applying to renew your passport so as not to face legal complications later. This procedure, if not followed, might result in refusal of renewals or some legal repercussions.Therefore, it is preferable to take permission from the court to comply with legal procedure requirements.I hope this response is beneficial for your situation.

Now, initially the Society had 3 unsold flats, and the Sale deed between X and Y did not mention the three flats, and subsequently an issue has arisen as to who is entitled to claim the benefits of the sale proceeds after the society has sold the flats. Legally, since X has purchased the specific flat through a sale deed, and the three flats were not part of the sale, X may not have a claim to make pertaining to the sale proceeds from those flats. However, if the same was previously mentioned in the Sale Deed, the same may be possible. Y, being the original owner, retains the rights to any benefits that have been derived from the unsold flats, until the same has been transferred through any legal written document to another person.

    "question": "Partition of agricultural land",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case, this agricultural land appears to be undivided legally because no written agreement exists or a government record confirms that the land has been divided between your family and Ghanshyam's family earlier. According to Indian laws related to property and partition, not having any document with such registration for partition deeds also enhances your position to demand equal and just distribution of your share in the land.Since, no written or registered agreement documents the partition that occurred 50 years ago, the court will most likely treat the land as undivided. That would make it possible to partition the land now through the legal process. Courts generally seek a just division of jointly held property, and because access to the main road is critical to the value of the land, the partition likely will occur on an equal division principle.On the other hand, patwari's kurre also suggests equal shares on the main road.Your case is stronger due to the fact that there is no proof or official document of the government that exists for their claim of initial division.A formal agreement or official record mostly happens in partition-related cases and the absence of such written evidence weakens their case. This is further supported by your argument against their selling the land, as well as Patwari's suggestion to partition in your favor.Cases involving partition might take 2-5 years or even more depending on the complexity of the case and how crowded the judicial schedule is. Therefore, you will want to create all records and proof related to the case as it can go as far as no written agreement before making a case for fair partition; there may also be an injunction that does not allow the sale or transfer of the land until the court finalizes the partition.I hope this explanation meets your needs precisely.

    "answer": "You have given a receipt for the amount received from the purchaser and have actually not entered into a sale agreement.Besides this is an unregistered document having no legal validity.Since  you admitted that there is no forfeiture clause added to this acknowledgement, you cannot forfeit the advance amount if the purchaser do not run up on the stipulated date for executing a registered sale deed in his favor after reeving the sale consideration amount .However you are at your liberty to cancel the deal if the buyer is not honoring the commitment on or before the stipulated time period but remember that you may have to return the token money to him otherwise he may sue you for either recovery of that amount or may even file a suit for specific performance of contract claiming execution of sale deed. .T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

Associate, Joint or provisional Member.(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in section 22, the society may admitany personas an associate,jointor provisional Member.(2) Right to vote and contest the election shall be subject to the provisions of sub-sections (2), (3) and (4) of section 154B-11.154B-11. Voting rights of Member.(1) No Member of society shall have more than one vote in its affairs:Provided that, every right to vote shall be exercised personally:Provided further that, in the case of an equality of votes, the Chairman shall have a casting vote in the meeting of a society.(2) The Associate Member shall have right to vote with prior written consent of a Member.(3) The provisional Member shall have right to vote.(4) In case of joint Member the person whose name stands first in the share certificate, shall have right to vote. In his absence, the person whose name stands second, and in the absence of both, the person whose name stands next and likewise, who is present and who is not a minor, shall have right to vote.(5) In case of Association of society, authorised Member of member society shall have right to vote.(6) In case of company or firm or any other body corporate or local authority or any legal body constituted under any law for the time being in force, the authorised director or person or any one of the partners as appointed by the firm, shall have right to vote.Section 22 and section 23 sub-sections 1 to 3 have been made applicable to co-operative housing societies by virtue of s.154B(1)Section 22 - Person who may become member(1 ) Subject to the provisions of section 24,no person shall be admitted as a member of a society except the following, that is to say--(a) an individual, who is competent to contract under the Indian Contract Act, 1872;(b) a firm, company or any other body corporate constituted under any law for the time being in force, or a society registered under the societies Registration Act, 1860;(c) a society registered, or deemed to be registered, under this Act;1 [(d) the State Government or the Central Government;](e) a local authority;(f) as public trust registered under any law for the time being in force for the registration of such trusts;8[(g) the depositor or the financial service user] :-----------------(2 )Where a person is refused admission as a member of a society, the decision (with the reasons therefore) shall be communicated to that person within fifteen days of the date of the decision, or within three months 5 [from the date of receipt of the application for admission, whichever is earlier. If the society does not communicate any decision to the applicant within three months from the date of receipt of such application the applicant shall be deemed to have been [admitted] as a member of the society.]7 [If any question arises whether a person has become a deemed member or otherwise, the same shall be decided by the Registrar after giving a reasonable opportunity of being heard to all the concerned parties.]Section 23 - Open membership(1) No society shall, without sufficient cause, refuse admission to membership to any person duly qualified therefor under the provisions of this Act and its by-laws.(2) Any person aggrieved by the decision of a society, refusing him admission to its membership, may appeal to the Registrar 5[within a period of sixty days from the date of the decision of the society]. 3[Every such appeal, as far, as possible, be disposed of by the Registrar within a period of three months from the date of its receipt:Provided that, where such appeal is not so disposed of within the said period of three months, the Registrar shall record the reasons for the delay.](3) The decision of the Registrar in appeal, shall be final and the Registrar shall communicate his decision to the parties within fifteen days from the date thereof.Thus s.154B-1 clause (b) defines who is a Joint Member. It only says that the joint member has share right title and interest in the flat jointly. It nowhere says that the order of names has to be the same as in the instrument of transfer. Thus the only requirement is that the joint member should have a share right etc in the flat jointly with another.u/s 154B-4(1) the society can admit ANY person as the joint member. It does not state that only the person whose name stands second in the instrument of transfer [in your case the gift deed] can be admitted as a joint memberthe voting rights of joint members are also provided in s. 154B-11 (4)thus if the society has communicated its reasons against transfer of membership to the joint names in the order desired by you, then you will have to appeal to the registrar u/s 23(2)and if there is no communication by the society about its refusal to admit the joint members as stated in the application then they would be deemed to become the members of the society by virtue of s.22(2) after the expiry of the statutory period stated thereinYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Order of names on Coop Housing Share Certificate vs order of names on Gift Deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Under the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960 and relevant bye-laws, it is the Gift Deed alone that forms the primary document for ownership transfer in a cooperative society which records legal transfer of title. It can be deemed justifiable as the very suggestion by the society to issue the share certificate as mentioned in the Gift Deed is a reflection of the legal status of ownership. The order of the names in the Gift Deed is what reflects the intention of the transferor, and in updating their records, the law compels the society to oblige by the same.While the application form (Appendix 23) allows you to specify the priority of members for listing purposes, for all legal purposes, including ownership, the Gift Deed is paramount. Under the laws governing cooperative housing societies, both are coowners who hold their shares equally, regardless of which one is first and which second on the application form. If the society misreads the application and labels the second-named member as an \"Associate Member,\" they are, in fact, full members with equal rights.If you are still facing problems at any point in the future, remedy may be available through consulting the society registrar or Rule 56 of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Rules, dealing with voting rights, co-members' rights, and election procedures. Your option filled in your application form is also important for administrative reasons, though it will not supersede the legal order of ownership established under the Gift Deed.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Parking slots in a redeveloped building",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case, where the redevelopment has left you with fewer slots for parking, the choice of who gets those slots should really be governed by the terms of the redevelopment agreement or as under the rules put in place by the housing society, as per the Maharashtra Ownership Flats Act, 1963 and the Maharashtra Apartment Ownership Act, 1970. Here, the developer has allotted parking slots to new members; however, the remaining slots have to be shared fairly among the original owners.Since you do not own a car currently but wish to have a parking slot for future sale purposes, you can seek out the society and request it to allot you a parking slot. The society has all the rights when first established to allot the parking slots fairly and in a clear manner, normally either through a lottery system or even an equal distribution. You can ask for the society to use some criteria, such as considering your ownership of a 3-bedroom flat and applying it in order to allocate a parking slot appropriately, or whatever other equitable method may apply.If such a fair solution is not provided then, you can raise a dispute with the Cooperative Court or under relevant provisions of MOFA so that proper demand allocation will be made. However, any allocations have to be in accordance with the society's decision, and the allocations have to be according to the rules and regulations fixed by the managing committee of the society.Thank you.

    "question": "Legal Remedies for Challenging CCPD Orders and Retaliation in Workplace for 90% Blind PwD",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Sorry to hear about your condition.According to the RPwD Act, 2016, while filing an appeal against any order passed by the Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities (CCPD), the act does not consist of an appellate provision to appeal against the CCPD’s order. Thus, the conventional legal treatment would be to move to the higher court by filing a writ petition under Article 226 of theConstitution of Indiaand praying for judicial review of the CCPD’s decision. This approach is taken when Challenging quasi-judicial orders that do not provide a statutory right of appeal.A writ petition would enable you to appeal the decision on the different grounds such as illegality, irrationality, or procedural impropriety. The High Court has jurisdiction to consider whether or not the CCPD complied with the law and whether the procedural fairness was complied with or not. CCPD orders are of administrative nature, thus, in case of extreme need you can apply for a writ of certiorari or mandamus depending on the kind of relief you want.In regards to workplace discrimination and retaliation your rights are protected under the RPwD act especially section 20 that deals with nondiscrimination in employment, However,with 90% blindness, finding employment is still a vital challenge. If the CCPD has not provided sufficient relief, the High Court can be contacted for enforcing your rights and for handling the punitive transfer, perhaps for requesting a stay with regard to the transfer in addition to discrimination and retaliation.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Considering the health and age-related condition and financial condition of your case, it would be a better option to approach the SBI bank for a one-time settlement. According to Indian banking law and RBI guidelines, when the account becomes an NPA on grounds of genuine reasons when the borrowing is not repaid, the bank may provide the option of OTS.However, since your account has not been classified yet as NPA, this might be the reason your plea for the settlement was rejected in the first place. First, you have to ask the bank to restructure the loan considering your health and financial conditions.You can reach the grievance redressal cell of the bank, and lodge a written complaint with the bank regarding how the interest rates on your account are being increased arbitrarily, how your health issues have aggravated, and how things are going financially in the current situation.Also, you must mention to them the amount that has already been paid, which is INR 42,45,445 and make them understand that it is not possible to continue the repayments. If the officials at the bank are persisting with harassment, then report this to the Banking Ombudsman, Reserve Bank of India.The Ombudsman takes complaints on issues related to banking services, including harassment by officers and failure to process your requests appropriately. Other than that, you can even go to court to inform the bank officials of mental harassment and even threats of a lawsuit without first considering good possible solutions.I hope this explanation resolves your doubts effectively.

    "question": "Inheritance of agricultural by NRI children from resident Himachal Pradesh parents",
    "answer": "Dear Client,As NRIs, on the death of your parents, their natural inheritance would pass on to you as legal heirs under the Hindu Succession Law. However, it is always advisable to formalize the process by having your parents execute a clear will for the transfer of the land to you, thereby avoiding any complexities in the future.Regarding the Himachali status, since the land is in Himachal, non-agriculturists or NRIs may not be allowed to purchase agricultural land in the state. You would require a Himachali Certificate, also known as a bonafide certificate, establishing your Himachal lineage through your parents. These certificates are issued by the concerned Tehsildar's office after documents establishing your family's origins being from Himachal. Your parents' certificates, voter ID, or ration card can work as proof.If to secure the land for the future generations is your desired purpose, then it is best when you are still with your parents to have already documented and registered it.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "context": "Asked 8 months ago in Property Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Partition of agricultural land",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case, this agricultural land appears to be undivided legally because no written agreement exists or a government record confirms that the land has been divided between your family and Ghanshyam's family earlier. According to Indian laws related to property and partition, not having any document with such registration for partition deeds also enhances your position to demand equal and just distribution of your share in the land.Since, no written or registered agreement documents the partition that occurred 50 years ago, the court will most likely treat the land as undivided. That would make it possible to partition the land now through the legal process. Courts generally seek a just division of jointly held property, and because access to the main road is critical to the value of the land, the partition likely will occur on an equal division principle.On the other hand, patwari's kurre also suggests equal shares on the main road.Your case is stronger due to the fact that there is no proof or official document of the government that exists for their claim of initial division.A formal agreement or official record mostly happens in partition-related cases and the absence of such written evidence weakens their case. This is further supported by your argument against their selling the land, as well as Patwari's suggestion to partition in your favor.Cases involving partition might take 2-5 years or even more depending on the complexity of the case and how crowded the judicial schedule is. Therefore, you will want to create all records and proof related to the case as it can go as far as no written agreement before making a case for fair partition; there may also be an injunction that does not allow the sale or transfer of the land until the court finalizes the partition.I hope this explanation meets your needs precisely.

Associate, Joint or provisional Member.(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in section 22, the society may admitany personas an associate,jointor provisional Member.(2) Right to vote and contest the election shall be subject to the provisions of sub-sections (2), (3) and (4) of section 154B-11.154B-11. Voting rights of Member.(1) No Member of society shall have more than one vote in its affairs:Provided that, every right to vote shall be exercised personally:Provided further that, in the case of an equality of votes, the Chairman shall have a casting vote in the meeting of a society.(2) The Associate Member shall have right to vote with prior written consent of a Member.(3) The provisional Member shall have right to vote.(4) In case of joint Member the person whose name stands first in the share certificate, shall have right to vote. In his absence, the person whose name stands second, and in the absence of both, the person whose name stands next and likewise, who is present and who is not a minor, shall have right to vote.(5) In case of Association of society, authorised Member of member society shall have right to vote.(6) In case of company or firm or any other body corporate or local authority or any legal body constituted under any law for the time being in force, the authorised director or person or any one of the partners as appointed by the firm, shall have right to vote.Section 22 and section 23 sub-sections 1 to 3 have been made applicable to co-operative housing societies by virtue of s.154B(1)Section 22 - Person who may become member(1 ) Subject to the provisions of section 24,no person shall be admitted as a member of a society except the following, that is to say--(a) an individual, who is competent to contract under the Indian Contract Act, 1872;(b) a firm, company or any other body corporate constituted under any law for the time being in force, or a society registered under the societies Registration Act, 1860;(c) a society registered, or deemed to be registered, under this Act;1 [(d) the State Government or the Central Government;](e) a local authority;(f) as public trust registered under any law for the time being in force for the registration of such trusts;8[(g) the depositor or the financial service user] :-----------------(2 )Where a person is refused admission as a member of a society, the decision (with the reasons therefore) shall be communicated to that person within fifteen days of the date of the decision, or within three months 5 [from the date of receipt of the application for admission, whichever is earlier. If the society does not communicate any decision to the applicant within three months from the date of receipt of such application the applicant shall be deemed to have been [admitted] as a member of the society.]7 [If any question arises whether a person has become a deemed member or otherwise, the same shall be decided by the Registrar after giving a reasonable opportunity of being heard to all the concerned parties.]Section 23 - Open membership(1) No society shall, without sufficient cause, refuse admission to membership to any person duly qualified therefor under the provisions of this Act and its by-laws.(2) Any person aggrieved by the decision of a society, refusing him admission to its membership, may appeal to the Registrar 5[within a period of sixty days from the date of the decision of the society]. 3[Every such appeal, as far, as possible, be disposed of by the Registrar within a period of three months from the date of its receipt:Provided that, where such appeal is not so disposed of within the said period of three months, the Registrar shall record the reasons for the delay.](3) The decision of the Registrar in appeal, shall be final and the Registrar shall communicate his decision to the parties within fifteen days from the date thereof.Thus s.154B-1 clause (b) defines who is a Joint Member. It only says that the joint member has share right title and interest in the flat jointly. It nowhere says that the order of names has to be the same as in the instrument of transfer. Thus the only requirement is that the joint member should have a share right etc in the flat jointly with another.u/s 154B-4(1) the society can admit ANY person as the joint member. It does not state that only the person whose name stands second in the instrument of transfer [in your case the gift deed] can be admitted as a joint memberthe voting rights of joint members are also provided in s. 154B-11 (4)thus if the society has communicated its reasons against transfer of membership to the joint names in the order desired by you, then you will have to appeal to the registrar u/s 23(2)and if there is no communication by the society about its refusal to admit the joint members as stated in the application then they would be deemed to become the members of the society by virtue of s.22(2) after the expiry of the statutory period stated thereinYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Order of names on Coop Housing Share Certificate vs order of names on Gift Deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Under the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960 and relevant bye-laws, it is the Gift Deed alone that forms the primary document for ownership transfer in a cooperative society which records legal transfer of title. It can be deemed justifiable as the very suggestion by the society to issue the share certificate as mentioned in the Gift Deed is a reflection of the legal status of ownership. The order of the names in the Gift Deed is what reflects the intention of the transferor, and in updating their records, the law compels the society to oblige by the same.While the application form (Appendix 23) allows you to specify the priority of members for listing purposes, for all legal purposes, including ownership, the Gift Deed is paramount. Under the laws governing cooperative housing societies, both are coowners who hold their shares equally, regardless of which one is first and which second on the application form. If the society misreads the application and labels the second-named member as an \"Associate Member,\" they are, in fact, full members with equal rights.If you are still facing problems at any point in the future, remedy may be available through consulting the society registrar or Rule 56 of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Rules, dealing with voting rights, co-members' rights, and election procedures. Your option filled in your application form is also important for administrative reasons, though it will not supersede the legal order of ownership established under the Gift Deed.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Regarding one-time settlement of loan with State Bank of India",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Considering the health and age-related condition and financial condition of your case, it would be a better option to approach the SBI bank for a one-time settlement. According to Indian banking law and RBI guidelines, when the account becomes an NPA on grounds of genuine reasons when the borrowing is not repaid, the bank may provide the option of OTS.However, since your account has not been classified yet as NPA, this might be the reason your plea for the settlement was rejected in the first place. First, you have to ask the bank to restructure the loan considering your health and financial conditions.You can reach the grievance redressal cell of the bank, and lodge a written complaint with the bank regarding how the interest rates on your account are being increased arbitrarily, how your health issues have aggravated, and how things are going financially in the current situation.Also, you must mention to them the amount that has already been paid, which is INR 42,45,445 and make them understand that it is not possible to continue the repayments. If the officials at the bank are persisting with harassment, then report this to the Banking Ombudsman, Reserve Bank of India.The Ombudsman takes complaints on issues related to banking services, including harassment by officers and failure to process your requests appropriately. Other than that, you can even go to court to inform the bank officials of mental harassment and even threats of a lawsuit without first considering good possible solutions.I hope this explanation resolves your doubts effectively.

    "context": "Asked 8 months ago in Property Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Partition of agricultural land",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case, this agricultural land appears to be undivided legally because no written agreement exists or a government record confirms that the land has been divided between your family and Ghanshyam's family earlier. According to Indian laws related to property and partition, not having any document with such registration for partition deeds also enhances your position to demand equal and just distribution of your share in the land.Since, no written or registered agreement documents the partition that occurred 50 years ago, the court will most likely treat the land as undivided. That would make it possible to partition the land now through the legal process. Courts generally seek a just division of jointly held property, and because access to the main road is critical to the value of the land, the partition likely will occur on an equal division principle.On the other hand, patwari's kurre also suggests equal shares on the main road.Your case is stronger due to the fact that there is no proof or official document of the government that exists for their claim of initial division.A formal agreement or official record mostly happens in partition-related cases and the absence of such written evidence weakens their case. This is further supported by your argument against their selling the land, as well as Patwari's suggestion to partition in your favor.Cases involving partition might take 2-5 years or even more depending on the complexity of the case and how crowded the judicial schedule is. Therefore, you will want to create all records and proof related to the case as it can go as far as no written agreement before making a case for fair partition; there may also be an injunction that does not allow the sale or transfer of the land until the court finalizes the partition.I hope this explanation meets your needs precisely.

    "answer": "few definitions and provisions under the Maharashtra Co-operative societies act, 1960, need to be considered in order to answer your query:Chapter 13B [XIIIB] pertaining to co-operative housing societies is relevant.Section 154B-1 - Definitions:In this Chapter, unless the context otherwise requires,--(18) \"Member\" means a person joining in an application for the registration of a housing society which is subsequently registered, or a person duly admitted to Membership of a society after its registration and includes associate or joint or provisional Member;(a) \"Associate Member\" means husband, wife, father, mother, brother, sister, son, daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, nephew, niece a person duly admitted to Membership of a housing society on written recommendation of a Member to exercise his rights and duties with his written prior consent and whose name does not stand in the share certificate;(b) \"Joint Member\" means a person joining in an application for the registration of a housing society jointly, which is subsequently registered or a person who is duly admitted to Membership after its registration and who holds share, right, title and interest in the flat jointly but whose name does not stand first in the share certificate;(c) \"provisional Member\" means a person who is duly admitted as a Member of a society temporarily after death of a Member on the basis of nomination till the admission of legal heir or heirs as the Member of the society in place of deceased Member;[154B-4. Associate, Joint or provisional Member.(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in section 22, the society may admitany personas an associate,jointor provisional Member.(2) Right to vote and contest the election shall be subject to the provisions of sub-sections (2), (3) and (4) of section 154B-11.154B-11. Voting rights of Member.(1) No Member of society shall have more than one vote in its affairs:Provided that, every right to vote shall be exercised personally:Provided further that, in the case of an equality of votes, the Chairman shall have a casting vote in the meeting of a society.(2) The Associate Member shall have right to vote with prior written consent of a Member.(3) The provisional Member shall have right to vote.(4) In case of joint Member the person whose name stands first in the share certificate, shall have right to vote. In his absence, the person whose name stands second, and in the absence of both, the person whose name stands next and likewise, who is present and who is not a minor, shall have right to vote.(5) In case of Association of society, authorised Member of member society shall have right to vote.(6) In case of company or firm or any other body corporate or local authority or any legal body constituted under any law for the time being in force, the authorised director or person or any one of the partners as appointed by the firm, shall have right to vote.Section 22 and section 23 sub-sections 1 to 3 have been made applicable to co-operative housing societies by virtue of s.154B(1)Section 22 - Person who may become member(1 ) Subject to the provisions of section 24,no person shall be admitted as a member of a society except the following, that is to say--(a) an individual, who is competent to contract under the Indian Contract Act, 1872;(b) a firm, company or any other body corporate constituted under any law for the time being in force, or a society registered under the societies Registration Act, 1860;(c) a society registered, or deemed to be registered, under this Act;1 [(d) the State Government or the Central Government;](e) a local authority;(f) as public trust registered under any law for the time being in force for the registration of such trusts;8[(g) the depositor or the financial service user] :-----------------(2 )Where a person is refused admission as a member of a society, the decision (with the reasons therefore) shall be communicated to that person within fifteen days of the date of the decision, or within three months 5 [from the date of receipt of the application for admission, whichever is earlier. If the society does not communicate any decision to the applicant within three months from the date of receipt of such application the applicant shall be deemed to have been [admitted] as a member of the society.]7 [If any question arises whether a person has become a deemed member or otherwise, the same shall be decided by the Registrar after giving a reasonable opportunity of being heard to all the concerned parties.]Section 23 - Open membership(1) No society shall, without sufficient cause, refuse admission to membership to any person duly qualified therefor under the provisions of this Act and its by-laws.(2) Any person aggrieved by the decision of a society, refusing him admission to its membership, may appeal to the Registrar 5[within a period of sixty days from the date of the decision of the society]. 3[Every such appeal, as far, as possible, be disposed of by the Registrar within a period of three months from the date of its receipt:Provided that, where such appeal is not so disposed of within the said period of three months, the Registrar shall record the reasons for the delay.](3) The decision of the Registrar in appeal, shall be final and the Registrar shall communicate his decision to the parties within fifteen days from the date thereof.Thus s.154B-1 clause (b) defines who is a Joint Member. It only says that the joint member has share right title and interest in the flat jointly. It nowhere says that the order of names has to be the same as in the instrument of transfer. Thus the only requirement is that the joint member should have a share right etc in the flat jointly with another.u/s 154B-4(1) the society can admit ANY person as the joint member. It does not state that only the person whose name stands second in the instrument of transfer [in your case the gift deed] can be admitted as a joint memberthe voting rights of joint members are also provided in s. 154B-11 (4)thus if the society has communicated its reasons against transfer of membership to the joint names in the order desired by you, then you will have to appeal to the registrar u/s 23(2)and if there is no communication by the society about its refusal to admit the joint members as stated in the application then they would be deemed to become the members of the society by virtue of s.22(2) after the expiry of the statutory period stated thereinYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Order of names on Coop Housing Share Certificate vs order of names on Gift Deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Under the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960 and relevant bye-laws, it is the Gift Deed alone that forms the primary document for ownership transfer in a cooperative society which records legal transfer of title. It can be deemed justifiable as the very suggestion by the society to issue the share certificate as mentioned in the Gift Deed is a reflection of the legal status of ownership. The order of the names in the Gift Deed is what reflects the intention of the transferor, and in updating their records, the law compels the society to oblige by the same.While the application form (Appendix 23) allows you to specify the priority of members for listing purposes, for all legal purposes, including ownership, the Gift Deed is paramount. Under the laws governing cooperative housing societies, both are coowners who hold their shares equally, regardless of which one is first and which second on the application form. If the society misreads the application and labels the second-named member as an \"Associate Member,\" they are, in fact, full members with equal rights.If you are still facing problems at any point in the future, remedy may be available through consulting the society registrar or Rule 56 of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Rules, dealing with voting rights, co-members' rights, and election procedures. Your option filled in your application form is also important for administrative reasons, though it will not supersede the legal order of ownership established under the Gift Deed.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Foreign nationals will be eligible for an X visa, provided they are dependents of Indian citizens and there will be no work-study-business in India. Even though the client of your husband is a US-based company without any Indian connection, remote work would still be viewed as a violation of the conditions of the X visa while staying in India.Employment of any nature is strictly barred under an X visa, or whether the employer is Indian or foreign.He would need to apply for a visa of employment to work in India. Usually, an employment visa is issued for employment purposes from an employer in India; however, in certain instances, it can also be acquired to render services to foreign clients, in particular if the person involved is an independent contractor.That is a gray area in the visa regulations of India; however, seeking conversion of his X visa to an employment visa would best be the legal recourse in order to be valid.Regarding taxes, he would be classified as a tax resident if he stays for a considerable duration. He would thus be subject to taxes in the country on incomes accrued from outside its border, but that would depend on his status as a tax resident and the treaties applicable between India and the US.I hope this explanation assists you in resolving your concerns.

Associate, Joint or provisional Member.(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in section 22, the society may admitany personas an associate,jointor provisional Member.(2) Right to vote and contest the election shall be subject to the provisions of sub-sections (2), (3) and (4) of section 154B-11.154B-11. Voting rights of Member.(1) No Member of society shall have more than one vote in its affairs:Provided that, every right to vote shall be exercised personally:Provided further that, in the case of an equality of votes, the Chairman shall have a casting vote in the meeting of a society.(2) The Associate Member shall have right to vote with prior written consent of a Member.(3) The provisional Member shall have right to vote.(4) In case of joint Member the person whose name stands first in the share certificate, shall have right to vote. In his absence, the person whose name stands second, and in the absence of both, the person whose name stands next and likewise, who is present and who is not a minor, shall have right to vote.(5) In case of Association of society, authorised Member of member society shall have right to vote.(6) In case of company or firm or any other body corporate or local authority or any legal body constituted under any law for the time being in force, the authorised director or person or any one of the partners as appointed by the firm, shall have right to vote.Section 22 and section 23 sub-sections 1 to 3 have been made applicable to co-operative housing societies by virtue of s.154B(1)Section 22 - Person who may become member(1 ) Subject to the provisions of section 24,no person shall be admitted as a member of a society except the following, that is to say--(a) an individual, who is competent to contract under the Indian Contract Act, 1872;(b) a firm, company or any other body corporate constituted under any law for the time being in force, or a society registered under the societies Registration Act, 1860;(c) a society registered, or deemed to be registered, under this Act;1 [(d) the State Government or the Central Government;](e) a local authority;(f) as public trust registered under any law for the time being in force for the registration of such trusts;8[(g) the depositor or the financial service user] :-----------------(2 )Where a person is refused admission as a member of a society, the decision (with the reasons therefore) shall be communicated to that person within fifteen days of the date of the decision, or within three months 5 [from the date of receipt of the application for admission, whichever is earlier. If the society does not communicate any decision to the applicant within three months from the date of receipt of such application the applicant shall be deemed to have been [admitted] as a member of the society.]7 [If any question arises whether a person has become a deemed member or otherwise, the same shall be decided by the Registrar after giving a reasonable opportunity of being heard to all the concerned parties.]Section 23 - Open membership(1) No society shall, without sufficient cause, refuse admission to membership to any person duly qualified therefor under the provisions of this Act and its by-laws.(2) Any person aggrieved by the decision of a society, refusing him admission to its membership, may appeal to the Registrar 5[within a period of sixty days from the date of the decision of the society]. 3[Every such appeal, as far, as possible, be disposed of by the Registrar within a period of three months from the date of its receipt:Provided that, where such appeal is not so disposed of within the said period of three months, the Registrar shall record the reasons for the delay.](3) The decision of the Registrar in appeal, shall be final and the Registrar shall communicate his decision to the parties within fifteen days from the date thereof.Thus s.154B-1 clause (b) defines who is a Joint Member. It only says that the joint member has share right title and interest in the flat jointly. It nowhere says that the order of names has to be the same as in the instrument of transfer. Thus the only requirement is that the joint member should have a share right etc in the flat jointly with another.u/s 154B-4(1) the society can admit ANY person as the joint member. It does not state that only the person whose name stands second in the instrument of transfer [in your case the gift deed] can be admitted as a joint memberthe voting rights of joint members are also provided in s. 154B-11 (4)thus if the society has communicated its reasons against transfer of membership to the joint names in the order desired by you, then you will have to appeal to the registrar u/s 23(2)and if there is no communication by the society about its refusal to admit the joint members as stated in the application then they would be deemed to become the members of the society by virtue of s.22(2) after the expiry of the statutory period stated thereinYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Order of names on Coop Housing Share Certificate vs order of names on Gift Deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Under the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960 and relevant bye-laws, it is the Gift Deed alone that forms the primary document for ownership transfer in a cooperative society which records legal transfer of title. It can be deemed justifiable as the very suggestion by the society to issue the share certificate as mentioned in the Gift Deed is a reflection of the legal status of ownership. The order of the names in the Gift Deed is what reflects the intention of the transferor, and in updating their records, the law compels the society to oblige by the same.While the application form (Appendix 23) allows you to specify the priority of members for listing purposes, for all legal purposes, including ownership, the Gift Deed is paramount. Under the laws governing cooperative housing societies, both are coowners who hold their shares equally, regardless of which one is first and which second on the application form. If the society misreads the application and labels the second-named member as an \"Associate Member,\" they are, in fact, full members with equal rights.If you are still facing problems at any point in the future, remedy may be available through consulting the society registrar or Rule 56 of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Rules, dealing with voting rights, co-members' rights, and election procedures. Your option filled in your application form is also important for administrative reasons, though it will not supersede the legal order of ownership established under the Gift Deed.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Associate, Joint or provisional Member.(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in section 22, the society may admitany personas an associate,jointor provisional Member.(2) Right to vote and contest the election shall be subject to the provisions of sub-sections (2), (3) and (4) of section 154B-11.154B-11. Voting rights of Member.(1) No Member of society shall have more than one vote in its affairs:Provided that, every right to vote shall be exercised personally:Provided further that, in the case of an equality of votes, the Chairman shall have a casting vote in the meeting of a society.(2) The Associate Member shall have right to vote with prior written consent of a Member.(3) The provisional Member shall have right to vote.(4) In case of joint Member the person whose name stands first in the share certificate, shall have right to vote. In his absence, the person whose name stands second, and in the absence of both, the person whose name stands next and likewise, who is present and who is not a minor, shall have right to vote.(5) In case of Association of society, authorised Member of member society shall have right to vote.(6) In case of company or firm or any other body corporate or local authority or any legal body constituted under any law for the time being in force, the authorised director or person or any one of the partners as appointed by the firm, shall have right to vote.Section 22 and section 23 sub-sections 1 to 3 have been made applicable to co-operative housing societies by virtue of s.154B(1)Section 22 - Person who may become member(1 ) Subject to the provisions of section 24,no person shall be admitted as a member of a society except the following, that is to say--(a) an individual, who is competent to contract under the Indian Contract Act, 1872;(b) a firm, company or any other body corporate constituted under any law for the time being in force, or a society registered under the societies Registration Act, 1860;(c) a society registered, or deemed to be registered, under this Act;1 [(d) the State Government or the Central Government;](e) a local authority;(f) as public trust registered under any law for the time being in force for the registration of such trusts;8[(g) the depositor or the financial service user] :-----------------(2 )Where a person is refused admission as a member of a society, the decision (with the reasons therefore) shall be communicated to that person within fifteen days of the date of the decision, or within three months 5 [from the date of receipt of the application for admission, whichever is earlier. If the society does not communicate any decision to the applicant within three months from the date of receipt of such application the applicant shall be deemed to have been [admitted] as a member of the society.]7 [If any question arises whether a person has become a deemed member or otherwise, the same shall be decided by the Registrar after giving a reasonable opportunity of being heard to all the concerned parties.]Section 23 - Open membership(1) No society shall, without sufficient cause, refuse admission to membership to any person duly qualified therefor under the provisions of this Act and its by-laws.(2) Any person aggrieved by the decision of a society, refusing him admission to its membership, may appeal to the Registrar 5[within a period of sixty days from the date of the decision of the society]. 3[Every such appeal, as far, as possible, be disposed of by the Registrar within a period of three months from the date of its receipt:Provided that, where such appeal is not so disposed of within the said period of three months, the Registrar shall record the reasons for the delay.](3) The decision of the Registrar in appeal, shall be final and the Registrar shall communicate his decision to the parties within fifteen days from the date thereof.Thus s.154B-1 clause (b) defines who is a Joint Member. It only says that the joint member has share right title and interest in the flat jointly. It nowhere says that the order of names has to be the same as in the instrument of transfer. Thus the only requirement is that the joint member should have a share right etc in the flat jointly with another.u/s 154B-4(1) the society can admit ANY person as the joint member. It does not state that only the person whose name stands second in the instrument of transfer [in your case the gift deed] can be admitted as a joint memberthe voting rights of joint members are also provided in s. 154B-11 (4)thus if the society has communicated its reasons against transfer of membership to the joint names in the order desired by you, then you will have to appeal to the registrar u/s 23(2)and if there is no communication by the society about its refusal to admit the joint members as stated in the application then they would be deemed to become the members of the society by virtue of s.22(2) after the expiry of the statutory period stated thereinYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Order of names on Coop Housing Share Certificate vs order of names on Gift Deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Under the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960 and relevant bye-laws, it is the Gift Deed alone that forms the primary document for ownership transfer in a cooperative society which records legal transfer of title. It can be deemed justifiable as the very suggestion by the society to issue the share certificate as mentioned in the Gift Deed is a reflection of the legal status of ownership. The order of the names in the Gift Deed is what reflects the intention of the transferor, and in updating their records, the law compels the society to oblige by the same.While the application form (Appendix 23) allows you to specify the priority of members for listing purposes, for all legal purposes, including ownership, the Gift Deed is paramount. Under the laws governing cooperative housing societies, both are coowners who hold their shares equally, regardless of which one is first and which second on the application form. If the society misreads the application and labels the second-named member as an \"Associate Member,\" they are, in fact, full members with equal rights.If you are still facing problems at any point in the future, remedy may be available through consulting the society registrar or Rule 56 of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Rules, dealing with voting rights, co-members' rights, and election procedures. Your option filled in your application form is also important for administrative reasons, though it will not supersede the legal order of ownership established under the Gift Deed.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Should I seek legal advice on Agreement for Sale when buying a new flat in Mumbai from reputed builder",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Indeed, seek legal advice on the \"Agreement for Sale\" even though the builder is reputed and the project is RERA-registered. The legal scrutiny will provide you with an agreement that takes care of your interest coupled with presentation of a compliant agreement with RERA guidelines. If the change suggestions of the builder are reasonable or mandatorily required in law, his lawyer is sure to accept changes suggested.The cost to consult an attorney about this type of agreement can vary with the complexity of the procedure and experience with the lawyer, but it usually falls in the range of ₹15,000 to ₹50,000 in Mumbai.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Associate, Joint or provisional Member.(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in section 22, the society may admitany personas an associate,jointor provisional Member.(2) Right to vote and contest the election shall be subject to the provisions of sub-sections (2), (3) and (4) of section 154B-11.154B-11. Voting rights of Member.(1) No Member of society shall have more than one vote in its affairs:Provided that, every right to vote shall be exercised personally:Provided further that, in the case of an equality of votes, the Chairman shall have a casting vote in the meeting of a society.(2) The Associate Member shall have right to vote with prior written consent of a Member.(3) The provisional Member shall have right to vote.(4) In case of joint Member the person whose name stands first in the share certificate, shall have right to vote. In his absence, the person whose name stands second, and in the absence of both, the person whose name stands next and likewise, who is present and who is not a minor, shall have right to vote.(5) In case of Association of society, authorised Member of member society shall have right to vote.(6) In case of company or firm or any other body corporate or local authority or any legal body constituted under any law for the time being in force, the authorised director or person or any one of the partners as appointed by the firm, shall have right to vote.Section 22 and section 23 sub-sections 1 to 3 have been made applicable to co-operative housing societies by virtue of s.154B(1)Section 22 - Person who may become member(1 ) Subject to the provisions of section 24,no person shall be admitted as a member of a society except the following, that is to say--(a) an individual, who is competent to contract under the Indian Contract Act, 1872;(b) a firm, company or any other body corporate constituted under any law for the time being in force, or a society registered under the societies Registration Act, 1860;(c) a society registered, or deemed to be registered, under this Act;1 [(d) the State Government or the Central Government;](e) a local authority;(f) as public trust registered under any law for the time being in force for the registration of such trusts;8[(g) the depositor or the financial service user] :-----------------(2 )Where a person is refused admission as a member of a society, the decision (with the reasons therefore) shall be communicated to that person within fifteen days of the date of the decision, or within three months 5 [from the date of receipt of the application for admission, whichever is earlier. If the society does not communicate any decision to the applicant within three months from the date of receipt of such application the applicant shall be deemed to have been [admitted] as a member of the society.]7 [If any question arises whether a person has become a deemed member or otherwise, the same shall be decided by the Registrar after giving a reasonable opportunity of being heard to all the concerned parties.]Section 23 - Open membership(1) No society shall, without sufficient cause, refuse admission to membership to any person duly qualified therefor under the provisions of this Act and its by-laws.(2) Any person aggrieved by the decision of a society, refusing him admission to its membership, may appeal to the Registrar 5[within a period of sixty days from the date of the decision of the society]. 3[Every such appeal, as far, as possible, be disposed of by the Registrar within a period of three months from the date of its receipt:Provided that, where such appeal is not so disposed of within the said period of three months, the Registrar shall record the reasons for the delay.](3) The decision of the Registrar in appeal, shall be final and the Registrar shall communicate his decision to the parties within fifteen days from the date thereof.Thus s.154B-1 clause (b) defines who is a Joint Member. It only says that the joint member has share right title and interest in the flat jointly. It nowhere says that the order of names has to be the same as in the instrument of transfer. Thus the only requirement is that the joint member should have a share right etc in the flat jointly with another.u/s 154B-4(1) the society can admit ANY person as the joint member. It does not state that only the person whose name stands second in the instrument of transfer [in your case the gift deed] can be admitted as a joint memberthe voting rights of joint members are also provided in s. 154B-11 (4)thus if the society has communicated its reasons against transfer of membership to the joint names in the order desired by you, then you will have to appeal to the registrar u/s 23(2)and if there is no communication by the society about its refusal to admit the joint members as stated in the application then they would be deemed to become the members of the society by virtue of s.22(2) after the expiry of the statutory period stated thereinYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Order of names on Coop Housing Share Certificate vs order of names on Gift Deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Under the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960 and relevant bye-laws, it is the Gift Deed alone that forms the primary document for ownership transfer in a cooperative society which records legal transfer of title. It can be deemed justifiable as the very suggestion by the society to issue the share certificate as mentioned in the Gift Deed is a reflection of the legal status of ownership. The order of the names in the Gift Deed is what reflects the intention of the transferor, and in updating their records, the law compels the society to oblige by the same.While the application form (Appendix 23) allows you to specify the priority of members for listing purposes, for all legal purposes, including ownership, the Gift Deed is paramount. Under the laws governing cooperative housing societies, both are coowners who hold their shares equally, regardless of which one is first and which second on the application form. If the society misreads the application and labels the second-named member as an \"Associate Member,\" they are, in fact, full members with equal rights.If you are still facing problems at any point in the future, remedy may be available through consulting the society registrar or Rule 56 of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Rules, dealing with voting rights, co-members' rights, and election procedures. Your option filled in your application form is also important for administrative reasons, though it will not supersede the legal order of ownership established under the Gift Deed.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Foreign nationals will be eligible for an X visa, provided they are dependents of Indian citizens and there will be no work-study-business in India. Even though the client of your husband is a US-based company without any Indian connection, remote work would still be viewed as a violation of the conditions of the X visa while staying in India.Employment of any nature is strictly barred under an X visa, or whether the employer is Indian or foreign.He would need to apply for a visa of employment to work in India. Usually, an employment visa is issued for employment purposes from an employer in India; however, in certain instances, it can also be acquired to render services to foreign clients, in particular if the person involved is an independent contractor.That is a gray area in the visa regulations of India; however, seeking conversion of his X visa to an employment visa would best be the legal recourse in order to be valid.Regarding taxes, he would be classified as a tax resident if he stays for a considerable duration. He would thus be subject to taxes in the country on incomes accrued from outside its border, but that would depend on his status as a tax resident and the treaties applicable between India and the US.I hope this explanation assists you in resolving your concerns.

    "question": "Can I renew my Passport if I have pending a case against me",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case, because there is a pending FIR underSection 420IPC (now section 318 of the BNS, 2023), you shall have to go through particular legal procedures as entailed by the law of India on renewal of passports. A case already pending under the provisions of the concerned court requires notice to the said court regarding the renewal of a passport and obtaining permission therefrom. Even though you have a stay order on the FIR and are allowed to travel abroad, this exempts you not to getting permission for passport renewal.File an application in the court where your case is pending seeking permission to renew your passport with reasons and an explanation of the circumstances. Such permission by courts generally remains valid unless there is a strong reason to reject the permission. Meanwhile, you should state that you have an already pending case and anticipatory bail for applying to renew your passport so as not to face legal complications later. This procedure, if not followed, might result in refusal of renewals or some legal repercussions.Therefore, it is preferable to take permission from the court to comply with legal procedure requirements.I hope this response is beneficial for your situation. If you still have any further queries regarding this matter, do not hesitate to contact us again.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Inheritance of agricultural by NRI children from resident Himachal Pradesh parents",
    "answer": "Dear Client,As NRIs, on the death of your parents, their natural inheritance would pass on to you as legal heirs under the Hindu Succession Law. However, it is always advisable to formalize the process by having your parents execute a clear will for the transfer of the land to you, thereby avoiding any complexities in the future.Regarding the Himachali status, since the land is in Himachal, non-agriculturists or NRIs may not be allowed to purchase agricultural land in the state. You would require a Himachali Certificate, also known as a bonafide certificate, establishing your Himachal lineage through your parents. These certificates are issued by the concerned Tehsildar's office after documents establishing your family's origins being from Himachal. Your parents' certificates, voter ID, or ration card can work as proof.If to secure the land for the future generations is your desired purpose, then it is best when you are still with your parents to have already documented and registered it.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Even though the client of your husband is a US-based company without any Indian connection, remote work would still be viewed as a violation of the conditions of the X visa while staying in India.Employment of any nature is strictly barred under an X visa, or whether the employer is Indian or foreign.He would need to apply for a visa of employment to work in India. Usually, an employment visa is issued for employment purposes from an employer in India; however, in certain instances, it can also be acquired to render services to foreign clients, in particular if the person involved is an independent contractor.That is a gray area in the visa regulations of India; however, seeking conversion of his X visa to an employment visa would best be the legal recourse in order to be valid.Regarding taxes, he would be classified as a tax resident if he stays for a considerable duration. He would thus be subject to taxes in the country on incomes accrued from outside its border, but that would depend on his status as a tax resident and the treaties applicable between India and the US.I hope this explanation assists you in resolving your concerns.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Before you purchase agricultural land under a Power of Attorney, ensure:1. **PoA Verification**: Registered and authorized to sell.2. **Ownership Check**: The *Saatbara* extract shows it corresponds with the owner and also shows no encumbrances.3. **Title Search**: Has not been used to claim any disputes or other claims on the land at any point of time during the past 30 years.4. The land could be sold to you strictly under the law using your farmers' certificate as legitimate proof for the transfer.5. **EC (Encumbrance Certificate)**: Ensures lien free status of the property.6. **Mutation Records**: Asserts rightful ownership and inheritance. It can save one from all fraud as well as legal conditions.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

An invalid sale deed executed by a PoA holder under no proper authority can even be declared null and void after the completion of the sale, and so such a check becomes important.To avoid fraud, obtain through a title search at the sub-registrar's office an encumbrance certificate indicating that no claims or encumbrances are encroaching on the said land. Let survey (*Mozani*) ascertain that the land referred to matches the location and description as stated in the 7/12 extract.In case, after due care and precautions taken, title issues or defects arise after the sale, you can claim cancellation of the sale deed and refund under Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, whereupon cancellation is permitted when a contract becomes voidable or the fact is that there is defect in title.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Foreign nationals will be eligible for an X visa, provided they are dependents of Indian citizens and there will be no work-study-business in India. Even though the client of your husband is a US-based company without any Indian connection, remote work would still be viewed as a violation of the conditions of the X visa while staying in India.Employment of any nature is strictly barred under an X visa, or whether the employer is Indian or foreign.He would need to apply for a visa of employment to work in India. Usually, an employment visa is issued for employment purposes from an employer in India; however, in certain instances, it can also be acquired to render services to foreign clients, in particular if the person involved is an independent contractor.That is a gray area in the visa regulations of India; however, seeking conversion of his X visa to an employment visa would best be the legal recourse in order to be valid.Regarding taxes, he would be classified as a tax resident if he stays for a considerable duration. He would thus be subject to taxes in the country on incomes accrued from outside its border, but that would depend on his status as a tax resident and the treaties applicable between India and the US.I hope this explanation assists you in resolving your concerns.

    "answer": "Dear Client,As NRIs, on the death of your parents, their natural inheritance would pass on to you as legal heirs under the Hindu Succession Law. However, it is always advisable to formalize the process by having your parents execute a clear will for the transfer of the land to you, thereby avoiding any complexities in the future.Regarding the Himachali status, since the land is in Himachal, non-agriculturists or NRIs may not be allowed to purchase agricultural land in the state. You would require a Himachali Certificate, also known as a bonafide certificate, establishing your Himachal lineage through your parents. These certificates are issued by the concerned Tehsildar's office after documents establishing your family's origins being from Himachal. Your parents' certificates, voter ID, or ration card can work as proof.If to secure the land for the future generations is your desired purpose, then it is best when you are still with your parents to have already documented and registered it.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can tenant claim ownership after stay of 8 years",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In this case i would like to inform you that,under a Leave and License agreement, the tenant would not be able to lay claim to the ownership rights as such agreements do not create a tenancy per se but give only temporary permission to occupy the property, governed by the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999. Therefore, the tenant cannot claim ownership.Yet a tenant may decline vacating if:i)There is no serving at the termination of a legal notice.ii)This includes claims of harassment or unfair eviction practices.The tenant has to be given a notice of legal eviction, and if he/she does not vacate on his/her own, the landlord has to go to court for an order of eviction which can take up considerable time. Still, even while that is true, in most respects, the process of Leave and License is simpler for the eviction process compared to a tenancy agreement.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If your younger uncle is dodging the sale or accepting a low price, you can go ahead and sell it to the highest bidder, and make him duly serve the notice. Renting out the property without the concerned person's consent can be legally challenged.Considering the ₹30 lakh from your grandmother's account, being the nominee, your uncle is liable to distribute the amount received according to all the heirs.

Rebuilding-Based Eviction: You can file an eviction case based on the fact that rebuilding is proposed under the Tamil Nadu Rent Act, with a structural engineer's report for the demolition purpose.

Prohibition of transfer of granted lands.-(1) Notwithstanding anything in any law, agreement, contract or instrument, any transfer of granted land made either before or after the commencement of this Act, in contravention of the terms of the grant of such land or the law providing for such grant, or sub-section (2) shall be null and void and no right, title or interest in such land shall be conveyed or be deemed ever to have conveyed by such transfer.\"It is very clear from the above provision of Section that if any transfer of granted land is alienated, which is contrary to the Land Grant Rules, will be null and void.If the original grantee is filing an application under section 5 of the act,  with regard to terms of Section 5 of the Act which enables any interested person to make an application for having the transfer annulled as void under Section 4 of the Act. the court can pass an order declaring the sale or the transaction as null and void.However the supreme court has ruled in favor of the purchaser stating that the land was alienated after 15 year of allotment to the grantee hence any application made resumption of land the same is not maintainable..

If your younger uncle is dodging the sale or accepting a low price, you can go ahead and sell it to the highest bidder, and make him duly serve the notice. Renting out the property without the concerned person's consent can be legally challenged.Considering the ₹30 lakh from your grandmother's account, being the nominee, your uncle is liable to distribute the amount received according to all the heirs.

Punishment  of such offence is imprisonment  up to 3 months and fine of 5K. Offence is cognizable but police will hesitate of register complaint.

    "question": "Licensee unwilling to vacate after lease expiration - Need remedy",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Under the Indian Law, the Leave and License agreement only gives temporary rights over the premises, and the license shall vacate the same upon notice. As you have already given the required 30-day's notice and are over that period the tenant has overstayed, so you can file an eviction suit in the respective court of Mumbai by stating the personal reasons, like your parents' health. Police may be called in to enforce law and order if the tenant threatens harassment but cannot be directly evicted without a court order. Filing of eviction suit is required to enforce vacating of the property, and the procedure can be shortened with proper reasons.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Leaving in Pagdi System in Chawl for more than 32 Years",
    "answer": "Ideally the tenant is to approach the landlord for paying the rentThe tenant is required to show his readiness and willingness to pay the rent on timeIf the landlord stopped coming to the building to collect rent, then the tenant ought to have approached the landlord for paying the rentThe tenant must show and prove that he made all inquiries to find the whereabouts of the landlord or his heirsIf the heirs could not be traced, the tenant ought to have deposited the rent in the Small Causes Court to show his bonafides and willingness to pay the rentHowever it appears that in your case none of the above was doneJust because someone claiming to be the heir of the landlord appeared after 8 years, the tenant cannot be heard to say that since no one from the landlord's end came in the building to collect rent for the last 8 years, that's why the tenant didn't take any steps to pay the rent.The obligation to pay rent is on the tenant. The landlord has got no legal obligation to go to the building and collect rent from his tenantsSo I am afraid that in your case the judgment will be passed against the tenant for being in arrears of rent and for not taking any positive steps to tender the rent to the landlord to show the tenant's readiness and willingness to pay rentIf there was any doubt about the person claiming to be the heir of the landlord, the tenant ought to have deposited rent in court until such person produced an heirship certificate. This was not done.So mostly likely the tenants will suffer an eviction decreeAs regards the unauthorized construction, that too cannot be justified by saying that why only 4 tenants are targeted and why not others who have also made such unauthorized extensions and alternations.If the tenant is in breach of the tenancy terms and Municipal law , he cannot be heard to say that he is entitled to commit such breach since others have committed it tooSo on the ground of making unauthorized changes to the tenanted premises as well the tenant will suffer an eviction decreeI must inform you that prior to the filing of the suit the heir must have issued a statutory demand notice u/s 15. So the tenant has got 2 opportunities to pay the arrears of rent and avoid an eviction decree for the time being. One is when he tenders the rent to the landlord within the statutory period mentioned in the statutory demand notice and another is when the tenant deposits the rent in court within the set time limit after receiving court summonsAlso you cannot take the plea that the claim of arrears of rent is barred by limitation since there are Bombay High Court judgments which have held that the tenant has to deposit the time barred rent claims as well to avoid eviction.So your case appears to be quite weakYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Leaving in Pagdi System in Chawl for more than 32 Years",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I would like to inform you that,under the Pagdi system, you are being protected under the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999. If the landlord's legal heir is demanding rent from you, he must prove first his legal ownership- succession certificate or legal heirship documents. You are entitled to ask for proof before paying rent.Regarding the notice, you must appear at court. The legal successor may try to make a case of non-payment to make the case for eviction; but by proving that you are willing to pay once the legal ownership is clear, this will go in your favor. The charge of construction without permission (1+1) would be a valid ground to create a case under Section 16(1) of the Act if one includes that this was done without the appropriate permissions from BMC.Since you are not alone and there are other tenants in the same situation, you can move this to court. Recommend getting a new lawyer to prepare for your case at the hearing on 23rd October. The court will then proceed to determine whether the landlord has satisfied his duties of establishing his ownership prior to ordering any eviction or back rent pay order.Thank you.

These are relevant when giving a petition to have the ex-parte injunction set aside on the 1st of October in the year 2024 be kicked out because under the CPC under Order V, proper service must have been made. You should consider bringing an application for contempt against Judge P. Nageswara Rao for granting the injunction when there is no sufficient basis to do so without sufficient notice violating your rights and procedurally unfair. Although there are concerns that complaints against both judges should be made, it may be more beneficial to aim at the junior judge if you think he is pressured by the first judge. Whatever samples of his calls or conversation or other such material for substantiating the allegations compiled by her must be compiled completely. The approach is associated with Section 27 of the CPC pointing out that proper summon and fair hearing should be conducted in the case.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Therefore, the tenant cannot claim ownership.Yet a tenant may decline vacating if:i)There is no serving at the termination of a legal notice.ii)This includes claims of harassment or unfair eviction practices.The tenant has to be given a notice of legal eviction, and if he/she does not vacate on his/her own, the landlord has to go to court for an order of eviction which can take up considerable time. Still, even while that is true, in most respects, the process of Leave and License is simpler for the eviction process compared to a tenancy agreement.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "As clearly qouted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India- \"Once a tenant is always a tenant'.A tenant can not claim ownership over any property to which he is a tenant and if any tenant refuse to evict the rented premises, than the owner of the property can send him a legal notice for eviction and if the tenant don't vacate the premises even after the legal notice than the owner can file an eviction suit against him.Generally, an eviction suit does not last for 1 or 1.5 year but it all depends on the burden of the cases on the respective court of that particular state and the earliest date given by such court in a ordinary manner.Vishek VatsAdvocate, Delhi90 AnswersTalk to Advocate Vishek Vats"

    "question": "Wife files a false 498a case as FIR, false DVC, MC for sake of maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case it is possible that you may have to pay maintenance during theDomestic Violence(DV) proceedings though your wife may be levelling baseless allegations. Your wife will be able to claim from your income of ₹ 90,000 or any reasonable amount minus the medical bills. While the DV case might be false, and may change maintenance obligations if proven so, it does not necessarily remove you from paying unless a court allows it to do so. As for making home dues, since your wife is capable of earning but decide not to work then this too can be taken to court to try and reduce her maintenance claim. Furthermore, an act can be an act of cruelty in terms of Section 13(1)(ia) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 where false allegations have been made. Once you prove that the allegations made by her are false you can file a defamation case undersection 354of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (previously, Section 499 IPC) or can lodge a complaint under section 246 of BNS (Previously, Section 211 of IPC) for filing a false case. For these legal issues, you should consult a family law attorney to assist you on the matter to avoid further complications.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Wife files a false 498a case as FIR, false DVC, MC for sake of maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queries1. In the case ofDomestic Violence, if your wife produces before the court photographs of bruises, then that may be taken into consideration, but she has to prove that such injuries have been given to her by you. Mere photographs cannot prove anything against a person, therefore, there is scope for argument against such evidence.2. In cases of maintenance, prima facie evidence may be permitted by the court even without any proper investigation, and an order for interim maintenance can be passed by the judge. You will have to pay maintenance even if you prove her allegations of default to be false, but the amount may be reduced or even disallowed by the court as per its estimation of her needs and your ability to pay.3. If you can show your wife is capable of earning -- by showing past work as a beautician or education -- the court may remit or refuse to award maintenance. The courts, in general, are reluctant to award maintenance if wife has deliberately avoided employment with the sole intention of claiming maintenance.4. Maintenance amount is usually computed on your income and not your parent's. If your monthly salary is ₹90,000 and you have heavy financial commitments like loan repayments or medical and legal charges, the court is likely to consider all these points while deciding an amount for you. The figure can range between 20-30% of your net income with deductions.5. If allegations prove untrue, one could prohibit future maintenance but could not recover past payments.6.a) A police can even file an FIR without investigation in false cases. b) Maintenance can also be granted in false cases. c) Husband protection laws are lesser but exist.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Wife files a false 498a case as FIR, false DVC, MC for sake of maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queries,1. Your child and second wife's case: Visiting your child will not add to complication in the 498A case filed against you by your second wife. This is because child visitation rights are separate, cannot be tagged with that kind of case.2. Right to visit your child: You have the right to visit your child at home or at school, other than that allowed by the conditions of a court order. Hostile behavior by the family of your first wife can be legally controlled through the enforcement of your visitation rights.3. Rights to visit your child: Regardless of whether you ever remarry, nothing impacts on the rights to visit your child from the previous marriage.4. False enrollment in land registration: In case there have been forged engravings in your wife's and father-in-law's land registration you may file a complaint against them. However, the legal significance to your case depends on how you word it legally.5. Income proof: Gather evidence that she earns her money by sending business advertisements and photographs or even client feedback. You can present these in court to prove that she is indeed capable of earning.6. Effect of acting in court: lllCourts do not rely on acting. If your wife cannot properly present her evidence, her exaggerated claims are likely to fall. Make sure you have good, factual evidence to defend yourself with.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Need to understand how to get registry done if my mother is gifted with a property from her mother via gift deed.",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case, since a valid and registered gift deed was was five years ago, your mother is the absolute owner of that property. In Indian law, unless fraud, coercion, or undue influence is proved, a registered gift deed is incapable of being revoked. There is no case where an increase in property prices has opened up legitimate grounds to challenge such a gift deed.Now, if you want that very property to be further registered in the name of your mother then it is not possible as the gift deed is enough to transfer the ownership and the property is already under her name legally. No further registration is required.If you want to transfer a portion of the property to your father, your mother can make a gift deed in favour of your father for a part of the property. The steps which have to be followed are:1. Drafting of a fresh gift deed transferring a part of the property of your mother in favour of your father.2. Payment of Haryana stamp duty and registration fees.3. Gift deed must be presented before the Sub-Registrar in the local Sub-Registrar's office, who would register it.This would mean that legally your father is also a co-owner of the property. The donee and donor, however, being alive explains that the original gift deed is strengthened and less likely to stand any chance of being challenged.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Rental agreement cancellation",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The notice from the tenant stating two months is as per the rental agreement, making the termination quite a painless affair. You can acknowledge and accept the notice verbally and in writing by sending a written reply, and you can even share a Word document over WhatsApp. Legally, you don't have to send this copy as well because communicating over WhatsApp, including sharing of a Word document, can be held valid where parties consent to doing so. The necessity to include the lease agreement is not applicable since the terms are already decided. After the notice period is over, take possession from the tenant and sort out all the dues or property inspection issues.Thank you hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Agreement Form: The leave and license agreement throws the tenants out of the premises sooner without any rights but also offers police assistance in retrieving the property when the license term expires.2. Proactive Eviction: Normally, eviction proceedings rely on valid grounds on or after the lease expires. Thus, pre-expiration filing is hard.3. Leave and License: It makes it easier to obtain eviction upon expiry of the agreement through legal notices and, if required, filing for repossession in court.4. Rebuilding-Based Eviction: You can file an eviction case based on the fact that rebuilding is proposed under the Tamil Nadu Rent Act, with a structural engineer's report for the demolition purpose. Tenants may claim but the court is likely to accept landowners' petitions claiming genuine rebuilding purposes.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can tenant claim ownership after stay of 8 years",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In this case i would like to inform you that,under a Leave and License agreement, the tenant would not be able to lay claim to the ownership rights as such agreements do not create a tenancy per se but give only temporary permission to occupy the property, governed by the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999. Therefore, the tenant cannot claim ownership.Yet a tenant may decline vacating if:i)There is no serving at the termination of a legal notice.ii)This includes claims of harassment or unfair eviction practices.The tenant has to be given a notice of legal eviction, and if he/she does not vacate on his/her own, the landlord has to go to court for an order of eviction which can take up considerable time. Still, even while that is true, in most respects, the process of Leave and License is simpler for the eviction process compared to a tenancy agreement.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case it is possible that you may have to pay maintenance during theDomestic Violence(DV) proceedings though your wife may be levelling baseless allegations. Your wife will be able to claim from your income of ₹ 90,000 or any reasonable amount minus the medical bills. While the DV case might be false, and may change maintenance obligations if proven so, it does not necessarily remove you from paying unless a court allows it to do so. As for making home dues, since your wife is capable of earning but decide not to work then this too can be taken to court to try and reduce her maintenance claim. Furthermore, an act can be an act of cruelty in terms of Section 13(1)(ia) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 where false allegations have been made. Once you prove that the allegations made by her are false you can file a defamation case undersection 354of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (previously, Section 499 IPC) or can lodge a complaint under section 246 of BNS (Previously, Section 211 of IPC) for filing a false case.

    "question": "Wife files a false 498a case as FIR, false DVC, MC for sake of maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queries1. In the case ofDomestic Violence, if your wife produces before the court photographs of bruises, then that may be taken into consideration, but she has to prove that such injuries have been given to her by you. Mere photographs cannot prove anything against a person, therefore, there is scope for argument against such evidence.2. In cases of maintenance, prima facie evidence may be permitted by the court even without any proper investigation, and an order for interim maintenance can be passed by the judge. You will have to pay maintenance even if you prove her allegations of default to be false, but the amount may be reduced or even disallowed by the court as per its estimation of her needs and your ability to pay.3. If you can show your wife is capable of earning -- by showing past work as a beautician or education -- the court may remit or refuse to award maintenance. The courts, in general, are reluctant to award maintenance if wife has deliberately avoided employment with the sole intention of claiming maintenance.4. Maintenance amount is usually computed on your income and not your parent's. If your monthly salary is ₹90,000 and you have heavy financial commitments like loan repayments or medical and legal charges, the court is likely to consider all these points while deciding an amount for you. The figure can range between 20-30% of your net income with deductions.5. If allegations prove untrue, one could prohibit future maintenance but could not recover past payments.6.a) A police can even file an FIR without investigation in false cases. b) Maintenance can also be granted in false cases. c) Husband protection laws are lesser but exist.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Wife files a false 498a case as FIR, false DVC, MC for sake of maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queries,1. Your child and second wife's case: Visiting your child will not add to complication in the 498A case filed against you by your second wife. This is because child visitation rights are separate, cannot be tagged with that kind of case.2. Right to visit your child: You have the right to visit your child at home or at school, other than that allowed by the conditions of a court order. Hostile behavior by the family of your first wife can be legally controlled through the enforcement of your visitation rights.3. Rights to visit your child: Regardless of whether you ever remarry, nothing impacts on the rights to visit your child from the previous marriage.4. False enrollment in land registration: In case there have been forged engravings in your wife's and father-in-law's land registration you may file a complaint against them. However, the legal significance to your case depends on how you word it legally.5. Income proof: Gather evidence that she earns her money by sending business advertisements and photographs or even client feedback. You can present these in court to prove that she is indeed capable of earning.6. Effect of acting in court: lllCourts do not rely on acting. If your wife cannot properly present her evidence, her exaggerated claims are likely to fall. Make sure you have good, factual evidence to defend yourself with.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Need to understand how to get registry done if my mother is gifted with a property from her mother via gift deed.",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case, since a valid and registered gift deed was was five years ago, your mother is the absolute owner of that property. In Indian law, unless fraud, coercion, or undue influence is proved, a registered gift deed is incapable of being revoked. There is no case where an increase in property prices has opened up legitimate grounds to challenge such a gift deed.Now, if you want that very property to be further registered in the name of your mother then it is not possible as the gift deed is enough to transfer the ownership and the property is already under her name legally. No further registration is required.If you want to transfer a portion of the property to your father, your mother can make a gift deed in favour of your father for a part of the property. The steps which have to be followed are:1. Drafting of a fresh gift deed transferring a part of the property of your mother in favour of your father.2. Payment of Haryana stamp duty and registration fees.3. Gift deed must be presented before the Sub-Registrar in the local Sub-Registrar's office, who would register it.This would mean that legally your father is also a co-owner of the property. The donee and donor, however, being alive explains that the original gift deed is strengthened and less likely to stand any chance of being challenged.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Under the Indian Law, the Leave and License agreement only gives temporary rights over the premises, and the license shall vacate the same upon notice. As you have already given the required 30-day's notice and are over that period the tenant has overstayed, so you can file an eviction suit in the respective court of Mumbai by stating the personal reasons, like your parents' health. Police may be called in to enforce law and order if the tenant threatens harassment but cannot be directly evicted without a court order. Filing of eviction suit is required to enforce vacating of the property, and the procedure can be shortened with proper reasons.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Agreement Form: The leave and license agreement throws the tenants out of the premises sooner without any rights but also offers police assistance in retrieving the property when the license term expires.2. Proactive Eviction: Normally, eviction proceedings rely on valid grounds on or after the lease expires. Thus, pre-expiration filing is hard.3. Leave and License: It makes it easier to obtain eviction upon expiry of the agreement through legal notices and, if required, filing for repossession in court.4. Rebuilding-Based Eviction: You can file an eviction case based on the fact that rebuilding is proposed under the Tamil Nadu Rent Act, with a structural engineer's report for the demolition purpose.

    "question": "Travelled abroad without NOC from university",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the possible response to your queries.1) In your case, purchasing tickets and proceeding on leave without NOC is not advisable. Government employees, as you are also part of this system at universities, have Indian law making it necessary to obtain a No Objection Certificate for foreign travel as a check to transparency and accountability, as per the guidelines of the Department of Personnel and Training, DoPT. Hence, proceeding without NOC may call for disciplinary action in the form of treating the absence as unauthorized leave, issuing a show-cause notice or suspension for non-compliance.2) Such actions may be taken by the university under the service conduct rules governing the behavior of government employees. In fact, the consistent refusal or even delay in the issuance of the NOC may well be a basis for a complaint under the rubric of harassment. You may file a formal grievance with the committee of the university, pointing out the unwarranted delay when all conditions are satisfied, including consent from your Head of Department, and there would be no implication on classes.3) If it is a recurring issue, you would be well advised to take up the issue with the UGC and approach the CAT seeking redress for the delay and harassment inflicted upon you under service rules. You may even file a writ petition in the High Court for redress for the undue delay and non-issuance of the NOC, which hinders your rights and causes unwarranted distress.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In this case i would like to inform you that,under a Leave and License agreement, the tenant would not be able to lay claim to the ownership rights as such agreements do not create a tenancy per se but give only temporary permission to occupy the property, governed by the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999. Therefore, the tenant cannot claim ownership.Yet a tenant may decline vacating if:i)There is no serving at the termination of a legal notice.ii)This includes claims of harassment or unfair eviction practices.The tenant has to be given a notice of legal eviction, and if he/she does not vacate on his/her own, the landlord has to go to court for an order of eviction which can take up considerable time. Still, even while that is true, in most respects, the process of Leave and License is simpler for the eviction process compared to a tenancy agreement.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "If the gifted property was transferred  to your mother by an unregistered document then it is not valid legally.If the property which was transferred to your mother by her mother was her own and absolute property, then nothing prevents her from executing a registered gift deed now also because she is alive and the donee is also alive.You can ask your grandmother to immediately execute a registered gift deed in favor of your mother before anyone raises any dispute or approaches court with any unnecessary litigation.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Need to understand how to get registry done if my mother is gifted with a property from her mother via gift deed.",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case, since a valid and registered gift deed was was five years ago, your mother is the absolute owner of that property. In Indian law, unless fraud, coercion, or undue influence is proved, a registered gift deed is incapable of being revoked. There is no case where an increase in property prices has opened up legitimate grounds to challenge such a gift deed.Now, if you want that very property to be further registered in the name of your mother then it is not possible as the gift deed is enough to transfer the ownership and the property is already under her name legally. No further registration is required.If you want to transfer a portion of the property to your father, your mother can make a gift deed in favour of your father for a part of the property. The steps which have to be followed are:1. Drafting of a fresh gift deed transferring a part of the property of your mother in favour of your father.2. Payment of Haryana stamp duty and registration fees.3. Gift deed must be presented before the Sub-Registrar in the local Sub-Registrar's office, who would register it.This would mean that legally your father is also a co-owner of the property. The donee and donor, however, being alive explains that the original gift deed is strengthened and less likely to stand any chance of being challenged.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,For the renovation of the house and conversion of the electricity connection from residential to commercial, you can go ahead if the tenant has been evacuated already, or if you have a court order to do so. As you have recently provided the tenant with a final notice to quit the rented premises because of the current rental court case is close to being determined you have the authority to carry out the renovation work. But make sure that you do not infringe any court order regarding the status of the tenant during the eviction process to avert any legal hurt. If rental arrears cross ₹2 lakh, you can get a vacate order in your favour. If the court has granted you an ex parte order then you can enforce it to regain possession of the property. It is always wise to seek legal advice and help in order to conduct all actions without a violation of law and to help in the proper implementation of the court order.Hope you find this answer helpful in resolving your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Agreement Form: The leave and license agreement throws the tenants out of the premises sooner without any rights but also offers police assistance in retrieving the property when the license term expires.2. Proactive Eviction: Normally, eviction proceedings rely on valid grounds on or after the lease expires. Thus, pre-expiration filing is hard.3. Leave and License: It makes it easier to obtain eviction upon expiry of the agreement through legal notices and, if required, filing for repossession in court.4. Rebuilding-Based Eviction: You can file an eviction case based on the fact that rebuilding is proposed under the Tamil Nadu Rent Act, with a structural engineer's report for the demolition purpose. Tenants may claim but the court is likely to accept landowners' petitions claiming genuine rebuilding purposes.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can tenant claim ownership after stay of 8 years",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In this case i would like to inform you that,under a Leave and License agreement, the tenant would not be able to lay claim to the ownership rights as such agreements do not create a tenancy per se but give only temporary permission to occupy the property, governed by the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999. Therefore, the tenant cannot claim ownership.Yet a tenant may decline vacating if:i)There is no serving at the termination of a legal notice.ii)This includes claims of harassment or unfair eviction practices.The tenant has to be given a notice of legal eviction, and if he/she does not vacate on his/her own, the landlord has to go to court for an order of eviction which can take up considerable time. Still, even while that is true, in most respects, the process of Leave and License is simpler for the eviction process compared to a tenancy agreement.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Non-resident Indians selling a family home in India are liable to capital gains tax computed at the current value of ₹ 3 Crore of the house. LTCG tax at 20% is applicable when holding periods are more than two years and therefore the tax payable comes to about ₹60 Lakhs. An STCG tax may be attracted at the rate of tax as applicable for that income slab may be attracted depending on the amount of income. The buyer will subtract TDS from the amount and any extra amount of TDS can be claimed if the income tax returns are being filed. It is allowed to bring up to USD 1 million per a financial year received from the sales proceeds to the NRE account provided necessary forms have been filed.

    "question": "Adoption under HAMA in India and traveling abroad",
    "answer": "Dear Client,As you are an Indian citizen who has adopted a baby girl under Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act will need a NOC from CARA to travel with the child outside the country. This particular NOC shows that the adoption was done and it permits one to travel to other countries. But for now that you have the child’s passport, ensure that you carry along other important papers such as; adoption order, marriage certificate among others which will be required at immigration. If you have never got a response from CARA or HAMA then it is wiser to write an email, message or follow up a call or one should consult a lawyer who specializes in adoption cases. Some of legal provisions for definition of NOC contain in Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 and guidelines as prescribed by Central Adoption Resource Authority popularly known as CARA lay down the formalities that are required for NOC.Hope you find this answer suitable for resolving you query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "OBC NCL eligibility",
    "answer": "- As far as the Government employees are considered, the entry cadre/post is to be taken into consideration, and salary and agricultural income are not to be considered as income for calculating annual income for creamy layer status.1. If anyone of, father or mother is direct recruited class 1 servants than their children won't be eligible for NCL. But if he/she is promoted to class 1 then the kids will be eligible2. If both of the parents are class 2 then their kids won't be eligible for OBC quota , and in case of one only , then the child would be off from creamy layer and they can avail benefits of quota3. If father was recruited direct to class 2 positions and then prompted to class 1 before age of 40 than it would be no longer NCL. However this scenario only applies to father not the mother- The government servants who don’t fall under this category are all non-creamy layer.- Government Employees of Class 3 or below class 3 officers are eligible for OBC Quota., and the salary/ income of the government employees are not to be taken into consideration for considering the OBC NCL category certificate.- Since your father is under group B m, and mother is promoted in group B, then you are eligible to get non-creamy OBC Certificate.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "OBC NCL eligibility",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case, your mother was recruited as a Consolidated BT Assistant in 2004 on a fixed pay, which probably categorizes her under Group C at that time, since consolidated pay is more or less associated with lower categories. However, the moment she was regularized in the year 2006, she was placed under Group B, as that indicated her position after regularization with pay scale benefits and allowances.For OBC-NCL Eligibility: If your both parents are Group B officers and no one of your parents has been promoted to a higher level than Group B, you fall within the category of OBC-NCL according to the eligible criteria of the Government of India. You may visit the official website for guidelines on parental employment in Group B with reference to OBC-NCL.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Let me make it clear to you that just because your mother started receiving a consolidated pay of ₹4000/- she cannot be regarded as belong to Group C or D in Tamil Nadu. She entered by Through Teacher Recruitment Board TRBs in the year 2004, her services were regularized from 2006 and going by the pay structure relevant to her time her designation was probably in Group C. Group C assignments are normally prescribed by certification and generally are not related to manual work, whereas group D is generally for manual job posts. As to confirm the classification as per Annexure II it would be advisable to crosscheck such papers like appointment letters and joining orders from the TRB. She can also seek advice from an attorney, who is conversant with the employment laws in Tamil Nadu to get a clear stand of her legal right.Hope you find this answer helpful in resolving your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"
