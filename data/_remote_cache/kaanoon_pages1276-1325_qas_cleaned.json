    "question": "Can X write a will saying property should go to Y and then on the death of Y to go to Z?",
    "answer": "Sadhu Singh v. Gurdwara Sahib Narike And OthersSupreme Court Of IndiaSep 8, 2006An owner ofpropertyhas normally the right to deal with thatpropertyincluding the right to devise or bequeath theproperty. He could thus dispose it of by a testament. Section 30 of the Act, not only does not curtail or affect this right, it actually reaffirms that right. Thus, a Hindu male could testamentarily dispose of hisproperty. When he does that, a succession under the Act stands excluded and thepropertypasses to the testamentary heirs. Hence, when a male Hindu executes a will bequeathing the properties, the legatees take it subject to the terms of the will unless of course, any stipulation therein is found invalid. Therefore, there is nothing in the Act which affects the right of a male Hindu to dispose of hispropertyby providing only alifeestateor limitedestatefor his widow. The Act does not stand in the way of his separate properties being dealt with by him as he deems fit. His will hence could not be challenged as being hit by the Act.14. When he thus validly disposes of hispropertyby providing for a limitedestateto his heir, the wife, the wife or widow has to take it as theestatefalls. This restriction on her right so provided, is really respected by the Act. It provides inSection 14(2)of the Act, that in such a case, the widow is bound by the limitation on her right and she cannot claim any higher right by invoking Section 14(1) of the Act.Thus the first attempt must be to reconcile all the clauses in the will and give effect to all of them. When we make that attempt in the context of what this Court had indicated in the decision quoted above, we find that the apparent absoluteestategiven to his wife by the testator is sought to be cut down by the stipulations that thepropertymust go to his nephews after the death of the wife, that the wife cannot testamentarily dispose of thepropertyin favour of anyone else and the further interdict in the note that the wife during her lifetime would not be entitled to mortgage or sell the properties. Thus on reconciling the various clauses in the will and the destination for the properties that the testator had in mind, we have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the apparent absoluteestatein favour of Isher Kaur has to be cut down to alifeestateso as to accommodate theestateconferred on the nephews.Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "question": "Adverse possession- what is meant by a blood relative",
    "answer": "Dear Client,According to the doctrine of adverse possession, a person acquires legal ownership of land after holding it without interruption for more than 12 years, regardless of who else owns the property. A person who held property but subsequently abandoned it without taking any action is seen as having forfeited their claim to the land or property. In the case of Ravindra Kaur Grewal v. Manjeet Kaur (2019), it had been held by the Court that the person who has the possession of any immovable property for more than 12 years has the right to acquire its ownership. The Karnataka Board of Wakf v. Government of India (2004) case established a precedent wherein an individual who claims ownership of property held by another takes possession of it. Despite this, ownership is transferred to the possessor right away if the landlord with legitimate ownership doesn't pursue legal action for a period of 12 years or more. The guidelines established in this instance support the adverse possession theory even moreAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,A partition suit is a legal process that divides property among co-owners. In India, the partition of property is governed by theHindu Succession Act, 1956, and the Indian Partition Act, 1893. Any or all of the co-owners of a property can file a partition suit. The co-owners can be legal heirs also if it is a family property. Anyone having a share in the property which is intended to be partitioned can file the suit. In a recent ruling, the  Supreme Court ruled that each interested person is considered a plaintiff in a lawsuit seeking the division of joint property. This implies that no co-sharer may restrict another co-sharer from bringing a partition suit; rather, each co-sharer has the right to start and prosecute one. The Supreme Court is the last court to be approached if the decisions of all lower courts, including the Taluk, District, and High courts, are not to one's satisfaction.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Try to reach a mutually agreeable agreement with your present employment. If it's not clearly mentioned in the contract, ask them to explain the precise grounds for their refusal to take payment in lieu of notice. It seems that the extract you have provided does not indicate that you are misreading the contract. It lays out exactly how payments can be made in lieu of notice. Keep reaching out to your employer, stressing that you are willing to abide by the terms stated in the contract. Legal timetables might change depending on the court's availability, the jurisdiction, and the case's complexity. In the worst-case situation, your employer may file a lawsuit for breach of contract if you turn in office supplies and fail to show up for work after a set date. They might take legal action to recover damages you might have caused them by not giving them enough warning. Additionally, if you fail to adhere to your notice period duties, the corporation may withhold your relieving letter in certain circumstances. If you begin working for another company without giving notice, you may face legal repercussions, including accusations of breach of contract from your existing employer.

    "answer": "- As per Specific Relief Act, if any employee quits before the notice period, the Employer can only recover the Notice pay, and the Company cannot force to serve the entire notice period.- Further, the resignation decision is the employee’s decision, and the employer cannot sue for breach of contract, if the employee leaves without serving contractual notice.- Except, recovery of the said amount, company cannot harm you for the same- Further, no employer can refused to return the original certificates or to issue relieving letter .If they are doing so, their act is illegal, unjustified and against the fundamental rights of the employee.- Further, the employment bond with the negative covenant is valid and legally enforceable, if the parties agree with their free consent i.e. without force, coercion, undue influence, misrepresentation and mistake, but it is not enforceable, if it is either one sided, unconscionable or unreasonable.- Hence, you are free to joint other company after paying the notice period which is mentioned in the offer letter.- Send a notice to the said company to issue RL after receiving the payment of notice period.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Payment in lieu of notice period",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Try to reach a mutually agreeable agreement with your present employment. If it's not clearly mentioned in the contract, ask them to explain the precise grounds for their refusal to take payment in lieu of notice. It seems that the extract you have provided does not indicate that you are misreading the contract. It lays out exactly how payments can be made in lieu of notice. Keep reaching out to your employer, stressing that you are willing to abide by the terms stated in the contract. Legal timetables might change depending on the court's availability, the jurisdiction, and the case's complexity. In the worst-case situation, your employer may file a lawsuit for breach of contract if you turn in office supplies and fail to show up for work after a set date. They might take legal action to recover damages you might have caused them by not giving them enough warning. Additionally, if you fail to adhere to your notice period duties, the corporation may withhold your relieving letter in certain circumstances. If you begin working for another company without giving notice, you may face legal repercussions, including accusations of breach of contract from your existing employer. It can also affect your future employment opportunities and professional reputation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "RWA penalizing  tenant for previous dues by owner",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Should your rental agreement include that the landlord is responsible for maintenance costs and they have neglected to do so, you ought to notify the landlord that they are in violation of your agreement. Send your landlord a letter outlining the necessary payments for repairs. Give your landlord a deadline in a follow-up letter if you don't receive a satisfactory response to your initial correspondence. If you are still not happy with your landlord's response, you can send another letter letting him know that you plan to take the matter up with the local council in the event that he fails to pay the maintenance charge. It may be against the applicable housing society or apartment association rules and bylaws for homeowners in an apartment complex to neglect to pay maintenance fees. Depending on the kind of organisation, the state's Apartment Ownership Act or Cooperative Society Act may be violated if the apartment complex is registered under the applicable state legislation and maintenance fees are not paid. The organisation may pursue legal action against defaulters and is authorised by these Acts to levy maintenance fees from flat owners. In addition, the association has the authority to charge late fees or interest. Should the failure to pay maintenance fees continue, the association may pursue legal action against the defaulters, including bringing a lawsuit in civil court to recoup the unpaid balances. In these situations, the association may file a claim for recovery with the court and pursue legal action to recoup the outstanding funds, which may include selling and seizing the defaulter's assets.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Accordingly using any Using offensive language, physical aggression, refusal to cooperate with lawful orders, or any actions that hinder the police in carrying out their duties could be considered misbehavior. But in your case Both points mentioned may not necessarily amount to misbehavior. Police officers generally have the authority to detain individuals for questioning if they believe a crime has been committed. However, the use of force should be proportionate, and individuals have the right to know the reasons for their detention. And Petty cases are usually filed for minor offenses. Any behavior that violates local laws or regulations, even if it's a minor offense, could lead to the filing of a petty case. In this case where the conduct of police officer is found inappropriate you can go to a Police Station to Complain Against a Police Officer and always take a lawyer with you.

It is essential for the police to thoroughly document their findings during the additional investigation. The police, based on their independent investigation, can file a discharge application before the court. In this application, they can present their reasons for seeking the discharge of the accused. The police should highlight any new evidence or circumstances that have emerged during the additional investigation, which they believe justifies dropping the charges. The police can consult with the public prosecutor handling the case. The prosecutor may provide legal advice on the best course of action and may assist in presenting the case to the court. It is crucial to have a clear and strong legal argument for why the charges should be dropped. It's important to note that legal procedures can vary by jurisdiction, so consulting with legal professionals familiar with the local laws and practices is crucial.

This is often done to allow for further investigation or to address issues that may affect the case and, if the police are unable to gather sufficient evidence to proceed with the case, they may submit a discharge application. This is a request to the court to discharge the accused, effectively ending the legal proceedings against them. The grounds for discharge may include the lack of evidence, new facts emerging, or a determination that the alleged actions do not constitute a criminal offense.

Ensure that you have all relevant documents, such as transaction details, communication with the bank, and proof of your efforts to resolve the matter. If you have evidence that the recipient is not cooperating in returning the funds, you may need to consider legal action against the individual. where the wrong recipient is unresponsive or unwilling to return the funds, your bank generally reverts with a 'recovery unsuccessful’ message. At this point, your next plausible step would be legal recourse.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "The Uttar Pradesh Regulation of Urban Premises Tenancy Act, 2021",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Given that the renters are exhibiting appropriate behaviour, paying rent on schedule, and there is no evidence of damage or subletting, it may be difficult to discover grounds for eviction based on the information you have supplied. But still these grounds can be considered: You might be able to use non-payment or late rent as justification for eviction if there are any instances of late or unpaid rent. Verify whether the tenants have broken any particular clauses in the lease. This can involve making changes to the property without permission, doing things that aren't allowed under the lease, or breaking any other rules. If a renter needs the property for personal or family purposes, several laws permit landlords to evict them. But it appears that you have disregarded this. For significant repairs or renovations, landlords may have the right to evict tenants under specific circumstances. You have stated that the structure doesn't require significant repairs or demolition, though.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Such a suit is intended to get a formal legal ruling or determination from a court concerning a specific matter or query.

However, it's important to note that the court may impose certain conditions or costs while granting permission for withdrawal. also Order 23, Rule 1(3) of the CPC states that a plaintiff must request authorization from the court in its motion for withdrawal if they wish to leave the lawsuit and proceed with a new lawsuit over the same subject matter.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Yes, if Mr. B files a lawsuit for contempt of court within the relevant statute of limitations, the bank will be held liable for disobeying the Supreme Court's ruling.

Any behavior that violates local laws or regulations, even if it's a minor offense, could lead to the filing of a petty case.

The police should highlight any new evidence or circumstances that have emerged during the additional investigation, which they believe justifies dropping the charges. The police can consult with the public prosecutor handling the case. The prosecutor may provide legal advice on the best course of action and may assist in presenting the case to the court. It is crucial to have a clear and strong legal argument for why the charges should be dropped.

The police or prosecuting authorities may have the ability to request the court to stay proceedings temporarily. This is often done to allow for further investigation or to address issues that may affect the case and, if the police are unable to gather sufficient evidence to proceed with the case, they may submit a discharge application. This is a request to the court to discharge the accused, effectively ending the legal proceedings against them. The grounds for discharge may include the lack of evidence, new facts emerging, or a determination that the alleged actions do not constitute a criminal offense.

If the bank does not respond verbally, submit a written complaint to the bank's branch where you hold the account. Clearly state the details of the incorrect transaction and the steps you have taken to rectify the mistake. If the bank still does not address your issue, you can approach the Banking Ombudsman, an independent authority established by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to resolve banking-related complaints. Visit the RBI's official website to find the contact details and the procedure for filing a complaint with the Banking Ombudsman. If the issue persists, you can file a complaint with the consumer court. Ensure that you have all relevant documents, such as transaction details, communication with the bank, and proof of your efforts to resolve the matter. If you have evidence that the recipient is not cooperating in returning the funds, you may need to consider legal action against the individual. where the wrong recipient is unresponsive or unwilling to return the funds, your bank generally reverts with a 'recovery unsuccessful’ message.

    "question": "My elder brother not showing proof of our late father's plot's gift deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In a court of law, the deed may be contested by the declaration of a gift deed litigation. To find out if a gift deed can be revoked, the giver must, however, be able to demonstrate that the present was taken against their will and that there was improper influence or fraud. If a written document prepared for gifting property is absent, the legality of a gift deed is nullified. The written instrument is necessary to verify the title. The validity of a gift deed is unaffected by the size of the property. Any size and value of land or property can be gifted. A gift deed is void and subject to legal challenges if the consent for the gift transfer was not freely granted. If the gift deed was not executed and registered in compliance with legal requirements, it can be contested in court.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

While the court may not explicitly grant permission for further investigation, if the police believe it is necessary, they can proceed with it. It is essential for the police to thoroughly document their findings during the additional investigation. The police, based on their independent investigation, can file a discharge application before the court. In this application, they can present their reasons for seeking the discharge of the accused. The police should highlight any new evidence or circumstances that have emerged during the additional investigation, which they believe justifies dropping the charges. The police can consult with the public prosecutor handling the case. The prosecutor may provide legal advice on the best course of action and may assist in presenting the case to the court. It is crucial to have a clear and strong legal argument for why the charges should be dropped. It's important to note that legal procedures can vary by jurisdiction, so consulting with legal professionals familiar with the local laws and practices is crucial.

Conspicuously, it still did not confer such powers on the Magistrate to direct further and/or fresh investigation after submission of the final report by the Police. The police or prosecuting authorities may have the ability to request the court to stay proceedings temporarily. This is often done to allow for further investigation or to address issues that may affect the case and, if the police are unable to gather sufficient evidence to proceed with the case, they may submit a discharge application. This is a request to the court to discharge the accused, effectively ending the legal proceedings against them. The grounds for discharge may include the lack of evidence, new facts emerging, or a determination that the alleged actions do not constitute a criminal offense. The court will evaluate the discharge application and may grant it if it finds that there is insufficient evidence to proceed or if there are other valid reasons.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Refund of fees and NOC from advocate",
    "answer": "The practice for asking for a NOC is arbitrary under Article 22(1) of theConstitution of India. (It guarantees every person the right to consult and be defended by any legal practitioner of their choice.)A litigant must be free to change their advocate in case they are not able to pay the fees.party to a litigation has an absolute right to appoint an advocate of his choice, to terminate his services, and to appoint a new advocate. Hence, a party cannot be compelled to obtain 'no objection' from the advocate already on record. Insisting for 'no objection' from the previous advocate will amount to putting a restriction on the right of a party to appoint an advocate of his choice.Recently Karnataka high court has observed and held that .if the Advocate feels that he has any genuine claim or grievance against his client, the appropriate course is to return the brief with endorsement of no objection and agitate such right in an appropriate forum, in accordance with law and not indulge in arm twisting methods by holding on to the brief.\"It was  also held that :There is nothing known as irrevocable vakalatnama. The right of a party to withdraw vakalatnama or authorization given to an advocate is absolute. Hence, a party may discharge his advocate any time, with or without cause by withdrawing his vakalatnama or authorization. On discharging the advocate, the party has the right to have the case file returned to him from the advocate, and any refusal by the advocate to return the fileamounts to misconduct under Section 35 of the Advocates Act, 1961. In any proceeding, including civil and criminal, a party has an absolute right to appoint a new Advocate. Under no circumstance, a party can be denied of his right to appoint a new advocate of his choice. Therefore, it follows that any rule or law imposing restriction on the said right can't be construed as mandatory. Accordingly, Courts, Tribunals or otherauthorities shall not ask for 'no objection' of the advocate already on record, to accept the vakalatnama filed by a new advocate.under no circumstance, a party can be denied of his right to appoint a new advocate of his choice hence you can proceed through a new advocate.You can demand at least half of the huge fee paid by you, if he or she is refusing you may give a complaint against the advocate in the bar council of Karnataka.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Dear client,If your lawyer has not acted according to your expectations, you have the right to seek a change of lawyer. The NOC is not a necessary document to change your lawyer. You can change your lawyer at any point in time by giving a written notice to your existing lawyer. However, it is advisable to obtain a NOC from the lawyer to avoid any future disputes.Regarding the refund of fees, you should first check the terms of the agreement that you signed with the lawyer. If the agreement provides for a refund of fees in case the lawyer fails to perform his duties, then you can demand a refund of fees. If there is no such clause in the agreement, you can negotiate with the lawyer and try to settle the matter amicably. If the lawyer still refuses to refund your fees, you can file a complaint with the Bar Council of Karnataka.It is important to note that the delay in correcting the scrutiny defects by your lawyer could have affected the outcome of your case. Therefore, it is important to find a good and reliable lawyer who can handle your case efficiently. You can search for a lawyer in Karnataka who specializes in criminal law and has a good track record.

With regards to the trial court asking for the bond and sureties again, it is possible that they require a fresh bond and sureties as the previous ones were furnished at the police station and may not be valid for the trial court proceedings.As for finding sureties, you may try reaching out to friends or family members who reside in Bangalore and who may be willing to stand as sureties for you. Alternatively, you may also try contacting a bail bondsman or surety agency in Bangalore to help you with this.If you are unable to find sureties in Bangalore or are facing difficulty in arranging for them, you may also request the court for an exemption from the requirement of sureties or ask for a relaxation in the amount of bond and sureties required. However, it is important to note that such exemptions or relaxations are subject to the discretion of the court and may not always be granted.In case you decide to bring sureties from Gujarat, you may have to request the court for permission to do so and provide valid reasons for the same. The court may also require additional documents and information to verify the identity and credibility of the sureties.It is advisable to consult with your lawyer and follow their advice on how best to proceed in this matter.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Generally, you can voice your concerns in writing to the Chief Justice. But it's imperative that you always communicate in a proper, courteous manner. Give a detailed account of the problems you are having, the reasons for the delays in your case, and the effects they are having on your personal and work life. Provide pertinent papers to back up your assertions. Make sure your letter is factual, succinct, and formatted correctly to be addressed to a senior authority. Legal concerns are often handled via formal channels and court procedures. It's possible that your advocate will have to adhere to certain procedures, such sending letters or petitions via the court registry, instead of going directly to the Chief Justice.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Getting your expired Remote Control renewed as soon as possible is crucial. The traffic police will penalise you if they find you driving without a registration certificate or if it has expired. The ticket won't have an impact on the cost of future auto insurance, but the movement of your car will be restricted in most states. Before moving, registration must be renewed. Circulars pertaining to PUCs that mandate the scrapping of cars after 15 years are not eligible for renewal. The transfer of ownership might not occur even if you sell it. In order to get your car's RC cancelled, you must notify the RTO within 14 days of scrapping it. To ensure a seamless RC cancellation process in the event that your car is totaled, you should also obtain a comprehensive auto insurance coverage. It is imperative to renew the Registration Certificate before to its expiration date in order to prevent any penalties or fines, as mentioned in the certificate. There's a penalty fee associated with renewing it even if you've missed the deadline.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In accordance with the Code of Civil Procedure, it must be properly signed and validated. It is common practice to register complaints in Hindi, English, or any other regional language that has been designated as a state language. In accordance with the Bar Council of India Rules, the State Bar Council in which the advocate is enrolled is the appropriate party to receive a complaint against. After reviewing the complaint, the State Bar Council will decide what steps to take. At the Bar Council of India office, an appeal may be filed by the appellant, his lawyer, or a designated representative. To reach the Secretary of the Bar Council of India, it can also be submitted by registered mail. On or before the last day of limitation, the appeal must be filed. File the complaint on an affidavit, meaning on 100/-stamp paper with two extra copies. If there are more than one Advocate, add extra copies for each. The Indian Oaths Act permits a Notary or Magistrate to administer oaths, and this person must witness the properly sworn Affidavit.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Banks/Lenders often prefer transactions to be backed by clear and legally sound documents.

The accused's covert intention to assist with the proceedings is being monitored. Circumstances that prevented the accused from appearing in court as a representative. Gather any evidence that supports your claim of being present on the two hearing dates where the court marked you as absent.

    "question": "Refund of fees and NOC from advocate",
    "answer": "The practice for asking for a NOC is arbitrary under Article 22(1) of theConstitution of India. (It guarantees every person the right to consult and be defended by any legal practitioner of their choice.)A litigant must be free to change their advocate in case they are not able to pay the fees.party to a litigation has an absolute right to appoint an advocate of his choice, to terminate his services, and to appoint a new advocate. Hence, a party cannot be compelled to obtain 'no objection' from the advocate already on record. Insisting for 'no objection' from the previous advocate will amount to putting a restriction on the right of a party to appoint an advocate of his choice.Recently Karnataka high court has observed and held that .if the Advocate feels that he has any genuine claim or grievance against his client, the appropriate course is to return the brief with endorsement of no objection and agitate such right in an appropriate forum, in accordance with law and not indulge in arm twisting methods by holding on to the brief.\"It was  also held that :There is nothing known as irrevocable vakalatnama. The right of a party to withdraw vakalatnama or authorization given to an advocate is absolute. Hence, a party may discharge his advocate any time, with or without cause by withdrawing his vakalatnama or authorization. On discharging the advocate, the party has the right to have the case file returned to him from the advocate, and any refusal by the advocate to return the fileamounts to misconduct under Section 35 of the Advocates Act, 1961. In any proceeding, including civil and criminal, a party has an absolute right to appoint a new Advocate. Under no circumstance, a party can be denied of his right to appoint a new advocate of his choice. Therefore, it follows that any rule or law imposing restriction on the said right can't be construed as mandatory. Accordingly, Courts, Tribunals or otherauthorities shall not ask for 'no objection' of the advocate already on record, to accept the vakalatnama filed by a new advocate.under no circumstance, a party can be denied of his right to appoint a new advocate of his choice hence you can proceed through a new advocate.You can demand at least half of the huge fee paid by you, if he or she is refusing you may give a complaint against the advocate in the bar council of Karnataka.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Refund of fees and NOC from advocate",
    "answer": "Dear client,If your lawyer has not acted according to your expectations, you have the right to seek a change of lawyer. The NOC is not a necessary document to change your lawyer. You can change your lawyer at any point in time by giving a written notice to your existing lawyer. However, it is advisable to obtain a NOC from the lawyer to avoid any future disputes.Regarding the refund of fees, you should first check the terms of the agreement that you signed with the lawyer. If the agreement provides for a refund of fees in case the lawyer fails to perform his duties, then you can demand a refund of fees. If there is no such clause in the agreement, you can negotiate with the lawyer and try to settle the matter amicably. If the lawyer still refuses to refund your fees, you can file a complaint with the Bar Council of Karnataka.It is important to note that the delay in correcting the scrutiny defects by your lawyer could have affected the outcome of your case. Therefore, it is important to find a good and reliable lawyer who can handle your case efficiently. You can search for a lawyer in Karnataka who specializes in criminal law and has a good track record.

Alternatively, you may also try contacting a bail bondsman or surety agency in Bangalore to help you with this.If you are unable to find sureties in Bangalore or are facing difficulty in arranging for them, you may also request the court for an exemption from the requirement of sureties or ask for a relaxation in the amount of bond and sureties required. However, it is important to note that such exemptions or relaxations are subject to the discretion of the court and may not always be granted.In case you decide to bring sureties from Gujarat, you may have to request the court for permission to do so and provide valid reasons for the same.

    "answer": "Dear clientFor Mr. A:Regardless of any contempt of court issues, the bank may still pursue legal action under the Negotiable Instruments Act (NI Act) if Mr. A's checks bounce. Additionally, Mr. A may file a case for contempt of court against the bank for violating the Supreme Court order, as long as he does so within the applicable statute of limitations. The statute of limitations for bringing a contempt of court lawsuit varies based on the particulars and the relevant jurisdiction. Mr. A should speak with an attorney to find out when the statute of limitations will apply to his case. The bank may still take legal action under the NI Act for the returned checks, but the exact statute of limitations would rely on the nature of the loan agreement and the applicable legislation in the particular jurisdiction.For Mr. B:Yes, in the event that Mr. B's checks bounce, the bank may file a lawsuit under the NI Act, just like in Mr. A's case. Yes, if Mr. B files a lawsuit for contempt of court within the relevant statute of limitations, the bank will be held liable for disobeying the Supreme Court's ruling. Regardless of any potential contempt of court difficulties, both Mr. A and Mr. B are still legally required to repay the loan in accordance with the terms of their agreements with the bank. Legal repercussions, including possible bank enforcement measures, could follow nonpayment of the debt.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,When an application for the quashing of N.B.W. is entertained under section 482 Cr.P.C., the Hon'ble High Court has the authority to revoke non-bailable warrants. The following are the primary factors that the High Court may take into account in order to nullify the N.B.W. against the accused: that the applicant or accused has not been found to have committed any crimes.  There is a malicious intent behind the initiation of proceedings. The accused's covert intention to assist with the proceedings is being monitored. Circumstances that prevented the accused from appearing in court as a representative. Gather any evidence that supports your claim of being present on the two hearing dates where the court marked you as absent. This could include any documentation, records, or statements from witnesses who can testify to your presence. A charge sheet's ability to be amended after it has been filed can rely on the jurisdiction's particular rules and regulations and can be a complicated legal problem.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Documentation proving a person's or an organization's legal entitlement to own a certain asset or piece of real estate is known as proof of ownership. Depending on the kind of property, it may contain bills of sale, stock certificates, deeds, titles to real estate, and other pertinent paperwork. A registered sale deed a document that documents the buyer-seller exchange of real estate is the main document used in India to prove land ownership. The record of rights, which is a document that contains information about the property, property tax receipts, and survey documents are further documents that are used to prove ownership. These documents, however, merely serve as a record of the property transfer and do not confer a government-guaranteed title to the assets. In these kinds of deals, it is the buyer's responsibility to verify a property's previous ownership records. Because of this, land title in India is presumed and open to dispute based on these kinds of sale deeds.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Income tax guidelines for a poker player",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In order to pay taxes on winnings from online gaming, individuals who get income from such winnings are required to have TDS deducted from their net profits, as per Section 194BA of the Income Tax Act, 1961. After any entry fees are deducted, Section 194BA requires that TDS be deducted from each and every rupee won; these amounts are known as net wins. The Rs 10,000/-threshold will therefore not apply while deducting TDS. If there is any outstanding money in the user account that has not yet been withdrawn, TDS must be applied to net wins in compliance with the regulations at the conclusion of the fiscal year. TDS has to be taken out of the amount withdrawn when a user withdraws net winnings from their user account. But the total amount withdrawn during the fiscal year will have such TDS subtracted. If the TDS collected is more than what you owe to the government, you can get a TDS Refund. A taxpayer is obliged to file Income Tax Returns according to their slab. Taxpayers who fall inside the 5% tax bracket, for example, are eligible to receive a refund of TDS for any excess amount paid as TDS on investments or fixed deposit interest.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Pending final decision on such appeal, a local commissioner cannot be appointed for dividing the property by metes and bounds. If the appellate court rules against the heirs of your late brother and confirms the decision of the trial court, then because the children of the late brother are in possession, you will have to file a separate suit seeking partition and separate possession. The brother's suit i believe only sought for a declaration that he is the owner of the shop.2. to prevent the heirs of the brother creating any third party interest in the meanwhile, you can file an interim application in the pending appeal for restraining the heirs from creating third party interest in the shop3. as regards the house, all who are in favour of partition will have to jointly file a partition suit against the member who is refusing partition.

    "question": "Stamp duty in release deed and/ or gift deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Even though the legal ramifications are the same, a release deed differs greatly from a gift deed. The release deed can be drawn for cash consideration, unlike a gift deed. Every release entails a stake or interest in the property in question. There is typically a prior interest in the property held by the person in whose behalf the release is issued. With this tool, you can give another joint owner or co-owner your ownership interests in a piece of property. Transfers of this kind are final. Their main distinction is that a release deed ends a person's current rights over a specific piece of property, whereas a gift deed transfers ownership of a property to another party. A gift deed is only legally binding if it is registered, following theTransfer of Property Actof 1882. A gift deed's registration requires the donee and two witnesses to attest to it in addition to the donor's signature (required). Actually, the Gift Deed can only be enforced if it is filed with the registrar's office. In order to transfer the property as a gift, the donor must pay the stamp duty and registration fees because there is a monetary exchange involved, and the gift will be void if the donee clears it.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The police station's in-charge officer may only grant bail if there are no good reasons to suspect that the accused has committed a crime that is not subject to bail or if the alleged offence is not punishable by death or life in prison. Regular bail permits the accused to be freed from custody upon the execution of a bond, either with or without sureties; interim bail, on the other hand, allows the accused to be released from detention for a brief duration while their bail application is pending. For a crime that is not subject to bail, bail may be granted if the accused is a woman or a minor. In cases of non-bailable offences, bail may be granted in the absence of sufficient proof. Bail may be granted if the complainant fails to file a FIR on time.  In some situations, a court has the authority to revoke someone's bail. There are two ways that this might occur: either the police, the complainant, or another party who is impacted seeks it, or the court decides to act independently (Suo moto). Initially, a bail application needs to be submitted to the court with jurisdiction over the case by the accused or their representative. The causes for requesting bail as well as the justifications for doing so should be included in the bail application.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The traffic police will penalise you if they find you driving without a registration certificate or if it has expired. The ticket won't have an impact on the cost of future auto insurance, but the movement of your car will be restricted in most states. Before moving, registration must be renewed. Circulars pertaining to PUCs that mandate the scrapping of cars after 15 years are not eligible for renewal. The transfer of ownership might not occur even if you sell it. In order to get your car's RC cancelled, you must notify the RTO within 14 days of scrapping it. To ensure a seamless RC cancellation process in the event that your car is totaled, you should also obtain a comprehensive auto insurance coverage. It is imperative to renew the Registration Certificate before to its expiration date in order to prevent any penalties or fines, as mentioned in the certificate.

    "question": "On chargesheet",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The police station's in-charge officer may only grant bail if there are no good reasons to suspect that the accused has committed a crime that is not subject to bail or if the alleged offence is not punishable by death or life in prison. Regular bail permits the accused to be freed from custody upon the execution of a bond, either with or without sureties; interim bail, on the other hand, allows the accused to be released from detention for a brief duration while their bail application is pending. For a crime that is not subject to bail, bail may be granted if the accused is a woman or a minor. In cases of non-bailable offences, bail may be granted in the absence of sufficient proof. Bail may be granted if the complainant fails to file a FIR on time.  In some situations, a court has the authority to revoke someone's bail. There are two ways that this might occur: either the police, the complainant, or another party who is impacted seeks it, or the court decides to act independently (Suo moto). Initially, a bail application needs to be submitted to the court with jurisdiction over the case by the accused or their representative. The causes for requesting bail as well as the justifications for doing so should be included in the bail application.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can my father write WILL on Partitioned/inherited agricultural land in Karnataka",
    "answer": "Dear Client,An undivided property that belongs to four generations of a single family is known as an ancestral property. An ancestral property would cease to be an ancestral property once it was divided among the stakeholders and became a self-acquired property. The ancestral character of a property that has been divided or partitioned through a partition deed, family arrangement, etc., is lost. The condition for an ancestral property to be considered valid is that it should never have been split up or partitioned by family members. This is because each coparcener's share of the divided ancestral property becomes their own property. Following division, a coparcener's share of the ancestral property that remains after partition belongs to his male offspring. The Supreme Court held in this case as well that \"if an ancestral property is divided and is held by a single person, it must be treated as separate property. This person is then entitled to dispose of the coparcenary property, treating it as his separate property, but the alienation made prior to the birth cannot be questioned if a son is subsequently born.\" However, the property turns into a coparcenary asset the moment a son is born, and he will then gain a stake in it and become a coparcener. An ancestral property no longer qualifies as such once it has been divided among the family members. It is up to a father whether or not to leave his son his own property. This, however, does not apply to ancestral properties.With respect to ancestral property, the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 grants daughters the position of coparcener, granting them equal rights with their son. Before the 1956 modification, only male family members were coparceners, the originalHindu Succession Act's Section 6 had not mentioned a daughter's claim in a coparcenary property.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The traffic police will penalise you if they find you driving without a registration certificate or if it has expired. The ticket won't have an impact on the cost of future auto insurance, but the movement of your car will be restricted in most states. Before moving, registration must be renewed. Circulars pertaining to PUCs that mandate the scrapping of cars after 15 years are not eligible for renewal. The transfer of ownership might not occur even if you sell it. In order to get your car's RC cancelled, you must notify the RTO within 14 days of scrapping it. To ensure a seamless RC cancellation process in the event that your car is totaled, you should also obtain a comprehensive auto insurance coverage. It is imperative to renew the Registration Certificate before to its expiration date in order to prevent any penalties or fines, as mentioned in the certificate. There's a penalty fee associated with renewing it even if you've missed the deadline.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,A dishonoured check's drawer must get a formal notification, according to Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act of 1881. If the recipient of a cheque has not received the payment because of inadequate funds or for any other reason, this provision offers them a legal remedy. A dishonoured check's payee is required by Section 138 to notify the drawer in writing of the dishonoured check within 30 days of receiving it. The notification needs to be delivered either speed post or registered mail, and it needs to be acknowledged. The recipient has the right to sue the issuer for failing to pay the bill if the issuer declines to pay or if the bounced bill was done on purpose. A settlement can be negotiated and a payment schedule can be agreed upon by the parties to resolve the dispute. The payee may bring a criminal complaint against the drawer in accordance with Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act if the drawer does not make the payment within 15 days of receiving the notice. After the 15-day period has passed, the complaint must be submitted within 30 days. If a cheque drawer is found guilty under Section 138, he has the right to appeal the decision. The Appellate Court may, in such a situation, direct him to deposit a sum equal to at least 20% of the damages or fine that the trial court assessed, in accordance with Section 148. Issuing a cheque against an account that isn't fully funded could result in legal action for the payer. The payee has three months to decide whether to sue the payer or permit the payer to rewrite the cheque. If a cheque is returned unpaid, the payer faces a maximum two-year jail sentence.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Stamp duty in release deed and/ or gift deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Even though the legal ramifications are the same, a release deed differs greatly from a gift deed. The release deed can be drawn for cash consideration, unlike a gift deed. Every release entails a stake or interest in the property in question. There is typically a prior interest in the property held by the person in whose behalf the release is issued. With this tool, you can give another joint owner or co-owner your ownership interests in a piece of property. Transfers of this kind are final. Their main distinction is that a release deed ends a person's current rights over a specific piece of property, whereas a gift deed transfers ownership of a property to another party. A gift deed is only legally binding if it is registered, following theTransfer of Property Actof 1882. A gift deed's registration requires the donee and two witnesses to attest to it in addition to the donor's signature (required). Actually, the Gift Deed can only be enforced if it is filed with the registrar's office. In order to transfer the property as a gift, the donor must pay the stamp duty and registration fees because there is a monetary exchange involved, and the gift will be void if the donee clears it.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Property share",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Documentation proving a person's or an organization's legal entitlement to own a certain asset or piece of real estate is known as proof of ownership. Depending on the kind of property, it may contain bills of sale, stock certificates, deeds, titles to real estate, and other pertinent paperwork. A registered sale deed a document that documents the buyer-seller exchange of real estate is the main document used in India to prove land ownership. The record of rights, which is a document that contains information about the property, property tax receipts, and survey documents are further documents that are used to prove ownership. These documents, however, merely serve as a record of the property transfer and do not confer a government-guaranteed title to the assets. In these kinds of deals, it is the buyer's responsibility to verify a property's previous ownership records. Because of this, land title in India is presumed and open to dispute based on these kinds of sale deeds.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Nevertheless, the state in which the sale deed is being executed will determine the stamp duty that will be charged on it. In India, state-by-state variations exist in the stamp paper value required for the fulfilment of real estate sales agreements. The minimum amount of stamp paper needed, however, is Rs. 100 in the majority of states. When compared to a sale deed, the stamp duty that must be paid on an agreement to sell is typically smaller. Depending on the kind of transaction, the Rs 100 stamp paper has different legal significance.

    "answer": "Dear Client,The police station's in-charge officer may only grant bail if there are no good reasons to suspect that the accused has committed a crime that is not subject to bail or if the alleged offence is not punishable by death or life in prison. Regular bail permits the accused to be freed from custody upon the execution of a bond, either with or without sureties; interim bail, on the other hand, allows the accused to be released from detention for a brief duration while their bail application is pending. For a crime that is not subject to bail, bail may be granted if the accused is a woman or a minor. In cases of non-bailable offences, bail may be granted in the absence of sufficient proof. Bail may be granted if the complainant fails to file a FIR on time.  In some situations, a court has the authority to revoke someone's bail. There are two ways that this might occur: either the police, the complainant, or another party who is impacted seeks it, or the court decides to act independently (Suo moto). Initially, a bail application needs to be submitted to the court with jurisdiction over the case by the accused or their representative. The causes for requesting bail as well as the justifications for doing so should be included in the bail application.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Send your landlord a letter outlining the necessary payments for repairs. Give your landlord a deadline in a follow-up letter if you don't receive a satisfactory response to your initial correspondence. If you are still not happy with your landlord's response, you can send another letter letting him know that you plan to take the matter up with the local council in the event that he fails to pay the maintenance charge. It may be against the applicable housing society or apartment association rules and bylaws for homeowners in an apartment complex to neglect to pay maintenance fees. Depending on the kind of organisation, the state's Apartment Ownership Act or Cooperative Society Act may be violated if the apartment complex is registered under the applicable state legislation and maintenance fees are not paid. The organisation may pursue legal action against defaulters and is authorised by these Acts to levy maintenance fees from flat owners. In addition, the association has the authority to charge late fees or interest. Should the failure to pay maintenance fees continue, the association may pursue legal action against the defaulters, including bringing a lawsuit in civil court to recoup the unpaid balances. In these situations, the association may file a claim for recovery with the court and pursue legal action to recoup the outstanding funds, which may include selling and seizing the defaulter's assets.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Stamp duty in release deed and/ or gift deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Even though the legal ramifications are the same, a release deed differs greatly from a gift deed. The release deed can be drawn for cash consideration, unlike a gift deed. Every release entails a stake or interest in the property in question. There is typically a prior interest in the property held by the person in whose behalf the release is issued. With this tool, you can give another joint owner or co-owner your ownership interests in a piece of property. Transfers of this kind are final. Their main distinction is that a release deed ends a person's current rights over a specific piece of property, whereas a gift deed transfers ownership of a property to another party. A gift deed is only legally binding if it is registered, following theTransfer of Property Actof 1882. A gift deed's registration requires the donee and two witnesses to attest to it in addition to the donor's signature (required). Actually, the Gift Deed can only be enforced if it is filed with the registrar's office. In order to transfer the property as a gift, the donor must pay the stamp duty and registration fees because there is a monetary exchange involved, and the gift will be void if the donee clears it.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "On chargesheet",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The police station's in-charge officer may only grant bail if there are no good reasons to suspect that the accused has committed a crime that is not subject to bail or if the alleged offence is not punishable by death or life in prison. Regular bail permits the accused to be freed from custody upon the execution of a bond, either with or without sureties; interim bail, on the other hand, allows the accused to be released from detention for a brief duration while their bail application is pending. For a crime that is not subject to bail, bail may be granted if the accused is a woman or a minor. In cases of non-bailable offences, bail may be granted in the absence of sufficient proof. Bail may be granted if the complainant fails to file a FIR on time.  In some situations, a court has the authority to revoke someone's bail. There are two ways that this might occur: either the police, the complainant, or another party who is impacted seeks it, or the court decides to act independently (Suo moto). Initially, a bail application needs to be submitted to the court with jurisdiction over the case by the accused or their representative. The causes for requesting bail as well as the justifications for doing so should be included in the bail application.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Completed properties are not subject to GST when they are sold. An 18% tax rate is applied to the sale of freshly built or under construction commercial properties based on the property's worth. The developer or constructor of the commercial property is subject to this tax, which they must submit to the government for payment. Capital gains on the sale of real estate are subject to a 20% tax. The entire tax outlay for a net capital gain of Rs. 63,00,000 is Rs. 12,97,800. The amount of taxes that must be paid on this is substantial. Reinvesting the capital gains from the sale of a residential property is advised.

    "question": "Stamp duty in release deed and/ or gift deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Even though the legal ramifications are the same, a release deed differs greatly from a gift deed. The release deed can be drawn for cash consideration, unlike a gift deed. Every release entails a stake or interest in the property in question. There is typically a prior interest in the property held by the person in whose behalf the release is issued. With this tool, you can give another joint owner or co-owner your ownership interests in a piece of property. Transfers of this kind are final. Their main distinction is that a release deed ends a person's current rights over a specific piece of property, whereas a gift deed transfers ownership of a property to another party. A gift deed is only legally binding if it is registered, following theTransfer of Property Actof 1882. A gift deed's registration requires the donee and two witnesses to attest to it in addition to the donor's signature (required). Actually, the Gift Deed can only be enforced if it is filed with the registrar's office. In order to transfer the property as a gift, the donor must pay the stamp duty and registration fees because there is a monetary exchange involved, and the gift will be void if the donee clears it.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,A copy of the will, the original property documents, the property owner's death certificate, identification, and proof of address must be submitted by the legal heir (as defined by the will) in order to apply for a transfer of ownership. Consequently, in the event that your mother passed away without making a will, the house would be evenly divided between you and your siblings as legal heirs. The properties of the paternal ancestors cannot be sold without the consent of their descendants. Any number of people may register a Relinquishment Deed in favour of the selected party jointly or severally if they wish to give up their legal rights. Depending on the value of the immovable property, there may be little stamp duty and registration costs. The mutual approval of all remaining legal heirs is required before any deceased person's property can be sold. If a property is still mortgaged, it cannot be sold; in that case, new sale transactions must be completed with original documentation.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Nevertheless, the state in which the sale deed is being executed will determine the stamp duty that will be charged on it. In India, state-by-state variations exist in the stamp paper value required for the fulfilment of real estate sales agreements. The minimum amount of stamp paper needed, however, is Rs. 100 in the majority of states. When compared to a sale deed, the stamp duty that must be paid on an agreement to sell is typically smaller. Depending on the kind of transaction, the Rs 100 stamp paper has different legal significance.

    "question": "Income tax guidelines for a poker player",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In order to pay taxes on winnings from online gaming, individuals who get income from such winnings are required to have TDS deducted from their net profits, as per Section 194BA of the Income Tax Act, 1961. After any entry fees are deducted, Section 194BA requires that TDS be deducted from each and every rupee won; these amounts are known as net wins. The Rs 10,000/-threshold will therefore not apply while deducting TDS. If there is any outstanding money in the user account that has not yet been withdrawn, TDS must be applied to net wins in compliance with the regulations at the conclusion of the fiscal year. TDS has to be taken out of the amount withdrawn when a user withdraws net winnings from their user account. But the total amount withdrawn during the fiscal year will have such TDS subtracted. If the TDS collected is more than what you owe to the government, you can get a TDS Refund. A taxpayer is obliged to file Income Tax Returns according to their slab. Taxpayers who fall inside the 5% tax bracket, for example, are eligible to receive a refund of TDS for any excess amount paid as TDS on investments or fixed deposit interest.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

But still these grounds can be considered: You might be able to use non-payment or late rent as justification for eviction if there are any instances of late or unpaid rent. Verify whether the tenants have broken any particular clauses in the lease. This can involve making changes to the property without permission, doing things that aren't allowed under the lease, or breaking any other rules. If a renter needs the property for personal or family purposes, several laws permit landlords to evict them. But it appears that you have disregarded this.

    "answer": "Dear Client,The additional parking lot registration process is the same as the one for the apartment and parking lot you have already bought and registered. When an apartment sale deed is executed and registered, the customary process involves designating one covered or uncovered parking space for a sum of Rs. 1,00,000 for covered parking and Rs. 75,000 for uncovered parking. This amount is added to the consideration amount of the apartment and is subject to stamp duty. The buyer may take a chance and contact the builder for the sale of additional covered or uncovered parking if the developer has any that falls under his share. The only need is to have it separately registered.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The properties of the paternal ancestors cannot be sold without the consent of their descendants.

Depending on the value of the immovable property, there may be little stamp duty and registration costs. The mutual approval of all remaining legal heirs is required before any deceased person's property can be sold.

Nevertheless, the state in which the sale deed is being executed will determine the stamp duty that will be charged on it. In India, state-by-state variations exist in the stamp paper value required for the fulfilment of real estate sales agreements. The minimum amount of stamp paper needed, however, is Rs. 100 in the majority of states. When compared to a sale deed, the stamp duty that must be paid on an agreement to sell is typically smaller. Depending on the kind of transaction, the Rs 100 stamp paper has different legal significance.

    "answer": "Dear clientHandling a criminal complaint can be difficult, particularly if the complainant has not provided enough evidence or if there are questions about jurisdiction. As a precaution, it is usually advisable to file a bail petition for official records, particularly if there is a possibility of an arrest. It guarantees that you are ready in the event that the magistrate decides to order your arrest during the hearing. To bolster their case, the complainant ought to present pre-trial documentation. To adequately prepare your defence, your attorney can ask the opposing counsel for this material. The charges in the complaint, the gravity of the offences, and your financial situation are some of the variables that go into determining the bond amount. The magistrate's decision may be influenced by incomplete documentation. At the summons stage, the magistrate may set bail in accordance with the details in the complaint letter and any further arguments made during the hearing. Yes, the attorney is allowed to bring up these issues with the magistrate and ask the other side for pre-trial testimony.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the Indian judiciary is also endowed with the inherent authority to set aside a judgement or order that was gained by fraudulent means in court. Recall requests of orders are typically only maintainable under certain circumstances, such as where the order is without jurisdiction and the party against whom the order was issued has not received notice of the recall proceedings. Courts may review and recall their own rulings as part of their inherent authority under the Civil Procedure Code (CPC). This is why the scope of recall and review has been determined time and time again by the Honourable Supreme Court. The Supreme Court's ruling in the case of Asit Kumar Kar v. State of West Bengal & Ors may be relied upon in this regard. The court stated that in the case of a recall petition, \"the court does not go into merit but simply recalls the order which was passed without giving due opportunity of hearing to the affected party,\" and in the case of a review petition, the court considers \"the merit that the judgement has an error apparent on the face of the record.\"Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear clientHandling a criminal complaint can be difficult, particularly if the complainant has not provided enough evidence or if there are questions about jurisdiction. As a precaution, it is usually advisable to file a bail petition for official records, particularly if there is a possibility of an arrest. It guarantees that you are ready in the event that the magistrate decides to order your arrest during the hearing. To bolster their case, the complainant ought to present pre-trial documentation. To adequately prepare your defence, your attorney can ask the opposing counsel for this material. The charges in the complaint, the gravity of the offences, and your financial situation are some of the variables that go into determining the bond amount. The magistrate's decision may be influenced by incomplete documentation. At the summons stage, the magistrate may set bail in accordance with the details in the complaint letter and any further arguments made during the hearing. Yes, the attorney is allowed to bring up these issues with the magistrate and ask the other side for pre-trial testimony.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In order to pay taxes on winnings from online gaming, individuals who get income from such winnings are required to have TDS deducted from their net profits, as per Section 194BA of the Income Tax Act, 1961. After any entry fees are deducted, Section 194BA requires that TDS be deducted from each and every rupee won; these amounts are known as net wins. The Rs 10,000/-threshold will therefore not apply while deducting TDS. If there is any outstanding money in the user account that has not yet been withdrawn, TDS must be applied to net wins in compliance with the regulations at the conclusion of the fiscal year. TDS has to be taken out of the amount withdrawn when a user withdraws net winnings from their user account. But the total amount withdrawn during the fiscal year will have such TDS subtracted. If the TDS collected is more than what you owe to the government, you can get a TDS Refund. A taxpayer is obliged to file Income Tax Returns according to their slab. Taxpayers who fall inside the 5% tax bracket, for example, are eligible to receive a refund of TDS for any excess amount paid as TDS on investments or fixed deposit interest.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "The Uttar Pradesh Regulation of Urban Premises Tenancy Act, 2021",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Given that the renters are exhibiting appropriate behaviour, paying rent on schedule, and there is no evidence of damage or subletting, it may be difficult to discover grounds for eviction based on the information you have supplied. But still these grounds can be considered: You might be able to use non-payment or late rent as justification for eviction if there are any instances of late or unpaid rent. Verify whether the tenants have broken any particular clauses in the lease. This can involve making changes to the property without permission, doing things that aren't allowed under the lease, or breaking any other rules. If a renter needs the property for personal or family purposes, several laws permit landlords to evict them. But it appears that you have disregarded this. For significant repairs or renovations, landlords may have the right to evict tenants under specific circumstances.

    "answer": "Dear clientHandling a criminal complaint can be difficult, particularly if the complainant has not provided enough evidence or if there are questions about jurisdiction. As a precaution, it is usually advisable to file a bail petition for official records, particularly if there is a possibility of an arrest. It guarantees that you are ready in the event that the magistrate decides to order your arrest during the hearing. To bolster their case, the complainant ought to present pre-trial documentation. To adequately prepare your defence, your attorney can ask the opposing counsel for this material. The charges in the complaint, the gravity of the offences, and your financial situation are some of the variables that go into determining the bond amount. The magistrate's decision may be influenced by incomplete documentation. At the summons stage, the magistrate may set bail in accordance with the details in the complaint letter and any further arguments made during the hearing. Yes, the attorney is allowed to bring up these issues with the magistrate and ask the other side for pre-trial testimony.

    "question": "Income tax guidelines for a poker player",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In order to pay taxes on winnings from online gaming, individuals who get income from such winnings are required to have TDS deducted from their net profits, as per Section 194BA of the Income Tax Act, 1961. After any entry fees are deducted, Section 194BA requires that TDS be deducted from each and every rupee won; these amounts are known as net wins. The Rs 10,000/-threshold will therefore not apply while deducting TDS. If there is any outstanding money in the user account that has not yet been withdrawn, TDS must be applied to net wins in compliance with the regulations at the conclusion of the fiscal year. TDS has to be taken out of the amount withdrawn when a user withdraws net winnings from their user account. But the total amount withdrawn during the fiscal year will have such TDS subtracted. If the TDS collected is more than what you owe to the government, you can get a TDS Refund. A taxpayer is obliged to file Income Tax Returns according to their slab. Taxpayers who fall inside the 5% tax bracket, for example, are eligible to receive a refund of TDS for any excess amount paid as TDS on investments or fixed deposit interest.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can my father write WILL on Partitioned/inherited agricultural land in Karnataka",
    "answer": "Dear Client,An undivided property that belongs to four generations of a single family is known as an ancestral property. An ancestral property would cease to be an ancestral property once it was divided among the stakeholders and became a self-acquired property. The ancestral character of a property that has been divided or partitioned through a partition deed, family arrangement, etc., is lost. The condition for an ancestral property to be considered valid is that it should never have been split up or partitioned by family members. This is because each coparcener's share of the divided ancestral property becomes their own property. Following division, a coparcener's share of the ancestral property that remains after partition belongs to his male offspring. The Supreme Court held in this case as well that \"if an ancestral property is divided and is held by a single person, it must be treated as separate property. This person is then entitled to dispose of the coparcenary property, treating it as his separate property, but the alienation made prior to the birth cannot be questioned if a son is subsequently born.\" However, the property turns into a coparcenary asset the moment a son is born, and he will then gain a stake in it and become a coparcener. An ancestral property no longer qualifies as such once it has been divided among the family members. It is up to a father whether or not to leave his son his own property. This, however, does not apply to ancestral properties.With respect to ancestral property, the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 grants daughters the position of coparcener, granting them equal rights with their son. Before the 1956 modification, only male family members were coparceners, the originalHindu Succession Act's Section 6 had not mentioned a daughter's claim in a coparcenary property.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Ordinarily, in such cases, the authority concerned will have to give notice to the occupier of the building / structure or the person who has cultivated the land and take possession in the presence of independent witnesses and get their signatures on the panchanama. Of course, refusal of the owner of the land or building / structure may not lead to an inference that the possession of the acquired land had not been taken.iv)If the acquisition is of a large tract of land, it may not be possible for the acquiring / designated authority to take physical possession of each and every parcel of the land and it will be sufficient that symbolic possession is taken by preparing appropriate document in the presence of independent witnesses and getting their signatures on such document.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

The properties of the paternal ancestors cannot be sold without the consent of their descendants. Any number of people may register a Relinquishment Deed in favour of the selected party jointly or severally if they wish to give up their legal rights. Depending on the value of the immovable property, there may be little stamp duty and registration costs. The mutual approval of all remaining legal heirs is required before any deceased person's property can be sold.

    "question": "Dispute against Insurance company for rejecting claim in Hyderabad consumer court",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Direct grievance registration is available through the \"Bima Bharosa System,\" an online platform operated by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI). The main statutory authority that oversees and controls the insurance industry in India is the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA), which was established by the IRDA Act. By ensuring prompt resolution of insurance claims and the avoidance of fraud and malpractice by insurance companies, the Insurance Rights Development Association (IRDA) seeks to advance and safeguard the interests of policyholders in India. The Insurance Regulation and Development Authority (IRDA) established the Integrated Grievance Management System (IGMS) to facilitate online complaints against insurance companies. A distinct complaint ID is provided to the concerned department for dispute resolution when an insurance advocate in India files a complaint online on behalf of the policyholder. You may also lodge a complaint against an insurance provider with the Insurance Ombudsman, who is another entity to deal with. To complain to the insurance ombudsman, an individual or his legal heirs may do so. The insurance ombudsman may investigate the following types of insurance issues: rejection of an insurance claim, either in full or in part , disagreement on how much of the premium is paid or owed. Legal analysis and interpretation of an insurance policy in relation to a claim. postponement of insurance claim settlement. non-issuing of insurance following payment of the premium. You have one year from the date of an insurance claim's denial, refusal, or delay to register a complaint with the insurance ombudsman. You can file a complaint with the relevant consumer forum if the issue remains unresolved after you have tried the IRDA or the insurance ombudsman. In India, consumer forums are divided into three levels: District discussion forum if the insurance claim's total worth is less than Rs. 20 lakhs, a complaint may be made. State Commission if the total amount is more than Rs. 20 lakhs but less than Rs. 1 crore, a complaint may be filed. National Commission when the entire amount exceeds Rs. 1 crore, a complaint may be submitted.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

To find out if a gift deed can be revoked, the giver must, however, be able to demonstrate that the present was taken against their will and that there was improper influence or fraud. If a written document prepared for gifting property is absent, the legality of a gift deed is nullified. The written instrument is necessary to verify the title. The validity of a gift deed is unaffected by the size of the property. Any size and value of land or property can be gifted. A gift deed is void and subject to legal challenges if the consent for the gift transfer was not freely granted.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Address verification is not needed for any other accommodations the applicant may have had in the year prior to the application date. However, in order for police verification to take place, the applicant must provide the addresses of every place they have lived in the previous year. The passport will only bear the current address endorsement, not the permanent address. Both the permanent and current addresses will be verified by the police.

    "question": "Resale of property without OC received",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Residential properties covered in the affordable housing segment will be subject to a 1% GST charge without input tax credit. 12% GST is applied on real estate for under-construction properties. Completed properties are not subject to GST when they are sold. An 18% tax rate is applied to the sale of freshly built or under construction commercial properties based on the property's worth. The developer or constructor of the commercial property is subject to this tax, which they must submit to the government for payment. Capital gains on the sale of real estate are subject to a 20% tax. The entire tax outlay for a net capital gain of Rs. 63,00,000 is Rs. 12,97,800. The amount of taxes that must be paid on this is substantial. Reinvesting the capital gains from the sale of a residential property is advised. You must buy a new property either a year before or two years after the sale in order to be eligible for this exemption under Section 54 of the Income Tax Act, 1961.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

To find out if a gift deed can be revoked, the giver must, however, be able to demonstrate that the present was taken against their will and that there was improper influence or fraud. If a written document prepared for gifting property is absent, the legality of a gift deed is nullified. The written instrument is necessary to verify the title. The validity of a gift deed is unaffected by the size of the property. Any size and value of land or property can be gifted. A gift deed is void and subject to legal challenges if the consent for the gift transfer was not freely granted.

    "question": "Contempt case in high court was disposed of and dismissed, went for slp now u/s 151 in high court",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the Indian judiciary is also endowed with the inherent authority to set aside a judgement or order that was gained by fraudulent means in court. Recall requests of orders are typically only maintainable under certain circumstances, such as where the order is without jurisdiction and the party against whom the order was issued has not received notice of the recall proceedings. Courts may review and recall their own rulings as part of their inherent authority under the Civil Procedure Code (CPC). This is why the scope of recall and review has been determined time and time again by the Honourable Supreme Court. The Supreme Court's ruling in the case of Asit Kumar Kar v. State of West Bengal & Ors may be relied upon in this regard. The court stated that in the case of a recall petition, \"the court does not go into merit but simply recalls the order which was passed without giving due opportunity of hearing to the affected party,\" and in the case of a review petition, the court considers \"the merit that the judgement has an error apparent on the face of the record.\"Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Direct grievance registration is available through the \"Bima Bharosa System,\" an online platform operated by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI). The main statutory authority that oversees and controls the insurance industry in India is the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA), which was established by the IRDA Act. By ensuring prompt resolution of insurance claims and the avoidance of fraud and malpractice by insurance companies, the Insurance Rights Development Association (IRDA) seeks to advance and safeguard the interests of policyholders in India. The Insurance Regulation and Development Authority (IRDA) established the Integrated Grievance Management System (IGMS) to facilitate online complaints against insurance companies. A distinct complaint ID is provided to the concerned department for dispute resolution when an insurance advocate in India files a complaint online on behalf of the policyholder. You may also lodge a complaint against an insurance provider with the Insurance Ombudsman, who is another entity to deal with. To complain to the insurance ombudsman, an individual or his legal heirs may do so. The insurance ombudsman may investigate the following types of insurance issues: rejection of an insurance claim, either in full or in part , disagreement on how much of the premium is paid or owed. Legal analysis and interpretation of an insurance policy in relation to a claim. postponement of insurance claim settlement. non-issuing of insurance following payment of the premium. You have one year from the date of an insurance claim's denial, refusal, or delay to register a complaint with the insurance ombudsman. You can file a complaint with the relevant consumer forum if the issue remains unresolved after you have tried the IRDA or the insurance ombudsman. In India, consumer forums are divided into three levels: District discussion forum if the insurance claim's total worth is less than Rs. 20 lakhs, a complaint may be made. State Commission if the total amount is more than Rs. 20 lakhs but less than Rs. 1 crore, a complaint may be filed. National Commission when the entire amount exceeds Rs. 1 crore, a complaint may be submitted.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "The agreement to sub lease is not a title document hence you cannot claim title to the property unless you have a registered sale deed on your name .2. The builder cannot demand transfer charges from you if the property has been purchased by you by a registered sale deed and you are the absolute owner of the property, especially in the absence of a RWA.3. If the builder is not cooperating then you can take legal action by first sending him a legal notice demanding the relief you require and then escalate the matter legally.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "there seems to be a lot of confusion in your queryi would like to know whether the possession was given to you pursuant to a duly registered agreement for sale executed by the builder in your favour?if that is the case and possession is with you then obviously the allotment of the flat is done to the purchaser on 'ownership basis'so i am not able to understand for what the sub-lease agreement was madethe flat purchaser on being put in possession of the flat [for which i assume he has a registered agreement for sale in his favour] then there is no question at all for seeking noc of the builder to sell the flat or to pay him any transfer chargesthe flat purchaser can directly sell the flat to the purchaser of his choicethe builder cannot act like some landlord and collect transfer feealso since the possession is given i assume the OC must be receivedso once the OC is received and possession is given to majority flat purchasers who can form a society or association then the builder cannot hold up on the property till eternity...there are umpteen number of judgments of various high courts to that effectif the builder has not formed a society or an association of flat purchasers despite the minimum number of flat buyers required to form a society having taken their flats and has also not conveyed the property to such society, then the flat buyers can themselves form a society and apply to the competent authority for conveying the property to such societyso if the builder's time to exit the project has come but he has still held up onto it to collect transfer fee on transfer of flats, then despite there being any stipulation to that effect in the agreement with the flat buyer, such stipulation will be of no effect and will be merely a blanket consentYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Contempt case in high court was disposed of and dismissed, went for slp now u/s 151 in high court",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the Indian judiciary is also endowed with the inherent authority to set aside a judgement or order that was gained by fraudulent means in court. Recall requests of orders are typically only maintainable under certain circumstances, such as where the order is without jurisdiction and the party against whom the order was issued has not received notice of the recall proceedings. Courts may review and recall their own rulings as part of their inherent authority under the Civil Procedure Code (CPC). This is why the scope of recall and review has been determined time and time again by the Honourable Supreme Court. The Supreme Court's ruling in the case of Asit Kumar Kar v. State of West Bengal & Ors may be relied upon in this regard. The court stated that in the case of a recall petition, \"the court does not go into merit but simply recalls the order which was passed without giving due opportunity of hearing to the affected party,\" and in the case of a review petition, the court considers \"the merit that the judgement has an error apparent on the face of the record.\"Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In a court of law, the deed may be contested by the declaration of a gift deed litigation. To find out if a gift deed can be revoked, the giver must, however, be able to demonstrate that the present was taken against their will and that there was improper influence or fraud. If a written document prepared for gifting property is absent, the legality of a gift deed is nullified. The written instrument is necessary to verify the title. The validity of a gift deed is unaffected by the size of the property. Any size and value of land or property can be gifted. A gift deed is void and subject to legal challenges if the consent for the gift transfer was not freely granted. If the gift deed was not executed and registered in compliance with legal requirements, it can be contested in court.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Direct grievance registration is available through the \"Bima Bharosa System,\" an online platform operated by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI). The main statutory authority that oversees and controls the insurance industry in India is the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA), which was established by the IRDA Act. By ensuring prompt resolution of insurance claims and the avoidance of fraud and malpractice by insurance companies, the Insurance Rights Development Association (IRDA) seeks to advance and safeguard the interests of policyholders in India. The Insurance Regulation and Development Authority (IRDA) established the Integrated Grievance Management System (IGMS) to facilitate online complaints against insurance companies. A distinct complaint ID is provided to the concerned department for dispute resolution when an insurance advocate in India files a complaint online on behalf of the policyholder. You may also lodge a complaint against an insurance provider with the Insurance Ombudsman, who is another entity to deal with. To complain to the insurance ombudsman, an individual or his legal heirs may do so. The insurance ombudsman may investigate the following types of insurance issues: rejection of an insurance claim, either in full or in part , disagreement on how much of the premium is paid or owed. Legal analysis and interpretation of an insurance policy in relation to a claim. postponement of insurance claim settlement. non-issuing of insurance following payment of the premium. You have one year from the date of an insurance claim's denial, refusal, or delay to register a complaint with the insurance ombudsman. You can file a complaint with the relevant consumer forum if the issue remains unresolved after you have tried the IRDA or the insurance ombudsman. In India, consumer forums are divided into three levels: District discussion forum if the insurance claim's total worth is less than Rs. 20 lakhs, a complaint may be made. State Commission if the total amount is more than Rs. 20 lakhs but less than Rs. 1 crore, a complaint may be filed. National Commission when the entire amount exceeds Rs. 1 crore, a complaint may be submitted.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "1. the appellate court will now decide whether the shop is the self acquired property of your late brother or it is the joint family property in which all the heirs of your late father have an undivided interest. Pending final decision on such appeal, a local commissioner cannot be appointed for dividing the property by metes and bounds. If the appellate court rules against the heirs of your late brother and confirms the decision of the trial court, then because the children of the late brother are in possession, you will have to file a separate suit seeking partition and separate possession. The brother's suit i believe only sought for a declaration that he is the owner of the shop.2. to prevent the heirs of the brother creating any third party interest in the meanwhile, you can file an interim application in the pending appeal for restraining the heirs from creating third party interest in the shop3. as regards the house, all who are in favour of partition will have to jointly file a partition suit against the member who is refusing partition.

    "question": "Contempt case in high court was disposed of and dismissed, went for slp now u/s 151 in high court",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the Indian judiciary is also endowed with the inherent authority to set aside a judgement or order that was gained by fraudulent means in court. Recall requests of orders are typically only maintainable under certain circumstances, such as where the order is without jurisdiction and the party against whom the order was issued has not received notice of the recall proceedings. Courts may review and recall their own rulings as part of their inherent authority under the Civil Procedure Code (CPC). This is why the scope of recall and review has been determined time and time again by the Honourable Supreme Court. The Supreme Court's ruling in the case of Asit Kumar Kar v. State of West Bengal & Ors may be relied upon in this regard. The court stated that in the case of a recall petition, \"the court does not go into merit but simply recalls the order which was passed without giving due opportunity of hearing to the affected party,\" and in the case of a review petition, the court considers \"the merit that the judgement has an error apparent on the face of the record.\"Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,A dishonoured check's drawer must get a formal notification, according to Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act of 1881. If the recipient of a cheque has not received the payment because of inadequate funds or for any other reason, this provision offers them a legal remedy. A dishonoured check's payee is required by Section 138 to notify the drawer in writing of the dishonoured check within 30 days of receiving it. The notification needs to be delivered either speed post or registered mail, and it needs to be acknowledged. The recipient has the right to sue the issuer for failing to pay the bill if the issuer declines to pay or if the bounced bill was done on purpose. A settlement can be negotiated and a payment schedule can be agreed upon by the parties to resolve the dispute. The payee may bring a criminal complaint against the drawer in accordance with Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act if the drawer does not make the payment within 15 days of receiving the notice. After the 15-day period has passed, the complaint must be submitted within 30 days. If a cheque drawer is found guilty under Section 138, he has the right to appeal the decision. The Appellate Court may, in such a situation, direct him to deposit a sum equal to at least 20% of the damages or fine that the trial court assessed, in accordance with Section 148. Issuing a cheque against an account that isn't fully funded could result in legal action for the payer. The payee has three months to decide whether to sue the payer or permit the payer to rewrite the cheque. If a cheque is returned unpaid, the payer faces a maximum two-year jail sentence.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Muslim property partition",
    "answer": "1. the appellate court will now decide whether the shop is the self acquired property of your late brother or it is the joint family property in which all the heirs of your late father have an undivided interest. Pending final decision on such appeal, a local commissioner cannot be appointed for dividing the property by metes and bounds. If the appellate court rules against the heirs of your late brother and confirms the decision of the trial court, then because the children of the late brother are in possession, you will have to file a separate suit seeking partition and separate possession. The brother's suit i believe only sought for a declaration that he is the owner of the shop.2. to prevent the heirs of the brother creating any third party interest in the meanwhile, you can file an interim application in the pending appeal for restraining the heirs from creating third party interest in the shop3. as regards the house, all who are in favour of partition will have to jointly file a partition suit against the member who is refusing partition. An affidavit does not work for that.Please note that this forum is not for giving formats or for making predictions as regards how much time it will take for the court cases.Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "RWA penalizing  tenant for previous dues by owner",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Should your rental agreement include that the landlord is responsible for maintenance costs and they have neglected to do so, you ought to notify the landlord that they are in violation of your agreement. Send your landlord a letter outlining the necessary payments for repairs. Give your landlord a deadline in a follow-up letter if you don't receive a satisfactory response to your initial correspondence. If you are still not happy with your landlord's response, you can send another letter letting him know that you plan to take the matter up with the local council in the event that he fails to pay the maintenance charge. It may be against the applicable housing society or apartment association rules and bylaws for homeowners in an apartment complex to neglect to pay maintenance fees. Depending on the kind of organisation, the state's Apartment Ownership Act or Cooperative Society Act may be violated if the apartment complex is registered under the applicable state legislation and maintenance fees are not paid. The organisation may pursue legal action against defaulters and is authorised by these Acts to levy maintenance fees from flat owners. In addition, the association has the authority to charge late fees or interest. Should the failure to pay maintenance fees continue, the association may pursue legal action against the defaulters, including bringing a lawsuit in civil court to recoup the unpaid balances. In these situations, the association may file a claim for recovery with the court and pursue legal action to recoup the outstanding funds, which may include selling and seizing the defaulter's assets.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "1. the appellate court will now decide whether the shop is the self acquired property of your late brother or it is the joint family property in which all the heirs of your late father have an undivided interest. Pending final decision on such appeal, a local commissioner cannot be appointed for dividing the property by metes and bounds. If the appellate court rules against the heirs of your late brother and confirms the decision of the trial court, then because the children of the late brother are in possession, you will have to file a separate suit seeking partition and separate possession. The brother's suit i believe only sought for a declaration that he is the owner of the shop.2. to prevent the heirs of the brother creating any third party interest in the meanwhile, you can file an interim application in the pending appeal for restraining the heirs from creating third party interest in the shop3. as regards the house, all who are in favour of partition will have to jointly file a partition suit against the member who is refusing partition. An affidavit does not work for that.Please note that this forum is not for giving formats or for making predictions as regards how much time it will take for the court cases.Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Should your rental agreement include that the landlord is responsible for maintenance costs and they have neglected to do so, you ought to notify the landlord that they are in violation of your agreement. Send your landlord a letter outlining the necessary payments for repairs. Give your landlord a deadline in a follow-up letter if you don't receive a satisfactory response to your initial correspondence. If you are still not happy with your landlord's response, you can send another letter letting him know that you plan to take the matter up with the local council in the event that he fails to pay the maintenance charge. It may be against the applicable housing society or apartment association rules and bylaws for homeowners in an apartment complex to neglect to pay maintenance fees. Depending on the kind of organisation, the state's Apartment Ownership Act or Cooperative Society Act may be violated if the apartment complex is registered under the applicable state legislation and maintenance fees are not paid. The organisation may pursue legal action against defaulters and is authorised by these Acts to levy maintenance fees from flat owners. In addition, the association has the authority to charge late fees or interest. Should the failure to pay maintenance fees continue, the association may pursue legal action against the defaulters, including bringing a lawsuit in civil court to recoup the unpaid balances. In these situations, the association may file a claim for recovery with the court and pursue legal action to recoup the outstanding funds, which may include selling and seizing the defaulter's assets.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If the recipient of a cheque has not received the payment because of inadequate funds or for any other reason, this provision offers them a legal remedy. A dishonoured check's payee is required by Section 138 to notify the drawer in writing of the dishonoured check within 30 days of receiving it. The notification needs to be delivered either speed post or registered mail, and it needs to be acknowledged. The recipient has the right to sue the issuer for failing to pay the bill if the issuer declines to pay or if the bounced bill was done on purpose. A settlement can be negotiated and a payment schedule can be agreed upon by the parties to resolve the dispute. The payee may bring a criminal complaint against the drawer in accordance with Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act if the drawer does not make the payment within 15 days of receiving the notice. After the 15-day period has passed, the complaint must be submitted within 30 days. If a cheque drawer is found guilty under Section 138, he has the right to appeal the decision. The Appellate Court may, in such a situation, direct him to deposit a sum equal to at least 20% of the damages or fine that the trial court assessed, in accordance with Section 148. Issuing a cheque against an account that isn't fully funded could result in legal action for the payer. The payee has three months to decide whether to sue the payer or permit the payer to rewrite the cheque. If a cheque is returned unpaid, the payer faces a maximum two-year jail sentence.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The Sale Agreement, any relevant prior sales agreements, and a No Objection Certificate (in the event that a resale has taken place) are other crucial documents.

    "question": "Can my father write WILL on Partitioned/inherited agricultural land in Karnataka",
    "answer": "Dear Client,An undivided property that belongs to four generations of a single family is known as an ancestral property. An ancestral property would cease to be an ancestral property once it was divided among the stakeholders and became a self-acquired property. The ancestral character of a property that has been divided or partitioned through a partition deed, family arrangement, etc., is lost. The condition for an ancestral property to be considered valid is that it should never have been split up or partitioned by family members. This is because each coparcener's share of the divided ancestral property becomes their own property. Following division, a coparcener's share of the ancestral property that remains after partition belongs to his male offspring. The Supreme Court held in this case as well that \"if an ancestral property is divided and is held by a single person, it must be treated as separate property. This person is then entitled to dispose of the coparcenary property, treating it as his separate property, but the alienation made prior to the birth cannot be questioned if a son is subsequently born.\" However, the property turns into a coparcenary asset the moment a son is born, and he will then gain a stake in it and become a coparcener. An ancestral property no longer qualifies as such once it has been divided among the family members. It is up to a father whether or not to leave his son his own property. This, however, does not apply to ancestral properties.With respect to ancestral property, the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 grants daughters the position of coparcener, granting them equal rights with their son. Before the 1956 modification, only male family members were coparceners, the originalHindu Succession Act's Section 6 had not mentioned a daughter's claim in a coparcenary property.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Property share",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Documentation proving a person's or an organization's legal entitlement to own a certain asset or piece of real estate is known as proof of ownership. Depending on the kind of property, it may contain bills of sale, stock certificates, deeds, titles to real estate, and other pertinent paperwork. A registered sale deed a document that documents the buyer-seller exchange of real estate is the main document used in India to prove land ownership. The record of rights, which is a document that contains information about the property, property tax receipts, and survey documents are further documents that are used to prove ownership. These documents, however, merely serve as a record of the property transfer and do not confer a government-guaranteed title to the assets. In these kinds of deals, it is the buyer's responsibility to verify a property's previous ownership records. Because of this, land title in India is presumed and open to dispute based on these kinds of sale deeds.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It represents the completion of the deal and is the definitive proof of the property's sale. Before the execution date, the sale deed must be signed on defined-value non-judicial stamp paper and registered with the appropriate office, such as the Sub-Registrar of Assurance, within four months. In order for the transfer of ownership to be upheld in court, it needs to be registered. Documents needed for the sale deed process include the draft title deed, the sharing agreement between the builder and the owner (if applicable), the power of attorney (if granted), the official blueprint, the housing board's allocation letter (if applicable), and the original property papers from the bank, if there are any outstanding loans. The Sale Agreement, any relevant prior sales agreements, and a No Objection Certificate (in the event that a resale has taken place) are other crucial documents. Encumbrance certificates, completion certificates, property tax receipts, identification documents from all parties involved, including witnesses, and passport-size photos of them are essential for verification.

    "question": "Can my father write WILL on Partitioned/inherited agricultural land in Karnataka",
    "answer": "Dear Client,An undivided property that belongs to four generations of a single family is known as an ancestral property. An ancestral property would cease to be an ancestral property once it was divided among the stakeholders and became a self-acquired property. The ancestral character of a property that has been divided or partitioned through a partition deed, family arrangement, etc., is lost. The condition for an ancestral property to be considered valid is that it should never have been split up or partitioned by family members. This is because each coparcener's share of the divided ancestral property becomes their own property. Following division, a coparcener's share of the ancestral property that remains after partition belongs to his male offspring. The Supreme Court held in this case as well that \"if an ancestral property is divided and is held by a single person, it must be treated as separate property. This person is then entitled to dispose of the coparcenary property, treating it as his separate property, but the alienation made prior to the birth cannot be questioned if a son is subsequently born.\" However, the property turns into a coparcenary asset the moment a son is born, and he will then gain a stake in it and become a coparcener. An ancestral property no longer qualifies as such once it has been divided among the family members. It is up to a father whether or not to leave his son his own property. This, however, does not apply to ancestral properties.With respect to ancestral property, the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 grants daughters the position of coparcener, granting them equal rights with their son. Before the 1956 modification, only male family members were coparceners, the originalHindu Succession Act's Section 6 had not mentioned a daughter's claim in a coparcenary property.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Agreement to Sale",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The final and irreversible legal document that transfers ownership of the property from the seller to the buyer is called a sales deed agreement, sometimes referred to as a conveyance deed or a title deed. It represents the completion of the deal and is the definitive proof of the property's sale. Before the execution date, the sale deed must be signed on defined-value non-judicial stamp paper and registered with the appropriate office, such as the Sub-Registrar of Assurance, within four months. In order for the transfer of ownership to be upheld in court, it needs to be registered. Documents needed for the sale deed process include the draft title deed, the sharing agreement between the builder and the owner (if applicable), the power of attorney (if granted), the official blueprint, the housing board's allocation letter (if applicable), and the original property papers from the bank, if there are any outstanding loans. The Sale Agreement, any relevant prior sales agreements, and a No Objection Certificate (in the event that a resale has taken place) are other crucial documents. Encumbrance certificates, completion certificates, property tax receipts, identification documents from all parties involved, including witnesses, and passport-size photos of them are essential for verification. Possession letter, Occupancy Certificate, and Stamp Duty Receipt.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can my father write WILL on Partitioned/inherited agricultural land in Karnataka",
    "answer": "Dear Client,An undivided property that belongs to four generations of a single family is known as an ancestral property. An ancestral property would cease to be an ancestral property once it was divided among the stakeholders and became a self-acquired property. The ancestral character of a property that has been divided or partitioned through a partition deed, family arrangement, etc., is lost. The condition for an ancestral property to be considered valid is that it should never have been split up or partitioned by family members. This is because each coparcener's share of the divided ancestral property becomes their own property. Following division, a coparcener's share of the ancestral property that remains after partition belongs to his male offspring. The Supreme Court held in this case as well that \"if an ancestral property is divided and is held by a single person, it must be treated as separate property. This person is then entitled to dispose of the coparcenary property, treating it as his separate property, but the alienation made prior to the birth cannot be questioned if a son is subsequently born.\" However, the property turns into a coparcenary asset the moment a son is born, and he will then gain a stake in it and become a coparcener. An ancestral property no longer qualifies as such once it has been divided among the family members. It is up to a father whether or not to leave his son his own property. This, however, does not apply to ancestral properties.With respect to ancestral property, the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 grants daughters the position of coparcener, granting them equal rights with their son. Before the 1956 modification, only male family members were coparceners, the originalHindu Succession Act's Section 6 had not mentioned a daughter's claim in a coparcenary property.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can my father write WILL on Partitioned/inherited agricultural land in Karnataka",
    "answer": "Dear Client,An undivided property that belongs to four generations of a single family is known as an ancestral property. An ancestral property would cease to be an ancestral property once it was divided among the stakeholders and became a self-acquired property. The ancestral character of a property that has been divided or partitioned through a partition deed, family arrangement, etc., is lost. The condition for an ancestral property to be considered valid is that it should never have been split up or partitioned by family members. This is because each coparcener's share of the divided ancestral property becomes their own property. Following division, a coparcener's share of the ancestral property that remains after partition belongs to his male offspring. The Supreme Court held in this case as well that \"if an ancestral property is divided and is held by a single person, it must be treated as separate property. This person is then entitled to dispose of the coparcenary property, treating it as his separate property, but the alienation made prior to the birth cannot be questioned if a son is subsequently born.\" However, the property turns into a coparcenary asset the moment a son is born, and he will then gain a stake in it and become a coparcener. An ancestral property no longer qualifies as such once it has been divided among the family members. It is up to a father whether or not to leave his son his own property. This, however, does not apply to ancestral properties.With respect to ancestral property, the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 grants daughters the position of coparcener, granting them equal rights with their son. Before the 1956 modification, only male family members were coparceners, the originalHindu Succession Act's Section 6 had not mentioned a daughter's claim in a coparcenary property.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It represents the completion of the deal and is the definitive proof of the property's sale. Before the execution date, the sale deed must be signed on defined-value non-judicial stamp paper and registered with the appropriate office, such as the Sub-Registrar of Assurance, within four months. In order for the transfer of ownership to be upheld in court, it needs to be registered. Documents needed for the sale deed process include the draft title deed, the sharing agreement between the builder and the owner (if applicable), the power of attorney (if granted), the official blueprint, the housing board's allocation letter (if applicable), and the original property papers from the bank, if there are any outstanding loans. The Sale Agreement, any relevant prior sales agreements, and a No Objection Certificate (in the event that a resale has taken place) are other crucial documents. Encumbrance certificates, completion certificates, property tax receipts, identification documents from all parties involved, including witnesses, and passport-size photos of them are essential for verification.

Once the plaintiff establishes his entitlement to the legal character or right to property, he still has to persuade the court that the defendant has denied or is motivated to deny the plaintiff's legal character or right in declaratory cases. Declaratory cases are a useful and significant remedy since they aim to remove the current source of conflict and avert future litigation. As per Article 58 of the Limitation Act, 1963, one has three years from the day the right 'first' accrued to obtain a declaration.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Safe guarding myself and my old parents  from Mentally torturing wife",
    "answer": "Dear Client,According to the Guardian and Ward Act of 1890, the child's welfare is of utmost significance, and courts with competent authority work to strike a balance between the two. Moreover, just because one parent is granted custody of the kids doesn't mean that the other parent is cut off from communication or visitation rights. The courts in India ensure that the child receives the love and care of both parents. The other parent is granted visitation privileges by the court, with the court setting the terms. The Hon'ble Supreme Court and other Indian courts have stated time and time again that the minor's welfare is the only factor taken into account when deciding who gets custody of them, regardless of the claims of the parties to the custody of children.A course of unprovoked and abusive behaviour towards one's spouse that results in unbearable humiliation, distress, and misery is referred to as mental cruelty. This behaviour harms the complainant's physical and mental health and makes it impracticable for the complainant to preserve their marital status. The type of cruel treatment, the psychological effects on the spouse, and whether or not it makes the spouse reasonably fear that living with the other spouse would be \"harmful\" or \"injurious\" are all important factors to consider when determining whether or not something qualifies as mental cruelty. Therefore, the determination of cruelty is essentially an inferential process that involves considering the characteristics of the behaviour and its impact on the spouse who is lodging the complaint.  The court stated that in handling these kinds of cruelty charges, it is crucial that the court refrain from looking for a universal standard of cruelty because cruelty in one instance might not be cruelty in another. It is necessary to take into account the parties' \"economic and social conditions,\" \"culture and human values to which they attach importance,\" and the type of living to which the parties are accustomed.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "In India, apartment car parking laws are governed by the RERA Act of 2016. According to this act,builders can sell covered garage space separately. However, open or stilt parking spaces are considered common amenities, like a lobby, stairs, and garden, and cannot be charged for separately.This is not a covered parking space hence the builder cannot sell the parking space.The right to use is not a sale transaction.Once the builder hands over the common areas to the RWA, then the entire common areas belong to the RWA only.The Supreme Court's decision reaffirmed thatparking spaces are common facilities provided by society and cannot be sold separately.The buyer-seller agreement is a legally binding contract between you and the builder.If the agreement specifically mentions that you have purchased an exclusive right to use a covered car parking space, then the builder is obligated to add this to the sale deed.Your RWA  has got rights to eject the right to use letter issued by the builder.  In fact the right to use letter says only right to use and not a sale deed, besides once the common areas have been handed over the builder ceases all  rights in the common areas of the  apartments.You may better take action now itself to retrieve your money given for purchasing the additional car parking space.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Dear Client,A supreme court judgment ruled that NRI landlord need not be physically present in country to initiate proceedings against under East Punjab Urban Rest Construction Act. Even though there is no case law for Pune separately, you will have a strong precedent to justify that physical presence is not needed for filing an eviction proceeding. Considering that you want to use the house for your personal purpose and the tenant is not paying rent, filing an eviction suit is appropriate. Mandatory physical presence is not required.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Right to use letter from builder for a basement car parking.",
    "answer": "In India, apartment car parking laws are governed by the RERA Act of 2016. According to this act,builders can sell covered garage space separately. However, open or stilt parking spaces are considered common amenities, like a lobby, stairs, and garden, and cannot be charged for separately.This is not a covered parking space hence the builder cannot sell the parking space.The right to use is not a sale transaction.Once the builder hands over the common areas to the RWA, then the entire common areas belong to the RWA only.The Supreme Court's decision reaffirmed thatparking spaces are common facilities provided by society and cannot be sold separately.The buyer-seller agreement is a legally binding contract between you and the builder.If the agreement specifically mentions that you have purchased an exclusive right to use a covered car parking space, then the builder is obligated to add this to the sale deed.Your RWA  has got rights to eject the right to use letter issued by the builder.  In fact the right to use letter says only right to use and not a sale deed, besides once the common areas have been handed over the builder ceases all  rights in the common areas of the  apartments.You may better take action now itself to retrieve your money given for purchasing the additional car parking space.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

As mentioned above, if the right to use letter contains all the provisions of a valid contract, it will be deemed as a valid legal document by RWA. But in any case, obtaining a sale deed will secure your property to the fullest as it will provide a proof for the transfer of full ownership over such property. As far as the possibility of RWA taking over your property is concerned, you will have a strong proof to show the consumer court the payment details of the transaction, considering the transaction is an online one.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It is best to return to the trial court and request permission to travel.Permission to travel may not always be granted by the trial court in a timely manner. It relies on a number of things, such as the volume of cases and the workings of the court.You might look into alternate conflict resolution procedures like mediation or arbitration if the opposing party isn't open to negotiating.The particulars of your case and the court's discretion may determine the amount of bail that is necessary, if any.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Will deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Locate the will. Should the decedent name you as their executor, you will have a deadline for locating and filing the decedent's will upon their passing. Should you be designated administrator, you will need to submit the will to the court following your appointment. Determining and safeguarding the estate's assets is one of your responsibilities as the administrator. You will need to take custody of property and make sure it is kept safe by using your authority as administrator or executor in order to collect property. Following the acquisition of the property, you will need to inventory it. You may be asked to file an inventory form with the court as proof that you have finished this work successfully. Every item of property will be listed on the inventory form along with its value and a description.Give creditors the opportunity to file claims. You must settle the debts of the deceased in priority order when using the estate's assets to pay them off. If the estate does not have enough money to cover the debts, you will need to sell assets to raise the money. Paying off outstanding obligations owed to the deceased is a part of overseeing the estate. You must let people who owed the deceased person money know that they are obliged to pay the estate. A letter to this effect should be sent to debtors, and copies should be retained on file. You must file all applicable tax returns on behalf of the estate and the dead as the administrator or executor. Section 159 of the Income Tax Act states that in the event of a person's death, his or her legal representatives would be responsible for paying any amount that the deceased would have been responsible for paying in the same way and to the same degree as the deceased.You must distribute the remaining assets to each of the decedent's beneficiaries once all obligations have been settled and all property has been gathered. In the event that a will exists, you will allocate the assets in accordance with its wishes. You shall divide the remaining assets in accordance with the relevant succession laws if the decedent passed away intestate. Make a final accounting. You may be required to provide a final accounting to the court once the estate has been managed through to conclusion. A final account is a comprehensive record of the assets acquired, the debts settled, and the distributions given. The account must balance when you present it to the judge.The following criteria typically influence registration fees, which are not fixed in general: States may have different registration costs based on their own laws and regulations.

    "answer": "Dear Client,The property that could be developed into homes was first referred to as Grama Natham. It was also designed to help separate residential areas more clearly from government-owned territory, including Badlands, Pannai Lands, Ryotwari Lands, and Inam Lands. Grama Natham is the term for the barren and underutilised terrain that is found outside of towns like Chennai. This is a plot of land that isn't actually owned by anyone. Such land is not legally proven to be owned. Grama Natham's land may only be utilised for non-commercial, residential uses. There is almost little room for future growth and no social infrastructure in the area. Land in the Grama Natham style is frequently more affordable, particularly in Chennai's suburbs. Acquiring Patta for Grama Natham land in Chennai is a difficult task. To follow their shared process, you will need to attend the village administration office. You will receive procedure guidance from the officials. Land in Natham is restricted to residential usage.
