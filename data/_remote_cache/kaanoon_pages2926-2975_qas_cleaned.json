But it is not possible for me to comment on all of that without the full facts of the case.2.A determination that a person has breached s. 16 is indeed appealable. The appeal has to be filed with the Appellate Authority notified by the government under clause (a) of section 2 of the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946 (20 of 1946). This its as per rule 11 of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Rules, 2013. The appeal is to be filed within 90 days of the recommendations sought to be challenged (i.e., the recommendation that Subject be punished for breach of S. 16).The Maharashtra Government has designated Industrial Courts constituted under section 10 of the Maharashtra Industrial Relations Act (XI of 1947) as the \"Appellate Authority.\" There are about twenty Industrial Courts in Maharashtra: Pune, Mumbai, Dhule, Nagpur, Thane, Kolhapur, Nashik, A u r a n g a b a d , A m a r a v a t i , Ahmednagar, Solapur, Jalna, Akola, Yavatmal, Satara, Jalgaon, Chandrapur, Bhandara, Sangali and Latur.The Subject is therefore advised to forthwith file an appeal with the appropriate Industrial Court. They can then have any adverse findings and recommendations overturned. Needless to say a successful appeal would give their tormentors pause.Hope that answers your question.Pulkit ChandnaAdvocate, New Delhi208 Answers5 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Pulkit Chandna"

Inheritance of property means  succession,the devolution of property on an heir or heirs upon the death of the owner.It is a process which involves the passing on of material property from one generation to another, usually within the family, generally from older parents (donors) to their adult children (heirs), which is completed after the death of the older generation.Thus inheritance happens only after the death of the property owner (be it self acquired or his/her own inherited property).

    "answer": "DearSorry to hear about your situation.You have two three options here:-1. You can  first file a petition forrestitution of conjugal rights. Your wife will be ordered to live with you. If she doesn't follow that order and live with you for an year, you can file a petition for divorce.2. You can file a petition for judicial separation and after one year of passing of decree of judicial separation you can file for divorce.3. You can file a case for divorce against your wife if there are any grounds for cruelty. To establish these facts it is important to know all facts and I cannot give an opinion here without knowing it all.4. If your wife also wants a divorce, you can file a petition for mutual divorce also known as no fault divorce and in that terms of the divorce will have to be agreed between you and your wife. This is the fastest and best method but obviously this happens rarely as divorce proceedings are contested by parties.Please note, you should have access to documents which show what your wife is earning right now. Do that before you tell her about your intention to file for divorce. Maintenance and Alimony is a hotly contested issue in divorce proceedings and you would certainly require all the paperwork. Bank Statements, IT returns, Salary Slip, Appointment Letter of workplace, proof of lavish lifestyle, etc.Hope this helps.RegardsAbhiraj JayantAbhiraj JayantAdvocate, Delhi50 Answers1 ConsultationTalk to Advocate Abhiraj Jayant"

    "answer": "Hello,Correct me if I am wrong. Your wife refuses to live with your parents and she’d rather the two of you lived alone or with her parents?If my reading of your factual narration is correct, your wife could be guilty of treating you with cruelty. To try and separate her husband from his parents is a form of cruelty in the eyes of India law — more so when the parents are counting on the son’s support.Cruelty is one of the grounds of divorce under theHindu Marriage Act(the statute applicable to you). For now, it appears to be the most appropriate. The advice may stand altered if and when more details become known.She could bring a maintenance action against you. And if she is really spiteful (presuming nothing here), she could file a complaint under the DV Act or a criminal complaint against you. Again, I don’t know enough to give you specific advice on this score.You will do well to preserve all evidence (electronic or otherwise) that might help you establish the things you have described here, namely: (a) you’ve indulged her throughout, (b) she has been uninterested in returning the favour, (c) she has tried to separate you from your parents who need you, and (d) she has left you of her own volition without any provocation from your side.In case, you still want to give it a final try. You could approach a court here in Delhi and seek the “restitution of conjugal rights.” It is a court decree asking the respondent (your wife) to return to the petitioner (husband).  While it cannot be enforced, it can often get the job done by bringing the couple back together. It is also used by husbands to establish good faith on their part and to show they have been abandoned (and not the other way ‘round). This can help in maintenance cases.Hope that answers your question.Pulkit ChandnaAdvocate, New Delhi208 Answers5 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Pulkit Chandna"

    "question": "Unfair harassment by ICC committee",
    "answer": "Hello,1. You are correct in that the Act provides for only two consequences for violation by an ICC committee member of the confidentiality obligation contained in Section 16, to wit: (a) removal from the ICC (S. 4[5][a]) and (b) a fine of Rs. 5000 (rule 12 of the rules framed under s. 29 of the Act). A greater penalty would bedehorsor beyond the scope of the Act. In other words, they cannot visit the Subject with a greater punishment. At least not under the Act. It is not clear if the Subject is being threatened with said extra-statutory consequences under their employment contract. Further, such intimidation could give the Subject a cause of action of their own (in tort or contract or both). But it is not possible for me to comment on all of that without the full facts of the case.2.A determination that a person has breached s. 16 is indeed appealable. The appeal has to be filed with the Appellate Authority notified by the government under clause (a) of section 2 of the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946 (20 of 1946). This its as per rule 11 of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Rules, 2013. The appeal is to be filed within 90 days of the recommendations sought to be challenged (i.e., the recommendation that Subject be punished for breach of S. 16).The Maharashtra Government has designated Industrial Courts constituted under section 10 of the Maharashtra Industrial Relations Act (XI of 1947) as the \"Appellate Authority.\" There are about twenty Industrial Courts in Maharashtra: Pune, Mumbai, Dhule, Nagpur, Thane, Kolhapur, Nashik, A u r a n g a b a d , A m a r a v a t i , Ahmednagar, Solapur, Jalna, Akola, Yavatmal, Satara, Jalgaon, Chandrapur, Bhandara, Sangali and Latur.The Subject is therefore advised to forthwith file an appeal with the appropriate Industrial Court. They can then have any adverse findings and recommendations overturned. Needless to say a successful appeal would give their tormentors pause.Hope that answers your question.Pulkit ChandnaAdvocate, New Delhi208 Answers5 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Pulkit Chandna"

    "answer": "The terrace and other common areas are common to all the members of the associations and the association of the apartment is having rights and control over all the common areas of the complex.A terrace or rooftop is a common area of in a residential society which is for the enjoyment and benefit of all its members. Although it has been seen that many developers resort to selling or giving exclusive terrace rights on payment, the practice is illegal.A community hall, a play area, a garden, a stairway, a terrace and elevators are all shared areas and have to be made accessible to all the apartment-owners without any ownership issue. As any repair, replacement and maintenance cost of such common areas has to be borne by all the flat owners collectively, likewise, any income or profits arising from the use of such common areas have to be distributed evenly among all the flat owners.It has been seen that many buildings have terraces on certain floors, below the main terrace on the top floor. Developers often hoodwink the residents and sell these terraces to the adjacent flat owners thereby making huge profits. However, this too is against the law. A terrace that is not accessible from the common areas and is attached exclusively to a flat can only be sold to a flat owner but all other terraces are for the common usage.It is for the same reason a terrace is not included in the Floor Space Index (FSI) of an apartment. Reason: it cannot be bought or sold.The residents can complain against the developer by approaching the Consumer ForumT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "The terrace and other common areas are common to all the members of the associations and the association of the apartment is having rights and control over all the common areas of the complex.A terrace or rooftop is a common area of in a residential society which is for the enjoyment and benefit of all its members. Although it has been seen that many developers resort to selling or giving exclusive terrace rights on payment, the practice is illegal.A community hall, a play area, a garden, a stairway, a terrace and elevators are all shared areas and have to be made accessible to all the apartment-owners without any ownership issue. As any repair, replacement and maintenance cost of such common areas has to be borne by all the flat owners collectively, likewise, any income or profits arising from the use of such common areas have to be distributed evenly among all the flat owners.It has been seen that many buildings have terraces on certain floors, below the main terrace on the top floor. Developers often hoodwink the residents and sell these terraces to the adjacent flat owners thereby making huge profits. However, this too is against the law. A terrace that is not accessible from the common areas and is attached exclusively to a flat can only be sold to a flat owner but all other terraces are for the common usage.It is for the same reason a terrace is not included in the Floor Space Index (FSI) of an apartment. Reason: it cannot be bought or sold.The residents can complain against the developer by approaching the Consumer ForumT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "The terrace and other common areas are common to all the members of the associations and the association of the apartment is having rights and control over all the common areas of the complex.A terrace or rooftop is a common area of in a residential society which is for the enjoyment and benefit of all its members. Although it has been seen that many developers resort to selling or giving exclusive terrace rights on payment, the practice is illegal.A community hall, a play area, a garden, a stairway, a terrace and elevators are all shared areas and have to be made accessible to all the apartment-owners without any ownership issue. As any repair, replacement and maintenance cost of such common areas has to be borne by all the flat owners collectively, likewise, any income or profits arising from the use of such common areas have to be distributed evenly among all the flat owners.It has been seen that many buildings have terraces on certain floors, below the main terrace on the top floor. Developers often hoodwink the residents and sell these terraces to the adjacent flat owners thereby making huge profits. However, this too is against the law. A terrace that is not accessible from the common areas and is attached exclusively to a flat can only be sold to a flat owner but all other terraces are for the common usage.It is for the same reason a terrace is not included in the Floor Space Index (FSI) of an apartment. Reason: it cannot be bought or sold.The residents can complain against the developer by approaching the Consumer ForumT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "The terrace and other common areas are common to all the members of the associations and the association of the apartment is having rights and control over all the common areas of the complex.A terrace or rooftop is a common area of in a residential society which is for the enjoyment and benefit of all its members. Although it has been seen that many developers resort to selling or giving exclusive terrace rights on payment, the practice is illegal.A community hall, a play area, a garden, a stairway, a terrace and elevators are all shared areas and have to be made accessible to all the apartment-owners without any ownership issue. As any repair, replacement and maintenance cost of such common areas has to be borne by all the flat owners collectively, likewise, any income or profits arising from the use of such common areas have to be distributed evenly among all the flat owners.It has been seen that many buildings have terraces on certain floors, below the main terrace on the top floor. Developers often hoodwink the residents and sell these terraces to the adjacent flat owners thereby making huge profits. However, this too is against the law. A terrace that is not accessible from the common areas and is attached exclusively to a flat can only be sold to a flat owner but all other terraces are for the common usage.It is for the same reason a terrace is not included in the Floor Space Index (FSI) of an apartment. Reason: it cannot be bought or sold.The residents can complain against the developer by approaching the Consumer ForumT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "A general category person can't buy an land belongingto SC / ST category through direct purchase. He has to take permission from the relative authoritySection 42 (SC, ST Act) provides some general restrictions on sale, gift and bequest of the interest of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe, in the whole or part of their holding.If the land is self earned, not much problem.If the land was granted by the government, then you need to be careful.The preamble of the Act reads:“An Act to provide for the prohibition of transfer of certain lands granted by the government, to persons belonging to the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes in the state, which means any land granted to the landless agricultural labourers belonging to scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, cannot be purchased. Anyone who purchases such a property, will not get clear and marketable title; such property will be eventually acquired by Government and returned to the original owner without any compensation to the purchaser.”The problem lies in the fact that when the grantee goes to sell the land which he is not supposed to the Govt does not refuse to register this Sale but officially accepts it as a legal sale. Later the grantee goes back to the Govt and claims this land back. The law then says the land has to be returned to the grantee without any compensation.Limitations of the Act a) Land cannot be sold without permission from Govt. within 15 years b) Most grantees sell the land immediately on receiving the granted land.The original grantee or his heirs can claim the land back after 100 years even if land has changed hands officially through Registered Sale Deeds a number of times.StrangelyThe Limitation Act Does not apply to this law (e) This law is retrospective in nature Ex post facto law India d) The current owner should handover possession including building, trees etc. without any compensation even if taxes are paid and land has been registered in the purchasers nameThe current owner may have purchased it from another party and may be the third or fourth in line in which the property has changed hands.But only the current owner is expected to bear the loss of all accumulated purchases and sales"

But that's the choice of the developer if he is ready to wait for the father's Will being probated and the PRC being mutated to reflect the correct land owners. The developer is exercising his due diligence. Some developers are a bit adventurous and directly enter into a DA despite pending compliance by the land owner, by taking an indemnity from the land owner. But given how matters get blocked in the courts in case of any dispute claim or litigation, many developers are very cautious and want all legal compliance to be in place before signing the dotted line in the actual contractYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Land transfer from Schedule tribe to Scheduled tribe",
    "answer": "A general category person can't buy an land belongingto SC / ST category through direct purchase. He has to take permission from the relative authoritySection 42 (SC, ST Act) provides some general restrictions on sale, gift and bequest of the interest of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe, in the whole or part of their holding.If the land is self earned, not much problem.If the land was granted by the government, then you need to be careful.The preamble of the Act reads:“An Act to provide for the prohibition of transfer of certain lands granted by the government, to persons belonging to the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes in the state, which means any land granted to the landless agricultural labourers belonging to scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, cannot be purchased. Anyone who purchases such a property, will not get clear and marketable title; such property will be eventually acquired by Government and returned to the original owner without any compensation to the purchaser.”The problem lies in the fact that when the grantee goes to sell the land which he is not supposed to the Govt does not refuse to register this Sale but officially accepts it as a legal sale. Later the grantee goes back to the Govt and claims this land back. The law then says the land has to be returned to the grantee without any compensation.Limitations of the Act a) Land cannot be sold without permission from Govt. within 15 years b) Most grantees sell the land immediately on receiving the granted land.The original grantee or his heirs can claim the land back after 100 years even if land has changed hands officially through Registered Sale Deeds a number of times.StrangelyThe Limitation Act Does not apply to this law (e) This law is retrospective in nature Ex post facto law India d) The current owner should handover possession including building, trees etc. without any compensation even if taxes are paid and land has been registered in the purchasers nameThe current owner may have purchased it from another party and may be the third or fourth in line in which the property has changed hands.But only the current owner is expected to bear the loss of all accumulated purchases and sales"

    "question": "Mortgaged Property Sold",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Section 60 of theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, lays down that after the principal money becomes due, the mortgagor can tender the money and require the mortgagee to deliver the possession of the property or the dead/documents to him. In 2020, the Supreme Court held that the right to redeem a property from a mortgagee, cannot be denied. It emphasized that equity insists upon the principle that a mortgage is intended merely to afford security to a lender and thus mortgagees have to be considerate before disposing off the property of mortgagor.According to Rule 4 Order XXXIV of Code of Civil procedure, 1908, the mortgagee can apply for a preliminary decree in a suit for sale in the Civil Court, wherein the mortgagor shall be summoned to pay mortgaged money together along with other expenses as determined by the Court. In the event the mortgagor fails to pay the said amount, the mortgagee shall be entitled to obtain/apply for a final decree as per Rule 5 Order XXXIV of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, debarring the mortgagor to redeem the mortgaged property and permitting the mortgagee to sell the property.In light of the same, recently, on September 2nd, 2021, the Delhi High Court, in the caseof Pushpa Builder Limited v. Vaish Cooperative Adarsh Bank Limited., stated that it is, but reasonable, to expect banks, to respect the right of the borrowers to maximize their profits from the sale of collateral and securities by the banks.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "A general category person can't buy an land belongingto SC / ST category through direct purchase. He has to take permission from the relative authoritySection 42 (SC, ST Act) provides some general restrictions on sale, gift and bequest of the interest of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe, in the whole or part of their holding.If the land is self earned, not much problem.If the land was granted by the government, then you need to be careful.The preamble of the Act reads:“An Act to provide for the prohibition of transfer of certain lands granted by the government, to persons belonging to the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes in the state, which means any land granted to the landless agricultural labourers belonging to scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, cannot be purchased. Anyone who purchases such a property, will not get clear and marketable title; such property will be eventually acquired by Government and returned to the original owner without any compensation to the purchaser.”The problem lies in the fact that when the grantee goes to sell the land which he is not supposed to the Govt does not refuse to register this Sale but officially accepts it as a legal sale. Later the grantee goes back to the Govt and claims this land back. The law then says the land has to be returned to the grantee without any compensation.Limitations of the Act a) Land cannot be sold without permission from Govt. within 15 years b) Most grantees sell the land immediately on receiving the granted land.The original grantee or his heirs can claim the land back after 100 years even if land has changed hands officially through Registered Sale Deeds a number of times.StrangelyThe Limitation Act Does not apply to this law (e) This law is retrospective in nature Ex post facto law India d) The current owner should handover possession including building, trees etc. without any compensation even if taxes are paid and land has been registered in the purchasers nameThe current owner may have purchased it from another party and may be the third or fourth in line in which the property has changed hands.But only the current owner is expected to bear the loss of all accumulated purchases and sales"

Additionally, if there was a contract between you and the builder, this would be a breach of your contract, so you can get compensation for the breach of contract, as given in the contract. In case you don't have a contract, then also the acts of the builder are in breach of Sec. 55 of theTransfer of Property Act, and you can file a civil case for recovery of damages and compensation.Alternatively, you can also approach Consumer court or RERA for the redressal of your grievances.Siddharth JainAdvocate, New Delhi6464 Answers102 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Siddharth Jain"

    "question": "Mortgaged Property Sold",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Section 60 of theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, lays down that after the principal money becomes due, the mortgagor can tender the money and require the mortgagee to deliver the possession of the property or the dead/documents to him. In 2020, the Supreme Court held that the right to redeem a property from a mortgagee, cannot be denied. It emphasized that equity insists upon the principle that a mortgage is intended merely to afford security to a lender and thus mortgagees have to be considerate before disposing off the property of mortgagor.According to Rule 4 Order XXXIV of Code of Civil procedure, 1908, the mortgagee can apply for a preliminary decree in a suit for sale in the Civil Court, wherein the mortgagor shall be summoned to pay mortgaged money together along with other expenses as determined by the Court. In the event the mortgagor fails to pay the said amount, the mortgagee shall be entitled to obtain/apply for a final decree as per Rule 5 Order XXXIV of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, debarring the mortgagor to redeem the mortgaged property and permitting the mortgagee to sell the property.In light of the same, recently, on September 2nd, 2021, the Delhi High Court, in the caseof Pushpa Builder Limited v. Vaish Cooperative Adarsh Bank Limited., stated that it is, but reasonable, to expect banks, to respect the right of the borrowers to maximize their profits from the sale of collateral and securities by the banks.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Property Rights Dispute",
    "answer": "Your sister can approach the senior citizen's welfare tribunal and get her son and daughter vacate from the house by applying the force of law.Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act in 2007 (Senior Citizens Act) which grants such rights, to the senior citizens, can be invoked by your sister to get them vacated from the property.To protect their rights, senior citizens planning on gifting property to their child should consider including an express condition in the gift/transfer deed that the child will maintain them. If the child violates this condition, then the parent can approach the Maintenance Tribunal to declare the gift void and return the property to the senior citizen.Some courts have even observed that an express condition is not required in the deed and as such, a condition may be implied when a parent gifts property to a child out of love and affection or in lieu of services.Although the Senior Citizens Act itself does not provide for eviction/removal from property, Indian courts, including the Supreme Court, have permitted eviction/removal of the children or relatives from the property of senior citizens in case of harassment or non-maintenance.Courts have also ordered removal of children from the parents’ home when children have resorted to harassing their parents.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Hello,A daughter-in-law has no right in her mother-in-law’s sef acquired property.Self-acquired property includes property the mother-in-law bought for herself, inherited as an heir, received as a gift, or acquired under a Will.If this is your self-acquired property as you seem to suggest, your daughter-in-law has no claim to it. You can sell or gift the property in your lifetime to anyone. In case you want to give the property to one or more persons after you are gone, you are free to have a Will prepared to that effect.Fairness is not something any court will go into. It is your property and you are free to do whatever you want with it. The law is not concerned with that aspect.As for a stay, courts are slow to pass such orders in cases involving property disputes. This is because any sale of property during the pendency of the case is subject to its outcome. This is a sufficient safeguard. It is a legal doctrine called lis pendens. In simple words, anyone who buys the property during the dispute will have to comply with the final decision of the court. If the court says the seller was not the owner for example, the buyer will have no claim to the property. It will go to the winning side.Hope that answers your question.

Non-compliance with any of the Act’s criteria or requirements is one of the most common objections dealt with.Once such an application has been received by the marriage officer, duly signed by both parties, the officer shall then issue a thirty-day public notice to raise objections to the intended marriage if any. The objections generally relate to non-compliance with the conditions referred to in Section 4 of the Act (also referred to in Step 1). If the conditions are duly met and no such objections are raised, a marriage certificate should be entered in the Marriage Certificate Book. Here, both the intending parties and the witnesses are required to sign.Marriage underSpecial Marriage Actcan be registered in the office of the Marriage Officer under whose jurisdiction bride or bridegroom resides.Please do understand  that publication of  notice is mandatory and the place of registration is decided according to the places of living of parties who intended to marry each other.Law does not allow for exceptions based upon whims or any other reason that a concerned party may project.Even though if both have resided in any other place than their own home town they will produce rental agreement before the marriage officer for the purpose of marriage at that place .Ajay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

    "question": "Mortgaged Property Sold",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Section 60 of theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, lays down that after the principal money becomes due, the mortgagor can tender the money and require the mortgagee to deliver the possession of the property or the dead/documents to him. In 2020, the Supreme Court held that the right to redeem a property from a mortgagee, cannot be denied. It emphasized that equity insists upon the principle that a mortgage is intended merely to afford security to a lender and thus mortgagees have to be considerate before disposing off the property of mortgagor.According to Rule 4 Order XXXIV of Code of Civil procedure, 1908, the mortgagee can apply for a preliminary decree in a suit for sale in the Civil Court, wherein the mortgagor shall be summoned to pay mortgaged money together along with other expenses as determined by the Court. In the event the mortgagor fails to pay the said amount, the mortgagee shall be entitled to obtain/apply for a final decree as per Rule 5 Order XXXIV of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, debarring the mortgagor to redeem the mortgaged property and permitting the mortgagee to sell the property.In light of the same, recently, on September 2nd, 2021, the Delhi High Court, in the caseof Pushpa Builder Limited v. Vaish Cooperative Adarsh Bank Limited., stated that it is, but reasonable, to expect banks, to respect the right of the borrowers to maximize their profits from the sale of collateral and securities by the banks.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "the property will have to be mutated to include the names of yourself, your sister and your mother alongwith your fatherthen after you obtain the probate of your father's Will, the PR Card will again have to be mutated to delete the name of your father and insert your mother's name having 50% share and balance 50% being held by the 2 childrenyou can make a MOU in the meanwhile with the developers before signing the DAUnder the MOU it can be agreed that condition precedent for signing the DA would be that the grantors of development rights have to take steps for mutating the PR card to reflect the correct owners as per the grandmother's and father's Willso until the condition precedent in the MOU as aforesaid is not complied, the developer will not get any development rights. But that's the choice of the developer if he is ready to wait for the father's Will being probated and the PRC being mutated to reflect the correct land owners. The developer is exercising his due diligence. Some developers are a bit adventurous and directly enter into a DA despite pending compliance by the land owner, by taking an indemnity from the land owner. But given how matters get blocked in the courts in case of any dispute claim or litigation, many developers are very cautious and want all legal compliance to be in place before signing the dotted line in the actual contractYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Hello,A daughter-in-law has no right in her mother-in-law’s sef acquired property.Self-acquired property includes property the mother-in-law bought for herself, inherited as an heir, received as a gift, or acquired under a Will.If this is your self-acquired property as you seem to suggest, your daughter-in-law has no claim to it. You can sell or gift the property in your lifetime to anyone. In case you want to give the property to one or more persons after you are gone, you are free to have a Will prepared to that effect.Fairness is not something any court will go into. It is your property and you are free to do whatever you want with it. The law is not concerned with that aspect.As for a stay, courts are slow to pass such orders in cases involving property disputes. This is because any sale of property during the pendency of the case is subject to its outcome. This is a sufficient safeguard. It is a legal doctrine called lis pendens. In simple words, anyone who buys the property during the dispute will have to comply with the final decision of the court. If the court says the seller was not the owner for example, the buyer will have no claim to the property. It will go to the winning side.Hope that answers your question.

The objections generally relate to non-compliance with the conditions referred to in Section 4 of the Act (also referred to in Step 1).

Here, both the intending parties and the witnesses are required to sign.Marriage underSpecial Marriage Actcan be registered in the office of the Marriage Officer under whose jurisdiction bride or bridegroom resides.Please do understand  that publication of  notice is mandatory and the place of registration is decided according to the places of living of parties who intended to marry each other.Law does not allow for exceptions based upon whims or any other reason that a concerned party may project.Even though if both have resided in any other place than their own home town they will produce rental agreement before the marriage officer for the purpose of marriage at that place .Ajay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

    "question": "Foreign marriage",
    "answer": "Marriage in India is required to be registered under Indian marriage law. If a marriage between an Indian and a foreign national is to take place in India, the marriage has to solemnize under theSpecial Marriage Actof 1954.Generally, you are required to file a notice of intended marriage with a Marriage Registrar of your choice in India. This notice is required to be published within the stipulated 30 days. At the end of the 30 days the Marriage Registrar is free to perform the marriage.If one partner is residing in a foreign country then the partner who is resident in India will have to fill out the “Marriage Notice”  collected from the Marriage Registration Office of his/her choice in India and send it to his/her partner in the foreign country who will also have to fill it out. This “Notice” should then be sent back to the partner in India who will have to re-submit it at the Marriage Registration Office.

    "answer": "Hello,A daughter-in-law has no right in her mother-in-law’s sef acquired property.Self-acquired property includes property the mother-in-law bought for herself, inherited as an heir, received as a gift, or acquired under a Will.If this is your self-acquired property as you seem to suggest, your daughter-in-law has no claim to it. You can sell or gift the property in your lifetime to anyone. In case you want to give the property to one or more persons after you are gone, you are free to have a Will prepared to that effect.Fairness is not something any court will go into. It is your property and you are free to do whatever you want with it. The law is not concerned with that aspect.As for a stay, courts are slow to pass such orders in cases involving property disputes. This is because any sale of property during the pendency of the case is subject to its outcome. This is a sufficient safeguard. It is a legal doctrine called lis pendens. In simple words, anyone who buys the property during the dispute will have to comply with the final decision of the court. If the court says the seller was not the owner for example, the buyer will have no claim to the property. It will go to the winning side.Hope that answers your question.

The duration of the case can't be quantified.4.   Since your sisters' also have equal right over the property as that of you, they can't be stopped from using the house until the partition is done.Shashidhar S.

You can sell or gift the property in your lifetime to anyone. In case you want to give the property to one or more persons after you are gone, you are free to have a Will prepared to that effect.Fairness is not something any court will go into. It is your property and you are free to do whatever you want with it. The law is not concerned with that aspect.As for a stay, courts are slow to pass such orders in cases involving property disputes. This is because any sale of property during the pendency of the case is subject to its outcome. This is a sufficient safeguard. It is a legal doctrine called lis pendens. In simple words, anyone who buys the property during the dispute will have to comply with the final decision of the court. If the court says the seller was not the owner for example, the buyer will have no claim to the property. It will go to the winning side.Hope that answers your question.

    "answer": "TheSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 Section 5 specifies that the parties must give written notice to the Marriage Officer of the District and that at least one of the parties must have lived in the district for at least 30 days immediately before the date of such notification.According to Section 6 of the Act, the original and genuine copy of the notification must be submitted in the ‘Marriage Notice Book.’ After the Marriage Officer receives the application, he or she will publish a thirty-day public notice to see whether there are any objections to the marriage. Non-compliance with any of the Act’s criteria or requirements is one of the most common objections dealt with.Once such an application has been received by the marriage officer, duly signed by both parties, the officer shall then issue a thirty-day public notice to raise objections to the intended marriage if any. The objections generally relate to non-compliance with the conditions referred to in Section 4 of the Act (also referred to in Step 1). If the conditions are duly met and no such objections are raised, a marriage certificate should be entered in the Marriage Certificate Book. Here, both the intending parties and the witnesses are required to sign.Marriage underSpecial Marriage Actcan be registered in the office of the Marriage Officer under whose jurisdiction bride or bridegroom resides.Please do understand  that publication of  notice is mandatory and the place of registration is decided according to the places of living of parties who intended to marry each other.Law does not allow for exceptions based upon whims or any other reason that a concerned party may project.Even though if both have resided in any other place than their own home town they will produce rental agreement before the marriage officer for the purpose of marriage at that place .Ajay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

    "question": "Can a widow daughter-in-law get a stay order to prevent mother-in-law from selling owned property",
    "answer": "Hello,A daughter-in-law has no right in her mother-in-law’s sef acquired property.Self-acquired property includes property the mother-in-law bought for herself, inherited as an heir, received as a gift, or acquired under a Will.If this is your self-acquired property as you seem to suggest, your daughter-in-law has no claim to it. You can sell or gift the property in your lifetime to anyone. In case you want to give the property to one or more persons after you are gone, you are free to have a Will prepared to that effect.Fairness is not something any court will go into. It is your property and you are free to do whatever you want with it. The law is not concerned with that aspect.As for a stay, courts are slow to pass such orders in cases involving property disputes. This is because any sale of property during the pendency of the case is subject to its outcome. This is a sufficient safeguard. It is a legal doctrine called lis pendens. In simple words, anyone who buys the property during the dispute will have to comply with the final decision of the court. If the court says the seller was not the owner for example, the buyer will have no claim to the property. It will go to the winning side.Hope that answers your question.

    "question": "Can a widow daughter-in-law get a stay order to prevent mother-in-law from selling owned property",
    "answer": "Hello,A daughter-in-law has no right in her mother-in-law’s sef acquired property.Self-acquired property includes property the mother-in-law bought for herself, inherited as an heir, received as a gift, or acquired under a Will.If this is your self-acquired property as you seem to suggest, your daughter-in-law has no claim to it. You can sell or gift the property in your lifetime to anyone. In case you want to give the property to one or more persons after you are gone, you are free to have a Will prepared to that effect.Fairness is not something any court will go into. It is your property and you are free to do whatever you want with it. The law is not concerned with that aspect.As for a stay, courts are slow to pass such orders in cases involving property disputes. This is because any sale of property during the pendency of the case is subject to its outcome. This is a sufficient safeguard. It is a legal doctrine called lis pendens. In simple words, anyone who buys the property during the dispute will have to comply with the final decision of the court. If the court says the seller was not the owner for example, the buyer will have no claim to the property. It will go to the winning side.Hope that answers your question.

You can file a complaint in District Consumer Commission under newConsumer Protection Act, 2019 for refund of advance as it is clear case of deficiency of service. District Consumer Commission is more powerful than RERA Authority as it has power to order arrest of respondent. You can also file criminal complaint against him for cheating. File the case in the Court of Magistrate as police will hesitate to take complaint. Court will order police to register FIR,  investigate, produce accused in court and file charge sheet. After trial Court will punish the accused. Punishment for cheating is jail up to seven  years. Once summons is served on him he will come for settlement, the offence of cheating is compoundable, that is it can be compromised between complaint and accused. You can collect you money and compromise the offence.Ravi ShindeAdvocate, Hyderabad4923 Answers42 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ravi Shinde"

    "answer": "DearSorry to hear about your situation.You have two three options here:-1. You can  first file a petition forrestitution of conjugal rights. Your wife will be ordered to live with you. If she doesn't follow that order and live with you for an year, you can file a petition for divorce.2. You can file a petition for judicial separation and after one year of passing of decree of judicial separation you can file for divorce.3. You can file a case for divorce against your wife if there are any grounds for cruelty. To establish these facts it is important to know all facts and I cannot give an opinion here without knowing it all.4. If your wife also wants a divorce, you can file a petition for mutual divorce also known as no fault divorce and in that terms of the divorce will have to be agreed between you and your wife. This is the fastest and best method but obviously this happens rarely as divorce proceedings are contested by parties.Please note, you should have access to documents which show what your wife is earning right now. Do that before you tell her about your intention to file for divorce. Maintenance and Alimony is a hotly contested issue in divorce proceedings and you would certainly require all the paperwork. Bank Statements, IT returns, Salary Slip, Appointment Letter of workplace, proof of lavish lifestyle, etc.Hope this helps.RegardsAbhiraj JayantAbhiraj JayantAdvocate, Delhi50 Answers1 ConsultationTalk to Advocate Abhiraj Jayant"

    "answer": "Hello,Correct me if I am wrong. Your wife refuses to live with your parents and she’d rather the two of you lived alone or with her parents?If my reading of your factual narration is correct, your wife could be guilty of treating you with cruelty. To try and separate her husband from his parents is a form of cruelty in the eyes of India law — more so when the parents are counting on the son’s support.Cruelty is one of the grounds of divorce under theHindu Marriage Act(the statute applicable to you). For now, it appears to be the most appropriate. The advice may stand altered if and when more details become known.She could bring a maintenance action against you. And if she is really spiteful (presuming nothing here), she could file a complaint under the DV Act or a criminal complaint against you. Again, I don’t know enough to give you specific advice on this score.You will do well to preserve all evidence (electronic or otherwise) that might help you establish the things you have described here, namely: (a) you’ve indulged her throughout, (b) she has been uninterested in returning the favour, (c) she has tried to separate you from your parents who need you, and (d) she has left you of her own volition without any provocation from your side.In case, you still want to give it a final try. You could approach a court here in Delhi and seek the “restitution of conjugal rights.” It is a court decree asking the respondent (your wife) to return to the petitioner (husband).  While it cannot be enforced, it can often get the job done by bringing the couple back together. It is also used by husbands to establish good faith on their part and to show they have been abandoned (and not the other way ‘round). This can help in maintenance cases.Hope that answers your question.Pulkit ChandnaAdvocate, New Delhi208 Answers5 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Pulkit Chandna"

If she doesn't follow that order and live with you for an year, you can file a petition for divorce.2. You can file a petition for judicial separation and after one year of passing of decree of judicial separation you can file for divorce.3. You can file a case for divorce against your wife if there are any grounds for cruelty. To establish these facts it is important to know all facts and I cannot give an opinion here without knowing it all.4. If your wife also wants a divorce, you can file a petition for mutual divorce also known as no fault divorce and in that terms of the divorce will have to be agreed between you and your wife. This is the fastest and best method but obviously this happens rarely as divorce proceedings are contested by parties.Please note, you should have access to documents which show what your wife is earning right now. Do that before you tell her about your intention to file for divorce. Maintenance and Alimony is a hotly contested issue in divorce proceedings and you would certainly require all the paperwork. Bank Statements, IT returns, Salary Slip, Appointment Letter of workplace, proof of lavish lifestyle, etc.Hope this helps.RegardsAbhiraj JayantAbhiraj JayantAdvocate, Delhi50 Answers1 ConsultationTalk to Advocate Abhiraj Jayant"

    "answer": "Hello,Correct me if I am wrong. Your wife refuses to live with your parents and she’d rather the two of you lived alone or with her parents?If my reading of your factual narration is correct, your wife could be guilty of treating you with cruelty. To try and separate her husband from his parents is a form of cruelty in the eyes of India law — more so when the parents are counting on the son’s support.Cruelty is one of the grounds of divorce under theHindu Marriage Act(the statute applicable to you). For now, it appears to be the most appropriate. The advice may stand altered if and when more details become known.She could bring a maintenance action against you. And if she is really spiteful (presuming nothing here), she could file a complaint under the DV Act or a criminal complaint against you. Again, I don’t know enough to give you specific advice on this score.You will do well to preserve all evidence (electronic or otherwise) that might help you establish the things you have described here, namely: (a) you’ve indulged her throughout, (b) she has been uninterested in returning the favour, (c) she has tried to separate you from your parents who need you, and (d) she has left you of her own volition without any provocation from your side.In case, you still want to give it a final try. You could approach a court here in Delhi and seek the “restitution of conjugal rights.” It is a court decree asking the respondent (your wife) to return to the petitioner (husband).  While it cannot be enforced, it can often get the job done by bringing the couple back together. It is also used by husbands to establish good faith on their part and to show they have been abandoned (and not the other way ‘round). This can help in maintenance cases.Hope that answers your question.Pulkit ChandnaAdvocate, New Delhi208 Answers5 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Pulkit Chandna"

    "answer": "DearSorry to hear about your situation.You have two three options here:-1. You can  first file a petition forrestitution of conjugal rights. Your wife will be ordered to live with you. If she doesn't follow that order and live with you for an year, you can file a petition for divorce.2. You can file a petition for judicial separation and after one year of passing of decree of judicial separation you can file for divorce.3. You can file a case for divorce against your wife if there are any grounds for cruelty. To establish these facts it is important to know all facts and I cannot give an opinion here without knowing it all.4. If your wife also wants a divorce, you can file a petition for mutual divorce also known as no fault divorce and in that terms of the divorce will have to be agreed between you and your wife. This is the fastest and best method but obviously this happens rarely as divorce proceedings are contested by parties.Please note, you should have access to documents which show what your wife is earning right now. Do that before you tell her about your intention to file for divorce. Maintenance and Alimony is a hotly contested issue in divorce proceedings and you would certainly require all the paperwork. Bank Statements, IT returns, Salary Slip, Appointment Letter of workplace, proof of lavish lifestyle, etc.Hope this helps.RegardsAbhiraj JayantAbhiraj JayantAdvocate, Delhi50 Answers1 ConsultationTalk to Advocate Abhiraj Jayant"

    "answer": "Hello,Correct me if I am wrong. Your wife refuses to live with your parents and she’d rather the two of you lived alone or with her parents?If my reading of your factual narration is correct, your wife could be guilty of treating you with cruelty. To try and separate her husband from his parents is a form of cruelty in the eyes of India law — more so when the parents are counting on the son’s support.Cruelty is one of the grounds of divorce under theHindu Marriage Act(the statute applicable to you). For now, it appears to be the most appropriate. The advice may stand altered if and when more details become known.She could bring a maintenance action against you. And if she is really spiteful (presuming nothing here), she could file a complaint under the DV Act or a criminal complaint against you. Again, I don’t know enough to give you specific advice on this score.You will do well to preserve all evidence (electronic or otherwise) that might help you establish the things you have described here, namely: (a) you’ve indulged her throughout, (b) she has been uninterested in returning the favour, (c) she has tried to separate you from your parents who need you, and (d) she has left you of her own volition without any provocation from your side.In case, you still want to give it a final try. You could approach a court here in Delhi and seek the “restitution of conjugal rights.” It is a court decree asking the respondent (your wife) to return to the petitioner (husband).  While it cannot be enforced, it can often get the job done by bringing the couple back together. It is also used by husbands to establish good faith on their part and to show they have been abandoned (and not the other way ‘round). This can help in maintenance cases.Hope that answers your question.Pulkit ChandnaAdvocate, New Delhi208 Answers5 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Pulkit Chandna"

You can file a complaint in District Consumer Commission under newConsumer Protection Act, 2019 for refund of advance as it is clear case of deficiency of service. District Consumer Commission is more powerful than RERA Authority as it has power to order arrest of respondent. You can also file criminal complaint against him for cheating. File the case in the Court of Magistrate as police will hesitate to take complaint. Court will order police to register FIR,  investigate, produce accused in court and file charge sheet. After trial Court will punish the accused. Punishment for cheating is jail up to seven  years. Once summons is served on him he will come for settlement, the offence of cheating is compoundable, that is it can be compromised between complaint and accused. You can collect you money and compromise the offence.Ravi ShindeAdvocate, Hyderabad4923 Answers42 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ravi Shinde"

District Consumer Commission is more powerful than RERA Authority as it has power to order arrest of respondent. You can also file criminal complaint against him for cheating. File the case in the Court of Magistrate as police will hesitate to take complaint. Court will order police to register FIR,  investigate, produce accused in court and file charge sheet. After trial Court will punish the accused. Punishment for cheating is jail up to seven  years. Once summons is served on him he will come for settlement, the offence of cheating is compoundable, that is it can be compromised between complaint and accused.

    "question": "Parking Bye Laws In Society",
    "answer": "Space of society is not a public place and therefore parking rules laid down by traffic police are not attracted. Within the space of society parking is governed by rules of common sense and convenience of all residents like…Each resident should have at least one parking place.A parking place should not cause obstruction to movement of other vehicles.Subject to paucity of land, no one should have more than one parking place.Considering the above in the light of your problem it can be asserted that…As you are using parking for a considerable period of time, there can be any reason to deny the same to you.No immovable property/easementary right can be sold in perpetuity under Section 10 ofTransfer of Property Act, 1882.No resident can be allotted more than one parking place.Give a reply on the above lines mentioning all facts of two parking places for some and no parking place for some.

If the child violates this condition, then the parent can approach the Maintenance Tribunal to declare the gift void and return the property to the senior citizen.Some courts have even observed that an express condition is not required in the deed and as such, a condition may be implied when a parent gifts property to a child out of love and affection or in lieu of services.Although the Senior Citizens Act itself does not provide for eviction/removal from property, Indian courts, including the Supreme Court, have permitted eviction/removal of the children or relatives from the property of senior citizens in case of harassment or non-maintenance.Courts have also ordered removal of children from the parents’ home when children have resorted to harassing their parents.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

There are two aspects to your question.Divorce: following conditions are laid down for validity of divorce granted by foreign Court in by India by SC in case of Y. Narsimha Rao’s case…The court that passed the decree has to be a court of competent jurisdiction which the Act or law under which the parties are married recognises as court of competent jurisdiction to entertain the matrimonial dispute. Any other court should be held to be a court without jurisdiction unless both the parties voluntarily and unconditionally subject themselves to the jurisdiction of that Court. (Even if she submits to the jurisdiction of court there, she can come back to India and claim that she was forced to do so. That is sufficient for Indian court of invalidate the decree of divorce obtained there.Decision of foreign court should be on a ground available under the law under which the parties married and decision should be result of the contest between the parties. (Here also you are on thin ice). Many other conditions are mentioned but it is not necessary to look into all conditions as above two are sufficient to question the divorce decree from a foreign Court.Custody of child: Under Section 6 of Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, father is natural guardian and custodian of minor after the minor reaches age of five years with visiting rights  to mother. Though this is general law under special circumstances if the  child is girl permanent custody is granted to mother with visiting rights  of father. (Daughter being Indian national, Indian law will prevail over local law).She can also file multiple civil and criminal cases like 498A, DV, PDA and other laws against husband and his family in India.

    "answer": "When both the parties were India & married in India according to any of the India form of marriage then the dissolution of such marriage should be done through the Indian Family Court of the competent jurisdiction where the marriage took place or where either of the parties usually reside or where both the parties last resided together.Who wish to take benefit of Indian laws and legal system to avoid facing up to any foreign judicial system.If divorce is inevitable, bitter battles cannot be the option to settle issues of child custody and access. Custody of a child, when parents divorce, only implies as to who the child will physically reside with. Both parents continue to be natural guardians. Family law courts generally base decisions on the best interests of the child or children, not always on the best arguments of each parent.The Supreme Court of India has consistently held that in deciding cases of child custody‘the first and paramount consideration is the welfare and interest of the child and not the rights of the parents under a statute.But in the Dutch system of law, in relation to the welfare of children, the Act on Parental Responsibility is the primary source of law. issues of children are not dealt with in a divorce case, but in separate processes.Jurisdiction in relation to children is governed by the Child Protection Convention for signatory countries. According to Articles 5 to 14 of the Child Protection Convention, jurisdiction is based on grounds mostly relating to the habitual residence of the child.Where the child is wrongfully removed or retained in another country and the child had his or her habitual residence in Denmark just before the wrongful removal or retention. This does not apply if more than one year has passed since the parent with parental rights was aware of where the child is, and that parent has not asked for the child's return within that one year and the child has now adjusted to that new country.Foreign court decrees of divorce or dissolution of marriage are valid in India provided such decree is according to the provision of law in India as provided under section 13 of the Civil Procedure Code and Principle of law as laid down by the Indian courts. A foreign court divorce decree may be valid in India ONLY if the spouse had lived in that country and had consented to that country's jurisdiction.Decree of Divorce by a foreign Court is also valid in India if there is no challenge by the other party. If both of you go for amutual consent divorce, then it is recognised and valid in India.. If someone has accepted the authority of a court, it cannot be open to the person to later question the authority of the court.So think about the nature of custody about the child ,visitation right etc.. before filing a divorce.As per the latest Supreme Court judgement which had held that a decree of divorce granted by a foreign court is not valid in India if the ground is not recognised by Indian law. But in the case of custody of Child , the paramount consideration is the welfare of child.Amutual consent divorceis the best idea. So think about which law is more beneficial to youAjay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

    "question": "Property Rights Dispute",
    "answer": "Your sister can approach the senior citizen's welfare tribunal and get her son and daughter vacate from the house by applying the force of law.Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act in 2007 (Senior Citizens Act) which grants such rights, to the senior citizens, can be invoked by your sister to get them vacated from the property.To protect their rights, senior citizens planning on gifting property to their child should consider including an express condition in the gift/transfer deed that the child will maintain them. If the child violates this condition, then the parent can approach the Maintenance Tribunal to declare the gift void and return the property to the senior citizen.Some courts have even observed that an express condition is not required in the deed and as such, a condition may be implied when a parent gifts property to a child out of love and affection or in lieu of services.Although the Senior Citizens Act itself does not provide for eviction/removal from property, Indian courts, including the Supreme Court, have permitted eviction/removal of the children or relatives from the property of senior citizens in case of harassment or non-maintenance.Courts have also ordered removal of children from the parents’ home when children have resorted to harassing their parents.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

It was noted that such allotment is final unless it is cancelled or the allottee   withdraw   from   the   scheme   and   such   allotment would   be   cancelled   only   under exceptional circumstances. It was noted that the allottee gets title to the property on the issue of allotment letter and the  payment  of  installments  was  only  a  follow-up  action  and  taking  the delivery of possession is only a formality. In the circular dated 16th December, 1993 the board  has  considered that  in  cases  of allotment  of  flats  or  houses  by  co-operative  societies  or  other  institutions  whose  schemes  of allotment and consideration are similar to those of D.D.A. may also be treated as casesIn terms of such clarifications, the date of allotment would be the date on which the purchaser of a residential unit can be stated to have  acquired  the  property.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

If the child violates this condition, then the parent can approach the Maintenance Tribunal to declare the gift void and return the property to the senior citizen.Some courts have even observed that an express condition is not required in the deed and as such, a condition may be implied when a parent gifts property to a child out of love and affection or in lieu of services.Although the Senior Citizens Act itself does not provide for eviction/removal from property, Indian courts, including the Supreme Court, have permitted eviction/removal of the children or relatives from the property of senior citizens in case of harassment or non-maintenance.Courts have also ordered removal of children from the parents’ home when children have resorted to harassing their parents.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "If the tenants have breached the conditions of the rental agreement then you have all the rights to vacate them by issuing a legal notice followed by an eviction suit.Since you have already approached police on the subject matter and the police also have instructed them to vacate, you should have followed up with the tenant to ensure that they have physically vacate the rented house and delivered vacant possession to you.Whereas you did not bother to ensure them vacating the rented premise physically.If this property belonged to you then why should your uncle come into the picture.He can very well inform the concerned police about this if summoned by police on the basis of their complaint.Besides, nothing prevented you from visiting the police station to solve the issue amicably because they have made a complaint for not returning the advance amount only.You could have taken steps to solve the issue by returning their advance amount after deducting the balance or arrears of rental amount and an amount towards the damages.Staying at a different city is not an excuse if at all you want to solve this problem without escalating the same to the court.Even though it is a civil matter and the police cannot interfere in it, since the police wanted to solve this problem peacefully you should cooperate with the police to sort it out properly.Your non cooperation in this issue will bring more trouble to you or you may have to file an eviction suit which will take years to get disposedT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "The property vested in you in 2011 when the agreement was registeredThe agreement will have the details of all the payments made prior to the registration date. So the receipts of the same will be acknowledged in the agreement itself and you do not need to produce the receiptsThe indexation can be done taking 2001 as the base year as suggested by the 1st CA since the payments were made between 1998 and 2008. As regards the payments made prior to 2001 you would need a valuation report or if those amounts are not substantial then you can simply claim deduction without inflating those amounts by considering the CIIYou can also claim deduction towards cost of improvement and inflate that amount too by considering the CII provided you have proof for the same if and when requisitioned by the assessing officerSo both the CAs are correct to the extent as aboveFor purpose of determining the holding period of the property the registration date will have to be consideredAnd for purpose of computing the capital gains the indexation can be done from 2001 onwards to reduce the capital gains outflowYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "According to the CBDT in its circular No.471 dated 15th October, 1986 had clarified this position by holding that when an assessee purchases a flat to be constructed by Delhi Development Authority (“D.D.A.” for short) for which allotment letter is issued, the date of such allotment would be relevant date for the purpose of capital gain tax as a date of acquisition. It was noted that such allotment is final unless it is cancelled or the allottee   withdraw   from   the   scheme   and   such   allotment would   be   cancelled   only   under exceptional circumstances. It was noted that the allottee gets title to the property on the issue of allotment letter and the  payment  of  installments  was  only  a  follow-up  action  and  taking  the delivery of possession is only a formality. In the circular dated 16th December, 1993 the board  has  considered that  in  cases  of allotment  of  flats  or  houses  by  co-operative  societies  or  other  institutions  whose  schemes  of allotment and consideration are similar to those of D.D.A. may also be treated as casesIn terms of such clarifications, the date of allotment would be the date on which the purchaser of a residential unit can be stated to have  acquired  the  property.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "If the tenants have breached the conditions of the rental agreement then you have all the rights to vacate them by issuing a legal notice followed by an eviction suit.Since you have already approached police on the subject matter and the police also have instructed them to vacate, you should have followed up with the tenant to ensure that they have physically vacate the rented house and delivered vacant possession to you.Whereas you did not bother to ensure them vacating the rented premise physically.If this property belonged to you then why should your uncle come into the picture.He can very well inform the concerned police about this if summoned by police on the basis of their complaint.Besides, nothing prevented you from visiting the police station to solve the issue amicably because they have made a complaint for not returning the advance amount only.You could have taken steps to solve the issue by returning their advance amount after deducting the balance or arrears of rental amount and an amount towards the damages.Staying at a different city is not an excuse if at all you want to solve this problem without escalating the same to the court.Even though it is a civil matter and the police cannot interfere in it, since the police wanted to solve this problem peacefully you should cooperate with the police to sort it out properly.Your non cooperation in this issue will bring more trouble to you or you may have to file an eviction suit which will take years to get disposedT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Wife and daughter being Indian nationals, law applicable to them is Indian law, that isHindu Marriage Act. There are two aspects to your question.Divorce: following conditions are laid down for validity of divorce granted by foreign Court in by India by SC in case of Y. Narsimha Rao’s case…The court that passed the decree has to be a court of competent jurisdiction which the Act or law under which the parties are married recognises as court of competent jurisdiction to entertain the matrimonial dispute. Any other court should be held to be a court without jurisdiction unless both the parties voluntarily and unconditionally subject themselves to the jurisdiction of that Court. (Even if she submits to the jurisdiction of court there, she can come back to India and claim that she was forced to do so. That is sufficient for Indian court of invalidate the decree of divorce obtained there.Decision of foreign court should be on a ground available under the law under which the parties married and decision should be result of the contest between the parties. (Here also you are on thin ice). Many other conditions are mentioned but it is not necessary to look into all conditions as above two are sufficient to question the divorce decree from a foreign Court.Custody of child: Under Section 6 of Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, father is natural guardian and custodian of minor after the minor reaches age of five years with visiting rights  to mother. Though this is general law under special circumstances if the  child is girl permanent custody is granted to mother with visiting rights  of father. (Daughter being Indian national, Indian law will prevail over local law).She can also file multiple civil and criminal cases like 498A, DV, PDA and other laws against husband and his family in India. If the marriage is with seven years, the burden is on the husband to prove that there is no cruelty. These are facts.

    "question": "Divorce Dutch citizen (Indian origin) and Indian citizen",
    "answer": "When both the parties were India & married in India according to any of the India form of marriage then the dissolution of such marriage should be done through the Indian Family Court of the competent jurisdiction where the marriage took place or where either of the parties usually reside or where both the parties last resided together.Who wish to take benefit of Indian laws and legal system to avoid facing up to any foreign judicial system.If divorce is inevitable, bitter battles cannot be the option to settle issues of child custody and access. Custody of a child, when parents divorce, only implies as to who the child will physically reside with. Both parents continue to be natural guardians. Family law courts generally base decisions on the best interests of the child or children, not always on the best arguments of each parent.The Supreme Court of India has consistently held that in deciding cases of child custody‘the first and paramount consideration is the welfare and interest of the child and not the rights of the parents under a statute.But in the Dutch system of law, in relation to the welfare of children, the Act on Parental Responsibility is the primary source of law. issues of children are not dealt with in a divorce case, but in separate processes.Jurisdiction in relation to children is governed by the Child Protection Convention for signatory countries. According to Articles 5 to 14 of the Child Protection Convention, jurisdiction is based on grounds mostly relating to the habitual residence of the child.Where the child is wrongfully removed or retained in another country and the child had his or her habitual residence in Denmark just before the wrongful removal or retention. This does not apply if more than one year has passed since the parent with parental rights was aware of where the child is, and that parent has not asked for the child's return within that one year and the child has now adjusted to that new country.Foreign court decrees of divorce or dissolution of marriage are valid in India provided such decree is according to the provision of law in India as provided under section 13 of the Civil Procedure Code and Principle of law as laid down by the Indian courts. A foreign court divorce decree may be valid in India ONLY if the spouse had lived in that country and had consented to that country's jurisdiction.Decree of Divorce by a foreign Court is also valid in India if there is no challenge by the other party. If both of you go for amutual consent divorce, then it is recognised and valid in India.. If someone has accepted the authority of a court, it cannot be open to the person to later question the authority of the court.So think about the nature of custody about the child ,visitation right etc.. before filing a divorce.As per the latest Supreme Court judgement which had held that a decree of divorce granted by a foreign court is not valid in India if the ground is not recognised by Indian law. But in the case of custody of Child , the paramount consideration is the welfare of child.Amutual consent divorceis the best idea. So think about which law is more beneficial to youAjay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

    "answer": "From your question is clear that you intent do be in marriage. Even if she obtains a no fault decree of divorce, such divorce is not valid in India and there no procedure in India for validation of decree of divorce from a foreign court.Following conditions are laid down for validity of divorce granted by foreign Court in by India by SC in case of Y. Narsimha Rao’s case (which are very difficult to meet)…The court that passed the decree has to be a court of competent jurisdiction which the Act or law under which the parties are married recognises as court of competent jurisdiction to entertain the matrimonial dispute. Any other court should be held to be a court without jurisdiction unless both the parties voluntarily and unconditionally subject themselves to the jurisdiction of that Court.Decision of foreign court should be on a ground available under the law under which the parties married and decision should be result of the contest between the parties. Many other conditions are mentioned but it is not necessary to look into all conditions as above two are sufficient to question the divorce decree from a foreign Court. You need only to deny the jurisdiction of U.S. court that will invalidate the decree of divorce obtained by her.Your second question: it is futile exercise and waste of money to file any Section 9 petition. For two reasons…A decree obtained under Section 9 is not worthless as no court can force a spouse to join the other.If she fails to join for two years after decree, you will be entitled to file and obtain divorce. Such decree will ultimately leads to divorce.There is no need to do anything in India if you are not interested in divorce. When she tries to enforce the decree of divorce, you can successfully challenge it.As all kids are above five, you are entitled to their custody under Section 6 of HMGA.Ravi ShindeAdvocate, Hyderabad4923 Answers42 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ravi Shinde"

    "question": "Divorce Dutch citizen (Indian origin) and Indian citizen",
    "answer": "When both the parties were India & married in India according to any of the India form of marriage then the dissolution of such marriage should be done through the Indian Family Court of the competent jurisdiction where the marriage took place or where either of the parties usually reside or where both the parties last resided together.Who wish to take benefit of Indian laws and legal system to avoid facing up to any foreign judicial system.If divorce is inevitable, bitter battles cannot be the option to settle issues of child custody and access. Custody of a child, when parents divorce, only implies as to who the child will physically reside with. Both parents continue to be natural guardians. Family law courts generally base decisions on the best interests of the child or children, not always on the best arguments of each parent.The Supreme Court of India has consistently held that in deciding cases of child custody‘the first and paramount consideration is the welfare and interest of the child and not the rights of the parents under a statute.But in the Dutch system of law, in relation to the welfare of children, the Act on Parental Responsibility is the primary source of law. issues of children are not dealt with in a divorce case, but in separate processes.Jurisdiction in relation to children is governed by the Child Protection Convention for signatory countries. According to Articles 5 to 14 of the Child Protection Convention, jurisdiction is based on grounds mostly relating to the habitual residence of the child.Where the child is wrongfully removed or retained in another country and the child had his or her habitual residence in Denmark just before the wrongful removal or retention. This does not apply if more than one year has passed since the parent with parental rights was aware of where the child is, and that parent has not asked for the child's return within that one year and the child has now adjusted to that new country.Foreign court decrees of divorce or dissolution of marriage are valid in India provided such decree is according to the provision of law in India as provided under section 13 of the Civil Procedure Code and Principle of law as laid down by the Indian courts. A foreign court divorce decree may be valid in India ONLY if the spouse had lived in that country and had consented to that country's jurisdiction.Decree of Divorce by a foreign Court is also valid in India if there is no challenge by the other party. If both of you go for amutual consent divorce, then it is recognised and valid in India.. If someone has accepted the authority of a court, it cannot be open to the person to later question the authority of the court.So think about the nature of custody about the child ,visitation right etc.. before filing a divorce.As per the latest Supreme Court judgement which had held that a decree of divorce granted by a foreign court is not valid in India if the ground is not recognised by Indian law. But in the case of custody of Child , the paramount consideration is the welfare of child.Amutual consent divorceis the best idea. So think about which law is more beneficial to youAjay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

    "answer": "- As per law, if wife is not supporting her husband for the enjoyment of life and denying relation, then the husband can get divorce after filing a divorce petition before the court on this ground.Further, As per Delhi High Court, physical intimacy is an essential aspect of marriage and a wife's continuous refusal to have such relationship with her husband can be a ground for divorce,- Further, as per Indian law, aMutual Consent Divorcegranted by foreign Court is considered as valid, legal and binding in Indian Courts by virtue of section 13 and 14 of CPC and also on account of comity of Nations.- Further, if the matter is contested between parties in foreign Court, and after due adjudication and trial, divorce is granted, then it will be valid and binding in India.- Further, if the matter is uncontested, one party comes back to India where marriage had taken place and contest proceedings in India, divorce as granted by foreign Court will not be applicable in India.- Hence, if you both are residing in one place and file a joint petition in that country of residence , then the decree of divorce granted by that country court will be valid in India.- If you both are on two different place , then you both can file mutual divorce petition in India as the marriage was solemnized here, and your appearance on each date is not mandatory.- You can settle the dispute of the custody of child at the time of divorce.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Divorce Dutch citizen (Indian origin) and Indian citizen",
    "answer": "When both the parties were India & married in India according to any of the India form of marriage then the dissolution of such marriage should be done through the Indian Family Court of the competent jurisdiction where the marriage took place or where either of the parties usually reside or where both the parties last resided together.Who wish to take benefit of Indian laws and legal system to avoid facing up to any foreign judicial system.If divorce is inevitable, bitter battles cannot be the option to settle issues of child custody and access. Custody of a child, when parents divorce, only implies as to who the child will physically reside with. Both parents continue to be natural guardians. Family law courts generally base decisions on the best interests of the child or children, not always on the best arguments of each parent.The Supreme Court of India has consistently held that in deciding cases of child custody‘the first and paramount consideration is the welfare and interest of the child and not the rights of the parents under a statute.But in the Dutch system of law, in relation to the welfare of children, the Act on Parental Responsibility is the primary source of law. issues of children are not dealt with in a divorce case, but in separate processes.Jurisdiction in relation to children is governed by the Child Protection Convention for signatory countries. According to Articles 5 to 14 of the Child Protection Convention, jurisdiction is based on grounds mostly relating to the habitual residence of the child.Where the child is wrongfully removed or retained in another country and the child had his or her habitual residence in Denmark just before the wrongful removal or retention. This does not apply if more than one year has passed since the parent with parental rights was aware of where the child is, and that parent has not asked for the child's return within that one year and the child has now adjusted to that new country.Foreign court decrees of divorce or dissolution of marriage are valid in India provided such decree is according to the provision of law in India as provided under section 13 of the Civil Procedure Code and Principle of law as laid down by the Indian courts. A foreign court divorce decree may be valid in India ONLY if the spouse had lived in that country and had consented to that country's jurisdiction.Decree of Divorce by a foreign Court is also valid in India if there is no challenge by the other party. If both of you go for amutual consent divorce, then it is recognised and valid in India.. If someone has accepted the authority of a court, it cannot be open to the person to later question the authority of the court.So think about the nature of custody about the child ,visitation right etc.. before filing a divorce.As per the latest Supreme Court judgement which had held that a decree of divorce granted by a foreign court is not valid in India if the ground is not recognised by Indian law. But in the case of custody of Child , the paramount consideration is the welfare of child.Amutual consent divorceis the best idea. So think about which law is more beneficial to youAjay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

    "question": "Section 9, HMA 1955",
    "answer": "From your question is clear that you intent do be in marriage. Even if she obtains a no fault decree of divorce, such divorce is not valid in India and there no procedure in India for validation of decree of divorce from a foreign court.Following conditions are laid down for validity of divorce granted by foreign Court in by India by SC in case of Y. Narsimha Rao’s case (which are very difficult to meet)…The court that passed the decree has to be a court of competent jurisdiction which the Act or law under which the parties are married recognises as court of competent jurisdiction to entertain the matrimonial dispute. Any other court should be held to be a court without jurisdiction unless both the parties voluntarily and unconditionally subject themselves to the jurisdiction of that Court.Decision of foreign court should be on a ground available under the law under which the parties married and decision should be result of the contest between the parties. Many other conditions are mentioned but it is not necessary to look into all conditions as above two are sufficient to question the divorce decree from a foreign Court. You need only to deny the jurisdiction of U.S. court that will invalidate the decree of divorce obtained by her.Your second question: it is futile exercise and waste of money to file any Section 9 petition. For two reasons…A decree obtained under Section 9 is not worthless as no court can force a spouse to join the other.If she fails to join for two years after decree, you will be entitled to file and obtain divorce. Such decree will ultimately leads to divorce.There is no need to do anything in India if you are not interested in divorce. When she tries to enforce the decree of divorce, you can successfully challenge it.As all kids are above five, you are entitled to their custody under Section 6 of HMGA.Ravi ShindeAdvocate, Hyderabad4923 Answers42 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ravi Shinde"

    "answer": "If the property has been held by the owners for over 2 years then the TDS in respect of sale of immovable property by sellers holding foreign citizenship is 20%+cess+Surcharge.The TDS is required to be deducted whenever any payment is made to the NRI for purchase of property.Even if the advance is being paid for purchase of property,  TDS is required to be deducted.Even if the value of property is less than Rs. 50 lakhs,  this TDS is required to be deducted.If the TDS is wrongly deducted or not deducted then the income tax department will not do anything to the seller but will catch hold of the buyer of the property to deposit the TDS. If the buyer forgot to deposit or deposit less amount towards TDS then the income tax department would recover the TDS from the buyer.Even if the seller has Indian pan card or AADHAR card,  he can still be considered a  NRI.  The residential status is determined only on the basis of number of days spent in India.If the seller gets a certificate from the income tax department for computation of capital gains,  the TDS may be deducted at a  lower rateT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Essential points to follow during finding out whether the seller is a resident or NRICountries’ citizenship does not matter during finding out if the seller is a resident or non-resident in India. Despite when an individual is a citizen of India however lives in a foreign country he will be recognized as a non-resident for income tax purposes. The income tax act does not discuss citizenship it only reveals the number of days spent in India.Despite if the seller owns an Indian Aadhaar card and PAN card he would still recognize as a non-resident in India.The number of days spent in India reveals the residential status of the person and it does not reveal on the grounds of the Aadhaar Card or PAN Card. The type of bank account of the seller does not have any influence on the residential status of the seller. It is due to the person does not convert his resident savings account to NRI bank accounts he would still acknowledge as a non-resident.You may ask the seller toobtain the certificate from the income tax department to calculate the capital gains that would diminish the TDS to be deducted.Various documents such as Purchase Price, Date of Purchase, any expenses on Renovation/ Construction, and others are needed to be submitted including with Form 13. The income tax officer would review these documents and if he accepted then he would provide a certificate for the lesser TDS deduction.When the seller would not able to get the certificate then the TDS shall be deducted on the sale value and would be rendered towards the surplus deduction of TDS.If the TDS is wrongly deducted or not deducted then the income tax department will not do anything to the seller but will catch hold of the buyer of the property to deposit the TDS. If the buyer forgot to deposit or deposit less amount towards TDS then the income tax department would recover the TDS from the buyer.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "NRI POA for sale transaction",
    "answer": "It is true that POA attested by Indian consulate and then notarised back in India is good enough to be valid for all matters in India under Section .33(1)(c) of the Registration Act, 1908. The  officials  in U.P. might have put off by notification of POA in Thane overlooking the  attestation by Indian Embassy. Submit your document for Registrar with attested POA and ask them to reject the  registration as POA is notarized in Thane. They cannot do that as there is lengthy procedure for rejection of registration giving legal and valid causes for rejection. You can also confront them with the  provision of law.Ravi ShindeAdvocate, Hyderabad4923 Answers42 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ravi Shinde"

    "answer": "Essential points to follow during finding out whether the seller is a resident or NRICountries’ citizenship does not matter during finding out if the seller is a resident or non-resident in India. Despite when an individual is a citizen of India however lives in a foreign country he will be recognized as a non-resident for income tax purposes. The income tax act does not discuss citizenship it only reveals the number of days spent in India.Despite if the seller owns an Indian Aadhaar card and PAN card he would still recognize as a non-resident in India.The number of days spent in India reveals the residential status of the person and it does not reveal on the grounds of the Aadhaar Card or PAN Card. The type of bank account of the seller does not have any influence on the residential status of the seller. It is due to the person does not convert his resident savings account to NRI bank accounts he would still acknowledge as a non-resident.You may ask the seller toobtain the certificate from the income tax department to calculate the capital gains that would diminish the TDS to be deducted.Various documents such as Purchase Price, Date of Purchase, any expenses on Renovation/ Construction, and others are needed to be submitted including with Form 13. The income tax officer would review these documents and if he accepted then he would provide a certificate for the lesser TDS deduction.When the seller would not able to get the certificate then the TDS shall be deducted on the sale value and would be rendered towards the surplus deduction of TDS.If the TDS is wrongly deducted or not deducted then the income tax department will not do anything to the seller but will catch hold of the buyer of the property to deposit the TDS. If the buyer forgot to deposit or deposit less amount towards TDS then the income tax department would recover the TDS from the buyer.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"
