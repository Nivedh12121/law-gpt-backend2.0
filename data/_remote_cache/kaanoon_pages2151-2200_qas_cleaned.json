    "answer": "You people should work strategically. You people should authorise a person to deal on behalf of all persons of group. The report of police that the matter involved is of civil dispute is incorrect. Your case is of cheating and forgery etc and there are several incidents of such fraud and cheatings by various renowned builders. You should file protest petition against the police report. Mere filing of FIR does not amount to defamation unless other conditions are not full filled. In your case no case of section 211 is made out on various grounds.1. No, it is not a case of false FIR. Court has to proceed in terms of law. Case is required to be contested properly.2. It depends upon wisdom of society.3. No case of defamation is made out.

    "question": "Financial fraud as promised flat not delivered",
    "answer": "Dear client  false FIR: If the police have conducted an investigation and concluded that there are no financial irregularities or criminal offenses committed by the society management committee, it may be difficult for them to prove that the FIR was false. However, the final decision rests with the magistrate. If you believe that the FIR was filed in good faith and there was a reasonable basis for your complaint, you can present your case to the court.Selective targeting: It's possible for the society to file a complaint against specific individuals rather than all ten complainants, but this would depend on the evidence and circumstances of the case. The court will assess the validity of the complaint based on the evidence and arguments presented.Defamation: The statement you mentioned in the FIR, claiming that the management committee members have duped people of their hard-earned money, may be considered defamatory if it harms their reputation. Defamation cases require proving that the statement was false and caused harm to the reputation of the individuals involved. If the statement is found to be false and made with the intent to harm their reputation, they may pursue a defamation case against you. It would be best to consult with a lawyer who specializes in defamation cases to understand the specific legal implications in your jurisdiction.Regarding the society's collection of money and selling unauthorized flats, it may be necessary to consult with a lawyer who specializes in real estate and property laws. They can provide you with the best advice on whether the society's actions constitute a crime or a civil dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Will and settlement forgery",
    "answer": "Dear client,From the information you've provided, it appears that there are multiple legal issues involved, including the validity of the will, the alleged fraudulent settlement, and the sale of the properties. Proving fraud can be challenging, as it requires substantial evidence and legal arguments. The lack of medical records for your grandmother's health and the uncertainty surrounding the fabrication of the settlement may complicate matters.To challenge the sale and potentially nullify it, you may need to present evidence and arguments to demonstrate that the sale was invalid or conducted unlawfully. This may include proving that the settlement was fraudulent, establishing that your grandfather did not have the legal right to sell the properties, or showing that the sale was made under duress or undue influence. A skilled attorney can guide you through the process and help you build a strong legal case.Regarding the priority between the will and the settlement, the specific language and terms of each document, as well as the applicable laws in your jurisdiction, will determine their legal standing. An attorney familiar with property and inheritance laws in your area can review the documents and advise you on their impact and validity.It is worth noting that legal proceedings can be lengthy, complex, and costly. The outcome of any legal case depends on the specific facts and evidence presented, as well as the interpretation and application of the law by the court. Consulting with a lawyer will give you a better understanding of the legal possibilities and the likelihood of success in your particular situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Land divided and sold to multiple buyers",
    "answer": "Dear client,In this scenario, the division of the land into two portions of 300 sq yards and 150 sq yards indicates that there are two separate buyers involved. The distribution of the original copies and certified copies of the link documents may vary depending on the agreement between the parties involved and the customary practices in the jurisdiction where the transaction takes place. However, here is a general understanding:Original Copies of Link Documents: Typically, the original copies of link documents, such as the title deed, previous sale deeds, and other relevant documents establishing the chain of ownership, are handed over to the buyer who purchases the larger portion of the land, in this case, buyer1 with 300 sq yards. The larger portion is often deemed more significant and thus granted the original copies.Certified Copies of Link Documents: The buyer who purchases the smaller portion of the land, buyer2 with 150 sq yards, usually receives certified copies of the link documents. These certified copies serve as evidence of ownership and provide necessary information about the history of the land's ownership.It's important to note that the actual distribution of the documents can be influenced by the agreement between the parties involved or specific circumstances surrounding the transaction. It is advisable to consult with a real estate lawyer or legal professional to ensure compliance with local laws and regulations and to clarify the specific terms and conditions of the land sale agreement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The MOU can specify that in case of any future necessity, such as the sale of the 150 sq yard land by buyer 2, the party possessing the original link document should provide it to facilitate the transaction.This agreement can help ensure transparency, clarity, and trust between the parties involved and mitigate potential disputes or complications in the future.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "As the landed property is owned your mother, first she has to transfer it among the three of you in some equitable percentage, say, in proportion to the expenditure each of you incurred, by means of a settlement deed which needs to be registered duly. Then each of you will be legally entitled to an undivided share of the land over which the superstructure is built. Afterwards, the three of you can execute a partition deed dividing the construction floor wise for the sake of practicality, mentioning all the relevant facts, such as your mother's settlement deed, the share of undivided portion of land for each, the amount of contribution made by each of you for construction of flats etc., and register it. As for the common areas such as car parking, rooftop terrace, lifts, generators etc., recite in the partition deed that these are meant for common possession and enjoyment and none of you  could claim any exclusive right.Swaminathan NeelakantanAdvocate, Coimbatore3023 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Swaminathan Neelakantan"

    "question": "Divide construction property",
    "answer": "Dear client, below I have provided some important information.Dividing the property equally: To divide the property equally among the three brothers, you have a few options.a) Partition Deed: A partition deed is a legal document that allows for the division of jointly owned property. It can be used to allocate specific portions of the property to each brother, specifying their respective rights and responsibilities. This can be a tax-efficient solution as it ensures each brother receives his fair share without additional tax implications.b) Will: If your mother is willing, she can draft a will that clearly states her intentions to divide the property equally among her three sons. However, it's important to consider the potential tax implications of inheriting the property through a will, as inheritance tax laws vary by jurisdiction.c) Registration of individual floors: Another option could be to register each floor or apartment in the name of each brother individually. This would provide individual ownership and may simplify the process of selling individual units in the future. However, it's crucial to consult with a local attorney to understand the legal and tax implications of this option.Selling the property in the future: If you wish to sell the property in the future, the method of sale would depend on how the property was divided among the brothers.If a partition deed was executed, each brother would have a specified portion of the property in his name, allowing for independent sale of their respective portions.If the property was divided through a will, the property would pass to the brothers as per the terms of the will. To sell the property, the brothers would need to follow the legal procedures and requirements for selling inherited property.If individual floors were registered in each brother's name, they would have independent ownership, and selling their respective units would be similar to selling any other individual property.In any case, it is advisable to consult with a local attorney to understand the specific legal requirements and procedures for selling property in your jurisdiction.Stilt parking and roof rights: To address the issue of stilt parking and roof rights, it would be advisable to have a clear agreement or documentation that outlines the rights and responsibilities of each brother. This agreement could specify the allocated parking spaces for each unit and any restrictions or guidelines for the use of the roof area. Having a legally binding agreement can help prevent conflicts in the future and ensure that everyone understands their rights and obligations.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Will and settlement forgery",
    "answer": "Dear client,From the information you've provided, it appears that there are multiple legal issues involved, including the validity of the will, the alleged fraudulent settlement, and the sale of the properties. Proving fraud can be challenging, as it requires substantial evidence and legal arguments. The lack of medical records for your grandmother's health and the uncertainty surrounding the fabrication of the settlement may complicate matters.To challenge the sale and potentially nullify it, you may need to present evidence and arguments to demonstrate that the sale was invalid or conducted unlawfully. This may include proving that the settlement was fraudulent, establishing that your grandfather did not have the legal right to sell the properties, or showing that the sale was made under duress or undue influence. A skilled attorney can guide you through the process and help you build a strong legal case.Regarding the priority between the will and the settlement, the specific language and terms of each document, as well as the applicable laws in your jurisdiction, will determine their legal standing. An attorney familiar with property and inheritance laws in your area can review the documents and advise you on their impact and validity.It is worth noting that legal proceedings can be lengthy, complex, and costly. The outcome of any legal case depends on the specific facts and evidence presented, as well as the interpretation and application of the law by the court. Consulting with a lawyer will give you a better understanding of the legal possibilities and the likelihood of success in your particular situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Wife have file two Domestic Violence Act 12 cases in same court? Is this legal",
    "answer": "Requesting the Judge to dispose of the first DV case: If you believe that the case has been pending for an extended period and there has been no progress, you can discuss the matter with your lawyer. They can advise you on the appropriate steps to request the court to dispose of the case or expedite the proceedings. This may involve filing an application or petition with the court, explaining the reasons for seeking a prompt resolution.Filing two DV cases: Generally, it is possible for a person to file multiple cases under the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005, if they allege different incidents or instances ofdomestic violence. However, it is important to note that the specific provisions of the law and the legal requirements may vary depending on your jurisdiction. It would be best to consult with your lawyer to understand the applicable laws and regulations in your situation.Requesting the Judge to dispose of the second DV case: Similar to the first case, if you believe that the second DV case is duplicative or lacks merit, you can discuss this concern with your lawyer. They can guide you on the appropriate legal steps to address the issue. This may involve requesting the court to dismiss the second case or consolidate it with the first case, depending on the circumstances.Filing a misconduct case against the prosecution attorney: If you believe that the prosecution attorney has acted unethically or inappropriately, you may consider filing a complaint with the appropriate Bar Council or legal authority in your jurisdiction. The Bar Council or disciplinary authority can investigate the matter and take appropriate action if they find any violation of professional ethics or misconduct.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard.Multiple proceedings on same cause of action are abuse of court process. A cause of action is the technical legal name for the set of facts which give rise to a claim enforceable in court. It is a legally recognized wrong that creates the right to sue. Each cause of action consists of points the plaintiff must prove and all of these elements must be satisfied in order to take court action.No two cases on same facts are maintainable. You can request the judge to dispose it and impose exorbitant cost. In case of Central Bureau of Investigation, Hyderabad Vs. K.Narayana decided in 2012, Hon’ble Supreme Court has ruled that a lawyer cannot be prosecuted for giving wrong advice to a bank unless there was proof to show that he was part of a conspiracy to defraud the bank. Therefore, taking into consideration this Hon'ble Supreme Court judgement, no action can be taken against the counsel.You may contact my secretary to connect with for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on Record & Amicus CuriaeSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

The recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission are typically implemented by the central government for its employees.Private engineering colleges that do not receive any kind of government aid are not directly mandated to implement the 7th Pay Commission recommendations. The application of the 7th Pay Commission in private educational institutions, including private engineering colleges, is not universal and may vary depending on the specific policies and agreements in place between the institution and its employees.Regarding the mandate of the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), I am unable to provide information on any specific updates or requirements after September 2021.

    "question": "Land divided and sold to multiple buyers",
    "answer": "Dear client,In this scenario, the division of the land into two portions of 300 sq yards and 150 sq yards indicates that there are two separate buyers involved. The distribution of the original copies and certified copies of the link documents may vary depending on the agreement between the parties involved and the customary practices in the jurisdiction where the transaction takes place. However, here is a general understanding:Original Copies of Link Documents: Typically, the original copies of link documents, such as the title deed, previous sale deeds, and other relevant documents establishing the chain of ownership, are handed over to the buyer who purchases the larger portion of the land, in this case, buyer1 with 300 sq yards. The larger portion is often deemed more significant and thus granted the original copies.Certified Copies of Link Documents: The buyer who purchases the smaller portion of the land, buyer2 with 150 sq yards, usually receives certified copies of the link documents. These certified copies serve as evidence of ownership and provide necessary information about the history of the land's ownership.It's important to note that the actual distribution of the documents can be influenced by the agreement between the parties involved or specific circumstances surrounding the transaction. It is advisable to consult with a real estate lawyer or legal professional to ensure compliance with local laws and regulations and to clarify the specific terms and conditions of the land sale agreement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The MOU can specify that in case of any future necessity, such as the sale of the 150 sq yard land by buyer 2, the party possessing the original link document should provide it to facilitate the transaction.This agreement can help ensure transparency, clarity, and trust between the parties involved and mitigate potential disputes or complications in the future.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

While I can provide general guidance, it's always recommended to consult with a legal professional or a real estate expert who can advise you based on the most up-to-date information and specific details of your situation.In India, the requirements and procedures for purchasing property can vary, so it's important to understand the legal framework and adhere to the necessary regulations. Regarding the GPA, the specific requirements may differ based on the state where the property is located. However, here are some general guidelines:General Power of Attorney (GPA): A GPA is a legal document that allows someone to act on your behalf in various matters, including property transactions. In this case, you would grant the GPA to your mother, authorizing her to handle the purchase of the residential plot.Notarization: Generally, it's advisable to notarize the GPA document to ensure its validity and authenticity. You can have the document notarized by a registered notary in Texas, USA. Notarization provides an official stamp of authenticity to the document.Attestation: Depending on the requirements of the Indian jurisdiction, you may need to get the GPA document attested by the Indian Embassy/Consulate in the USA. This is usually done to ensure that the document is recognized and accepted in India. Contact the nearest Indian Embassy/Consulate for specific information on their attestation process.Additional Requirements: Apart from the GPA, you may also need to provide other documents, such as proof of identity, proof of address, and any other documents requested by the relevant authorities in India. These requirements can vary, so it's crucial to consult with legal professionals who are familiar with the regulations in Bengaluru.To ensure compliance with all legal requirements, it's strongly recommended to consult with a lawyer specializing in property law or a real estate expert who can guide you through the process and assist you with the necessary documentation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,From the information you've provided, it appears that there are multiple legal issues involved, including the validity of the will, the alleged fraudulent settlement, and the sale of the properties. Proving fraud can be challenging, as it requires substantial evidence and legal arguments. The lack of medical records for your grandmother's health and the uncertainty surrounding the fabrication of the settlement may complicate matters.To challenge the sale and potentially nullify it, you may need to present evidence and arguments to demonstrate that the sale was invalid or conducted unlawfully. This may include proving that the settlement was fraudulent, establishing that your grandfather did not have the legal right to sell the properties, or showing that the sale was made under duress or undue influence. A skilled attorney can guide you through the process and help you build a strong legal case.Regarding the priority between the will and the settlement, the specific language and terms of each document, as well as the applicable laws in your jurisdiction, will determine their legal standing. An attorney familiar with property and inheritance laws in your area can review the documents and advise you on their impact and validity.It is worth noting that legal proceedings can be lengthy, complex, and costly. The outcome of any legal case depends on the specific facts and evidence presented, as well as the interpretation and application of the law by the court.

The recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission are typically implemented by the central government for its employees.Private engineering colleges that do not receive any kind of government aid are not directly mandated to implement the 7th Pay Commission recommendations. The application of the 7th Pay Commission in private educational institutions, including private engineering colleges, is not universal and may vary depending on the specific policies and agreements in place between the institution and its employees.Regarding the mandate of the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), I am unable to provide information on any specific updates or requirements after September 2021.

    "answer": "section 2(47)(i) of the  Income Tax Act, transfer in relation to a capital asset, includes, the sale, exchange or relinquishment of assets.2)The release when effected upon receipt of consideration becomes a deed of conveyance. The Honble Supreme Court in the judgment reported in AIR 1966 SC 337 (Thayyil Mammo And Anr. vs Kottiath Ramunni And Ors.) has held as follows:\"In Hemendra Nath Mukerji v. Kumar Nath Roy, 12 Cal WN 478, by a registered deed called a deed of disclaimer the executants relinquished all their right, title and interest and claim in the properties in favour of the releasee upon the condition that the releasee would discharge certain debts and the executants would be under no liability to pay those debts. Though the deed was stamped only as a release and not with ad valorem stamp, Maclean, C. J. held that on its true construction it was a transfer. We think that a registered instrument styled a release deed releasing the right, title and interest of the executant in any property in favour of the releasee for valuable consideration may operate as a conveyance, if the document clearly discloses an intention to effect a transfer. In the instant case, Ex. B-2 clearly discloses an intention to transfer all the rights of Baithan to defendants 1 to 5, and though the word \"surrender\" is used and though the deed is styled a release deed, it operates as an assignment.\"3) when you are relinquishing property for monetary consideration, it will result in capital gains for the transferor.and you have to pay income tax on consideration received by youAjay SethiAdvocate, Mumbai98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi"

    "answer": "An irreversible legal document or instrument is used when a legal heir irrevocably relinquishes or releases his or her legal rights in an inherited property for another legal heir, such as their mother, son, daughter, brother, sister, etc. The relinquishment deed needs to be registered with the sub-registrar in order to be valid legally. Only the portion of the property being given up is subject to stamp duty; the entire worth of the property is not. If the property is transferred by a relinquishment deed for a payment, the transferor will unavoidably incur capital gains under the IT Act, and no tax benefits would follow.The amount settled or market value of the property transferred under the registered relinquishment deed would attract the capital gains tax as applicableT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Income tax on giving up my rights as a beneficiary",
    "answer": "The tax implications of giving up your rights as a beneficiary and receiving monetary compensation, as well as vacating your father's premises and receiving compensation from your sister, may vary depending on the specific circumstances and the tax laws of your jurisdiction. It's important to consult with a qualified tax advisor or chartered accountant who can provide personalized advice based on your individual situation and the applicable tax laws.Regarding giving up your rights as a beneficiary and receiving monetary compensation, the tax treatment could depend on factors such as the nature of the rights being given up, the source of the compensation, and the tax laws governing such transactions in your jurisdiction. Generally, if the compensation received is in the nature of a capital receipt, it may be treated differently for tax purposes compared to compensation received as income.Regarding vacating your father's premises and receiving compensation from your sister, it could involve aspects of property transfer, rental income, or capital gains, depending on the specific details of the arrangement. Again, the tax treatment would depend on the applicable tax laws, the purpose of the transaction, and the specific nature of the compensation received.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Therefore, once extinguishment of any right in a property comes under definition of ‘transfer’, as defined u/s.2(47) of the Act, then consequential consideration received for transfer of property would come under the provisions of section 45 of the Income Tax Act, 1961.- You should contact an Income tax practitioner for getting a fruitful suggestions.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "Primary distinctions between Lease and Licence:1. A lease is a transfer of an interest in a specific immovable property, while licence is a bare permission, without any transfer of an interest.2. A lease creates an interest in favour of the leassee with respect of the property, but a licence does not create such an interest.3. A lease is both transferable and heritable, a sub tenancy can be created by the tenant and on the death of the tenant, the tenancy can be inherited by his/her legal heir, whereas, licence is neither transferable nor heritable.4. A licence comes to an end with the death of either the grantor or the grantee, since it is a personal contract, but a lease does not comes to an end on either the death of the grantor or grantee.5. A licence can be withdrawn at any time at the pleasure of the grantor but the lease can come to an end only in accordance with the terms and condition stipulated in the contract of tenancy agreement.6. A lease is unaffected by the transfer of the property by sale in favour of a third party. It continues and the purchaser has to wait till the time period for which the tenancy was created is over before he can get the possession, whereas, in case of a licence, if the property is sold to a third party, it comes to n end immediately.In the case ofMunicipal Corporation of Delhi vs. Pradip Oil Corporation and Anr. the Delhi High Court, made an important observation that a mere license does not create interest in the property to which it relates. Lease on the other hand, would amount to transfer of property. License may be personal or contractual.In the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi,it is mandatory to register the leave and license agreement for the rental period of more than 11 months.

    "question": "Leave and license agreement vs Lease agreeement",
    "answer": "Lease Agreement: A lease agreement typically grants exclusive possession and control of the property to the tenant for a specified duration. Here are some pros and cons to consider:Pros:Stability: A lease provides stability as it is usually for a longer duration, such as 1 year or more, and ensures consistent rental income.Rent Increase Control: The lease agreement can include clauses that limit the frequency and amount of rent increases during the lease term.Legal Protections: A lease agreement provides legal protections to both parties, outlining their rights and responsibilities.Cons:Limited Flexibility: A lease agreement restricts the landlord's ability to terminate the tenancy before the specified duration, which may be a disadvantage if the landlord wants to use or sell the property.Longer Vacancy Periods: If a tenant chooses not to renew the lease, there may be a longer period of vacancy between tenants.Leave and License Agreement: A leave and license agreement grants permission or a license to occupy the property for a specific period. Here are some pros and cons to consider:Pros:Flexibility: A leave and license agreement provides more flexibility to the landlord as it allows for the termination of the agreement after the license period expires.Quick Possession: Since the agreement is typically for a shorter duration, the landlord can regain possession of the property relatively quickly if needed.Cons:Uncertainty: A leave and license agreement gives the licensee the right to occupy the property, which means the licensee may have certain rights that can make eviction more challenging compared to a lease agreement.Frequent Renewals: If the licensee wants to continue occupying the property, the agreement may require frequent renewals, resulting in more administrative work and potential negotiation of terms.Regarding the issue of stamp duty, please note that stamp duty laws and regulations can vary by jurisdiction. It's essential to consult with a local lawyer to understand the specific stamp duty requirements and exemptions in your area.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

A lease is both transferable and heritable, a sub tenancy can be created by the tenant and on the death of the tenant, the tenancy can be inherited by his/her legal heir, whereas, licence is neither transferable nor heritable.4. A licence comes to an end with the death of either the grantor or the grantee, since it is a personal contract, but a lease does not comes to an end on either the death of the grantor or grantee.5. A licence can be withdrawn at any time at the pleasure of the grantor but the lease can come to an end only in accordance with the terms and condition stipulated in the contract of tenancy agreement.6. A lease is unaffected by the transfer of the property by sale in favour of a third party. It continues and the purchaser has to wait till the time period for which the tenancy was created is over before he can get the possession, whereas, in case of a licence, if the property is sold to a third party, it comes to n end immediately.In the case ofMunicipal Corporation of Delhi vs. Pradip Oil Corporation and Anr. the Delhi High Court, made an important observation that a mere license does not create interest in the property to which it relates. Lease on the other hand, would amount to transfer of property. License may be personal or contractual.In the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi,it is mandatory to register the leave and license agreement for the rental period of more than 11 months. Registering a rent agreement is optional in case the rental period is less than or equal to 11 months.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Leave and license agreement vs Lease agreeement",
    "answer": "Lease Agreement: A lease agreement typically grants exclusive possession and control of the property to the tenant for a specified duration. Here are some pros and cons to consider:Pros:Stability: A lease provides stability as it is usually for a longer duration, such as 1 year or more, and ensures consistent rental income.Rent Increase Control: The lease agreement can include clauses that limit the frequency and amount of rent increases during the lease term.Legal Protections: A lease agreement provides legal protections to both parties, outlining their rights and responsibilities.Cons:Limited Flexibility: A lease agreement restricts the landlord's ability to terminate the tenancy before the specified duration, which may be a disadvantage if the landlord wants to use or sell the property.Longer Vacancy Periods: If a tenant chooses not to renew the lease, there may be a longer period of vacancy between tenants.Leave and License Agreement: A leave and license agreement grants permission or a license to occupy the property for a specific period. Here are some pros and cons to consider:Pros:Flexibility: A leave and license agreement provides more flexibility to the landlord as it allows for the termination of the agreement after the license period expires.Quick Possession: Since the agreement is typically for a shorter duration, the landlord can regain possession of the property relatively quickly if needed.Cons:Uncertainty: A leave and license agreement gives the licensee the right to occupy the property, which means the licensee may have certain rights that can make eviction more challenging compared to a lease agreement.Frequent Renewals: If the licensee wants to continue occupying the property, the agreement may require frequent renewals, resulting in more administrative work and potential negotiation of terms.Regarding the issue of stamp duty, please note that stamp duty laws and regulations can vary by jurisdiction. It's essential to consult with a local lawyer to understand the specific stamp duty requirements and exemptions in your area.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can GPA holder give GPA to another person for same property",
    "answer": "Dear client,Based on the information provided, here are some insights:Q1. Given this situation, can I buy the property from O_new?The situation involves a chain of transactions where the property was initially owned by O_old and subsequently passed through A1, A2, and finally to O_new. However, the legality and validity of the transactions depend on the local laws and regulations governing property transfers in Bangalore, India.To ensure a safe purchase, it is crucial to conduct a thorough due diligence process, including verifying the authenticity and legality of the documents involved. Engaging the services of a qualified real estate lawyer would be highly recommended to review all the relevant documents and provide legal advice specific to your situation.Q2. Do I need any other documents to be sure of the purchase?Apart from the documents you've mentioned (GPA, confirmation deed), additional documents may be necessary to ensure a secure purchase. Some essential documents typically required in property transactions include:a. Sale deed: This document should contain the details of the property, the names of the buyer and seller, the sale price, and any specific conditions or clauses.b. Encumbrance certificate: This certificate provides information about any existing encumbrances, such as mortgages, liens, or claims on the property.c. Khata certificate and extract: These documents indicate the ownership details and the property's assessment for tax purposes.d. Completion certificate: If the property is part of a housing project, a completion certificate from the appropriate authority may be necessary.e. Occupancy certificate: This certificate is issued by the local municipal corporation or development authority and confirms that the building is constructed according to approved plans and is safe for occupancy.It's essential to consult with a real estate attorney or legal expert who can guide you on the specific documents required in your jurisdiction.Q3. What are the risks involved?There are potential risks associated with the situation you've described. Some of the risks could include:a. Legality of the transactions: It's important to verify the legality and validity of the GPA documents, including the registration processes followed. Improperly executed or unregistered GPAs may be considered invalid.b. Chain of title: The chain of title is the sequence of historical ownership transfers. Any gaps or irregularities in the chain of title could raise concerns about the property's ownership and affect your ability to establish clear and marketable title.c. Litigation or disputes: There is a risk that any previous or current owners may have legal disputes or claims against the property. These disputes can lead to litigation and potentially affect your ownership rights.d. Verification of documents: It's crucial to thoroughly examine the documents related to the property's ownership, including the GPAs, sale deeds, and any other relevant documents, to ensure their authenticity and legality.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Leave and license agreement vs Lease agreeement",
    "answer": "It is general misconception and also wrong notion that in case of lease or license agreement for 11 months the stamp duty is not payable. As per stamp Act every document including lease or license agreement fetch prescribed stamp duty which required to be affixed on document and to give legal entity every document is to be registered. The only difference between lease and license is that in case of license a person is granted license and permitted to use the premises in lieu of monthly license fee and the premises remain with licensor while in case of lease possession is also handed over to the tenant in lieu to monthly rent or lease money. If a document is not properly stamped and registered then such document though can be looked into for corroborating purpose only. In case of dispute court can sent such under stamped or unstained document to registrar of stamp who can impose 10 times penalty beside applicable stamp duty.So in the light of above  your understanding is incorrect and misconstrued about law of land and there is ever catch everywhere in such cases as elaborated by you.Siddharth SrivastavaAdvocate, Delhi1537 AnswersTalk to Advocate Siddharth Srivastava"

    "question": "Leave and license agreement vs Lease agreeement",
    "answer": "Primary distinctions between Lease and Licence:1. A lease is a transfer of an interest in a specific immovable property, while licence is a bare permission, without any transfer of an interest.2. A lease creates an interest in favour of the leassee with respect of the property, but a licence does not create such an interest.3. A lease is both transferable and heritable, a sub tenancy can be created by the tenant and on the death of the tenant, the tenancy can be inherited by his/her legal heir, whereas, licence is neither transferable nor heritable.4. A licence comes to an end with the death of either the grantor or the grantee, since it is a personal contract, but a lease does not comes to an end on either the death of the grantor or grantee.5. A licence can be withdrawn at any time at the pleasure of the grantor but the lease can come to an end only in accordance with the terms and condition stipulated in the contract of tenancy agreement.6. A lease is unaffected by the transfer of the property by sale in favour of a third party. It continues and the purchaser has to wait till the time period for which the tenancy was created is over before he can get the possession, whereas, in case of a licence, if the property is sold to a third party, it comes to n end immediately.In the case ofMunicipal Corporation of Delhi vs. Pradip Oil Corporation and Anr. the Delhi High Court, made an important observation that a mere license does not create interest in the property to which it relates. Lease on the other hand, would amount to transfer of property. License may be personal or contractual.In the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi,it is mandatory to register the leave and license agreement for the rental period of more than 11 months.

    "question": "Leave and license agreement vs Lease agreeement",
    "answer": "Lease Agreement: A lease agreement typically grants exclusive possession and control of the property to the tenant for a specified duration. Here are some pros and cons to consider:Pros:Stability: A lease provides stability as it is usually for a longer duration, such as 1 year or more, and ensures consistent rental income.Rent Increase Control: The lease agreement can include clauses that limit the frequency and amount of rent increases during the lease term.Legal Protections: A lease agreement provides legal protections to both parties, outlining their rights and responsibilities.Cons:Limited Flexibility: A lease agreement restricts the landlord's ability to terminate the tenancy before the specified duration, which may be a disadvantage if the landlord wants to use or sell the property.Longer Vacancy Periods: If a tenant chooses not to renew the lease, there may be a longer period of vacancy between tenants.Leave and License Agreement: A leave and license agreement grants permission or a license to occupy the property for a specific period. Here are some pros and cons to consider:Pros:Flexibility: A leave and license agreement provides more flexibility to the landlord as it allows for the termination of the agreement after the license period expires.Quick Possession: Since the agreement is typically for a shorter duration, the landlord can regain possession of the property relatively quickly if needed.Cons:Uncertainty: A leave and license agreement gives the licensee the right to occupy the property, which means the licensee may have certain rights that can make eviction more challenging compared to a lease agreement.Frequent Renewals: If the licensee wants to continue occupying the property, the agreement may require frequent renewals, resulting in more administrative work and potential negotiation of terms.Regarding the issue of stamp duty, please note that stamp duty laws and regulations can vary by jurisdiction. It's essential to consult with a local lawyer to understand the specific stamp duty requirements and exemptions in your area.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "section 2(47)(i) of the  Income Tax Act, transfer in relation to a capital asset, includes, the sale, exchange or relinquishment of assets.2)The release when effected upon receipt of consideration becomes a deed of conveyance. The Honble Supreme Court in the judgment reported in AIR 1966 SC 337 (Thayyil Mammo And Anr. vs Kottiath Ramunni And Ors.) has held as follows:\"In Hemendra Nath Mukerji v. Kumar Nath Roy, 12 Cal WN 478, by a registered deed called a deed of disclaimer the executants relinquished all their right, title and interest and claim in the properties in favour of the releasee upon the condition that the releasee would discharge certain debts and the executants would be under no liability to pay those debts. Though the deed was stamped only as a release and not with ad valorem stamp, Maclean, C. J. held that on its true construction it was a transfer. We think that a registered instrument styled a release deed releasing the right, title and interest of the executant in any property in favour of the releasee for valuable consideration may operate as a conveyance, if the document clearly discloses an intention to effect a transfer. In the instant case, Ex. B-2 clearly discloses an intention to transfer all the rights of Baithan to defendants 1 to 5, and though the word \"surrender\" is used and though the deed is styled a release deed, it operates as an assignment.\"3) when you are relinquishing property for monetary consideration, it will result in capital gains for the transferor.and you have to pay income tax on consideration received by youAjay SethiAdvocate, Mumbai98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi"

Only the portion of the property being given up is subject to stamp duty; the entire worth of the property is not.

It's important to consult with a qualified tax advisor or chartered accountant who can provide personalized advice based on your individual situation and the applicable tax laws.Regarding giving up your rights as a beneficiary and receiving monetary compensation, the tax treatment could depend on factors such as the nature of the rights being given up, the source of the compensation, and the tax laws governing such transactions in your jurisdiction. Generally, if the compensation received is in the nature of a capital receipt, it may be treated differently for tax purposes compared to compensation received as income.Regarding vacating your father's premises and receiving compensation from your sister, it could involve aspects of property transfer, rental income, or capital gains, depending on the specific details of the arrangement.

The distribution of the original copies and certified copies of the link documents may vary depending on the agreement between the parties involved and the customary practices in the jurisdiction where the transaction takes place. However, here is a general understanding:Original Copies of Link Documents: Typically, the original copies of link documents, such as the title deed, previous sale deeds, and other relevant documents establishing the chain of ownership, are handed over to the buyer who purchases the larger portion of the land, in this case, buyer1 with 300 sq yards. The larger portion is often deemed more significant and thus granted the original copies.Certified Copies of Link Documents: The buyer who purchases the smaller portion of the land, buyer2 with 150 sq yards, usually receives certified copies of the link documents. These certified copies serve as evidence of ownership and provide necessary information about the history of the land's ownership.It's important to note that the actual distribution of the documents can be influenced by the agreement between the parties involved or specific circumstances surrounding the transaction.

    "answer": "Dear client,As an NRI planning to purchase a residential plot in Bengaluru, India, and assigning your mother as the GPA (General Power of Attorney) holder, you will need to follow certain procedures and requirements. While I can provide general guidance, it's always recommended to consult with a legal professional or a real estate expert who can advise you based on the most up-to-date information and specific details of your situation.In India, the requirements and procedures for purchasing property can vary, so it's important to understand the legal framework and adhere to the necessary regulations. Regarding the GPA, the specific requirements may differ based on the state where the property is located. However, here are some general guidelines:General Power of Attorney (GPA): A GPA is a legal document that allows someone to act on your behalf in various matters, including property transactions. In this case, you would grant the GPA to your mother, authorizing her to handle the purchase of the residential plot.Notarization: Generally, it's advisable to notarize the GPA document to ensure its validity and authenticity. You can have the document notarized by a registered notary in Texas, USA. Notarization provides an official stamp of authenticity to the document.Attestation: Depending on the requirements of the Indian jurisdiction, you may need to get the GPA document attested by the Indian Embassy/Consulate in the USA. This is usually done to ensure that the document is recognized and accepted in India. Contact the nearest Indian Embassy/Consulate for specific information on their attestation process.Additional Requirements: Apart from the GPA, you may also need to provide other documents, such as proof of identity, proof of address, and any other documents requested by the relevant authorities in India. These requirements can vary, so it's crucial to consult with legal professionals who are familiar with the regulations in Bengaluru.To ensure compliance with all legal requirements, it's strongly recommended to consult with a lawyer specializing in property law or a real estate expert who can guide you through the process and assist you with the necessary documentation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The specific process for transferring ownership may vary depending on the laws and procedures of your jurisdiction.Typically, you will need to initiate the process of transferring the property to your name through a legal procedure such as a succession certificate, mutation of records, or obtaining a legal heir certificate. These documents establish your legal right to the property as the sole heir of your mother. The exact documents required and the process involved can vary based on the laws and regulations of your specific jurisdiction.Documents required: To sell the property, you will generally need the following documents:a. Proof of ownership: This includes the original sale deed or any subsequent transfer documents that establish your ownership of the property.b. Death certificate: You should have the original death certificate of your mother to establish her passing and your status as the sole heir.c. Transfer documents: The specific transfer documents required will depend on the laws of your jurisdiction. This may include a succession certificate, legal heir certificate, or mutation of records, as mentioned earlier.d. Encumbrance certificate: This certificate provides information about any existing encumbrances, such as mortgages, liens, or claims on the property.e.

    "question": "Overtime Work",
    "answer": "In India, the labor laws that govern overtime work and payment are primarily outlined in the Factories Act, 1948, and the Shops and Establishments Acts of respective states. The specific provisions of these acts may vary from state to state.Regarding overtime work, the law generally stipulates the following:Maximum working hours: The law sets a limit on the number of hours an employee can work in a day and a week. For example, in Maharashtra, the maximum working hours for adult workers in a day are 9 hours, and the maximum working hours in a week are 48 hours.Overtime wages: If an employee works beyond the prescribed working hours, they are entitled to overtime wages. The rate of overtime wages is typically higher than the regular hourly wage and may vary depending on the nature of work, whether it is on weekdays, weekends, or public holidays.Written records: Employers are required to maintain written records of the working hours, including overtime, of their employees.If your company is making employees work overtime without providing additional pay and not following the maximum working hour regulations, you may have a valid complaint. Here are some steps you can consider:Document the overtime hours: Keep a record of the extra hours you are working, including the date, time, and duration.Raise the issue internally: Bring the matter to the attention of your immediate supervisor or the HR department, preferably in writing. Explain the situation, express your concerns, and request proper adherence to labor laws.Seek legal advice: If your internal communication does not result in a resolution, you may want to consult with a labor law attorney in Pune. They can assess the specifics of your case and provide advice on the appropriate legal steps you can take.File a complaint: If your rights continue to be violated, you may consider filing a complaint with the relevant labor authorities, such as the local labor department or labor commissioner's office. They can investigate the matter and take appropriate action.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The nominee also has to submit prescribed identity proof. You can retain the entire SB account.Upon the death of the joint account holder, the FD value can be claimed in either of the following ways in different scenarios.- Either or survivor joint account: The survivor can continue with the FD account after producing the death certificate of the primary account holder.-Jointly or survivor account: The survivor can keep up the FD account till maturity and assume its ownership after submitting the death certificate of the primary account holder.-Former or survivor joint account: Former here means the primary account holder. Upon his/her death, the survivor can assume FD account ownership after submitting the death certificate of the primary account holder.-Anyone or survivor joint account: After the demise of the primary account holder, the next member can assume the primary role till FD maturity. In the case of more than two account holders, the next member needs the consent of all account holders for this transition.Note that if a Hindu female (mother) dies without a will, then the property is divided among legal heirs as per theHindu Succession Act's provisions.

    "question": "Nominee of accounts  and house property",
    "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about the loss of your mother. I'll provide you with some general guidance.Regarding the distribution of your mother's assets, here are some general points to consider:Fixed Deposits (FD) and Savings Bank (SB) Account: As you mentioned, you are the major nominee for both the FDs and the SB account. If you are the nominee, you may have the legal right to the proceeds of those accounts. However, it's important to understand that being a nominee does not necessarily mean you become the sole owner of the assets. The nominee is often considered as a custodian of the assets until the legal heirs are determined.House: Since the house was constructed by your father and your mother was the caretaker, it's essential to review the property documents to determine the ownership structure. If your mother was the sole owner, the property may be part of her estate and subject to distribution among the legal heirs. In such cases, it's advisable to consult with a lawyer to understand the specific laws and regulations in your jurisdiction regarding the division of property among legal heirs.Gold and other assets: Similar to the house, the gold and other assets would generally form part of your mother's estate. In the absence of a will or specific instructions, they would typically be divided equally among the legal heirs.While it's important to consider your mother's intentions and the care provided by you and your wife, it's crucial to understand that the final distribution of assets should generally adhere to the applicable laws. Consulting with a lawyer who specializes in inheritance and property laws can help you navigate the legal aspects and ensure a fair and proper distribution of assets..Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

They can provide you with specific advice based on the laws and regulations of your jurisdiction.Communicate with the tenant: Try to reach out to the tenant and explain the situation to them. Express the need to remove the entry from the Encumbrance Certificate (EC) and discuss the possibility of their cooperation. You may need to negotiate with them and potentially offer an incentive to encourage their cooperation.Serve a legal notice: If the tenant is uncooperative, you may need to serve them a legal notice requesting their presence for the cancellation of the agreement. Your lawyer can help you draft and serve this notice according to the relevant legal procedures.File a petition: If the tenant still refuses to cooperate, you may need to file a petition in a civil court to seek the cancellation of the agreement. Your lawyer can guide you through the necessary steps and represent you in court.Seek a court order: If the court finds in your favor, it can issue an order directing the registrar to remove the entry from the EC. This court order will then need to be submitted to the registrar's office for compliance.Disclose the situation to the potential buyer: It's important to be transparent with the potential buyer about the situation and inform them that you are actively working to resolve the issue. Depending on the buyer's preferences and the legal requirements in your jurisdiction, you may need to provide suitable assurances or documentation to address their concerns.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can GPA holder give GPA to another person for same property",
    "answer": "Dear client,Based on the information provided, here are some insights:Q1. Given this situation, can I buy the property from O_new?The situation involves a chain of transactions where the property was initially owned by O_old and subsequently passed through A1, A2, and finally to O_new. However, the legality and validity of the transactions depend on the local laws and regulations governing property transfers in Bangalore, India.To ensure a safe purchase, it is crucial to conduct a thorough due diligence process, including verifying the authenticity and legality of the documents involved. Engaging the services of a qualified real estate lawyer would be highly recommended to review all the relevant documents and provide legal advice specific to your situation.Q2. Do I need any other documents to be sure of the purchase?Apart from the documents you've mentioned (GPA, confirmation deed), additional documents may be necessary to ensure a secure purchase. Some essential documents typically required in property transactions include:a. Sale deed: This document should contain the details of the property, the names of the buyer and seller, the sale price, and any specific conditions or clauses.b. Encumbrance certificate: This certificate provides information about any existing encumbrances, such as mortgages, liens, or claims on the property.c. Khata certificate and extract: These documents indicate the ownership details and the property's assessment for tax purposes.d. Completion certificate: If the property is part of a housing project, a completion certificate from the appropriate authority may be necessary.e. Occupancy certificate: This certificate is issued by the local municipal corporation or development authority and confirms that the building is constructed according to approved plans and is safe for occupancy.It's essential to consult with a real estate attorney or legal expert who can guide you on the specific documents required in your jurisdiction.Q3. What are the risks involved?There are potential risks associated with the situation you've described. Some of the risks could include:a. Legality of the transactions: It's important to verify the legality and validity of the GPA documents, including the registration processes followed. Improperly executed or unregistered GPAs may be considered invalid.b. Chain of title: The chain of title is the sequence of historical ownership transfers. Any gaps or irregularities in the chain of title could raise concerns about the property's ownership and affect your ability to establish clear and marketable title.c. Litigation or disputes: There is a risk that any previous or current owners may have legal disputes or claims against the property. These disputes can lead to litigation and potentially affect your ownership rights.d. Verification of documents: It's crucial to thoroughly examine the documents related to the property's ownership, including the GPAs, sale deeds, and any other relevant documents, to ensure their authenticity and legality.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "- As per Supreme Court in the case of Suraj Lamp & Industries Pvt. Ltd. Vs State Of Haryana held , that sale transactions carried in the name of GPA will have no legal sanctity and immovable property can be sold or transferred only through registered deeds.- Further , transactions of the nature of GPA sales or SA/ GPA/ WILL transfers’ do not convey title and do not amount to transfer nor can they be recognized or valid mode of transfer of immovable property.- However, as the GPA for A1 & 2 was executed prior to passing this judgment , then it can be said valid-  Further, the GPA executed after 2011 will not termed as valid , and hence A2 was having no right to sell the property to O-NEW .- However, if A2 transferred the property by way of registered sale deed then there is no risk- A notarized deed /agreement related to property transfer is not valid.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "Regarding the sale of the property after the death of your mother, here are some general points to consider:Transfer of ownership: Since the property is currently in the names of both yourself and your late mother, you will need to transfer the ownership to your name alone before selling the property. The specific process for transferring ownership may vary depending on the laws and procedures of your jurisdiction.Typically, you will need to initiate the process of transferring the property to your name through a legal procedure such as a succession certificate, mutation of records, or obtaining a legal heir certificate. These documents establish your legal right to the property as the sole heir of your mother. The exact documents required and the process involved can vary based on the laws and regulations of your specific jurisdiction.Documents required: To sell the property, you will generally need the following documents:a. Proof of ownership: This includes the original sale deed or any subsequent transfer documents that establish your ownership of the property.b. Death certificate: You should have the original death certificate of your mother to establish her passing and your status as the sole heir.c. Transfer documents: The specific transfer documents required will depend on the laws of your jurisdiction. This may include a succession certificate, legal heir certificate, or mutation of records, as mentioned earlier.d. Encumbrance certificate: This certificate provides information about any existing encumbrances, such as mortgages, liens, or claims on the property.e. No-objection certificate (NOC): If applicable, you may need to obtain an NOC from any other legal heirs or family members who may have a claim to the property.State-specific requirements: While some documents and procedures may be common across India, it's important to note that certain requirements can vary from state to state.

They are acting numerous malpractices including frauds, cheating, delayed possession, misuse of buyer’s hard-earned money and the list goes on.The law facilitates several civil remedies under NCLT and RERA for distressed homebuyers. However, side by side the homebuyers can proceed with filing criminal cases against errant builders before Economic and Offence Wing.The Economic Offences form a separate category of criminal offences.

Economic offences, such as counterfeiting of currency, financial scams, fraud, money laundering, etc.There are the following ways to initiate criminal proceedings against the builder before EOW:-FIR would be filed;-Police would issue notice to builder for investigations;-Statement of complainant would be recorded;-EOW would file charge sheet on completion of investigations;-It would not affect your ongoing petition in any court.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "answer": "Divorce Prospects: The prospects of your husband obtaining a divorce will depend on various factors, including the specific grounds for divorce recognized in your jurisdiction and the evidence presented during the divorce proceedings. Generally, if your husband can establish valid grounds for divorce under the applicable laws, such as irretrievable breakdown of the marriage, cruelty, or other legally recognized grounds, he may have a reasonable chance of obtaining a divorce. However, the final decision will depend on the court's assessment of the evidence and the specific facts of your case. It's important to consult with a lawyer who can provide guidance based on the laws and practices in your jurisdiction.Conducting the Case in Absence: If you are moving to Canada and your husband files for divorce, it may be possible for your lawyer to represent you in your absence, depending on the laws and procedures of your jurisdiction.

At times, despite our best efforts, life takes a turn for the worst. We may have wanted different things from life, but life’s got its own plan as well. A bad marriage is something which nobody hopes for, but at times, that’s exactly what we are given and forced to face head on. Marriages are hard. Divorces…even harder. Nobody enters marriage thinking about a divorce in the end. If some are unable to cope with the harsh realities of marriage, the only viable option in front of them is to approach the Court and seek legal separation.Chances of divorce at this stage of life is very bleak. However, Court may grant if your husband is able to prove the grounds alleged in the divorce petition. Hon'ble Supreme Court has allowed video conferencing in various matrimonial matters, though not as a matter of recourse.

    "question": "Land divided and sold to multiple buyers",
    "answer": "Dear client,In this scenario, the division of the land into two portions of 300 sq yards and 150 sq yards indicates that there are two separate buyers involved. The distribution of the original copies and certified copies of the link documents may vary depending on the agreement between the parties involved and the customary practices in the jurisdiction where the transaction takes place. However, here is a general understanding:Original Copies of Link Documents: Typically, the original copies of link documents, such as the title deed, previous sale deeds, and other relevant documents establishing the chain of ownership, are handed over to the buyer who purchases the larger portion of the land, in this case, buyer1 with 300 sq yards. The larger portion is often deemed more significant and thus granted the original copies.Certified Copies of Link Documents: The buyer who purchases the smaller portion of the land, buyer2 with 150 sq yards, usually receives certified copies of the link documents. These certified copies serve as evidence of ownership and provide necessary information about the history of the land's ownership.It's important to note that the actual distribution of the documents can be influenced by the agreement between the parties involved or specific circumstances surrounding the transaction. It is advisable to consult with a real estate lawyer or legal professional to ensure compliance with local laws and regulations and to clarify the specific terms and conditions of the land sale agreement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The MOU can specify that in case of any future necessity, such as the sale of the 150 sq yard land by buyer 2, the party possessing the original link document should provide it to facilitate the transaction.This agreement can help ensure transparency, clarity, and trust between the parties involved and mitigate potential disputes or complications in the future.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

While I can provide general guidance, it's always recommended to consult with a legal professional or a real estate expert who can advise you based on the most up-to-date information and specific details of your situation.In India, the requirements and procedures for purchasing property can vary, so it's important to understand the legal framework and adhere to the necessary regulations. Regarding the GPA, the specific requirements may differ based on the state where the property is located. However, here are some general guidelines:General Power of Attorney (GPA): A GPA is a legal document that allows someone to act on your behalf in various matters, including property transactions. In this case, you would grant the GPA to your mother, authorizing her to handle the purchase of the residential plot.Notarization: Generally, it's advisable to notarize the GPA document to ensure its validity and authenticity. You can have the document notarized by a registered notary in Texas, USA. Notarization provides an official stamp of authenticity to the document.Attestation: Depending on the requirements of the Indian jurisdiction, you may need to get the GPA document attested by the Indian Embassy/Consulate in the USA. This is usually done to ensure that the document is recognized and accepted in India. Contact the nearest Indian Embassy/Consulate for specific information on their attestation process.Additional Requirements: Apart from the GPA, you may also need to provide other documents, such as proof of identity, proof of address, and any other documents requested by the relevant authorities in India. These requirements can vary, so it's crucial to consult with legal professionals who are familiar with the regulations in Bengaluru.To ensure compliance with all legal requirements, it's strongly recommended to consult with a lawyer specializing in property law or a real estate expert who can guide you through the process and assist you with the necessary documentation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Relinquishment deed draft on 3rs sub registrar stamp paper",
    "answer": "In general, when family members release or relinquish their share in favor of another family member, a deed of relinquishment or release deed is commonly used. This document outlines the intention of the releasing parties to transfer their rights, title, and interest in the property to the other party.While the specific requirements may vary based on the laws of the jurisdiction, some general considerations for a valid relinquishment or release deed include:Contents of the deed: The deed should clearly state the intention of the releasing parties to relinquish their share in the property. It should identify the property, mention the relationship between the parties, and outline the extent of the release. It's important to include all necessary details to avoid any ambiguity.Stamp duty and registration: Stamp duty is a tax levied on certain legal documents, including deeds of relinquishment or release. The stamp duty is usually calculated based on the value of the property being released or relinquished. In most cases, these deeds are required to be executed on stamp paper of appropriate value and registered with the relevant authority. The stamp duty and registration requirements may vary between states in India, so it's crucial to consult with a local lawyer who can advise you on the specific stamp duty and registration requirements in Karnataka.As for the stamp paper value, it's generally advisable to use the stamp paper of the appropriate value as required by the applicable stamp duty regulations. If the local advocate and stamp vendor are suggesting that a 3 rupees stamp paper is acceptable for your situation, they may be aware of any specific rules or exemptions in Karnataka. However, it's still advisable to consult with a lawyer to ensure that you are following the correct legal procedures.Regarding the use of \"release deed\" instead of \"relinquishment deed,\" the terminology may vary depending on the jurisdiction and legal practice. Both terms are commonly used to refer to the same concept of transferring or releasing one's rights in a property. The important aspect is that the document clearly reflects the intention of the parties and their agreement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

A bad marriage is something which nobody hopes for, but at times, that’s exactly what we are given and forced to face head on. Marriages are hard. Divorces…even harder.

While I can provide general guidance, it's always recommended to consult with a legal professional or a real estate expert who can advise you based on the most up-to-date information and specific details of your situation.In India, the requirements and procedures for purchasing property can vary, so it's important to understand the legal framework and adhere to the necessary regulations. Regarding the GPA, the specific requirements may differ based on the state where the property is located. However, here are some general guidelines:General Power of Attorney (GPA): A GPA is a legal document that allows someone to act on your behalf in various matters, including property transactions. In this case, you would grant the GPA to your mother, authorizing her to handle the purchase of the residential plot.Notarization: Generally, it's advisable to notarize the GPA document to ensure its validity and authenticity. You can have the document notarized by a registered notary in Texas, USA. Notarization provides an official stamp of authenticity to the document.Attestation: Depending on the requirements of the Indian jurisdiction, you may need to get the GPA document attested by the Indian Embassy/Consulate in the USA. This is usually done to ensure that the document is recognized and accepted in India. Contact the nearest Indian Embassy/Consulate for specific information on their attestation process.Additional Requirements: Apart from the GPA, you may also need to provide other documents, such as proof of identity, proof of address, and any other documents requested by the relevant authorities in India. These requirements can vary, so it's crucial to consult with legal professionals who are familiar with the regulations in Bengaluru.To ensure compliance with all legal requirements, it's strongly recommended to consult with a lawyer specializing in property law or a real estate expert who can guide you through the process and assist you with the necessary documentation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This may include any documents, such as marriage certificates or any proof regarding her caste status.If your wife is using her SC certificate to threaten or intimidate you, it may be appropriate to consult with a lawyer to understand the legal options available to you. They will be able to guide you on how to handle the situation and what legal remedies you may have.Regarding the issue of your wife's sister's marriage proposal and the claims made by her family about their caste, it may be helpful to gather any evidence or information that can substantiate your claims. This could include any documents or witnesses that can provide evidence regarding their caste status.Please note that caste-based discrimination or harassment is illegal in India under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, and there are legal provisions to address such issues. Consulting with a lawyer who specializes in family law and has expertise in dealing with caste-related matters would be advisable to understand the specific legal options available to you and how to proceed.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Regarding the sale of the property after the death of your mother, here are some general points to consider:Transfer of ownership: Since the property is currently in the names of both yourself and your late mother, you will need to transfer the ownership to your name alone before selling the property. The specific process for transferring ownership may vary depending on the laws and procedures of your jurisdiction.Typically, you will need to initiate the process of transferring the property to your name through a legal procedure such as a succession certificate, mutation of records, or obtaining a legal heir certificate. These documents establish your legal right to the property as the sole heir of your mother. The exact documents required and the process involved can vary based on the laws and regulations of your specific jurisdiction.Documents required: To sell the property, you will generally need the following documents:a. Proof of ownership: This includes the original sale deed or any subsequent transfer documents that establish your ownership of the property.b. Death certificate: You should have the original death certificate of your mother to establish her passing and your status as the sole heir.c. Transfer documents: The specific transfer documents required will depend on the laws of your jurisdiction. This may include a succession certificate, legal heir certificate, or mutation of records, as mentioned earlier.d. Encumbrance certificate: This certificate provides information about any existing encumbrances, such as mortgages, liens, or claims on the property.e. No-objection certificate (NOC): If applicable, you may need to obtain an NOC from any other legal heirs or family members who may have a claim to the property.State-specific requirements: While some documents and procedures may be common across India, it's important to note that certain requirements can vary from state to state. Therefore, it is advisable to consult with a local property lawyer who can guide you on the specific laws, regulations, and procedures applicable in your state.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "In India, the labor laws that govern overtime work and payment are primarily outlined in the Factories Act, 1948, and the Shops and Establishments Acts of respective states. The specific provisions of these acts may vary from state to state.Regarding overtime work, the law generally stipulates the following:Maximum working hours: The law sets a limit on the number of hours an employee can work in a day and a week. For example, in Maharashtra, the maximum working hours for adult workers in a day are 9 hours, and the maximum working hours in a week are 48 hours.Overtime wages: If an employee works beyond the prescribed working hours, they are entitled to overtime wages. The rate of overtime wages is typically higher than the regular hourly wage and may vary depending on the nature of work, whether it is on weekdays, weekends, or public holidays.Written records: Employers are required to maintain written records of the working hours, including overtime, of their employees.If your company is making employees work overtime without providing additional pay and not following the maximum working hour regulations, you may have a valid complaint. Here are some steps you can consider:Document the overtime hours: Keep a record of the extra hours you are working, including the date, time, and duration.Raise the issue internally: Bring the matter to the attention of your immediate supervisor or the HR department, preferably in writing. Explain the situation, express your concerns, and request proper adherence to labor laws.Seek legal advice: If your internal communication does not result in a resolution, you may want to consult with a labor law attorney in Pune. They can assess the specifics of your case and provide advice on the appropriate legal steps you can take.File a complaint: If your rights continue to be violated, you may consider filing a complaint with the relevant labor authorities, such as the local labor department or labor commissioner's office.

    "question": "Parking space (mechanical stack) in Co-op Housing Society In Mumbai",
    "answer": "In general, the ownership and management of parking spaces within a housing society or cooperative housing society are governed by the society's bylaws, rules, and regulations. These bylaws are typically framed in accordance with the cooperative housing society laws and regulations applicable in the specific state or region.In your case, it seems that the developer failed to construct the mechanical parking spaces as promised, and the society did not consider them as part of the common area space. This has resulted in a shortage of parking spaces and some members renting out their unused parking spots.To determine your rights and options, you may need to review the society's bylaws and relevant regulations governing parking spaces in cooperative housing societies in Maharashtra. These bylaws should outline the rights and responsibilities of the members, the society, and the developer regarding parking spaces.Additionally, you may want to consult with a lawyer who specializes in cooperative housing society matters to get specific legal advice based on the facts of your case. They can analyze the relevant documents, such as the purchase agreement, allotment letter, society bylaws, and any correspondence with the developer or society, to provide you with guidance on your legal rights and possible remedies.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Blood relative secretly buying life insurance on my life -- how to prevent?",
    "answer": "The special status of a blood relation, such as a father, can vary depending on the specific legal and financial circumstances in your jurisdictionBuying an insurance policy without your consent: In most cases, an adult son does not require the consent of their father to purchase an insurance policy on their own life. Insurance companies generally allow individuals to buy policies on their own lives without the need for consent from family members.Buying insurance without financial impact: Even if there is no direct financial impact on your father in the event of your death, he may still be allowed to purchase an insurance policy on your life, depending on the laws and regulations in your jurisdiction. However, the insurable interest principle might apply, which requires that the person purchasing the insurance policy has a financial interest or a reasonable expectation of financial loss upon your death. If there is no financial impact on your father, it could potentially affect the validity of the policy.Filing affidavits with insurance companies: If you do not consent to your father purchasing an insurance policy on your life, it may be advisable to inform the insurance companies in writing about your lack of consent and lack of financial interest. This can help ensure that the insurance company is aware of your position and can take it into consideration when processing any claims or dealing with any disputes.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "section 2(47)(i) of the  Income Tax Act, transfer in relation to a capital asset, includes, the sale, exchange or relinquishment of assets.2)The release when effected upon receipt of consideration becomes a deed of conveyance. The Honble Supreme Court in the judgment reported in AIR 1966 SC 337 (Thayyil Mammo And Anr. vs Kottiath Ramunni And Ors.) has held as follows:\"In Hemendra Nath Mukerji v. Kumar Nath Roy, 12 Cal WN 478, by a registered deed called a deed of disclaimer the executants relinquished all their right, title and interest and claim in the properties in favour of the releasee upon the condition that the releasee would discharge certain debts and the executants would be under no liability to pay those debts. Though the deed was stamped only as a release and not with ad valorem stamp, Maclean, C. J. held that on its true construction it was a transfer. We think that a registered instrument styled a release deed releasing the right, title and interest of the executant in any property in favour of the releasee for valuable consideration may operate as a conveyance, if the document clearly discloses an intention to effect a transfer. In the instant case, Ex. B-2 clearly discloses an intention to transfer all the rights of Baithan to defendants 1 to 5, and though the word \"surrender\" is used and though the deed is styled a release deed, it operates as an assignment.\"3) when you are relinquishing property for monetary consideration, it will result in capital gains for the transferor.and you have to pay income tax on consideration received by youAjay SethiAdvocate, Mumbai98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi"

Only the portion of the property being given up is subject to stamp duty; the entire worth of the property is not. If the property is transferred by a relinquishment deed for a payment, the transferor will unavoidably incur capital gains under the IT Act, and no tax benefits would follow.The amount settled or market value of the property transferred under the registered relinquishment deed would attract the capital gains tax as applicableT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

It's important to consult with a qualified tax advisor or chartered accountant who can provide personalized advice based on your individual situation and the applicable tax laws.Regarding giving up your rights as a beneficiary and receiving monetary compensation, the tax treatment could depend on factors such as the nature of the rights being given up, the source of the compensation, and the tax laws governing such transactions in your jurisdiction. Generally, if the compensation received is in the nature of a capital receipt, it may be treated differently for tax purposes compared to compensation received as income.Regarding vacating your father's premises and receiving compensation from your sister, it could involve aspects of property transfer, rental income, or capital gains, depending on the specific details of the arrangement.

    "question": "Land divided and sold to multiple buyers",
    "answer": "Dear client,In this scenario, the division of the land into two portions of 300 sq yards and 150 sq yards indicates that there are two separate buyers involved. The distribution of the original copies and certified copies of the link documents may vary depending on the agreement between the parties involved and the customary practices in the jurisdiction where the transaction takes place. However, here is a general understanding:Original Copies of Link Documents: Typically, the original copies of link documents, such as the title deed, previous sale deeds, and other relevant documents establishing the chain of ownership, are handed over to the buyer who purchases the larger portion of the land, in this case, buyer1 with 300 sq yards. The larger portion is often deemed more significant and thus granted the original copies.Certified Copies of Link Documents: The buyer who purchases the smaller portion of the land, buyer2 with 150 sq yards, usually receives certified copies of the link documents. These certified copies serve as evidence of ownership and provide necessary information about the history of the land's ownership.It's important to note that the actual distribution of the documents can be influenced by the agreement between the parties involved or specific circumstances surrounding the transaction. It is advisable to consult with a real estate lawyer or legal professional to ensure compliance with local laws and regulations and to clarify the specific terms and conditions of the land sale agreement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Original documents are generally preferred and considered more reliable during property transactions. Having only certified copies may raise concerns for potential buyers about the authenticity and genuineness of the documents.To address this concern, it is advisable for buyer 1 and buyer 2 to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) or agreement that outlines the rights and obligations regarding the original link document. The MOU can specify that in case of any future necessity, such as the sale of the 150 sq yard land by buyer 2, the party possessing the original link document should provide it to facilitate the transaction.This agreement can help ensure transparency, clarity, and trust between the parties involved and mitigate potential disputes or complications in the future.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Based on the information provided, here are some insights:Q1. Given this situation, can I buy the property from O_new?The situation involves a chain of transactions where the property was initially owned by O_old and subsequently passed through A1, A2, and finally to O_new. However, the legality and validity of the transactions depend on the local laws and regulations governing property transfers in Bangalore, India.To ensure a safe purchase, it is crucial to conduct a thorough due diligence process, including verifying the authenticity and legality of the documents involved. Engaging the services of a qualified real estate lawyer would be highly recommended to review all the relevant documents and provide legal advice specific to your situation.Q2. Do I need any other documents to be sure of the purchase?Apart from the documents you've mentioned (GPA, confirmation deed), additional documents may be necessary to ensure a secure purchase. Some essential documents typically required in property transactions include:a. Sale deed: This document should contain the details of the property, the names of the buyer and seller, the sale price, and any specific conditions or clauses.b. Encumbrance certificate: This certificate provides information about any existing encumbrances, such as mortgages, liens, or claims on the property.c. Khata certificate and extract: These documents indicate the ownership details and the property's assessment for tax purposes.d. Completion certificate: If the property is part of a housing project, a completion certificate from the appropriate authority may be necessary.e. Occupancy certificate: This certificate is issued by the local municipal corporation or development authority and confirms that the building is constructed according to approved plans and is safe for occupancy.It's essential to consult with a real estate attorney or legal expert who can guide you on the specific documents required in your jurisdiction.Q3. What are the risks involved?There are potential risks associated with the situation you've described. Some of the risks could include:a. Legality of the transactions: It's important to verify the legality and validity of the GPA documents, including the registration processes followed. Improperly executed or unregistered GPAs may be considered invalid.b. Chain of title: The chain of title is the sequence of historical ownership transfers. Any gaps or irregularities in the chain of title could raise concerns about the property's ownership and affect your ability to establish clear and marketable title.c. Litigation or disputes: There is a risk that any previous or current owners may have legal disputes or claims against the property. These disputes can lead to litigation and potentially affect your ownership rights.d. Verification of documents: It's crucial to thoroughly examine the documents related to the property's ownership, including the GPAs, sale deeds, and any other relevant documents, to ensure their authenticity and legality.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,As an NRI planning to purchase a residential plot in Bengaluru, India, and assigning your mother as the GPA (General Power of Attorney) holder, you will need to follow certain procedures and requirements. While I can provide general guidance, it's always recommended to consult with a legal professional or a real estate expert who can advise you based on the most up-to-date information and specific details of your situation.In India, the requirements and procedures for purchasing property can vary, so it's important to understand the legal framework and adhere to the necessary regulations. Regarding the GPA, the specific requirements may differ based on the state where the property is located. However, here are some general guidelines:General Power of Attorney (GPA): A GPA is a legal document that allows someone to act on your behalf in various matters, including property transactions. In this case, you would grant the GPA to your mother, authorizing her to handle the purchase of the residential plot.Notarization: Generally, it's advisable to notarize the GPA document to ensure its validity and authenticity. You can have the document notarized by a registered notary in Texas, USA. Notarization provides an official stamp of authenticity to the document.Attestation: Depending on the requirements of the Indian jurisdiction, you may need to get the GPA document attested by the Indian Embassy/Consulate in the USA. This is usually done to ensure that the document is recognized and accepted in India. Contact the nearest Indian Embassy/Consulate for specific information on their attestation process.Additional Requirements: Apart from the GPA, you may also need to provide other documents, such as proof of identity, proof of address, and any other documents requested by the relevant authorities in India. These requirements can vary, so it's crucial to consult with legal professionals who are familiar with the regulations in Bengaluru.To ensure compliance with all legal requirements, it's strongly recommended to consult with a lawyer specializing in property law or a real estate expert who can guide you through the process and assist you with the necessary documentation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The Honble Supreme Court in the judgment reported in AIR 1966 SC 337 (Thayyil Mammo And Anr. vs Kottiath Ramunni And Ors.) has held as follows:\"In Hemendra Nath Mukerji v. Kumar Nath Roy, 12 Cal WN 478, by a registered deed called a deed of disclaimer the executants relinquished all their right, title and interest and claim in the properties in favour of the releasee upon the condition that the releasee would discharge certain debts and the executants would be under no liability to pay those debts. Though the deed was stamped only as a release and not with ad valorem stamp, Maclean, C. J. held that on its true construction it was a transfer. We think that a registered instrument styled a release deed releasing the right, title and interest of the executant in any property in favour of the releasee for valuable consideration may operate as a conveyance, if the document clearly discloses an intention to effect a transfer. In the instant case, Ex. B-2 clearly discloses an intention to transfer all the rights of Baithan to defendants 1 to 5, and though the word \"surrender\" is used and though the deed is styled a release deed, it operates as an assignment.\"3) when you are relinquishing property for monetary consideration, it will result in capital gains for the transferor.and you have to pay income tax on consideration received by youAjay SethiAdvocate, Mumbai98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi"

    "question": "Income tax on giving up my rights as a beneficiary",
    "answer": "An irreversible legal document or instrument is used when a legal heir irrevocably relinquishes or releases his or her legal rights in an inherited property for another legal heir, such as their mother, son, daughter, brother, sister, etc. The relinquishment deed needs to be registered with the sub-registrar in order to be valid legally. Only the portion of the property being given up is subject to stamp duty; the entire worth of the property is not. If the property is transferred by a relinquishment deed for a payment, the transferor will unavoidably incur capital gains under the IT Act, and no tax benefits would follow.The amount settled or market value of the property transferred under the registered relinquishment deed would attract the capital gains tax as applicableT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "The tax implications of giving up your rights as a beneficiary and receiving monetary compensation, as well as vacating your father's premises and receiving compensation from your sister, may vary depending on the specific circumstances and the tax laws of your jurisdiction. It's important to consult with a qualified tax advisor or chartered accountant who can provide personalized advice based on your individual situation and the applicable tax laws.Regarding giving up your rights as a beneficiary and receiving monetary compensation, the tax treatment could depend on factors such as the nature of the rights being given up, the source of the compensation, and the tax laws governing such transactions in your jurisdiction. Generally, if the compensation received is in the nature of a capital receipt, it may be treated differently for tax purposes compared to compensation received as income.Regarding vacating your father's premises and receiving compensation from your sister, it could involve aspects of property transfer, rental income, or capital gains, depending on the specific details of the arrangement. Again, the tax treatment would depend on the applicable tax laws, the purpose of the transaction, and the specific nature of the compensation received.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "-  As per the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal , the income from the relinquishment of right over a property cannot be treated as capital gain for the purpose of levying an income tax.2.  As per Section 2(47) of the Income Tax Act,  even extinguishment of any rights in a property would also cover under the definition of transfer. Therefore, once extinguishment of any right in a property comes under definition of ‘transfer’, as defined u/s.2(47) of the Act, then consequential consideration received for transfer of property would come under the provisions of section 45 of the Income Tax Act, 1961.- You should contact an Income tax practitioner for getting a fruitful suggestions.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Land divided and sold to multiple buyers",
    "answer": "Dear client,In this scenario, the division of the land into two portions of 300 sq yards and 150 sq yards indicates that there are two separate buyers involved. The distribution of the original copies and certified copies of the link documents may vary depending on the agreement between the parties involved and the customary practices in the jurisdiction where the transaction takes place. However, here is a general understanding:Original Copies of Link Documents: Typically, the original copies of link documents, such as the title deed, previous sale deeds, and other relevant documents establishing the chain of ownership, are handed over to the buyer who purchases the larger portion of the land, in this case, buyer1 with 300 sq yards. The larger portion is often deemed more significant and thus granted the original copies.Certified Copies of Link Documents: The buyer who purchases the smaller portion of the land, buyer2 with 150 sq yards, usually receives certified copies of the link documents. These certified copies serve as evidence of ownership and provide necessary information about the history of the land's ownership.It's important to note that the actual distribution of the documents can be influenced by the agreement between the parties involved or specific circumstances surrounding the transaction. It is advisable to consult with a real estate lawyer or legal professional to ensure compliance with local laws and regulations and to clarify the specific terms and conditions of the land sale agreement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can GPA holder give GPA to another person for same property",
    "answer": "Dear client,Based on the information provided, here are some insights:Q1. Given this situation, can I buy the property from O_new?The situation involves a chain of transactions where the property was initially owned by O_old and subsequently passed through A1, A2, and finally to O_new. However, the legality and validity of the transactions depend on the local laws and regulations governing property transfers in Bangalore, India.To ensure a safe purchase, it is crucial to conduct a thorough due diligence process, including verifying the authenticity and legality of the documents involved. Engaging the services of a qualified real estate lawyer would be highly recommended to review all the relevant documents and provide legal advice specific to your situation.Q2. Do I need any other documents to be sure of the purchase?Apart from the documents you've mentioned (GPA, confirmation deed), additional documents may be necessary to ensure a secure purchase. Some essential documents typically required in property transactions include:a. Sale deed: This document should contain the details of the property, the names of the buyer and seller, the sale price, and any specific conditions or clauses.b. Encumbrance certificate: This certificate provides information about any existing encumbrances, such as mortgages, liens, or claims on the property.c. Khata certificate and extract: These documents indicate the ownership details and the property's assessment for tax purposes.d. Completion certificate: If the property is part of a housing project, a completion certificate from the appropriate authority may be necessary.e. Occupancy certificate: This certificate is issued by the local municipal corporation or development authority and confirms that the building is constructed according to approved plans and is safe for occupancy.It's essential to consult with a real estate attorney or legal expert who can guide you on the specific documents required in your jurisdiction.Q3. What are the risks involved?There are potential risks associated with the situation you've described. Some of the risks could include:a. Legality of the transactions: It's important to verify the legality and validity of the GPA documents, including the registration processes followed. Improperly executed or unregistered GPAs may be considered invalid.b. Chain of title: The chain of title is the sequence of historical ownership transfers. Any gaps or irregularities in the chain of title could raise concerns about the property's ownership and affect your ability to establish clear and marketable title.c. Litigation or disputes: There is a risk that any previous or current owners may have legal disputes or claims against the property. These disputes can lead to litigation and potentially affect your ownership rights.d. Verification of documents: It's crucial to thoroughly examine the documents related to the property's ownership, including the GPAs, sale deeds, and any other relevant documents, to ensure their authenticity and legality.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "section 2(47)(i) of the  Income Tax Act, transfer in relation to a capital asset, includes, the sale, exchange or relinquishment of assets.2)The release when effected upon receipt of consideration becomes a deed of conveyance. The Honble Supreme Court in the judgment reported in AIR 1966 SC 337 (Thayyil Mammo And Anr. vs Kottiath Ramunni And Ors.) has held as follows:\"In Hemendra Nath Mukerji v. Kumar Nath Roy, 12 Cal WN 478, by a registered deed called a deed of disclaimer the executants relinquished all their right, title and interest and claim in the properties in favour of the releasee upon the condition that the releasee would discharge certain debts and the executants would be under no liability to pay those debts. Though the deed was stamped only as a release and not with ad valorem stamp, Maclean, C. J. held that on its true construction it was a transfer. We think that a registered instrument styled a release deed releasing the right, title and interest of the executant in any property in favour of the releasee for valuable consideration may operate as a conveyance, if the document clearly discloses an intention to effect a transfer. In the instant case, Ex. B-2 clearly discloses an intention to transfer all the rights of Baithan to defendants 1 to 5, and though the word \"surrender\" is used and though the deed is styled a release deed, it operates as an assignment.\"3) when you are relinquishing property for monetary consideration, it will result in capital gains for the transferor.and you have to pay income tax on consideration received by youAjay SethiAdvocate, Mumbai98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi"

    "answer": "The tax implications of giving up your rights as a beneficiary and receiving monetary compensation, as well as vacating your father's premises and receiving compensation from your sister, may vary depending on the specific circumstances and the tax laws of your jurisdiction. It's important to consult with a qualified tax advisor or chartered accountant who can provide personalized advice based on your individual situation and the applicable tax laws.Regarding giving up your rights as a beneficiary and receiving monetary compensation, the tax treatment could depend on factors such as the nature of the rights being given up, the source of the compensation, and the tax laws governing such transactions in your jurisdiction. Generally, if the compensation received is in the nature of a capital receipt, it may be treated differently for tax purposes compared to compensation received as income.Regarding vacating your father's premises and receiving compensation from your sister, it could involve aspects of property transfer, rental income, or capital gains, depending on the specific details of the arrangement.

    "answer": "Dear client,Based on the information provided, here are some insights:Q1. Given this situation, can I buy the property from O_new?The situation involves a chain of transactions where the property was initially owned by O_old and subsequently passed through A1, A2, and finally to O_new. However, the legality and validity of the transactions depend on the local laws and regulations governing property transfers in Bangalore, India.To ensure a safe purchase, it is crucial to conduct a thorough due diligence process, including verifying the authenticity and legality of the documents involved. Engaging the services of a qualified real estate lawyer would be highly recommended to review all the relevant documents and provide legal advice specific to your situation.Q2. Do I need any other documents to be sure of the purchase?Apart from the documents you've mentioned (GPA, confirmation deed), additional documents may be necessary to ensure a secure purchase. Some essential documents typically required in property transactions include:a. Sale deed: This document should contain the details of the property, the names of the buyer and seller, the sale price, and any specific conditions or clauses.b. Encumbrance certificate: This certificate provides information about any existing encumbrances, such as mortgages, liens, or claims on the property.c. Khata certificate and extract: These documents indicate the ownership details and the property's assessment for tax purposes.d. Completion certificate: If the property is part of a housing project, a completion certificate from the appropriate authority may be necessary.e. Occupancy certificate: This certificate is issued by the local municipal corporation or development authority and confirms that the building is constructed according to approved plans and is safe for occupancy.It's essential to consult with a real estate attorney or legal expert who can guide you on the specific documents required in your jurisdiction.Q3. What are the risks involved?There are potential risks associated with the situation you've described. Some of the risks could include:a. Legality of the transactions: It's important to verify the legality and validity of the GPA documents, including the registration processes followed. Improperly executed or unregistered GPAs may be considered invalid.b. Chain of title: The chain of title is the sequence of historical ownership transfers. Any gaps or irregularities in the chain of title could raise concerns about the property's ownership and affect your ability to establish clear and marketable title.c. Litigation or disputes: There is a risk that any previous or current owners may have legal disputes or claims against the property. These disputes can lead to litigation and potentially affect your ownership rights.d. Verification of documents: It's crucial to thoroughly examine the documents related to the property's ownership, including the GPAs, sale deeds, and any other relevant documents, to ensure their authenticity and legality.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can GPA holder give GPA to another person for same property",
    "answer": "- As per Supreme Court in the case of Suraj Lamp & Industries Pvt. Ltd. Vs State Of Haryana held , that sale transactions carried in the name of GPA will have no legal sanctity and immovable property can be sold or transferred only through registered deeds.- Further , transactions of the nature of GPA sales or SA/ GPA/ WILL transfers’ do not convey title and do not amount to transfer nor can they be recognized or valid mode of transfer of immovable property.- However, as the GPA for A1 & 2 was executed prior to passing this judgment , then it can be said valid-  Further, the GPA executed after 2011 will not termed as valid , and hence A2 was having no right to sell the property to O-NEW .- However, if A2 transferred the property by way of registered sale deed then there is no risk- A notarized deed /agreement related to property transfer is not valid.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Blood relative secretly buying life insurance on my life -- how to prevent?",
    "answer": "The special status of a blood relation, such as a father, can vary depending on the specific legal and financial circumstances in your jurisdictionBuying an insurance policy without your consent: In most cases, an adult son does not require the consent of their father to purchase an insurance policy on their own life. Insurance companies generally allow individuals to buy policies on their own lives without the need for consent from family members.Buying insurance without financial impact: Even if there is no direct financial impact on your father in the event of your death, he may still be allowed to purchase an insurance policy on your life, depending on the laws and regulations in your jurisdiction. However, the insurable interest principle might apply, which requires that the person purchasing the insurance policy has a financial interest or a reasonable expectation of financial loss upon your death. If there is no financial impact on your father, it could potentially affect the validity of the policy.Filing affidavits with insurance companies: If you do not consent to your father purchasing an insurance policy on your life, it may be advisable to inform the insurance companies in writing about your lack of consent and lack of financial interest. This can help ensure that the insurance company is aware of your position and can take it into consideration when processing any claims or dealing with any disputes.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "The special status of a blood relation, such as a father, can vary depending on the specific legal and financial circumstances in your jurisdictionBuying an insurance policy without your consent: In most cases, an adult son does not require the consent of their father to purchase an insurance policy on their own life. Insurance companies generally allow individuals to buy policies on their own lives without the need for consent from family members.Buying insurance without financial impact: Even if there is no direct financial impact on your father in the event of your death, he may still be allowed to purchase an insurance policy on your life, depending on the laws and regulations in your jurisdiction. However, the insurable interest principle might apply, which requires that the person purchasing the insurance policy has a financial interest or a reasonable expectation of financial loss upon your death. If there is no financial impact on your father, it could potentially affect the validity of the policy.Filing affidavits with insurance companies: If you do not consent to your father purchasing an insurance policy on your life, it may be advisable to inform the insurance companies in writing about your lack of consent and lack of financial interest. This can help ensure that the insurance company is aware of your position and can take it into consideration when processing any claims or dealing with any disputes.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Regarding the sale of the property after the death of your mother, here are some general points to consider:Transfer of ownership: Since the property is currently in the names of both yourself and your late mother, you will need to transfer the ownership to your name alone before selling the property. The specific process for transferring ownership may vary depending on the laws and procedures of your jurisdiction.Typically, you will need to initiate the process of transferring the property to your name through a legal procedure such as a succession certificate, mutation of records, or obtaining a legal heir certificate. These documents establish your legal right to the property as the sole heir of your mother. The exact documents required and the process involved can vary based on the laws and regulations of your specific jurisdiction.Documents required: To sell the property, you will generally need the following documents:a. Proof of ownership: This includes the original sale deed or any subsequent transfer documents that establish your ownership of the property.b. Death certificate: You should have the original death certificate of your mother to establish her passing and your status as the sole heir.c. Transfer documents: The specific transfer documents required will depend on the laws of your jurisdiction. This may include a succession certificate, legal heir certificate, or mutation of records, as mentioned earlier.d. Encumbrance certificate: This certificate provides information about any existing encumbrances, such as mortgages, liens, or claims on the property.e. No-objection certificate (NOC): If applicable, you may need to obtain an NOC from any other legal heirs or family members who may have a claim to the property.State-specific requirements: While some documents and procedures may be common across India, it's important to note that certain requirements can vary from state to state. Therefore, it is advisable to consult with a local property lawyer who can guide you on the specific laws, regulations, and procedures applicable in your state.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

A bad marriage is something which nobody hopes for, but at times, that’s exactly what we are given and forced to face head on. Marriages are hard. Divorces…even harder. Nobody enters marriage thinking about a divorce in the end. If some are unable to cope with the harsh realities of marriage, the only viable option in front of them is to approach the Court and seek legal separation.Chances of divorce at this stage of life is very bleak. However, Court may grant if your husband is able to prove the grounds alleged in the divorce petition.

    "answer": "Content and its impact: The content you've provided outlines the petitioner's requests and intentions regarding the division of assets and access to premises. It appears to be a proposal for a compromise, and whether it negatively impacts you would depend on your specific circumstances and desired outcomes. It's crucial to carefully review the terms and implications of the proposed agreement and consider seeking legal advice to ensure it aligns with your interests and protects your rights.Procedure for presenting the agreement: The procedure for presenting the agreement may vary depending on the court rules and practices in your jurisdiction. It's generally advisable to work with your lawyer to draft the agreement accurately, including all necessary terms and signatures. They can guide you on the specific procedure for submitting the agreement to the court, which may involve filing it with the appropriate court clerk, serving copies to the other party, and potentially presenting it during the next hearing.Duration of the case: The duration of the case and whether there will be another hearing can depend on various factors, such as the complexity of the case, the court's schedule, and any potential disputes or disagreements that may arise. It's difficult to predict with certainty whether the case will conclude on the same day or require additional hearings. Your lawyer, who has a better understanding of the specific circumstances and the court's procedures, will be able to provide more accurate guidance on the expected timeline of your case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Parking space (mechanical stack) in Co-op Housing Society In Mumbai",
    "answer": "In general, the ownership and management of parking spaces within a housing society or cooperative housing society are governed by the society's bylaws, rules, and regulations. These bylaws are typically framed in accordance with the cooperative housing society laws and regulations applicable in the specific state or region.In your case, it seems that the developer failed to construct the mechanical parking spaces as promised, and the society did not consider them as part of the common area space. This has resulted in a shortage of parking spaces and some members renting out their unused parking spots.To determine your rights and options, you may need to review the society's bylaws and relevant regulations governing parking spaces in cooperative housing societies in Maharashtra. These bylaws should outline the rights and responsibilities of the members, the society, and the developer regarding parking spaces.Additionally, you may want to consult with a lawyer who specializes in cooperative housing society matters to get specific legal advice based on the facts of your case. They can analyze the relevant documents, such as the purchase agreement, allotment letter, society bylaws, and any correspondence with the developer or society, to provide you with guidance on your legal rights and possible remedies.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The nominee also has to submit prescribed identity proof. You can retain the entire SB account.Upon the death of the joint account holder, the FD value can be claimed in either of the following ways in different scenarios.- Either or survivor joint account: The survivor can continue with the FD account after producing the death certificate of the primary account holder.-Jointly or survivor account: The survivor can keep up the FD account till maturity and assume its ownership after submitting the death certificate of the primary account holder.-Former or survivor joint account: Former here means the primary account holder. Upon his/her death, the survivor can assume FD account ownership after submitting the death certificate of the primary account holder.-Anyone or survivor joint account: After the demise of the primary account holder, the next member can assume the primary role till FD maturity. In the case of more than two account holders, the next member needs the consent of all account holders for this transition.Note that if a Hindu female (mother) dies without a will, then the property is divided among legal heirs as per theHindu Succession Act's provisions.

    "question": "Nominee of accounts  and house property",
    "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about the loss of your mother. I'll provide you with some general guidance.Regarding the distribution of your mother's assets, here are some general points to consider:Fixed Deposits (FD) and Savings Bank (SB) Account: As you mentioned, you are the major nominee for both the FDs and the SB account. If you are the nominee, you may have the legal right to the proceeds of those accounts. However, it's important to understand that being a nominee does not necessarily mean you become the sole owner of the assets. The nominee is often considered as a custodian of the assets until the legal heirs are determined.House: Since the house was constructed by your father and your mother was the caretaker, it's essential to review the property documents to determine the ownership structure. If your mother was the sole owner, the property may be part of her estate and subject to distribution among the legal heirs. In such cases, it's advisable to consult with a lawyer to understand the specific laws and regulations in your jurisdiction regarding the division of property among legal heirs.Gold and other assets: Similar to the house, the gold and other assets would generally form part of your mother's estate. In the absence of a will or specific instructions, they would typically be divided equally among the legal heirs.While it's important to consider your mother's intentions and the care provided by you and your wife, it's crucial to understand that the final distribution of assets should generally adhere to the applicable laws. Consulting with a lawyer who specializes in inheritance and property laws can help you navigate the legal aspects and ensure a fair and proper distribution of assets..Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

I can understand your concern in this regard.Please understand that in your case, the nominee can claim the FD by submitting the death certificate of the account holder and KYC documents. The nominee also has to submit prescribed identity proof. You can retain the entire SB account.Upon the death of the joint account holder, the FD value can be claimed in either of the following ways in different scenarios.- Either or survivor joint account: The survivor can continue with the FD account after producing the death certificate of the primary account holder.-Jointly or survivor account: The survivor can keep up the FD account till maturity and assume its ownership after submitting the death certificate of the primary account holder.-Former or survivor joint account: Former here means the primary account holder. Upon his/her death, the survivor can assume FD account ownership after submitting the death certificate of the primary account holder.-Anyone or survivor joint account: After the demise of the primary account holder, the next member can assume the primary role till FD maturity. In the case of more than two account holders, the next member needs the consent of all account holders for this transition.Note that if a Hindu female (mother) dies without a will, then the property is divided among legal heirs as per theHindu Succession Act's provisions. The legal heirs are: Husband, sons and daughters (if predeceased, their children).Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "question": "Nominee of accounts  and house property",
    "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about the loss of your mother. I'll provide you with some general guidance.Regarding the distribution of your mother's assets, here are some general points to consider:Fixed Deposits (FD) and Savings Bank (SB) Account: As you mentioned, you are the major nominee for both the FDs and the SB account. If you are the nominee, you may have the legal right to the proceeds of those accounts. However, it's important to understand that being a nominee does not necessarily mean you become the sole owner of the assets. The nominee is often considered as a custodian of the assets until the legal heirs are determined.House: Since the house was constructed by your father and your mother was the caretaker, it's essential to review the property documents to determine the ownership structure. If your mother was the sole owner, the property may be part of her estate and subject to distribution among the legal heirs. In such cases, it's advisable to consult with a lawyer to understand the specific laws and regulations in your jurisdiction regarding the division of property among legal heirs.Gold and other assets: Similar to the house, the gold and other assets would generally form part of your mother's estate. In the absence of a will or specific instructions, they would typically be divided equally among the legal heirs.While it's important to consider your mother's intentions and the care provided by you and your wife, it's crucial to understand that the final distribution of assets should generally adhere to the applicable laws. Consulting with a lawyer who specializes in inheritance and property laws can help you navigate the legal aspects and ensure a fair and proper distribution of assets..Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "If the seller claims that he was threatened or coerced into signing different signatures on the sale deed, it may raise concerns about the validity and enforceability of the sale deed. In such a situation, it is important to gather evidence and consult with a lawyer who specializes in property law to understand your legal options and how to proceed.Here are some steps you may consider:Consult with a lawyer: Engage a lawyer who can review the sale deed, the different signatures, and any other relevant documents or evidence. They can advise you on the legal implications and guide you on the appropriate course of action.Gather evidence: Collect any evidence that supports your case, such as correspondence, communication records, or witnesses that can verify the circumstances surrounding the signing of the sale deed. This evidence can be helpful in establishing the facts and defending your position.Investigate the claim: If the seller alleges coercion or threat, it may be necessary to investigate the claim. This could involve engaging a professional investigator or gathering evidence to counter the seller's allegations. The objective is to ascertain the truth and establish the validity of the transaction.Negotiate or resolve the dispute: Depending on the findings of the investigation and legal advice, you may explore options for negotiation or resolution. This could involve discussions with the seller, mediation, or other dispute resolution mechanisms to reach a mutually acceptable solution.Legal remedies: If negotiations or alternative dispute resolution methods do not yield a satisfactory outcome, you may need to consider taking legal action.

    "question": "Overtime Work",
    "answer": "In India, the labor laws that govern overtime work and payment are primarily outlined in the Factories Act, 1948, and the Shops and Establishments Acts of respective states. The specific provisions of these acts may vary from state to state.Regarding overtime work, the law generally stipulates the following:Maximum working hours: The law sets a limit on the number of hours an employee can work in a day and a week. For example, in Maharashtra, the maximum working hours for adult workers in a day are 9 hours, and the maximum working hours in a week are 48 hours.Overtime wages: If an employee works beyond the prescribed working hours, they are entitled to overtime wages. The rate of overtime wages is typically higher than the regular hourly wage and may vary depending on the nature of work, whether it is on weekdays, weekends, or public holidays.Written records: Employers are required to maintain written records of the working hours, including overtime, of their employees.If your company is making employees work overtime without providing additional pay and not following the maximum working hour regulations, you may have a valid complaint. Here are some steps you can consider:Document the overtime hours: Keep a record of the extra hours you are working, including the date, time, and duration.Raise the issue internally: Bring the matter to the attention of your immediate supervisor or the HR department, preferably in writing. Explain the situation, express your concerns, and request proper adherence to labor laws.Seek legal advice: If your internal communication does not result in a resolution, you may want to consult with a labor law attorney in Pune. They can assess the specifics of your case and provide advice on the appropriate legal steps you can take.File a complaint: If your rights continue to be violated, you may consider filing a complaint with the relevant labor authorities, such as the local labor department or labor commissioner's office. They can investigate the matter and take appropriate action.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Relinquishment deed draft on 3rs sub registrar stamp paper",
    "answer": "In general, when family members release or relinquish their share in favor of another family member, a deed of relinquishment or release deed is commonly used. This document outlines the intention of the releasing parties to transfer their rights, title, and interest in the property to the other party.While the specific requirements may vary based on the laws of the jurisdiction, some general considerations for a valid relinquishment or release deed include:Contents of the deed: The deed should clearly state the intention of the releasing parties to relinquish their share in the property. It should identify the property, mention the relationship between the parties, and outline the extent of the release. It's important to include all necessary details to avoid any ambiguity.Stamp duty and registration: Stamp duty is a tax levied on certain legal documents, including deeds of relinquishment or release. The stamp duty is usually calculated based on the value of the property being released or relinquished. In most cases, these deeds are required to be executed on stamp paper of appropriate value and registered with the relevant authority. The stamp duty and registration requirements may vary between states in India, so it's crucial to consult with a local lawyer who can advise you on the specific stamp duty and registration requirements in Karnataka.As for the stamp paper value, it's generally advisable to use the stamp paper of the appropriate value as required by the applicable stamp duty regulations. If the local advocate and stamp vendor are suggesting that a 3 rupees stamp paper is acceptable for your situation, they may be aware of any specific rules or exemptions in Karnataka. However, it's still advisable to consult with a lawyer to ensure that you are following the correct legal procedures.Regarding the use of \"release deed\" instead of \"relinquishment deed,\" the terminology may vary depending on the jurisdiction and legal practice. Both terms are commonly used to refer to the same concept of transferring or releasing one's rights in a property. The important aspect is that the document clearly reflects the intention of the parties and their agreement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "In general, the ownership and management of parking spaces within a housing society or cooperative housing society are governed by the society's bylaws, rules, and regulations. These bylaws are typically framed in accordance with the cooperative housing society laws and regulations applicable in the specific state or region.In your case, it seems that the developer failed to construct the mechanical parking spaces as promised, and the society did not consider them as part of the common area space. This has resulted in a shortage of parking spaces and some members renting out their unused parking spots.To determine your rights and options, you may need to review the society's bylaws and relevant regulations governing parking spaces in cooperative housing societies in Maharashtra. These bylaws should outline the rights and responsibilities of the members, the society, and the developer regarding parking spaces.Additionally, you may want to consult with a lawyer who specializes in cooperative housing society matters to get specific legal advice based on the facts of your case. They can analyze the relevant documents, such as the purchase agreement, allotment letter, society bylaws, and any correspondence with the developer or society, to provide you with guidance on your legal rights and possible remedies.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Overtime Work",
    "answer": "In India, the labor laws that govern overtime work and payment are primarily outlined in the Factories Act, 1948, and the Shops and Establishments Acts of respective states. The specific provisions of these acts may vary from state to state.Regarding overtime work, the law generally stipulates the following:Maximum working hours: The law sets a limit on the number of hours an employee can work in a day and a week. For example, in Maharashtra, the maximum working hours for adult workers in a day are 9 hours, and the maximum working hours in a week are 48 hours.Overtime wages: If an employee works beyond the prescribed working hours, they are entitled to overtime wages. The rate of overtime wages is typically higher than the regular hourly wage and may vary depending on the nature of work, whether it is on weekdays, weekends, or public holidays.Written records: Employers are required to maintain written records of the working hours, including overtime, of their employees.If your company is making employees work overtime without providing additional pay and not following the maximum working hour regulations, you may have a valid complaint. Here are some steps you can consider:Document the overtime hours: Keep a record of the extra hours you are working, including the date, time, and duration.Raise the issue internally: Bring the matter to the attention of your immediate supervisor or the HR department, preferably in writing. Explain the situation, express your concerns, and request proper adherence to labor laws.Seek legal advice: If your internal communication does not result in a resolution, you may want to consult with a labor law attorney in Pune. They can assess the specifics of your case and provide advice on the appropriate legal steps you can take.File a complaint: If your rights continue to be violated, you may consider filing a complaint with the relevant labor authorities, such as the local labor department or labor commissioner's office. They can investigate the matter and take appropriate action.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "In general, the ownership and management of parking spaces within a housing society or cooperative housing society are governed by the society's bylaws, rules, and regulations. These bylaws are typically framed in accordance with the cooperative housing society laws and regulations applicable in the specific state or region.In your case, it seems that the developer failed to construct the mechanical parking spaces as promised, and the society did not consider them as part of the common area space. This has resulted in a shortage of parking spaces and some members renting out their unused parking spots.To determine your rights and options, you may need to review the society's bylaws and relevant regulations governing parking spaces in cooperative housing societies in Maharashtra. These bylaws should outline the rights and responsibilities of the members, the society, and the developer regarding parking spaces.Additionally, you may want to consult with a lawyer who specializes in cooperative housing society matters to get specific legal advice based on the facts of your case. They can analyze the relevant documents, such as the purchase agreement, allotment letter, society bylaws, and any correspondence with the developer or society, to provide you with guidance on your legal rights and possible remedies.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. Even if father is the co applicant, he can file the complaint since he also has interest in the property. My team is dealing with various cases of such nature. Legal Notice can be sent claiming the amount of compensation for the mental and physical agony. Generally, cases are settled at legal notice stage.These days the builders or developers are not fulfilling their aspirations and promises. They are acting numerous malpractices including frauds, cheating, delayed possession, misuse of buyer’s hard-earned money and the list goes on.The law facilitates several civil remedies under NCLT and RERA for distressed homebuyers. However, side by side the homebuyers can proceed with filing criminal cases against errant builders before Economic and Offence Wing.The Economic Offences form a separate category of criminal offences. Economic Offences not only victimize individuals with pecuniary loss but can also have serious repercussions on the national economy. Economic offences, such as counterfeiting of currency, financial scams, fraud, money laundering, etc.There are the following ways to initiate criminal proceedings against the builder before EOW:-FIR would be filed;-Police would issue notice to builder for investigations;-Statement of complainant would be recorded;-EOW would file charge sheet on completion of investigations;-It would not affect your ongoing petition in any court.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

The nominee also has to submit prescribed identity proof. You can retain the entire SB account.Upon the death of the joint account holder, the FD value can be claimed in either of the following ways in different scenarios.- Either or survivor joint account: The survivor can continue with the FD account after producing the death certificate of the primary account holder.-Jointly or survivor account: The survivor can keep up the FD account till maturity and assume its ownership after submitting the death certificate of the primary account holder.-Former or survivor joint account: Former here means the primary account holder. Upon his/her death, the survivor can assume FD account ownership after submitting the death certificate of the primary account holder.-Anyone or survivor joint account: After the demise of the primary account holder, the next member can assume the primary role till FD maturity. In the case of more than two account holders, the next member needs the consent of all account holders for this transition.Note that if a Hindu female (mother) dies without a will, then the property is divided among legal heirs as per theHindu Succession Act's provisions.

    "question": "Nominee of accounts  and house property",
    "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about the loss of your mother. I'll provide you with some general guidance.Regarding the distribution of your mother's assets, here are some general points to consider:Fixed Deposits (FD) and Savings Bank (SB) Account: As you mentioned, you are the major nominee for both the FDs and the SB account. If you are the nominee, you may have the legal right to the proceeds of those accounts. However, it's important to understand that being a nominee does not necessarily mean you become the sole owner of the assets. The nominee is often considered as a custodian of the assets until the legal heirs are determined.House: Since the house was constructed by your father and your mother was the caretaker, it's essential to review the property documents to determine the ownership structure. If your mother was the sole owner, the property may be part of her estate and subject to distribution among the legal heirs. In such cases, it's advisable to consult with a lawyer to understand the specific laws and regulations in your jurisdiction regarding the division of property among legal heirs.Gold and other assets: Similar to the house, the gold and other assets would generally form part of your mother's estate. In the absence of a will or specific instructions, they would typically be divided equally among the legal heirs.While it's important to consider your mother's intentions and the care provided by you and your wife, it's crucial to understand that the final distribution of assets should generally adhere to the applicable laws. Consulting with a lawyer who specializes in inheritance and property laws can help you navigate the legal aspects and ensure a fair and proper distribution of assets..Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In such a situation, it is important to gather evidence and consult with a lawyer who specializes in property law to understand your legal options and how to proceed.Here are some steps you may consider:Consult with a lawyer: Engage a lawyer who can review the sale deed, the different signatures, and any other relevant documents or evidence. They can advise you on the legal implications and guide you on the appropriate course of action.Gather evidence: Collect any evidence that supports your case, such as correspondence, communication records, or witnesses that can verify the circumstances surrounding the signing of the sale deed. This evidence can be helpful in establishing the facts and defending your position.Investigate the claim: If the seller alleges coercion or threat, it may be necessary to investigate the claim. This could involve engaging a professional investigator or gathering evidence to counter the seller's allegations. The objective is to ascertain the truth and establish the validity of the transaction.Negotiate or resolve the dispute: Depending on the findings of the investigation and legal advice, you may explore options for negotiation or resolution. This could involve discussions with the seller, mediation, or other dispute resolution mechanisms to reach a mutually acceptable solution.Legal remedies: If negotiations or alternative dispute resolution methods do not yield a satisfactory outcome, you may need to consider taking legal action.

    "question": "Father file case on sons self acquired property",
    "answer": "I understand your concerns regarding the property dispute with your father and brother. Here are some points to consider:Mediation: Mediation is an alternative dispute resolution process where a neutral third party helps facilitate negotiations between the parties involved in a dispute. While your lawyer may suggest mediation as a way to potentially resolve the dispute amicably, participation in mediation is voluntary. You have the right to decline mediation if you believe it will not lead to a satisfactory resolution or if you prefer to pursue the matter through the court.Court proceedings: If you choose not to pursue mediation or if mediation does not result in a settlement, the court proceedings will continue. It is within your rights to proceed with the legal process and seek a resolution through the court. Your lawyer should represent your interests and present the evidence and arguments on your behalf.Property ownership: Based on the information you provided, the property appears to be self-acquired by you. You have the necessary documents, such as the sales deed, EC, and bank statements, to prove your ownership. If you can establish that the property was purchased with your own funds and that your father and brother did not contribute financially, it strengthens your case for exclusive ownership.Tenants eviction: If you have valid grounds for eviction, such as non-payment of rent or breach of tenancy agreement, you can consider pursuing the eviction process parallel to the ongoing property dispute. Consult with your lawyer regarding the specific procedures and requirements for evicting tenants in your jurisdiction.NRI representation: As an NRI, you have the right to be informed about the progress of your case and to be involved in the legal proceedings. You can request your lawyer to provide you with regular updates and copies of court documents. If you feel that you are not being adequately represented or if you have concerns about the progress of the case, you may consider engaging a different lawyer or directly contacting the court for information.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Mother is Co Owner (housewife)- TDS Certificate Required?",
    "answer": "As an NRI buying a property with your mother as a co-owner, it's important to consider the relevant tax regulations and consult with a qualified tax professional or chartered accountant who specializes in NRI taxation to get accurate and up-to-date advice based on your specific circumstances. They will be able to guide you through the process and ensure compliance with the applicable tax laws.Regarding the TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) certificate, it's generally required when purchasing property from an NRI seller. The TDS rate for such transactions is typically 20% (plus applicable surcharges and cess) as per the Income Tax Act. However, there may be provisions for lower TDS rates or exemptions based on specific circumstances or if the buyer has obtained a certificate for a lower deduction or exemption from the Income Tax Department.The requirement for a TAN (Tax Deduction and Collection Account Number) typically applies to entities that are deducting or collecting tax at source. In the case of individuals, a TAN is generally not required unless they are conducting business or professional activities that mandate TDS compliance.Regarding the specific advice given by your friend about obtaining the TDS certificate in your mother's name, it's crucial to consult a tax professional who is familiar with your situation and the dispensation you have applied for with the Income Tax Department. They will be able to assess whether it is necessary or beneficial to obtain the TDS certificate in your mother's name, taking into account the applicable regulations and the specific dispensation you have sought.In summary, consulting with a qualified tax professional is strongly recommended to ensure that you understand and comply with the tax obligations associated with purchasing property as an NRI. They will be able to provide personalized advice based on your circumstances and guide you through the process of obtaining the necessary TDS certificate, if required.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Overtime Work",
    "answer": "In India, the labor laws that govern overtime work and payment are primarily outlined in the Factories Act, 1948, and the Shops and Establishments Acts of respective states. The specific provisions of these acts may vary from state to state.Regarding overtime work, the law generally stipulates the following:Maximum working hours: The law sets a limit on the number of hours an employee can work in a day and a week. For example, in Maharashtra, the maximum working hours for adult workers in a day are 9 hours, and the maximum working hours in a week are 48 hours.Overtime wages: If an employee works beyond the prescribed working hours, they are entitled to overtime wages. The rate of overtime wages is typically higher than the regular hourly wage and may vary depending on the nature of work, whether it is on weekdays, weekends, or public holidays.Written records: Employers are required to maintain written records of the working hours, including overtime, of their employees.If your company is making employees work overtime without providing additional pay and not following the maximum working hour regulations, you may have a valid complaint. Here are some steps you can consider:Document the overtime hours: Keep a record of the extra hours you are working, including the date, time, and duration.Raise the issue internally: Bring the matter to the attention of your immediate supervisor or the HR department, preferably in writing. Explain the situation, express your concerns, and request proper adherence to labor laws.Seek legal advice: If your internal communication does not result in a resolution, you may want to consult with a labor law attorney in Pune. They can assess the specifics of your case and provide advice on the appropriate legal steps you can take.File a complaint: If your rights continue to be violated, you may consider filing a complaint with the relevant labor authorities, such as the local labor department or labor commissioner's office.

    "question": "Relinquishment deed draft on 3rs sub registrar stamp paper",
    "answer": "In general, when family members release or relinquish their share in favor of another family member, a deed of relinquishment or release deed is commonly used. This document outlines the intention of the releasing parties to transfer their rights, title, and interest in the property to the other party.While the specific requirements may vary based on the laws of the jurisdiction, some general considerations for a valid relinquishment or release deed include:Contents of the deed: The deed should clearly state the intention of the releasing parties to relinquish their share in the property. It should identify the property, mention the relationship between the parties, and outline the extent of the release. It's important to include all necessary details to avoid any ambiguity.Stamp duty and registration: Stamp duty is a tax levied on certain legal documents, including deeds of relinquishment or release. The stamp duty is usually calculated based on the value of the property being released or relinquished. In most cases, these deeds are required to be executed on stamp paper of appropriate value and registered with the relevant authority. The stamp duty and registration requirements may vary between states in India, so it's crucial to consult with a local lawyer who can advise you on the specific stamp duty and registration requirements in Karnataka.As for the stamp paper value, it's generally advisable to use the stamp paper of the appropriate value as required by the applicable stamp duty regulations. If the local advocate and stamp vendor are suggesting that a 3 rupees stamp paper is acceptable for your situation, they may be aware of any specific rules or exemptions in Karnataka. However, it's still advisable to consult with a lawyer to ensure that you are following the correct legal procedures.Regarding the use of \"release deed\" instead of \"relinquishment deed,\" the terminology may vary depending on the jurisdiction and legal practice. Both terms are commonly used to refer to the same concept of transferring or releasing one's rights in a property. The important aspect is that the document clearly reflects the intention of the parties and their agreement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Overtime Work",
    "answer": "In India, the labor laws that govern overtime work and payment are primarily outlined in the Factories Act, 1948, and the Shops and Establishments Acts of respective states. The specific provisions of these acts may vary from state to state.Regarding overtime work, the law generally stipulates the following:Maximum working hours: The law sets a limit on the number of hours an employee can work in a day and a week. For example, in Maharashtra, the maximum working hours for adult workers in a day are 9 hours, and the maximum working hours in a week are 48 hours.Overtime wages: If an employee works beyond the prescribed working hours, they are entitled to overtime wages. The rate of overtime wages is typically higher than the regular hourly wage and may vary depending on the nature of work, whether it is on weekdays, weekends, or public holidays.Written records: Employers are required to maintain written records of the working hours, including overtime, of their employees.If your company is making employees work overtime without providing additional pay and not following the maximum working hour regulations, you may have a valid complaint. Here are some steps you can consider:Document the overtime hours: Keep a record of the extra hours you are working, including the date, time, and duration.Raise the issue internally: Bring the matter to the attention of your immediate supervisor or the HR department, preferably in writing. Explain the situation, express your concerns, and request proper adherence to labor laws.Seek legal advice: If your internal communication does not result in a resolution, you may want to consult with a labor law attorney in Pune. They can assess the specifics of your case and provide advice on the appropriate legal steps you can take.File a complaint: If your rights continue to be violated, you may consider filing a complaint with the relevant labor authorities, such as the local labor department or labor commissioner's office. They can investigate the matter and take appropriate action.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Relinquishment deed draft on 3rs sub registrar stamp paper",
    "answer": "In general, when family members release or relinquish their share in favor of another family member, a deed of relinquishment or release deed is commonly used. This document outlines the intention of the releasing parties to transfer their rights, title, and interest in the property to the other party.While the specific requirements may vary based on the laws of the jurisdiction, some general considerations for a valid relinquishment or release deed include:Contents of the deed: The deed should clearly state the intention of the releasing parties to relinquish their share in the property. It should identify the property, mention the relationship between the parties, and outline the extent of the release. It's important to include all necessary details to avoid any ambiguity.Stamp duty and registration: Stamp duty is a tax levied on certain legal documents, including deeds of relinquishment or release. The stamp duty is usually calculated based on the value of the property being released or relinquished. In most cases, these deeds are required to be executed on stamp paper of appropriate value and registered with the relevant authority. The stamp duty and registration requirements may vary between states in India, so it's crucial to consult with a local lawyer who can advise you on the specific stamp duty and registration requirements in Karnataka.As for the stamp paper value, it's generally advisable to use the stamp paper of the appropriate value as required by the applicable stamp duty regulations. If the local advocate and stamp vendor are suggesting that a 3 rupees stamp paper is acceptable for your situation, they may be aware of any specific rules or exemptions in Karnataka. However, it's still advisable to consult with a lawyer to ensure that you are following the correct legal procedures.Regarding the use of \"release deed\" instead of \"relinquishment deed,\" the terminology may vary depending on the jurisdiction and legal practice. Both terms are commonly used to refer to the same concept of transferring or releasing one's rights in a property. The important aspect is that the document clearly reflects the intention of the parties and their agreement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Overtime Work",
    "answer": "In India, the labor laws that govern overtime work and payment are primarily outlined in the Factories Act, 1948, and the Shops and Establishments Acts of respective states. The specific provisions of these acts may vary from state to state.Regarding overtime work, the law generally stipulates the following:Maximum working hours: The law sets a limit on the number of hours an employee can work in a day and a week. For example, in Maharashtra, the maximum working hours for adult workers in a day are 9 hours, and the maximum working hours in a week are 48 hours.Overtime wages: If an employee works beyond the prescribed working hours, they are entitled to overtime wages. The rate of overtime wages is typically higher than the regular hourly wage and may vary depending on the nature of work, whether it is on weekdays, weekends, or public holidays.Written records: Employers are required to maintain written records of the working hours, including overtime, of their employees.If your company is making employees work overtime without providing additional pay and not following the maximum working hour regulations, you may have a valid complaint. Here are some steps you can consider:Document the overtime hours: Keep a record of the extra hours you are working, including the date, time, and duration.Raise the issue internally: Bring the matter to the attention of your immediate supervisor or the HR department, preferably in writing. Explain the situation, express your concerns, and request proper adherence to labor laws.Seek legal advice: If your internal communication does not result in a resolution, you may want to consult with a labor law attorney in Pune. They can assess the specifics of your case and provide advice on the appropriate legal steps you can take.File a complaint: If your rights continue to be violated, you may consider filing a complaint with the relevant labor authorities, such as the local labor department or labor commissioner's office. They can investigate the matter and take appropriate action.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Relinquishment deed draft on 3rs sub registrar stamp paper",
    "answer": "In general, when family members release or relinquish their share in favor of another family member, a deed of relinquishment or release deed is commonly used. This document outlines the intention of the releasing parties to transfer their rights, title, and interest in the property to the other party.While the specific requirements may vary based on the laws of the jurisdiction, some general considerations for a valid relinquishment or release deed include:Contents of the deed: The deed should clearly state the intention of the releasing parties to relinquish their share in the property. It should identify the property, mention the relationship between the parties, and outline the extent of the release. It's important to include all necessary details to avoid any ambiguity.Stamp duty and registration: Stamp duty is a tax levied on certain legal documents, including deeds of relinquishment or release. The stamp duty is usually calculated based on the value of the property being released or relinquished. In most cases, these deeds are required to be executed on stamp paper of appropriate value and registered with the relevant authority. The stamp duty and registration requirements may vary between states in India, so it's crucial to consult with a local lawyer who can advise you on the specific stamp duty and registration requirements in Karnataka.As for the stamp paper value, it's generally advisable to use the stamp paper of the appropriate value as required by the applicable stamp duty regulations. If the local advocate and stamp vendor are suggesting that a 3 rupees stamp paper is acceptable for your situation, they may be aware of any specific rules or exemptions in Karnataka. However, it's still advisable to consult with a lawyer to ensure that you are following the correct legal procedures.Regarding the use of \"release deed\" instead of \"relinquishment deed,\" the terminology may vary depending on the jurisdiction and legal practice. Both terms are commonly used to refer to the same concept of transferring or releasing one's rights in a property. The important aspect is that the document clearly reflects the intention of the parties and their agreement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

You can retain the entire SB account.Upon the death of the joint account holder, the FD value can be claimed in either of the following ways in different scenarios.- Either or survivor joint account: The survivor can continue with the FD account after producing the death certificate of the primary account holder.-Jointly or survivor account: The survivor can keep up the FD account till maturity and assume its ownership after submitting the death certificate of the primary account holder.-Former or survivor joint account: Former here means the primary account holder. Upon his/her death, the survivor can assume FD account ownership after submitting the death certificate of the primary account holder.-Anyone or survivor joint account: After the demise of the primary account holder, the next member can assume the primary role till FD maturity. In the case of more than two account holders, the next member needs the consent of all account holders for this transition.Note that if a Hindu female (mother) dies without a will, then the property is divided among legal heirs as per theHindu Succession Act's provisions.

    "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about the loss of your mother. I'll provide you with some general guidance.Regarding the distribution of your mother's assets, here are some general points to consider:Fixed Deposits (FD) and Savings Bank (SB) Account: As you mentioned, you are the major nominee for both the FDs and the SB account. If you are the nominee, you may have the legal right to the proceeds of those accounts. However, it's important to understand that being a nominee does not necessarily mean you become the sole owner of the assets. The nominee is often considered as a custodian of the assets until the legal heirs are determined.House: Since the house was constructed by your father and your mother was the caretaker, it's essential to review the property documents to determine the ownership structure. If your mother was the sole owner, the property may be part of her estate and subject to distribution among the legal heirs. In such cases, it's advisable to consult with a lawyer to understand the specific laws and regulations in your jurisdiction regarding the division of property among legal heirs.Gold and other assets: Similar to the house, the gold and other assets would generally form part of your mother's estate. In the absence of a will or specific instructions, they would typically be divided equally among the legal heirs.While it's important to consider your mother's intentions and the care provided by you and your wife, it's crucial to understand that the final distribution of assets should generally adhere to the applicable laws.

    "question": "Father file case on sons self acquired property",
    "answer": "I understand your concerns regarding the property dispute with your father and brother. Here are some points to consider:Mediation: Mediation is an alternative dispute resolution process where a neutral third party helps facilitate negotiations between the parties involved in a dispute. While your lawyer may suggest mediation as a way to potentially resolve the dispute amicably, participation in mediation is voluntary. You have the right to decline mediation if you believe it will not lead to a satisfactory resolution or if you prefer to pursue the matter through the court.Court proceedings: If you choose not to pursue mediation or if mediation does not result in a settlement, the court proceedings will continue. It is within your rights to proceed with the legal process and seek a resolution through the court. Your lawyer should represent your interests and present the evidence and arguments on your behalf.Property ownership: Based on the information you provided, the property appears to be self-acquired by you. You have the necessary documents, such as the sales deed, EC, and bank statements, to prove your ownership. If you can establish that the property was purchased with your own funds and that your father and brother did not contribute financially, it strengthens your case for exclusive ownership.Tenants eviction: If you have valid grounds for eviction, such as non-payment of rent or breach of tenancy agreement, you can consider pursuing the eviction process parallel to the ongoing property dispute. Consult with your lawyer regarding the specific procedures and requirements for evicting tenants in your jurisdiction.NRI representation: As an NRI, you have the right to be informed about the progress of your case and to be involved in the legal proceedings. You can request your lawyer to provide you with regular updates and copies of court documents. If you feel that you are not being adequately represented or if you have concerns about the progress of the case, you may consider engaging a different lawyer or directly contacting the court for information.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

You can retain the entire SB account.Upon the death of the joint account holder, the FD value can be claimed in either of the following ways in different scenarios.- Either or survivor joint account: The survivor can continue with the FD account after producing the death certificate of the primary account holder.-Jointly or survivor account: The survivor can keep up the FD account till maturity and assume its ownership after submitting the death certificate of the primary account holder.-Former or survivor joint account: Former here means the primary account holder. Upon his/her death, the survivor can assume FD account ownership after submitting the death certificate of the primary account holder.-Anyone or survivor joint account: After the demise of the primary account holder, the next member can assume the primary role till FD maturity. In the case of more than two account holders, the next member needs the consent of all account holders for this transition.Note that if a Hindu female (mother) dies without a will, then the property is divided among legal heirs as per theHindu Succession Act's provisions.

    "question": "Nominee of accounts  and house property",
    "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about the loss of your mother. I'll provide you with some general guidance.Regarding the distribution of your mother's assets, here are some general points to consider:Fixed Deposits (FD) and Savings Bank (SB) Account: As you mentioned, you are the major nominee for both the FDs and the SB account. If you are the nominee, you may have the legal right to the proceeds of those accounts. However, it's important to understand that being a nominee does not necessarily mean you become the sole owner of the assets. The nominee is often considered as a custodian of the assets until the legal heirs are determined.House: Since the house was constructed by your father and your mother was the caretaker, it's essential to review the property documents to determine the ownership structure. If your mother was the sole owner, the property may be part of her estate and subject to distribution among the legal heirs. In such cases, it's advisable to consult with a lawyer to understand the specific laws and regulations in your jurisdiction regarding the division of property among legal heirs.Gold and other assets: Similar to the house, the gold and other assets would generally form part of your mother's estate. In the absence of a will or specific instructions, they would typically be divided equally among the legal heirs.While it's important to consider your mother's intentions and the care provided by you and your wife, it's crucial to understand that the final distribution of assets should generally adhere to the applicable laws. Consulting with a lawyer who specializes in inheritance and property laws can help you navigate the legal aspects and ensure a fair and proper distribution of assets..Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

I can understand your concern in this regard.Please understand that in your case, the nominee can claim the FD by submitting the death certificate of the account holder and KYC documents. The nominee also has to submit prescribed identity proof. You can retain the entire SB account.Upon the death of the joint account holder, the FD value can be claimed in either of the following ways in different scenarios.- Either or survivor joint account: The survivor can continue with the FD account after producing the death certificate of the primary account holder.-Jointly or survivor account: The survivor can keep up the FD account till maturity and assume its ownership after submitting the death certificate of the primary account holder.-Former or survivor joint account: Former here means the primary account holder. Upon his/her death, the survivor can assume FD account ownership after submitting the death certificate of the primary account holder.-Anyone or survivor joint account: After the demise of the primary account holder, the next member can assume the primary role till FD maturity. In the case of more than two account holders, the next member needs the consent of all account holders for this transition.Note that if a Hindu female (mother) dies without a will, then the property is divided among legal heirs as per theHindu Succession Act's provisions. The legal heirs are: Husband, sons and daughters (if predeceased, their children).Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "question": "Nominee of accounts  and house property",
    "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about the loss of your mother. I'll provide you with some general guidance.Regarding the distribution of your mother's assets, here are some general points to consider:Fixed Deposits (FD) and Savings Bank (SB) Account: As you mentioned, you are the major nominee for both the FDs and the SB account. If you are the nominee, you may have the legal right to the proceeds of those accounts. However, it's important to understand that being a nominee does not necessarily mean you become the sole owner of the assets. The nominee is often considered as a custodian of the assets until the legal heirs are determined.House: Since the house was constructed by your father and your mother was the caretaker, it's essential to review the property documents to determine the ownership structure. If your mother was the sole owner, the property may be part of her estate and subject to distribution among the legal heirs. In such cases, it's advisable to consult with a lawyer to understand the specific laws and regulations in your jurisdiction regarding the division of property among legal heirs.Gold and other assets: Similar to the house, the gold and other assets would generally form part of your mother's estate. In the absence of a will or specific instructions, they would typically be divided equally among the legal heirs.While it's important to consider your mother's intentions and the care provided by you and your wife, it's crucial to understand that the final distribution of assets should generally adhere to the applicable laws. Consulting with a lawyer who specializes in inheritance and property laws can help you navigate the legal aspects and ensure a fair and proper distribution of assets..Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Father file case on sons self acquired property",
    "answer": "I understand your concerns regarding the property dispute with your father and brother. Here are some points to consider:Mediation: Mediation is an alternative dispute resolution process where a neutral third party helps facilitate negotiations between the parties involved in a dispute. While your lawyer may suggest mediation as a way to potentially resolve the dispute amicably, participation in mediation is voluntary. You have the right to decline mediation if you believe it will not lead to a satisfactory resolution or if you prefer to pursue the matter through the court.Court proceedings: If you choose not to pursue mediation or if mediation does not result in a settlement, the court proceedings will continue. It is within your rights to proceed with the legal process and seek a resolution through the court. Your lawyer should represent your interests and present the evidence and arguments on your behalf.Property ownership: Based on the information you provided, the property appears to be self-acquired by you. You have the necessary documents, such as the sales deed, EC, and bank statements, to prove your ownership. If you can establish that the property was purchased with your own funds and that your father and brother did not contribute financially, it strengthens your case for exclusive ownership.Tenants eviction: If you have valid grounds for eviction, such as non-payment of rent or breach of tenancy agreement, you can consider pursuing the eviction process parallel to the ongoing property dispute. Consult with your lawyer regarding the specific procedures and requirements for evicting tenants in your jurisdiction.NRI representation: As an NRI, you have the right to be informed about the progress of your case and to be involved in the legal proceedings. You can request your lawyer to provide you with regular updates and copies of court documents. If you feel that you are not being adequately represented or if you have concerns about the progress of the case, you may consider engaging a different lawyer or directly contacting the court for information.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The TDS rate for such transactions is typically 20% (plus applicable surcharges and cess) as per the Income Tax Act. However, there may be provisions for lower TDS rates or exemptions based on specific circumstances or if the buyer has obtained a certificate for a lower deduction or exemption from the Income Tax Department.The requirement for a TAN (Tax Deduction and Collection Account Number) typically applies to entities that are deducting or collecting tax at source. In the case of individuals, a TAN is generally not required unless they are conducting business or professional activities that mandate TDS compliance.Regarding the specific advice given by your friend about obtaining the TDS certificate in your mother's name, it's crucial to consult a tax professional who is familiar with your situation and the dispensation you have applied for with the Income Tax Department. They will be able to assess whether it is necessary or beneficial to obtain the TDS certificate in your mother's name, taking into account the applicable regulations and the specific dispensation you have sought.In summary, consulting with a qualified tax professional is strongly recommended to ensure that you understand and comply with the tax obligations associated with purchasing property as an NRI. They will be able to provide personalized advice based on your circumstances and guide you through the process of obtaining the necessary TDS certificate, if required.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

I can understand your concern in this regard.Please understand that in your case, the nominee can claim the FD by submitting the death certificate of the account holder and KYC documents. The nominee also has to submit prescribed identity proof. You can retain the entire SB account.Upon the death of the joint account holder, the FD value can be claimed in either of the following ways in different scenarios.- Either or survivor joint account: The survivor can continue with the FD account after producing the death certificate of the primary account holder.-Jointly or survivor account: The survivor can keep up the FD account till maturity and assume its ownership after submitting the death certificate of the primary account holder.-Former or survivor joint account: Former here means the primary account holder. Upon his/her death, the survivor can assume FD account ownership after submitting the death certificate of the primary account holder.-Anyone or survivor joint account: After the demise of the primary account holder, the next member can assume the primary role till FD maturity. In the case of more than two account holders, the next member needs the consent of all account holders for this transition.Note that if a Hindu female (mother) dies without a will, then the property is divided among legal heirs as per theHindu Succession Act's provisions. The legal heirs are: Husband, sons and daughters (if predeceased, their children).Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "question": "Nominee of accounts  and house property",
    "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about the loss of your mother. I'll provide you with some general guidance.Regarding the distribution of your mother's assets, here are some general points to consider:Fixed Deposits (FD) and Savings Bank (SB) Account: As you mentioned, you are the major nominee for both the FDs and the SB account. If you are the nominee, you may have the legal right to the proceeds of those accounts. However, it's important to understand that being a nominee does not necessarily mean you become the sole owner of the assets. The nominee is often considered as a custodian of the assets until the legal heirs are determined.House: Since the house was constructed by your father and your mother was the caretaker, it's essential to review the property documents to determine the ownership structure. If your mother was the sole owner, the property may be part of her estate and subject to distribution among the legal heirs. In such cases, it's advisable to consult with a lawyer to understand the specific laws and regulations in your jurisdiction regarding the division of property among legal heirs.Gold and other assets: Similar to the house, the gold and other assets would generally form part of your mother's estate. In the absence of a will or specific instructions, they would typically be divided equally among the legal heirs.While it's important to consider your mother's intentions and the care provided by you and your wife, it's crucial to understand that the final distribution of assets should generally adhere to the applicable laws. Consulting with a lawyer who specializes in inheritance and property laws can help you navigate the legal aspects and ensure a fair and proper distribution of assets..Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Father file case on sons self acquired property",
    "answer": "I understand your concerns regarding the property dispute with your father and brother. Here are some points to consider:Mediation: Mediation is an alternative dispute resolution process where a neutral third party helps facilitate negotiations between the parties involved in a dispute. While your lawyer may suggest mediation as a way to potentially resolve the dispute amicably, participation in mediation is voluntary. You have the right to decline mediation if you believe it will not lead to a satisfactory resolution or if you prefer to pursue the matter through the court.Court proceedings: If you choose not to pursue mediation or if mediation does not result in a settlement, the court proceedings will continue. It is within your rights to proceed with the legal process and seek a resolution through the court. Your lawyer should represent your interests and present the evidence and arguments on your behalf.Property ownership: Based on the information you provided, the property appears to be self-acquired by you. You have the necessary documents, such as the sales deed, EC, and bank statements, to prove your ownership. If you can establish that the property was purchased with your own funds and that your father and brother did not contribute financially, it strengthens your case for exclusive ownership.Tenants eviction: If you have valid grounds for eviction, such as non-payment of rent or breach of tenancy agreement, you can consider pursuing the eviction process parallel to the ongoing property dispute. Consult with your lawyer regarding the specific procedures and requirements for evicting tenants in your jurisdiction.NRI representation: As an NRI, you have the right to be informed about the progress of your case and to be involved in the legal proceedings. You can request your lawyer to provide you with regular updates and copies of court documents. If you feel that you are not being adequately represented or if you have concerns about the progress of the case, you may consider engaging a different lawyer or directly contacting the court for information.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However for the purpose of eligibility of TDS provisions, total value of the property shall be considered.If a property has more than one buyer and/or seller, you need to fill in separate Form 26QB for each set of buyer and seller.

    "question": "Mother is Co Owner (housewife)- TDS Certificate Required?",
    "answer": "As an NRI buying a property with your mother as a co-owner, it's important to consider the relevant tax regulations and consult with a qualified tax professional or chartered accountant who specializes in NRI taxation to get accurate and up-to-date advice based on your specific circumstances. They will be able to guide you through the process and ensure compliance with the applicable tax laws.Regarding the TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) certificate, it's generally required when purchasing property from an NRI seller. The TDS rate for such transactions is typically 20% (plus applicable surcharges and cess) as per the Income Tax Act. However, there may be provisions for lower TDS rates or exemptions based on specific circumstances or if the buyer has obtained a certificate for a lower deduction or exemption from the Income Tax Department.The requirement for a TAN (Tax Deduction and Collection Account Number) typically applies to entities that are deducting or collecting tax at source. In the case of individuals, a TAN is generally not required unless they are conducting business or professional activities that mandate TDS compliance.Regarding the specific advice given by your friend about obtaining the TDS certificate in your mother's name, it's crucial to consult a tax professional who is familiar with your situation and the dispensation you have applied for with the Income Tax Department. They will be able to assess whether it is necessary or beneficial to obtain the TDS certificate in your mother's name, taking into account the applicable regulations and the specific dispensation you have sought.In summary, consulting with a qualified tax professional is strongly recommended to ensure that you understand and comply with the tax obligations associated with purchasing property as an NRI. They will be able to provide personalized advice based on your circumstances and guide you through the process of obtaining the necessary TDS certificate, if required.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Protecting possession in case of fraudulent sale deed",
    "answer": "Dear client,It is generally not permissible to file multiple suits on the same cause of action. If both suits involve the same cause of action and the same parties, the second suit may be stayed or consolidated with the first suit under Section 10 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC). You should discuss this matter with your lawyer, who can file the appropriate application to the court to request the stay of the second suit.The granting of a temporary injunction depends on various factors, including the merits of the case and the balance of convenience. If the other party can prove that there is a possibility of irreparable harm or loss if the injunction is not granted, they may be successful in obtaining temporary injunction relief. However, your lawyer will be in a better position to assess the strength of their argument and provide guidance on how to respond effectively.Possession can be established in various ways, and it is not always necessary for someone to be physically staying inside the house. However, having someone present at the property, even as a watchman or caretaker, can help demonstrate that you are in possession and taking steps to protect your property. You should discuss the best approach with your lawyer, taking into account the specific circumstances and risks involved.Blocking the front gate with a car may provide an additional physical barrier, but it's important to consider the legal implications and potential consequences. Blocking the gate could be seen as an obstruction, and it may not be advisable without proper legal authorization. It's best to consult with your lawyer to explore legal ways to protect your property.Remember, the information provided here is general in nature, and it's crucial to consult with a qualified property lawyer who can provide you with advice specific to your case.

    "answer": "In general, when dealing with a criminal case, it's important to consider the potential consequences of any agreements or statements made to the police or other parties involved. If you agree to a settlement with the new buyers and provide a written statement indicating that you will withdraw the 156(3) case, it may have implications for your ability to pursue a criminal case in the future.By agreeing to a settlement, you may be effectively acknowledging that a resolution has been reached, and it could be difficult to later argue for the registration of an FIR if the new buyers fail to fulfill their part of the agreement. It may weaken your position in claiming that a criminal offense has taken place.Before making any decisions or providing any written statements, it is highly recommended to consult with your lawyer. They can review the specifics of your case, the proposed settlement, and provide advice on the potential consequences and risks involved.

    "question": "Protecting possession in case of fraudulent sale deed",
    "answer": "First set of queries:The presumption of summons being served may vary depending on the specific rules and procedures followed by the civil court in your jurisdiction. It's best to consult with your lawyer regarding this matter to understand the local rules and how they apply to your case.Again, the treatment of court vacation in relation to the filing of a written statement can depend on local rules and procedures. Typically, court vacations are excluded from the calculation of time limits. It's essential to consult with your lawyer to understand the specific rules applicable to your case.If you have already requested the relief of permanent injunction in your own suit, it may not be necessary to file a counterclaim for the same relief in their suit. Your lawyer can guide you on whether it's appropriate to include it as a counterclaim or if it should be pursued solely in your own suit.Whether to ask for consolidation of the suits or file a rejection of plaint application is a strategic decision that should be discussed with your lawyer. They will be familiar with the specific circumstances of your case and can advise you on the best course of action.Falsely stating facts in a suit can be a serious matter, but the decision to initiate a criminal case would depend on the specific laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. It's advisable to consult with your lawyer and possibly involve the police or appropriate authorities if there is evidence of fraudulent statements.Second set of queries:Once the FIR is lodged, it would be best to consult with your lawyer regarding the appropriate course of action. They can guide you on whether to inform the magistrate or file an application to withdraw the 156(3) application.The contents of the FIR should ideally include all relevant details and allegations. If you have suspicions or additional information that you believe is relevant, it's generally advisable to include them in your statement. Your lawyer can provide more specific guidance based on the laws and practices in your jurisdiction.Contacting the IO to provide your statement or inquire about the progress of the investigation may be a reasonable step. However, it's important to follow the guidance of your lawyer, who can advise you on the best way to proceed in your specific case.The status of arrests and the appropriate follow-up procedures can vary depending on the laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. Your lawyer would be the best person to guide you on the appropriate actions and who can provide updates on the progress of the case.Third set of queries:If you withdraw the 156(3) application after the FIR is registered, it may be possible to file a subsequent 156(3) application if you are dissatisfied with the police investigation. However, the availability and maintainability of such an application would depend on the specific laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. Consulting with your lawyer is crucial in this situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Father file case on sons self acquired property",
    "answer": "I understand your concerns regarding the property dispute with your father and brother. Here are some points to consider:Mediation: Mediation is an alternative dispute resolution process where a neutral third party helps facilitate negotiations between the parties involved in a dispute. While your lawyer may suggest mediation as a way to potentially resolve the dispute amicably, participation in mediation is voluntary. You have the right to decline mediation if you believe it will not lead to a satisfactory resolution or if you prefer to pursue the matter through the court.Court proceedings: If you choose not to pursue mediation or if mediation does not result in a settlement, the court proceedings will continue. It is within your rights to proceed with the legal process and seek a resolution through the court. Your lawyer should represent your interests and present the evidence and arguments on your behalf.Property ownership: Based on the information you provided, the property appears to be self-acquired by you. You have the necessary documents, such as the sales deed, EC, and bank statements, to prove your ownership. If you can establish that the property was purchased with your own funds and that your father and brother did not contribute financially, it strengthens your case for exclusive ownership.Tenants eviction: If you have valid grounds for eviction, such as non-payment of rent or breach of tenancy agreement, you can consider pursuing the eviction process parallel to the ongoing property dispute. Consult with your lawyer regarding the specific procedures and requirements for evicting tenants in your jurisdiction.NRI representation: As an NRI, you have the right to be informed about the progress of your case and to be involved in the legal proceedings. You can request your lawyer to provide you with regular updates and copies of court documents. If you feel that you are not being adequately represented or if you have concerns about the progress of the case, you may consider engaging a different lawyer or directly contacting the court for information.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Mother is Co Owner (housewife)- TDS Certificate Required?",
    "answer": "As an NRI buying a property with your mother as a co-owner, it's important to consider the relevant tax regulations and consult with a qualified tax professional or chartered accountant who specializes in NRI taxation to get accurate and up-to-date advice based on your specific circumstances. They will be able to guide you through the process and ensure compliance with the applicable tax laws.Regarding the TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) certificate, it's generally required when purchasing property from an NRI seller. The TDS rate for such transactions is typically 20% (plus applicable surcharges and cess) as per the Income Tax Act. However, there may be provisions for lower TDS rates or exemptions based on specific circumstances or if the buyer has obtained a certificate for a lower deduction or exemption from the Income Tax Department.The requirement for a TAN (Tax Deduction and Collection Account Number) typically applies to entities that are deducting or collecting tax at source. In the case of individuals, a TAN is generally not required unless they are conducting business or professional activities that mandate TDS compliance.Regarding the specific advice given by your friend about obtaining the TDS certificate in your mother's name, it's crucial to consult a tax professional who is familiar with your situation and the dispensation you have applied for with the Income Tax Department. They will be able to assess whether it is necessary or beneficial to obtain the TDS certificate in your mother's name, taking into account the applicable regulations and the specific dispensation you have sought.In summary, consulting with a qualified tax professional is strongly recommended to ensure that you understand and comply with the tax obligations associated with purchasing property as an NRI.

    "answer": "The tribal people cannot let out their patta land on lease neither they can alienate the proeprty in any manner.Especially since the land is situated in the forest area, you may not get permission for access to the land through the forest area.As the tribal land owners are managing their access to their land by their own arrangement through the forest and also the forest authorities are turning a blind eye to this arrangement, they may not face any problem.However if the tribal land owner decides to lease out the patta land, then it may attract the sore eyes of the authorities concerned and they may refuse permission without complying to the rules and other conditions in this regard.Any lease to the non-tribals even of the Government land situated in scheduled area is in violation of Scheduled Area Land Transfer Regulation.The provisions of  forest conservation Act also may be invoked to prohibit the land owners to seek path access to the leased out land to the non tribals.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Eco resort in partnership with Tribal landowner",
    "answer": "The procedure for establishing an eco-resort on tribal patta land and the departments involved in granting permissions can vary depending on the specific regulations and laws of the region where the land is located. However, I can provide you with a general overview of the steps typically involved in such a project:Consultation and agreement: The first step is to consult with the landlord and reach an agreement on the terms and conditions of the partnership. This may include discussing profit sharing, lease duration, responsibilities for development and maintenance, and any other relevant aspects. It is advisable to engage a legal professional to draft a formal agreement to protect the interests of all parties involved.Tribal department consultation: Since the land is tribal patta land, it is crucial to engage with the tribal department or similar authority responsible for tribal welfare and land rights. They can provide guidance on the specific requirements and procedures for development on tribal land. They may also require documentation such as a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the local tribal community or governing body.Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA): Given that the property is located in a forest area, it is likely that an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) will be necessary. This assessment evaluates the potential environmental impact of the proposed development and provides recommendations for mitigating any negative effects. Consult an environmental consultant or firm experienced in conducting EIAs to guide you through this process.Land use conversion and permissions: Depending on the regulations in your region, you may need to obtain permission for converting the land's use from agricultural to non-agricultural or commercial purposes. The specific department responsible for granting such permissions can vary, but it could be the revenue department or the local municipal or development authority. You may need to submit an application, along with the necessary documents and fees, to initiate the conversion process.Building permits and construction: Once you have the necessary land use conversion, you will need to obtain building permits and other construction-related approvals from the local municipal or development authority. This involves submitting detailed architectural plans, structural designs, and other relevant documents for review and approval.Other permits and clearances: Depending on the nature and scope of your eco-resort project, you may need to obtain additional permits and clearances from various departments. This can include fire safety clearances, food and hygiene licenses, liquor licenses (if applicable), permits for signage, and any other permits required by local regulations.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Property matter with my cousin",
    "answer": "In your case, since you and your brother have been residing in the Delhi house for 40 years and the mutation in MCD is in your father's name, you may have a strong claim of possession based on adverse possession laws. Adverse possession is a legal principle that allows a person who has occupied a property for a certain period of time without the owner's permission to claim legal ownership. The specific requirements for adverse possession vary by jurisdiction, so it's crucial to consult with a lawyer who is familiar with the laws in your area.Regarding the registered will from 2007, it will be considered as evidence in court, but its validity and enforceability will depend on various factors, including the laws of succession and the specific terms of the will. The court will examine the evidence and consider all the relevant circumstances, including the possession and occupation of the property by you and your family for 40 years.Additionally, the other wills that were made in 2010 and 2011, stating that the registered will is invalid and that the Delhi house should be shared equally, may also be considered by the court as evidence of the intentions of your father and uncle. However, the court will thoroughly assess the authenticity and validity of these wills, including the circumstances under which they were made.The photocopies of the wills, the NOC, and the letter to the society may serve as supporting evidence in your case. However, it's important to note that the court will carefully evaluate the authenticity and credibility of these documents.Ultimately, the court will make a decision based on the evidence presented and the applicable laws. Family settlements can be considered by the court if all parties involved are willing to resolve the matter through negotiation and reach a mutually acceptable agreement. However, if the dispute cannot be settled amicably, the court may have to adjudicate the matter and make a final decision.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client  false FIR: If the police have conducted an investigation and concluded that there are no financial irregularities or criminal offenses committed by the society management committee, it may be difficult for them to prove that the FIR was false. However, the final decision rests with the magistrate. If you believe that the FIR was filed in good faith and there was a reasonable basis for your complaint, you can present your case to the court.Selective targeting: It's possible for the society to file a complaint against specific individuals rather than all ten complainants, but this would depend on the evidence and circumstances of the case. The court will assess the validity of the complaint based on the evidence and arguments presented.Defamation: The statement you mentioned in the FIR, claiming that the management committee members have duped people of their hard-earned money, may be considered defamatory if it harms their reputation. Defamation cases require proving that the statement was false and caused harm to the reputation of the individuals involved. If the statement is found to be false and made with the intent to harm their reputation, they may pursue a defamation case against you. It would be best to consult with a lawyer who specializes in defamation cases to understand the specific legal implications in your jurisdiction.Regarding the society's collection of money and selling unauthorized flats, it may be necessary to consult with a lawyer who specializes in real estate and property laws.

    "answer": "Dear client,Granting a Power of Attorney (POA) to your father would allow him to act on your behalf in various matters, including signing documents related to the property transaction. However, it's important to note that the specific powers granted through the POA need to be carefully defined. In your case, if the assignment process involves signing documents related to the sale of the property, it's crucial to ensure that the powers granted in the POA explicitly cover such actions.Regarding the registration process, it's generally required for the parties involved in the property transaction (buyer, seller, builder, etc.) to be present or represented during the registration at the registrar's office. Your father, as the holder of the POA, may represent you during the registration process. It's advisable to check the specific requirements and procedures with a legal professional or consult the local registrar office for accurate information.Regarding the format of the GPA, it's advisable to consult with a legal professional who can provide you with the appropriate format based on your specific requirements and jurisdiction. They can also guide you on whether the GPA needs to be attested by the Indian Consulate in the USA, as this may vary depending on the circumstances and jurisdiction.As for your additional questions:It's possible that your father may need to be present as a witness during the registration process, but the specific requirements may vary based on local regulations. It's advisable to consult with a legal professional or the registrar office for accurate information.If the lender (LICHFL) has informed you that they do not require a specific GPA format, but a general GPA is required by your father, you should consult with a legal professional to ensure that the GPA covers all necessary aspects and provides the required authority to your father.If the builder (Prestige) has provided a specific POA draft for the assignment process, it's advisable to review the draft carefully and consult with a legal professional to ensure it aligns with your requirements and covers all necessary aspects. Depending on the specific terms and conditions of the builder's draft, you may or may not need an additional GPA.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "In your case, since you and your brother have been residing in the Delhi house for 40 years and the mutation in MCD is in your father's name, you may have a strong claim of possession based on adverse possession laws. Adverse possession is a legal principle that allows a person who has occupied a property for a certain period of time without the owner's permission to claim legal ownership. The specific requirements for adverse possession vary by jurisdiction, so it's crucial to consult with a lawyer who is familiar with the laws in your area.Regarding the registered will from 2007, it will be considered as evidence in court, but its validity and enforceability will depend on various factors, including the laws of succession and the specific terms of the will. The court will examine the evidence and consider all the relevant circumstances, including the possession and occupation of the property by you and your family for 40 years.Additionally, the other wills that were made in 2010 and 2011, stating that the registered will is invalid and that the Delhi house should be shared equally, may also be considered by the court as evidence of the intentions of your father and uncle. However, the court will thoroughly assess the authenticity and validity of these wills, including the circumstances under which they were made.The photocopies of the wills, the NOC, and the letter to the society may serve as supporting evidence in your case. However, it's important to note that the court will carefully evaluate the authenticity and credibility of these documents.Ultimately, the court will make a decision based on the evidence presented and the applicable laws. Family settlements can be considered by the court if all parties involved are willing to resolve the matter through negotiation and reach a mutually acceptable agreement. However, if the dispute cannot be settled amicably, the court may have to adjudicate the matter and make a final decision.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Car not yet transferred by online dealer Cars24",
    "answer": "Dear client,Sending a legal notice: If the buyer has failed to transfer the car to his or his dealer's name and has not returned the car to you, you can consider sending a legal notice through the court to assert your rights and demand compliance. Your lawyer can assist you in drafting and sending the notice. The notice can be sent from the jurisdiction where the transaction took place or where the buyer is located. Your lawyer will guide you on the appropriate jurisdiction for sending the notice.Other options: Apart from sending a legal notice, you may explore other legal options available to you. These could include filing a complaint with the local consumer court or approaching the appropriate authorities in your jurisdiction to report the non-transfer of the vehicle and seek their intervention. Your lawyer can guide you on the best course of action based on the specific laws and regulations of your jurisdiction.Documentation and evidence: Gather all the relevant documentation related to the sale of the car, including the sale agreement, affidavit copy, online transaction details, and any other communication or evidence that proves your ownership transfer. These documents will be crucial in supporting your case and asserting your rights.Resolution of the accident matter: Since the car is still registered in your name, it is essential to ensure that the accident matter is properly resolved and any liabilities or claims are appropriately addressed. If necessary, consult your lawyer to ensure that all legal requirements are fulfilled and your involvement in the accident is properly documented and resolved.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Protecting possession in case of fraudulent sale deed",
    "answer": "Dear client,It is generally not permissible to file multiple suits on the same cause of action. If both suits involve the same cause of action and the same parties, the second suit may be stayed or consolidated with the first suit under Section 10 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC). You should discuss this matter with your lawyer, who can file the appropriate application to the court to request the stay of the second suit.The granting of a temporary injunction depends on various factors, including the merits of the case and the balance of convenience. If the other party can prove that there is a possibility of irreparable harm or loss if the injunction is not granted, they may be successful in obtaining temporary injunction relief. However, your lawyer will be in a better position to assess the strength of their argument and provide guidance on how to respond effectively.Possession can be established in various ways, and it is not always necessary for someone to be physically staying inside the house. However, having someone present at the property, even as a watchman or caretaker, can help demonstrate that you are in possession and taking steps to protect your property. You should discuss the best approach with your lawyer, taking into account the specific circumstances and risks involved.Blocking the front gate with a car may provide an additional physical barrier, but it's important to consider the legal implications and potential consequences. Blocking the gate could be seen as an obstruction, and it may not be advisable without proper legal authorization. It's best to consult with your lawyer to explore legal ways to protect your property.Remember, the information provided here is general in nature, and it's crucial to consult with a qualified property lawyer who can provide you with advice specific to your case.

    "question": "Protecting possession in case of fraudulent sale deed",
    "answer": "In general, when dealing with a criminal case, it's important to consider the potential consequences of any agreements or statements made to the police or other parties involved. If you agree to a settlement with the new buyers and provide a written statement indicating that you will withdraw the 156(3) case, it may have implications for your ability to pursue a criminal case in the future.By agreeing to a settlement, you may be effectively acknowledging that a resolution has been reached, and it could be difficult to later argue for the registration of an FIR if the new buyers fail to fulfill their part of the agreement. It may weaken your position in claiming that a criminal offense has taken place.Before making any decisions or providing any written statements, it is highly recommended to consult with your lawyer. They can review the specifics of your case, the proposed settlement, and provide advice on the potential consequences and risks involved. They can also guide you on how to protect your interests and ensure that your rights are safeguarded throughout the legal process.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "First set of queries:The presumption of summons being served may vary depending on the specific rules and procedures followed by the civil court in your jurisdiction. It's best to consult with your lawyer regarding this matter to understand the local rules and how they apply to your case.Again, the treatment of court vacation in relation to the filing of a written statement can depend on local rules and procedures. Typically, court vacations are excluded from the calculation of time limits. It's essential to consult with your lawyer to understand the specific rules applicable to your case.If you have already requested the relief of permanent injunction in your own suit, it may not be necessary to file a counterclaim for the same relief in their suit. Your lawyer can guide you on whether it's appropriate to include it as a counterclaim or if it should be pursued solely in your own suit.Whether to ask for consolidation of the suits or file a rejection of plaint application is a strategic decision that should be discussed with your lawyer. They will be familiar with the specific circumstances of your case and can advise you on the best course of action.Falsely stating facts in a suit can be a serious matter, but the decision to initiate a criminal case would depend on the specific laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. It's advisable to consult with your lawyer and possibly involve the police or appropriate authorities if there is evidence of fraudulent statements.Second set of queries:Once the FIR is lodged, it would be best to consult with your lawyer regarding the appropriate course of action. They can guide you on whether to inform the magistrate or file an application to withdraw the 156(3) application.The contents of the FIR should ideally include all relevant details and allegations. If you have suspicions or additional information that you believe is relevant, it's generally advisable to include them in your statement. Your lawyer can provide more specific guidance based on the laws and practices in your jurisdiction.Contacting the IO to provide your statement or inquire about the progress of the investigation may be a reasonable step. However, it's important to follow the guidance of your lawyer, who can advise you on the best way to proceed in your specific case.The status of arrests and the appropriate follow-up procedures can vary depending on the laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. Your lawyer would be the best person to guide you on the appropriate actions and who can provide updates on the progress of the case.Third set of queries:If you withdraw the 156(3) application after the FIR is registered, it may be possible to file a subsequent 156(3) application if you are dissatisfied with the police investigation. However, the availability and maintainability of such an application would depend on the specific laws and procedures in your jurisdiction.

    "answer": "Dear client,Granting a Power of Attorney (POA) to your father would allow him to act on your behalf in various matters, including signing documents related to the property transaction. However, it's important to note that the specific powers granted through the POA need to be carefully defined. In your case, if the assignment process involves signing documents related to the sale of the property, it's crucial to ensure that the powers granted in the POA explicitly cover such actions.Regarding the registration process, it's generally required for the parties involved in the property transaction (buyer, seller, builder, etc.) to be present or represented during the registration at the registrar's office. Your father, as the holder of the POA, may represent you during the registration process. It's advisable to check the specific requirements and procedures with a legal professional or consult the local registrar office for accurate information.Regarding the format of the GPA, it's advisable to consult with a legal professional who can provide you with the appropriate format based on your specific requirements and jurisdiction. They can also guide you on whether the GPA needs to be attested by the Indian Consulate in the USA, as this may vary depending on the circumstances and jurisdiction.As for your additional questions:It's possible that your father may need to be present as a witness during the registration process, but the specific requirements may vary based on local regulations. It's advisable to consult with a legal professional or the registrar office for accurate information.If the lender (LICHFL) has informed you that they do not require a specific GPA format, but a general GPA is required by your father, you should consult with a legal professional to ensure that the GPA covers all necessary aspects and provides the required authority to your father.If the builder (Prestige) has provided a specific POA draft for the assignment process, it's advisable to review the draft carefully and consult with a legal professional to ensure it aligns with your requirements and covers all necessary aspects. Depending on the specific terms and conditions of the builder's draft, you may or may not need an additional GPA.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Property matter with my cousin",
    "answer": "In your case, since you and your brother have been residing in the Delhi house for 40 years and the mutation in MCD is in your father's name, you may have a strong claim of possession based on adverse possession laws. Adverse possession is a legal principle that allows a person who has occupied a property for a certain period of time without the owner's permission to claim legal ownership. The specific requirements for adverse possession vary by jurisdiction, so it's crucial to consult with a lawyer who is familiar with the laws in your area.Regarding the registered will from 2007, it will be considered as evidence in court, but its validity and enforceability will depend on various factors, including the laws of succession and the specific terms of the will. The court will examine the evidence and consider all the relevant circumstances, including the possession and occupation of the property by you and your family for 40 years.Additionally, the other wills that were made in 2010 and 2011, stating that the registered will is invalid and that the Delhi house should be shared equally, may also be considered by the court as evidence of the intentions of your father and uncle. However, the court will thoroughly assess the authenticity and validity of these wills, including the circumstances under which they were made.The photocopies of the wills, the NOC, and the letter to the society may serve as supporting evidence in your case. However, it's important to note that the court will carefully evaluate the authenticity and credibility of these documents.Ultimately, the court will make a decision based on the evidence presented and the applicable laws. Family settlements can be considered by the court if all parties involved are willing to resolve the matter through negotiation and reach a mutually acceptable agreement. However, if the dispute cannot be settled amicably, the court may have to adjudicate the matter and make a final decision.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Understanding the legal requirements: Request clarification from the bankers about their specific concerns and the legal basis for their insistence on registering the 2nd sale. Gain a clear understanding of their requirements to better formulate your argument or seek alternative solutions.Review the applicable laws: Research and review the relevant property laws and regulations in your jurisdiction. Understand the legal implications of not registering the 2nd sale and any potential consequences it may have on the validity of subsequent transactions.Obtain legal opinion: Seek the advice of a qualified lawyer who specializes in property law. Share all the relevant details and documents related to the property, including the agreements and any correspondence regarding the non-registration of the 2nd sale. The lawyer can evaluate the situation based on the specific laws in your jurisdiction and provide you with a legal opinion on the matter.Validate the chain of ownership: Verify and document the chain of ownership from the 1st sale to your purchase. Collect all available legal documents, such as sale agreements, registration papers, and payment receipts, to establish a clear and consistent transfer of ownership.Consider alternative solutions: If registering the 2nd sale is not possible due to the death of the parties involved, discuss with your lawyer and the bankers potential alternative solutions to satisfy their requirements. This may include providing additional legal documentation, indemnity bonds, or obtaining a court order or clearance declaring the validity of the subsequent transactions.Negotiate with the bankers: Engage in open communication with the bankers and present your case supported by legal opinions and relevant documentation. Explain the circumstances surrounding the non-registration of the 2nd sale and emphasize that all necessary stamp duty and penalties were paid during the 3rd sale. Explore options for resolving the issue that are mutually acceptable to both parties.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, the Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021 allows a woman above the age of 21 to undergo artificial insemination, but in case of a married woman the consent of the ‘commissioning couple’ is required. This renders a married woman dependent on the wishes of the husband, which is acceptable if the couple lives together as it should be a mutual decision but in cases like the present matter when divorce proceedings have been initiated, the woman becomes hapless.What are demands of wife? it is court to adjudicate on this issue, however, you can oppose her demands and can also refute her.Q-2.Joint properties are liable to be divided among husband and wife.

A neutral third-party mediator can help facilitate discussions and find mutually acceptable solutions.File for divorce: If mediation or negotiation fails or is not a viable option, the spouse seeking divorce can file a divorce petition in the appropriate family court. The divorce petition should outline the grounds for divorce and the desired relief, such as property division and child custody.Property division: In the case of joint property, the court will typically consider various factors, including the contributions made by each spouse and the length of the marriage, to determine a fair division of assets. The specific laws and procedures for property division may vary depending on the jurisdiction.Timeframe: The time it takes to conclude a divorce case can vary widely depending on several factors, including the complexity of the case, the backlog of cases in the court system, and the level of cooperation between the parties.

    "question": "Car not yet transferred by online dealer Cars24",
    "answer": "Dear client,Sending a legal notice: If the buyer has failed to transfer the car to his or his dealer's name and has not returned the car to you, you can consider sending a legal notice through the court to assert your rights and demand compliance. Your lawyer can assist you in drafting and sending the notice. The notice can be sent from the jurisdiction where the transaction took place or where the buyer is located. Your lawyer will guide you on the appropriate jurisdiction for sending the notice.Other options: Apart from sending a legal notice, you may explore other legal options available to you. These could include filing a complaint with the local consumer court or approaching the appropriate authorities in your jurisdiction to report the non-transfer of the vehicle and seek their intervention. Your lawyer can guide you on the best course of action based on the specific laws and regulations of your jurisdiction.Documentation and evidence: Gather all the relevant documentation related to the sale of the car, including the sale agreement, affidavit copy, online transaction details, and any other communication or evidence that proves your ownership transfer. These documents will be crucial in supporting your case and asserting your rights.Resolution of the accident matter: Since the car is still registered in your name, it is essential to ensure that the accident matter is properly resolved and any liabilities or claims are appropriately addressed. If necessary, consult your lawyer to ensure that all legal requirements are fulfilled and your involvement in the accident is properly documented and resolved.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Property matter with my cousin",
    "answer": "In your case, since you and your brother have been residing in the Delhi house for 40 years and the mutation in MCD is in your father's name, you may have a strong claim of possession based on adverse possession laws. Adverse possession is a legal principle that allows a person who has occupied a property for a certain period of time without the owner's permission to claim legal ownership. The specific requirements for adverse possession vary by jurisdiction, so it's crucial to consult with a lawyer who is familiar with the laws in your area.Regarding the registered will from 2007, it will be considered as evidence in court, but its validity and enforceability will depend on various factors, including the laws of succession and the specific terms of the will. The court will examine the evidence and consider all the relevant circumstances, including the possession and occupation of the property by you and your family for 40 years.Additionally, the other wills that were made in 2010 and 2011, stating that the registered will is invalid and that the Delhi house should be shared equally, may also be considered by the court as evidence of the intentions of your father and uncle. However, the court will thoroughly assess the authenticity and validity of these wills, including the circumstances under which they were made.The photocopies of the wills, the NOC, and the letter to the society may serve as supporting evidence in your case. However, it's important to note that the court will carefully evaluate the authenticity and credibility of these documents.Ultimately, the court will make a decision based on the evidence presented and the applicable laws. Family settlements can be considered by the court if all parties involved are willing to resolve the matter through negotiation and reach a mutually acceptable agreement. However, if the dispute cannot be settled amicably, the court may have to adjudicate the matter and make a final decision.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client  false FIR: If the police have conducted an investigation and concluded that there are no financial irregularities or criminal offenses committed by the society management committee, it may be difficult for them to prove that the FIR was false. However, the final decision rests with the magistrate. If you believe that the FIR was filed in good faith and there was a reasonable basis for your complaint, you can present your case to the court.Selective targeting: It's possible for the society to file a complaint against specific individuals rather than all ten complainants, but this would depend on the evidence and circumstances of the case. The court will assess the validity of the complaint based on the evidence and arguments presented.Defamation: The statement you mentioned in the FIR, claiming that the management committee members have duped people of their hard-earned money, may be considered defamatory if it harms their reputation. Defamation cases require proving that the statement was false and caused harm to the reputation of the individuals involved. If the statement is found to be false and made with the intent to harm their reputation, they may pursue a defamation case against you. It would be best to consult with a lawyer who specializes in defamation cases to understand the specific legal implications in your jurisdiction.Regarding the society's collection of money and selling unauthorized flats, it may be necessary to consult with a lawyer who specializes in real estate and property laws.

    "answer": "Foreign court decree of divorce or dissolution of marriage can be valid in India provided such decree is according to the provision of law in India as provided under section 13 of the Civil Procedure Code and Principle of law as laid down by the Indian courts. A foreign court divorce decree may be valid in India ONLY if the spouse had lived in that country and had consented to that country's jurisdiction.In a contested case, the decree from Non reciprocating territory like Australia is  valid. Foreign orders/ decrees/judgments cannot be directly executed in India unless they are the judgments of courts in \"reciprocating territories\". In all other cases, the only mode of giving effect to a foreign judgment is to file a suit on the judgment in an appropriate Indian court, which has to be tested by section 13 of the Civil Procedure Code.Section 13 of the CPC deals with alternatives under which a foreign decree may not be recognized by an Indian Court; and until and unless, the foreign decree is in conformity with the public policy which is equity and good conscience, such a decree may not be recognizedAfter getting the decree , 498A has no validity and criminal case filed by your wife will not be maintainable.

    "answer": "Dear client,Granting a Power of Attorney (POA) to your father would allow him to act on your behalf in various matters, including signing documents related to the property transaction. However, it's important to note that the specific powers granted through the POA need to be carefully defined. In your case, if the assignment process involves signing documents related to the sale of the property, it's crucial to ensure that the powers granted in the POA explicitly cover such actions.Regarding the registration process, it's generally required for the parties involved in the property transaction (buyer, seller, builder, etc.) to be present or represented during the registration at the registrar's office. Your father, as the holder of the POA, may represent you during the registration process. It's advisable to check the specific requirements and procedures with a legal professional or consult the local registrar office for accurate information.Regarding the format of the GPA, it's advisable to consult with a legal professional who can provide you with the appropriate format based on your specific requirements and jurisdiction. They can also guide you on whether the GPA needs to be attested by the Indian Consulate in the USA, as this may vary depending on the circumstances and jurisdiction.As for your additional questions:It's possible that your father may need to be present as a witness during the registration process, but the specific requirements may vary based on local regulations. It's advisable to consult with a legal professional or the registrar office for accurate information.If the lender (LICHFL) has informed you that they do not require a specific GPA format, but a general GPA is required by your father, you should consult with a legal professional to ensure that the GPA covers all necessary aspects and provides the required authority to your father.If the builder (Prestige) has provided a specific POA draft for the assignment process, it's advisable to review the draft carefully and consult with a legal professional to ensure it aligns with your requirements and covers all necessary aspects. Depending on the specific terms and conditions of the builder's draft, you may or may not need an additional GPA.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Property matter with my cousin",
    "answer": "In your case, since you and your brother have been residing in the Delhi house for 40 years and the mutation in MCD is in your father's name, you may have a strong claim of possession based on adverse possession laws. Adverse possession is a legal principle that allows a person who has occupied a property for a certain period of time without the owner's permission to claim legal ownership. The specific requirements for adverse possession vary by jurisdiction, so it's crucial to consult with a lawyer who is familiar with the laws in your area.Regarding the registered will from 2007, it will be considered as evidence in court, but its validity and enforceability will depend on various factors, including the laws of succession and the specific terms of the will. The court will examine the evidence and consider all the relevant circumstances, including the possession and occupation of the property by you and your family for 40 years.Additionally, the other wills that were made in 2010 and 2011, stating that the registered will is invalid and that the Delhi house should be shared equally, may also be considered by the court as evidence of the intentions of your father and uncle. However, the court will thoroughly assess the authenticity and validity of these wills, including the circumstances under which they were made.The photocopies of the wills, the NOC, and the letter to the society may serve as supporting evidence in your case. However, it's important to note that the court will carefully evaluate the authenticity and credibility of these documents.Ultimately, the court will make a decision based on the evidence presented and the applicable laws. Family settlements can be considered by the court if all parties involved are willing to resolve the matter through negotiation and reach a mutually acceptable agreement. However, if the dispute cannot be settled amicably, the court may have to adjudicate the matter and make a final decision.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

A foreign court divorce decree may be valid in India ONLY if the spouse had lived in that country and had consented to that country's jurisdiction.In a contested case, the decree from Non reciprocating territory like Australia is  valid. Foreign orders/ decrees/judgments cannot be directly executed in India unless they are the judgments of courts in \"reciprocating territories\". In all other cases, the only mode of giving effect to a foreign judgment is to file a suit on the judgment in an appropriate Indian court, which has to be tested by section 13 of the Civil Procedure Code.Section 13 of the CPC deals with alternatives under which a foreign decree may not be recognized by an Indian Court; and until and unless, the foreign decree is in conformity with the public policy which is equity and good conscience, such a decree may not be recognizedAfter getting the decree , 498A has no validity and criminal case filed by your wife will not be maintainable.

    "answer": "Since you are not the title holder to the property, even otherwise you cannot execute the registered sale deed in favor of the prospective buyer.But as you entered into a sale agreement with the builder, a tripartite agreement with the builder is imminent,However as you are not physically present you can authorise your father to sign the agreement on your behalf and for this he can have a notarised POA deed, and as the tripartite agreement would be executed on an unregistered document, the power of attorney deed also need not be executed by a registered document.For getting the format of the POA deed, you can engage the services of any advocate of this forum or outside.An attestation by a local notary public of your country of residence would be sufficient to attest the POA deed.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear client,Granting a Power of Attorney (POA) to your father would allow him to act on your behalf in various matters, including signing documents related to the property transaction. However, it's important to note that the specific powers granted through the POA need to be carefully defined. In your case, if the assignment process involves signing documents related to the sale of the property, it's crucial to ensure that the powers granted in the POA explicitly cover such actions.Regarding the registration process, it's generally required for the parties involved in the property transaction (buyer, seller, builder, etc.) to be present or represented during the registration at the registrar's office. Your father, as the holder of the POA, may represent you during the registration process. It's advisable to check the specific requirements and procedures with a legal professional or consult the local registrar office for accurate information.Regarding the format of the GPA, it's advisable to consult with a legal professional who can provide you with the appropriate format based on your specific requirements and jurisdiction. They can also guide you on whether the GPA needs to be attested by the Indian Consulate in the USA, as this may vary depending on the circumstances and jurisdiction.As for your additional questions:It's possible that your father may need to be present as a witness during the registration process, but the specific requirements may vary based on local regulations. It's advisable to consult with a legal professional or the registrar office for accurate information.If the lender (LICHFL) has informed you that they do not require a specific GPA format, but a general GPA is required by your father, you should consult with a legal professional to ensure that the GPA covers all necessary aspects and provides the required authority to your father.If the builder (Prestige) has provided a specific POA draft for the assignment process, it's advisable to review the draft carefully and consult with a legal professional to ensure it aligns with your requirements and covers all necessary aspects. Depending on the specific terms and conditions of the builder's draft, you may or may not need an additional GPA.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Property matter with my cousin",
    "answer": "In your case, since you and your brother have been residing in the Delhi house for 40 years and the mutation in MCD is in your father's name, you may have a strong claim of possession based on adverse possession laws. Adverse possession is a legal principle that allows a person who has occupied a property for a certain period of time without the owner's permission to claim legal ownership. The specific requirements for adverse possession vary by jurisdiction, so it's crucial to consult with a lawyer who is familiar with the laws in your area.Regarding the registered will from 2007, it will be considered as evidence in court, but its validity and enforceability will depend on various factors, including the laws of succession and the specific terms of the will. The court will examine the evidence and consider all the relevant circumstances, including the possession and occupation of the property by you and your family for 40 years.Additionally, the other wills that were made in 2010 and 2011, stating that the registered will is invalid and that the Delhi house should be shared equally, may also be considered by the court as evidence of the intentions of your father and uncle. However, the court will thoroughly assess the authenticity and validity of these wills, including the circumstances under which they were made.The photocopies of the wills, the NOC, and the letter to the society may serve as supporting evidence in your case. However, it's important to note that the court will carefully evaluate the authenticity and credibility of these documents.Ultimately, the court will make a decision based on the evidence presented and the applicable laws. Family settlements can be considered by the court if all parties involved are willing to resolve the matter through negotiation and reach a mutually acceptable agreement. However, if the dispute cannot be settled amicably, the court may have to adjudicate the matter and make a final decision.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Foreign court decree of divorce or dissolution of marriage can be valid in India provided such decree is according to the provision of law in India as provided under section 13 of the Civil Procedure Code and Principle of law as laid down by the Indian courts. A foreign court divorce decree may be valid in India ONLY if the spouse had lived in that country and had consented to that country's jurisdiction.In a contested case, the decree from Non reciprocating territory like Australia is  valid. Foreign orders/ decrees/judgments cannot be directly executed in India unless they are the judgments of courts in \"reciprocating territories\". In all other cases, the only mode of giving effect to a foreign judgment is to file a suit on the judgment in an appropriate Indian court, which has to be tested by section 13 of the Civil Procedure Code.Section 13 of the CPC deals with alternatives under which a foreign decree may not be recognized by an Indian Court; and until and unless, the foreign decree is in conformity with the public policy which is equity and good conscience, such a decree may not be recognizedAfter getting the decree , 498A has no validity and criminal case filed by your wife will not be maintainable.

However, it's important to note that the specific powers granted through the POA need to be carefully defined. In your case, if the assignment process involves signing documents related to the sale of the property, it's crucial to ensure that the powers granted in the POA explicitly cover such actions.Regarding the registration process, it's generally required for the parties involved in the property transaction (buyer, seller, builder, etc.) to be present or represented during the registration at the registrar's office. Your father, as the holder of the POA, may represent you during the registration process. It's advisable to check the specific requirements and procedures with a legal professional or consult the local registrar office for accurate information.Regarding the format of the GPA, it's advisable to consult with a legal professional who can provide you with the appropriate format based on your specific requirements and jurisdiction. They can also guide you on whether the GPA needs to be attested by the Indian Consulate in the USA, as this may vary depending on the circumstances and jurisdiction.As for your additional questions:It's possible that your father may need to be present as a witness during the registration process, but the specific requirements may vary based on local regulations. It's advisable to consult with a legal professional or the registrar office for accurate information.If the lender (LICHFL) has informed you that they do not require a specific GPA format, but a general GPA is required by your father, you should consult with a legal professional to ensure that the GPA covers all necessary aspects and provides the required authority to your father.If the builder (Prestige) has provided a specific POA draft for the assignment process, it's advisable to review the draft carefully and consult with a legal professional to ensure it aligns with your requirements and covers all necessary aspects.

    "answer": "In your case, since you and your brother have been residing in the Delhi house for 40 years and the mutation in MCD is in your father's name, you may have a strong claim of possession based on adverse possession laws. Adverse possession is a legal principle that allows a person who has occupied a property for a certain period of time without the owner's permission to claim legal ownership. The specific requirements for adverse possession vary by jurisdiction, so it's crucial to consult with a lawyer who is familiar with the laws in your area.Regarding the registered will from 2007, it will be considered as evidence in court, but its validity and enforceability will depend on various factors, including the laws of succession and the specific terms of the will. The court will examine the evidence and consider all the relevant circumstances, including the possession and occupation of the property by you and your family for 40 years.Additionally, the other wills that were made in 2010 and 2011, stating that the registered will is invalid and that the Delhi house should be shared equally, may also be considered by the court as evidence of the intentions of your father and uncle. However, the court will thoroughly assess the authenticity and validity of these wills, including the circumstances under which they were made.The photocopies of the wills, the NOC, and the letter to the society may serve as supporting evidence in your case. However, it's important to note that the court will carefully evaluate the authenticity and credibility of these documents.Ultimately, the court will make a decision based on the evidence presented and the applicable laws. Family settlements can be considered by the court if all parties involved are willing to resolve the matter through negotiation and reach a mutually acceptable agreement. However, if the dispute cannot be settled amicably, the court may have to adjudicate the matter and make a final decision.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

A foreign court divorce decree may be valid in India ONLY if the spouse had lived in that country and had consented to that country's jurisdiction.In a contested case, the decree from Non reciprocating territory like Australia is  valid. Foreign orders/ decrees/judgments cannot be directly executed in India unless they are the judgments of courts in \"reciprocating territories\". In all other cases, the only mode of giving effect to a foreign judgment is to file a suit on the judgment in an appropriate Indian court, which has to be tested by section 13 of the Civil Procedure Code.Section 13 of the CPC deals with alternatives under which a foreign decree may not be recognized by an Indian Court; and until and unless, the foreign decree is in conformity with the public policy which is equity and good conscience, such a decree may not be recognizedAfter getting the decree , 498A has no validity and criminal case filed by your wife will not be maintainable.

However, the final decision rests with the magistrate. If you believe that the FIR was filed in good faith and there was a reasonable basis for your complaint, you can present your case to the court.Selective targeting: It's possible for the society to file a complaint against specific individuals rather than all ten complainants, but this would depend on the evidence and circumstances of the case. The court will assess the validity of the complaint based on the evidence and arguments presented.Defamation: The statement you mentioned in the FIR, claiming that the management committee members have duped people of their hard-earned money, may be considered defamatory if it harms their reputation. Defamation cases require proving that the statement was false and caused harm to the reputation of the individuals involved. If the statement is found to be false and made with the intent to harm their reputation, they may pursue a defamation case against you. It would be best to consult with a lawyer who specializes in defamation cases to understand the specific legal implications in your jurisdiction.Regarding the society's collection of money and selling unauthorized flats, it may be necessary to consult with a lawyer who specializes in real estate and property laws.

    "question": "Eco resort in partnership with Tribal landowner",
    "answer": "The procedure for establishing an eco-resort on tribal patta land and the departments involved in granting permissions can vary depending on the specific regulations and laws of the region where the land is located. However, I can provide you with a general overview of the steps typically involved in such a project:Consultation and agreement: The first step is to consult with the landlord and reach an agreement on the terms and conditions of the partnership. This may include discussing profit sharing, lease duration, responsibilities for development and maintenance, and any other relevant aspects. It is advisable to engage a legal professional to draft a formal agreement to protect the interests of all parties involved.Tribal department consultation: Since the land is tribal patta land, it is crucial to engage with the tribal department or similar authority responsible for tribal welfare and land rights. They can provide guidance on the specific requirements and procedures for development on tribal land. They may also require documentation such as a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the local tribal community or governing body.Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA): Given that the property is located in a forest area, it is likely that an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) will be necessary. This assessment evaluates the potential environmental impact of the proposed development and provides recommendations for mitigating any negative effects. Consult an environmental consultant or firm experienced in conducting EIAs to guide you through this process.Land use conversion and permissions: Depending on the regulations in your region, you may need to obtain permission for converting the land's use from agricultural to non-agricultural or commercial purposes. The specific department responsible for granting such permissions can vary, but it could be the revenue department or the local municipal or development authority. You may need to submit an application, along with the necessary documents and fees, to initiate the conversion process.Building permits and construction: Once you have the necessary land use conversion, you will need to obtain building permits and other construction-related approvals from the local municipal or development authority. This involves submitting detailed architectural plans, structural designs, and other relevant documents for review and approval.Other permits and clearances: Depending on the nature and scope of your eco-resort project, you may need to obtain additional permits and clearances from various departments. This can include fire safety clearances, food and hygiene licenses, liquor licenses (if applicable), permits for signage, and any other permits required by local regulations.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Foreign court decree of divorce or dissolution of marriage can be valid in India provided such decree is according to the provision of law in India as provided under section 13 of the Civil Procedure Code and Principle of law as laid down by the Indian courts. A foreign court divorce decree may be valid in India ONLY if the spouse had lived in that country and had consented to that country's jurisdiction.In a contested case, the decree from Non reciprocating territory like Australia is  valid. Foreign orders/ decrees/judgments cannot be directly executed in India unless they are the judgments of courts in \"reciprocating territories\". In all other cases, the only mode of giving effect to a foreign judgment is to file a suit on the judgment in an appropriate Indian court, which has to be tested by section 13 of the Civil Procedure Code.Section 13 of the CPC deals with alternatives under which a foreign decree may not be recognized by an Indian Court; and until and unless, the foreign decree is in conformity with the public policy which is equity and good conscience, such a decree may not be recognizedAfter getting the decree , 498A has no validity and criminal case filed by your wife will not be maintainable.

    "answer": "Dear client  false FIR: If the police have conducted an investigation and concluded that there are no financial irregularities or criminal offenses committed by the society management committee, it may be difficult for them to prove that the FIR was false. However, the final decision rests with the magistrate. If you believe that the FIR was filed in good faith and there was a reasonable basis for your complaint, you can present your case to the court.Selective targeting: It's possible for the society to file a complaint against specific individuals rather than all ten complainants, but this would depend on the evidence and circumstances of the case. The court will assess the validity of the complaint based on the evidence and arguments presented.Defamation: The statement you mentioned in the FIR, claiming that the management committee members have duped people of their hard-earned money, may be considered defamatory if it harms their reputation. Defamation cases require proving that the statement was false and caused harm to the reputation of the individuals involved. If the statement is found to be false and made with the intent to harm their reputation, they may pursue a defamation case against you. It would be best to consult with a lawyer who specializes in defamation cases to understand the specific legal implications in your jurisdiction.Regarding the society's collection of money and selling unauthorized flats, it may be necessary to consult with a lawyer who specializes in real estate and property laws.

    "question": "Eco resort in partnership with Tribal landowner",
    "answer": "The procedure for establishing an eco-resort on tribal patta land and the departments involved in granting permissions can vary depending on the specific regulations and laws of the region where the land is located. However, I can provide you with a general overview of the steps typically involved in such a project:Consultation and agreement: The first step is to consult with the landlord and reach an agreement on the terms and conditions of the partnership. This may include discussing profit sharing, lease duration, responsibilities for development and maintenance, and any other relevant aspects. It is advisable to engage a legal professional to draft a formal agreement to protect the interests of all parties involved.Tribal department consultation: Since the land is tribal patta land, it is crucial to engage with the tribal department or similar authority responsible for tribal welfare and land rights. They can provide guidance on the specific requirements and procedures for development on tribal land. They may also require documentation such as a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the local tribal community or governing body.Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA): Given that the property is located in a forest area, it is likely that an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) will be necessary. This assessment evaluates the potential environmental impact of the proposed development and provides recommendations for mitigating any negative effects. Consult an environmental consultant or firm experienced in conducting EIAs to guide you through this process.Land use conversion and permissions: Depending on the regulations in your region, you may need to obtain permission for converting the land's use from agricultural to non-agricultural or commercial purposes. The specific department responsible for granting such permissions can vary, but it could be the revenue department or the local municipal or development authority. You may need to submit an application, along with the necessary documents and fees, to initiate the conversion process.Building permits and construction: Once you have the necessary land use conversion, you will need to obtain building permits and other construction-related approvals from the local municipal or development authority. This involves submitting detailed architectural plans, structural designs, and other relevant documents for review and approval.Other permits and clearances: Depending on the nature and scope of your eco-resort project, you may need to obtain additional permits and clearances from various departments. This can include fire safety clearances, food and hygiene licenses, liquor licenses (if applicable), permits for signage, and any other permits required by local regulations.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client  false FIR: If the police have conducted an investigation and concluded that there are no financial irregularities or criminal offenses committed by the society management committee, it may be difficult for them to prove that the FIR was false. However, the final decision rests with the magistrate. If you believe that the FIR was filed in good faith and there was a reasonable basis for your complaint, you can present your case to the court.Selective targeting: It's possible for the society to file a complaint against specific individuals rather than all ten complainants, but this would depend on the evidence and circumstances of the case. The court will assess the validity of the complaint based on the evidence and arguments presented.Defamation: The statement you mentioned in the FIR, claiming that the management committee members have duped people of their hard-earned money, may be considered defamatory if it harms their reputation. Defamation cases require proving that the statement was false and caused harm to the reputation of the individuals involved. If the statement is found to be false and made with the intent to harm their reputation, they may pursue a defamation case against you. It would be best to consult with a lawyer who specializes in defamation cases to understand the specific legal implications in your jurisdiction.Regarding the society's collection of money and selling unauthorized flats, it may be necessary to consult with a lawyer who specializes in real estate and property laws.

    "answer": "Dear client  false FIR: If the police have conducted an investigation and concluded that there are no financial irregularities or criminal offenses committed by the society management committee, it may be difficult for them to prove that the FIR was false. However, the final decision rests with the magistrate. If you believe that the FIR was filed in good faith and there was a reasonable basis for your complaint, you can present your case to the court.Selective targeting: It's possible for the society to file a complaint against specific individuals rather than all ten complainants, but this would depend on the evidence and circumstances of the case. The court will assess the validity of the complaint based on the evidence and arguments presented.Defamation: The statement you mentioned in the FIR, claiming that the management committee members have duped people of their hard-earned money, may be considered defamatory if it harms their reputation. Defamation cases require proving that the statement was false and caused harm to the reputation of the individuals involved. If the statement is found to be false and made with the intent to harm their reputation, they may pursue a defamation case against you. It would be best to consult with a lawyer who specializes in defamation cases to understand the specific legal implications in your jurisdiction.Regarding the society's collection of money and selling unauthorized flats, it may be necessary to consult with a lawyer who specializes in real estate and property laws. They can provide you with the best advice on whether the society's actions constitute a crime or a civil dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Is Transfer Deed after Probate required and what are registration fees",
    "answer": "Dear client,In general, when a person passes away and their property is transferred to another person through a will, the legal process usually involves obtaining a probate or letters of administration, depending on the circumstances and the jurisdiction. The probate establishes the validity of the will and confirms the authority of the executor to distribute the deceased person's assets according to the terms of the will.Once you have obtained the probate, it is common to proceed with the transfer of ownership by updating the property records to reflect the new ownership structure. This is typically done through a transfer deed or similar document. The specific requirements and procedures for a transfer deed, as well as the associated registration charges, may depend on the laws and regulations of your area.To determine the exact requirements and registration charges for the transfer deed in your specific case, it is advisable to consult with a legal professional or a local authority responsible for property registrations, such as the Registrar or Sub-Registrar office. They will have the most accurate information regarding the applicable procedures and fees in your area.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Is Transfer Deed after Probate required and what are registration fees",
    "answer": "Dear client,In general, when a person passes away and their property is transferred to another person through a will, the legal process usually involves obtaining a probate or letters of administration, depending on the circumstances and the jurisdiction. The probate establishes the validity of the will and confirms the authority of the executor to distribute the deceased person's assets according to the terms of the will.Once you have obtained the probate, it is common to proceed with the transfer of ownership by updating the property records to reflect the new ownership structure. This is typically done through a transfer deed or similar document. The specific requirements and procedures for a transfer deed, as well as the associated registration charges, may depend on the laws and regulations of your area.To determine the exact requirements and registration charges for the transfer deed in your specific case, it is advisable to consult with a legal professional or a local authority responsible for property registrations, such as the Registrar or Sub-Registrar office.

However, the Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021 allows a woman above the age of 21 to undergo artificial insemination, but in case of a married woman the consent of the ‘commissioning couple’ is required. This renders a married woman dependent on the wishes of the husband, which is acceptable if the couple lives together as it should be a mutual decision but in cases like the present matter when divorce proceedings have been initiated, the woman becomes hapless.What are demands of wife? it is court to adjudicate on this issue, however, you can oppose her demands and can also refute her.Q-2.Joint properties are liable to be divided among husband and wife.

    "answer": "As per law the executing court does not have power to reexamine or to check the validity of award if the same is received by it for execution of award. Executing court cannot go into the merit of the case. An award exist and is enforceable till the same is not declared invalid or set aside by a competent court, so a party to Arbitration donot have power to decide the validity of an award. The application of given case law depends upon the facts and merit of the case. So the facts and merit of your case is required to be exsmined in order to examine the application of given case law. Further in the given case law the court itself has said that judgement is applicable to awards wherein the arbitral proceeding commenced post the 2015 amendment to the Arbitration Act. It does not deal with proceedings having been initiated pre the 2015 amendment and concluding post the 2015 amendment. So your conception of law is incorrect.

    "question": "Clarification about court judgment regarding arbitration",
    "answer": "Unilateral appointment is alsonot allowedbecause any party who has an interest in the outcome of the dispute should not be allowed to preside over as an arbitrator for that dispute.There has been plethora of cases where High Courts and Supreme Court has set aside the arbitral award on the ground of unilateral appointment of arbitrator. The reason behind such setting aside is that appointment of arbitrator by one party alone without giving opportunity to the other party shall have an element of bias and partiality.On one hand, where parties are given autonomy to agree on the procedure to appoint an arbitrator under Section 11(2), on the other hand, it is not correct to say that the same is not an absolute right of the party. The right of the parties to agree on the procedure to appoint the arbitrator is now subject to reasonable restriction, and one such instance of reasonable restriction is the unilateral appointment of arbitrator.You can file a petition to set aside the award in the appellate courtT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "The Supreme Court has given rationale behind such appointment in decisions likePerkinsandTRF Ltd.Further, it has become important for parties to draft the dispute resolution clause cautiously and should keep in mind that unilateral appointment is not allowed under the garb of party autonomy.The Court has observed that if one party has the exclusive right to appoint the arbitrator, then his choice will always have an element of bias. The relevant extract of the Court's observation is as follows:The reason is clear that whatever advantage a party may derive by nominating an arbitrator of its choice would get counter balanced by equal power with the other party. But, in a case where only one party has a right to appoint a sole arbitrator, its choice will always have an element of exclusivity in determining or charting the course for dispute resolution. Naturally, the person who has an interest in the outcome or decision of the dispute must not have the power to appoint a sole arbitrator. That has to be taken as the essence of the amendments brought in by the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015 (Act 3 of 2016).\"T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

You can go forward with the drafting of the legal agreement now and the agreement should contain the terms and conditions with which you handed over the amount to Mr. Iqbal.Under the Indian Contract Act, an agreement need not be written, it may be oral. The problem with oral agreement is that the burden is on you to prove that there existed an agreement between you and Mr. Iqbal.Kindly find the appropriate case law herewith. I have extracted the relevant segment from the Judgement. In the case ofS.V. Narayanaswamy vs. Savithramma2013R.F.A. No. 1163 of 2002 c/w R.F.A.No.1164 of 2002 Karnataka High Court,the Appellant sought to prove the existence of a oral agreement, which was vehemently claimed to exist, with respect to sale of property. With the onus to prove being on the Appellant, it did so, by producing cheques of several amounts, towards the entire consideration of the property. By producing various pieces of evidence, which indicated towards a whole, the court upheld the existence of the oral agreement, based on the scrutiny of the evidence provided.Also, you could send a legal Notice u/s 138 of N.I. Act,1881 to Mr. Iqbal to clear the outstanding amount. 15 days from the date of Legal Notice, you will have to wait for this reply and after the expiry of 15 days, you go ahead and file a PCR, then after the lapse of 30 days cognizance will be taken and the PCR will be converted to a Criminal Case after recording of sworn statement.

    "answer": "Dear Mr. A,Thank you for reaching out to me with your legal concerns. I understand the complexities of the situation you have described and will do my best to provide you with some guidance.Based on the information you have provided, there are a few legal implications that can be considered:Loan Agreement: Although you mentioned that there is no formal written agreement, the WhatsApp messages and audio recordings where Mr. Iqbal acknowledges his commitment to repay the borrowed amount, including the bank interest and profit, can serve as evidence of a verbal agreement. Verbal agreements can be legally binding, and these messages and recordings can be used to support your claim in case of a dispute.Use of Another Individual's Bank Account: Mr. Iqbal's use of Mr. Mohsin's bank account without his knowledge or consent raises concerns. It could potentially involve fraudulent activities, and Mr. Mohsin should be made aware of the situation if he is not already. Mr. Mohsin may choose to take legal action against Mr. Iqbal for any unauthorized use of his bank account.Property Sale and Fund Transfer: The purchase of land under Mr. Mohsin's name and subsequent sale of the property, with the funds being transferred into Mr. Iqbal's wife's account, raises questions about the legality of the transaction. This type of arrangement may be seen as an attempt to evade legal obligations or engage in fraudulent activities. It would be advisable to consult with a lawyer familiar with property and financial laws to further investigate this matter and determine the appropriate course of action.Given the circumstances, I recommend that you consult with a local lawyer who specializes in financial and property law. They will be able to review the specific details of your case, examine the evidence you have, and provide you with tailored advice based on the laws and regulations applicable in your jurisdiction. They can guide you on the best legal avenues available to recover the remaining amount owed to you and address any potential illegal activities that have taken place.Remember to gather and organize all relevant documents and evidence, such as bank statements, transaction records, and any other correspondence that supports your claims. This information will be valuable for your lawyer to assess the situation accurately.I hope this initial guidance helps you understand the potential legal implications and the steps you can take. It is important to consult with a professional lawyer who can provide you with personalized advice based on your specific circumstances. They will be in the best position to guide you through the legal process.Wishing you the best of luck in resolving this matter satisfactorily.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, here are some general steps you can consider:Review the rules and regulations: Familiarize yourself with the rules and regulations of the municipal authorities regarding the correction of names on birth certificates. These rules can usually be found on the official website of the municipal corporation or through direct communication with their offices.Gather supporting documents: Collect all relevant documents that can establish the correct names of your parents, such as their identification documents, passports, or any other official records that reflect their correct middle names. These documents can be essential in supporting your request for correction.Submit an application: Prepare a written application explaining the need for the correction and attach the supporting documents. Follow the prescribed procedure provided by the municipal authorities, including any required forms, fees, and supporting documents.Follow up with the municipal authorities: Regularly follow up with the municipal authorities to track the progress of your application. You may need to provide additional information or attend any hearings or meetings requested by the authorities.If the municipal authorities refuse to make the correction despite proper documentation and following the prescribed procedure, you may need to consider legal recourse. Consulting with an attorney who specializes in civil law or municipal matters can help you understand the specific legal options available in your jurisdiction. They can guide you through the process of obtaining a court order, which may be necessary to compel the municipal authorities to correct the birth certificate.The duration for obtaining a court order can vary depending on the complexity of the case, the workload of the court, and other factors.

    "question": "Is Transfer Deed after Probate required and what are registration fees",
    "answer": "Dear client,In general, when a person passes away and their property is transferred to another person through a will, the legal process usually involves obtaining a probate or letters of administration, depending on the circumstances and the jurisdiction. The probate establishes the validity of the will and confirms the authority of the executor to distribute the deceased person's assets according to the terms of the will.Once you have obtained the probate, it is common to proceed with the transfer of ownership by updating the property records to reflect the new ownership structure. This is typically done through a transfer deed or similar document. The specific requirements and procedures for a transfer deed, as well as the associated registration charges, may depend on the laws and regulations of your area.To determine the exact requirements and registration charges for the transfer deed in your specific case, it is advisable to consult with a legal professional or a local authority responsible for property registrations, such as the Registrar or Sub-Registrar office.

    "question": "Adoption son rights",
    "answer": "Based on the information you have provided, here are some general points to consider:Adoption Deed: The adoption deed registered in 1955, where your grandfather stated that all the property would be passed on to your father after the death of your grandparents, can be considered as a legal document. It signifies your father's right to inherit the property.Subsequent Will: The will written by your grandfather in 1958, dividing the properties into three parts, could impact the inheritance. However, if the adoption deed clearly stated that all the property would go to your father after the death of your grandparents, the subsequent will may be disputed based on the earlier adoption deed. A lawyer can review both documents to provide specific guidance.Will of Grandmothers: The wills written by your grandmothers, diverting the properties to their relative, may have legal implications. It would be important to assess the validity of these wills and the circumstances under which they were made. Factors such as the mental capacity of your grandmothers, undue influence, and the legal requirements for making a valid will should be considered.Rights of Minor: The fact that your father was a minor at the time of the adoption and subsequent wills may also impact the situation. Depending on the laws in your jurisdiction, special rules may apply to protect the rights of minors in inheritance matters.Undisclosed Properties: If there are properties that were not mentioned in the partition deed but were owned by your grandfather, the rights to those properties would need to be determined. The laws of succession and inheritance in your jurisdiction would apply to these undisclosed properties.Given the complexity of the situation and the need for a detailed analysis of the legal documents involved, it is highly recommended that you consult with a lawyer. They will be able to review the adoption deed, subsequent wills, and any other relevant documents, as well as consider the applicable laws to provide you with the specific advice you need.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Your father's age at the time the deed was executed (around 10) could potentially be a factor in its validity.In many jurisdictions, a minor cannot enter into a legally binding contract. Therefore, the validity of the Partition Deed may be questioned if your father was a minor at the time.Court Permission for Partition Deed Involving a Minor:When a minor is involved in a property transaction, court permission or a guardian's consent may be required to ensure the minor's interests are protected.Whether court permission was obtained at the time of the Partition Deed should be assessed. If it wasn't, this could impact the deed's validity.Location of the Will:The location where a will is written does not necessarily invalidate it. However, the will should generally comply with the legal requirements of the jurisdiction where the properties are located.Limitation and Adverse Possession:The laws regarding adverse possession and property limitations would vary. In some cases, adverse possession may apply if someone openly occupies and uses property for an extended period without the owner's objection.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "1. If the partition was done among the shareholders, then it will be considered as legally valid, in that case your father may not have any ground to claim any share in that property at this stage.2. If there is a minor share holder and his share was not considered then the minor shareholder can claim his share within three years from the date of he attaining his age of majority.3. The Will can be written from the place where the testator is residing, it is not necessary that the Will has to be written only in the place where the property is situated.4. If the property was in their obsession and if it was adverse to your father but he did not claim it within the limitation period then they can perfect the title operating the law of adverse possession.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Is Transfer Deed after Probate required and what are registration fees",
    "answer": "Dear client,In general, when a person passes away and their property is transferred to another person through a will, the legal process usually involves obtaining a probate or letters of administration, depending on the circumstances and the jurisdiction. The probate establishes the validity of the will and confirms the authority of the executor to distribute the deceased person's assets according to the terms of the will.Once you have obtained the probate, it is common to proceed with the transfer of ownership by updating the property records to reflect the new ownership structure. This is typically done through a transfer deed or similar document. The specific requirements and procedures for a transfer deed, as well as the associated registration charges, may depend on the laws and regulations of your area.To determine the exact requirements and registration charges for the transfer deed in your specific case, it is advisable to consult with a legal professional or a local authority responsible for property registrations, such as the Registrar or Sub-Registrar office.

Under the given circumstances, you have only liberty to negotiate the term. Time limit for eviction case cannot be predicted,  however, it will take minimum 3 years time if all goes well. There must be Arbitration clause in the agreement and if that would be so then eviction case, which is a civil remedy, would not be maintainable. So far cost is concern if govt chose to claim damages then cost will accordingly be increased beside damages etc. Since public interest is also involved so court may also be soft.

But, no statement has been mentioned regarding the ‘Ban on Sex Toys in India- Further, keeping sex toys at home for personal use, is not an offence unless the individual is private about its usage and functioning. Every individual has his/her private life and hence, they have the full right to do whatever they want to under those boundations.- Further, the Kolkata High Court addressed the issue whether sex toys sold in India comes under the charges of “obscenity”. The Court held that the charges on obscenity cannot be held as they were not legally sustainable. Just because the toy brings out sexual desires, it cannot be labeled as ‘obscene’.- Since, you got notice from Custom Department; hence you should give the reply of the show cause notice to the department and appear for personal hearing, and thereby declare before them that the said items are for personal use and not for sale to other persons.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Is Transfer Deed after Probate required and what are registration fees",
    "answer": "Dear client,In general, when a person passes away and their property is transferred to another person through a will, the legal process usually involves obtaining a probate or letters of administration, depending on the circumstances and the jurisdiction. The probate establishes the validity of the will and confirms the authority of the executor to distribute the deceased person's assets according to the terms of the will.Once you have obtained the probate, it is common to proceed with the transfer of ownership by updating the property records to reflect the new ownership structure. This is typically done through a transfer deed or similar document. The specific requirements and procedures for a transfer deed, as well as the associated registration charges, may depend on the laws and regulations of your area.To determine the exact requirements and registration charges for the transfer deed in your specific case, it is advisable to consult with a legal professional or a local authority responsible for property registrations, such as the Registrar or Sub-Registrar office. They will have the most accurate information regarding the applicable procedures and fees in your area.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Your lawyer will be able to guide you through the process and present the necessary evidence to support your bail application.Reinstatement of Sections 325 and 323: The decision to reinstate sections 325 and 323 by the judge may have been based on the opposition's arguments or other factors presented during the proceedings. The judge may have considered that there is enough material to warrant the inclusion of these sections in the chargesheet. However, the judge has also mentioned that you can challenge these sections during the trial. Your lawyer can evaluate the evidence and present your defense against these charges during the trial proceedings.Bail Cancellation and Chances of Getting Bail Again: The cancellation of bail may have been based on the judge's assessment of the evidence and other factors in the case.

    "question": "Alimony",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard.In case of Rajnesh v. Neha & Anr, Hon'ble Supreme Court stated that there can be no straitjacket formula for fixing such a quantum. Stressing upon the importance of maintaining a careful and just balance between all relevant factors, the Court held that the maintenance amount awarded must be reasonable and realistic. It directed the Courts to take cognizance of the fact that maintenance awarded to the applicant should neither be so extravagant that it becomes oppressive and unbearable for the respondent, nor should it be so meagre that it drives the applicant to penury.In addition to the statutory guidance, the Court laid down the following indicative factors to be considered before determining the quantum of maintenance (a) the status of the parties; (b) reasonable needs of the wife and dependent children; (c) whether the applicant is educated and professionally qualified; (d) whether the applicant has any independent source of income; (e) whether the income is sufficient to enable the applicant to maintain the same standard of living as she was accustomed to in her matrimonial home; (f) whether the applicant was employed prior to her marriage; (g) whether she was working during the subsistence of the marriage; (h) whether the wife was required to sacrifice her employment opportunities for nurturing the family, child rearing, and looking after adult members of the family; (i) reasonable costs of litigation for a non-working wife.Apart from the aforesaid factors set out hereinabove, the Court laid down certain additional factors for determining the quantum of maintenance payable. These are inter alia as follows:Age and employment of parties;Duration of marriage;Maintenance of minor children; andSerious disability or ill health of a spouse, child /children from the marriage or dependent relative who require constant care and recurrent expenditure, would also be a relevant consideration while quantifying maintenance.The aforesaid factors are not exhaustive, and the concerned Court can exercise its discretion to consider any other factor/s, which may be necessary or relevant in the facts and circumstances of a particular case.Further, in case of Manokaran vs. M.Devaki where it was held that Grant of maintenance to the wife working and earning more that her husband is improper and the same cannot be said that the wife was not having sufficient independent income.She can demand alimony, however, depending on the facts and circumstances you mentioned it can be denied if defended properly. It can be claimed for child as well. Maintenance amount can be reduced if passed against him in appellate Courts since she is presently working and she will have to submit an affidavit in Court about her present financial status.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete facts.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "question": "Alimony",
    "answer": "Dear client,In general, alimony (also known as spousal support or maintenance) is typically determined based on various factors, including the income and financial resources of both parties, the length of the marriage, the standard of living during the marriage, and the needs of each spouse. Whether alimony would be awarded and the specific amount would depend on the specific laws and regulations of your jurisdiction, as well as the unique circumstances of the case.When it comes to child support, the primary concern is the best interests of the child. The financial resources and ability of both parents to contribute to the child's upbringing are taken into consideration. It's possible that the daughter-in-law could seek child support from your sister's son for the care and upbringing of their child.Given the complexity of your situation and the potential legal implications, it's highly recommended to seek professional legal advice. A family law attorney can help you understand your rights and options and guide you through the divorce process while considering the specific laws and regulations applicable to your jurisdiction.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Without passage plot B and plot C cannot be enjoyed. So you have to provide passage to purchasers of plot B and plot C and thus, your demand of price for passage is not reasonable nor is justified.

    "question": "Selling common passage",
    "answer": "If the passage by the side of plot-A is necessary for access to the combined plots of B and C, it is possible that the prospective buyer's argument has some merit. Access rights and easements are legal concepts that govern the right to use someone else's property for access. The specific terms and conditions regarding access and any associated costs should ideally be addressed in a legal agreement or contract between the parties involved.To obtain accurate and specific advice for your situation, it would be advisable to consult with a local property lawyer who can review the relevant laws and regulations in your jurisdiction and provide guidance based on your specific circumstances. They will be able to advise you on the legal requirements regarding access, as well as negotiate and draft appropriate agreements to protect your interests.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"
