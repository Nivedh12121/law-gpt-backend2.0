    "answer": "Typically, if both biological parents have legal custody of a child and one of them passes away, the surviving parent retains sole legal custody. In this case, since your first wife has passed away, you would generally retain sole legal custody of your child. As a result, your second wife may not necessarily need to formally adopt your child.However, if your second wife wishes to establish a legal relationship with your child and become a legal guardian or adoptive parent, it may be beneficial to consult with a family law attorney in your jurisdiction. They can guide you through the process and provide advice on the best course of action based on the specific circumstances and the laws in your area.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "In the United States, the process of updating your child's passport with your current wife's name will typically require legal documentation, such as a court order or a notarized consent form from both biological parents. It's best to contact the passport agency or consult with an attorney specializing in family law to understand the specific requirements and procedures for updating a child's passport in your jurisdiction.Regarding the adoption of your child by your second wife, the necessity of adoption will depend on the laws of your jurisdiction. In some cases, if the biological parent who passed away was the legal parent and the surviving parent is the sole legal guardian, formal adoption may not be required. However, it's essential to consult with a family law attorney to determine the specific requirements and legal implications in your situation.Changing the name on official documents like a passport and Aadhar card may require submitting legal documentation, such as a court order or an adoption decree. The process and requirements for updating these documents can vary depending on the issuing authority and the specific laws of your country or region.

    "answer": "In the United States, the process of updating your child's passport with your current wife's name will typically require legal documentation, such as a court order or a notarized consent form from both biological parents. It's best to contact the passport agency or consult with an attorney specializing in family law to understand the specific requirements and procedures for updating a child's passport in your jurisdiction.Regarding the adoption of your child by your second wife, the necessity of adoption will depend on the laws of your jurisdiction. In some cases, if the biological parent who passed away was the legal parent and the surviving parent is the sole legal guardian, formal adoption may not be required. However, it's essential to consult with a family law attorney to determine the specific requirements and legal implications in your situation.Changing the name on official documents like a passport and Aadhar card may require submitting legal documentation, such as a court order or an adoption decree. The process and requirements for updating these documents can vary depending on the issuing authority and the specific laws of your country or region.

    "question": "Working abroad, 4 years of separation, want to initiate divorce",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can really understand your problem. They say marriages are made in heaven. But so is thunder and lightening. At times, despite our best efforts, life takes a turn for the worst. We may have wanted different things from life, but life’s got its own plan as well. A bad marriage is something which nobody hopes for, but at times, that’s exactly what we are given and forced to face head on. Marriages are hard. Divorces…even harder. Nobody enters a marriage thinking about a divorce in the end. If some are unable to cope with the harsh realities of marriage, the only viable option in front of them is to approach the Court and seek legal separation by way ofmutual consent divorce. There is a bitterness in your relationship now.You can send the notice via offshore lawyer. My team is dealing with various such matters and can help you, if required. They may or may not reply. They may file a police complaint. As per Indian law, there is no provision from stopping the other side to file criminal case.The person granting the power of attorney must be competent to make decisions on behalf of the other person. Additionally, the power of attorney must be signed by both the grantor and beneficiary. It would not require you to travel (whether mutual or contested). Counsel can manage. You can request the court for the video conferencing as well (if facilities are there).Negotiating a divorce settlement can be a stressful and emotional process.Tips to help you negotiate with your spouse effectively:Keep Emotions in Check:It’s important to keep emotions in check during negotiations and focus on achieving a fair settlement.Be Prepared: Come prepared with documentation and a clear understanding of your financial situation.Be Willing to Compromise:A successful negotiation involves compromise from both parties.Work with a Mediator:Consider working with a mediator to help facilitate negotiations and reach a fair settlement.Since I'm working as mediator, therefore I generally suggest my clients the following things to Consider while you negotiate a divorce alimony agreements:Focus On Your Interest Instead of Your Position:Nothing is more critical during divorce settlement or negotiations than removing yourself from the positional bargain after divorce papers. This is the time when you need to allow yourself to focus on the main interest that you are trying to satisfy. It would be best if you concentrate on positions like drawing a line in the sand when it comes to negotiating a divorce.Unfortunately, it is not helpful, especially if you are starting to negotiate a divorce. It would be best if you focused on the interest where you are satisfied and your spouse’s claim is satisfied. The situation can also pop up where you will not be able to pay more than the Stipend amount as a month in the alimony.Your spouse might take some position and will not settle the case unless she gets the desired amount in the element. This positional targeting will not help and instead blow the entire negotiating a divorce  case into a drawn-out conflict. The basis of the position might be the interest that you want to ensure that you don’t want to blow the budget and are managing the situation reasonably.The genuine interest of the spouse might be to ensure that they can continue to pay the rent or the utility while they finish the degree. Analyzing the situation from an exciting perspective will allow your thoughts and feelings to flow better, and you can devise a creative negotiation process.Don’t Go For Hard BargainingIt would be best if you were wary about taking hard bargaining too seriously during your negotiate a divorce process. It would be best if you did not go with the quote my way or the highway as it might land you in some trouble. This can be effective only in divorce cases where the other party is quite cheerful and willing to bend.Still, in the majority of the cases, the hard-bargaining approach leads to the breakdown of the negotiation and divorce settlement. No doubt the hard bargaining idea looks perfect up front, but it is a bad idea where there will be no negotiate a divorce ground.Ensure that you do not destroy the relationship with the other partyIn most divorce settlement negotiations, preserving a solid relationship with the other side is always a beneficial result. For example, if you have kids or are likely to be the ex-spouse soon but always be the parent of the child, then you need to develop a parenting plan and compared it with the spouse in the future.A marriage might be ending but in most cases of divorce relationship also exists after the termination of marriage, especially if it is a long-term marriage. Destroying the relationship, irrespective of the reason rarely ends positively for any parties during  negotiate a divorce settlements .Control Your EmotionsYou need to control your emotions throughout the process. It would be best if you considered it as putting on the poker face. You don’t often wish the other party to see the emotional side because they will understand your weaknesses and learn what triggers you. Of course, losing control of the emotions can lead to a breakdown, especially in the negotiate a divorce settlement , or can also lead to an increase in the cost or time.Be Willing To Educate The Other PartyWhatever is said and done, a lack of information on any party’s end can lead to overestimation of the results in the court. A typical case would be where the spouse is needy for whatever reason that has let them believe that the amount of alimony, they would receive is way more than what a family court could potentially even allow. In such cases, the best way is to educate the misinformed spouse. You can do this through the financial or marital asset disclosure. You can also do it through some motion practice like letter news from the lawyer or even during the divorce mediation.Be Transparent To Develop TrustWe generally find good deals inhibited as one of the parties did not develop enormous trust with the other party. For instance, you can consider your lawyer who will represent your spouse, who typically does not have access to any paperwork financially during the marriage. Even during the negotiations, everything is made genuinely transparent the other spouse might not end up trusting you. You can solve the trust issues by being transparent.Negotiate a Divorce, Communication Is EssentialIt would be best if you did not forget that negotiation a divorce requires a lot of communication between both parties and the divorce lawyers. Communication can quickly help you solve all the issues and also help you to get to the crux of the matter. In the majority of the cases, it requires you to have communication between you and your partner. You have to try working out all the terms of settlement when you are transparently communicating, which would be helpful as it will lead to the end of divorce resolution amicably.You and your partner might have some mistrust for each other or even some emotional issues that make negotiate a divorce impossible or impractical. In such a case, you should always connect with your lawyer for mediation to find the common interest ground on which the settlement can be built.Above all, you should focus on the problem instead of the people. It is expected during the negotiate a divorce that emotional issues in the relationship might pop up.

They will be able to guide you through the legal requirements and options available to secure your mother's interests.Discuss with your sister: Have an open and honest conversation with your sister about your concerns regarding the gift deed and the need to secure your mother's interests. It may be possible to reach an agreement that addresses your concerns while still allowing your sister to support her daughter's education.Consider a family settlement agreement: A family settlement agreement is a legally binding agreement that can be created to settle property-related disputes among family members. It can outline the terms and conditions of the transfer of the property, including provisions for your mother's interests. This agreement would need to be drafted by a lawyer and signed by all parties involved.Explore other options: If obtaining a loan is difficult due to your father's age, you may want to explore alternative financing options. This could include seeking loans from private lenders or exploring other sources of funding for your sister's daughter's education.Regarding your additional question about executing an MOU (Memorandum of Understanding), it is possible to use an MOU to outline the conditions and expectations associated with the gift deed. However, it is important to note that an MOU is generally not legally binding in the same way as a contract. It may be helpful to have the MOU drafted by a lawyer and have all parties involved sign it.

This typically involves taking steps to ensure that the terms of the compromise decree are carried out.Since there is a compromise decree for 10 acres and you are in possession of 9 acres, it's advisable to follow the terms of the decree. If there are specific instructions or terms related to the division of land, you should adhere to those terms.If the compromise decree specifies that you are entitled to 10 acres and the judgment debtor (the other party) holds the remaining 1 acre, you would generally not need to file a separate sale deed for the 1 acre. The terms of the compromise decree should guide the transfer of ownership.Recovery of 1 Acre as per Court Compromise Decree:If the compromise decree specifies that you are entitled to a total of 10 acres, and the judgment debtor has received compensation for the land acquired by the government (1 acre), you might need to enforce the decree through the execution process.The execution process involves the court's assistance in ensuring that the judgment debtor complies with the terms of the compromise decree.

    "question": "Working abroad, 4 years of separation, want to initiate divorce",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can really understand your problem. They say marriages are made in heaven. But so is thunder and lightening. At times, despite our best efforts, life takes a turn for the worst. We may have wanted different things from life, but life’s got its own plan as well. A bad marriage is something which nobody hopes for, but at times, that’s exactly what we are given and forced to face head on. Marriages are hard. Divorces…even harder. Nobody enters a marriage thinking about a divorce in the end. If some are unable to cope with the harsh realities of marriage, the only viable option in front of them is to approach the Court and seek legal separation by way ofmutual consent divorce. There is a bitterness in your relationship now.You can send the notice via offshore lawyer. My team is dealing with various such matters and can help you, if required. They may or may not reply. They may file a police complaint. As per Indian law, there is no provision from stopping the other side to file criminal case.The person granting the power of attorney must be competent to make decisions on behalf of the other person. Additionally, the power of attorney must be signed by both the grantor and beneficiary. It would not require you to travel (whether mutual or contested). Counsel can manage. You can request the court for the video conferencing as well (if facilities are there).Negotiating a divorce settlement can be a stressful and emotional process.Tips to help you negotiate with your spouse effectively:Keep Emotions in Check:It’s important to keep emotions in check during negotiations and focus on achieving a fair settlement.Be Prepared: Come prepared with documentation and a clear understanding of your financial situation.Be Willing to Compromise:A successful negotiation involves compromise from both parties.Work with a Mediator:Consider working with a mediator to help facilitate negotiations and reach a fair settlement.Since I'm working as mediator, therefore I generally suggest my clients the following things to Consider while you negotiate a divorce alimony agreements:Focus On Your Interest Instead of Your Position:Nothing is more critical during divorce settlement or negotiations than removing yourself from the positional bargain after divorce papers. This is the time when you need to allow yourself to focus on the main interest that you are trying to satisfy. It would be best if you concentrate on positions like drawing a line in the sand when it comes to negotiating a divorce.Unfortunately, it is not helpful, especially if you are starting to negotiate a divorce. It would be best if you focused on the interest where you are satisfied and your spouse’s claim is satisfied. The situation can also pop up where you will not be able to pay more than the Stipend amount as a month in the alimony.Your spouse might take some position and will not settle the case unless she gets the desired amount in the element. This positional targeting will not help and instead blow the entire negotiating a divorce  case into a drawn-out conflict. The basis of the position might be the interest that you want to ensure that you don’t want to blow the budget and are managing the situation reasonably.The genuine interest of the spouse might be to ensure that they can continue to pay the rent or the utility while they finish the degree. Analyzing the situation from an exciting perspective will allow your thoughts and feelings to flow better, and you can devise a creative negotiation process.Don’t Go For Hard BargainingIt would be best if you were wary about taking hard bargaining too seriously during your negotiate a divorce process. It would be best if you did not go with the quote my way or the highway as it might land you in some trouble. This can be effective only in divorce cases where the other party is quite cheerful and willing to bend.Still, in the majority of the cases, the hard-bargaining approach leads to the breakdown of the negotiation and divorce settlement. No doubt the hard bargaining idea looks perfect up front, but it is a bad idea where there will be no negotiate a divorce ground.Ensure that you do not destroy the relationship with the other partyIn most divorce settlement negotiations, preserving a solid relationship with the other side is always a beneficial result. For example, if you have kids or are likely to be the ex-spouse soon but always be the parent of the child, then you need to develop a parenting plan and compared it with the spouse in the future.A marriage might be ending but in most cases of divorce relationship also exists after the termination of marriage, especially if it is a long-term marriage. Destroying the relationship, irrespective of the reason rarely ends positively for any parties during  negotiate a divorce settlements .Control Your EmotionsYou need to control your emotions throughout the process. It would be best if you considered it as putting on the poker face. You don’t often wish the other party to see the emotional side because they will understand your weaknesses and learn what triggers you. Of course, losing control of the emotions can lead to a breakdown, especially in the negotiate a divorce settlement , or can also lead to an increase in the cost or time.Be Willing To Educate The Other PartyWhatever is said and done, a lack of information on any party’s end can lead to overestimation of the results in the court. A typical case would be where the spouse is needy for whatever reason that has let them believe that the amount of alimony, they would receive is way more than what a family court could potentially even allow. In such cases, the best way is to educate the misinformed spouse. You can do this through the financial or marital asset disclosure. You can also do it through some motion practice like letter news from the lawyer or even during the divorce mediation.Be Transparent To Develop TrustWe generally find good deals inhibited as one of the parties did not develop enormous trust with the other party.

Even during the negotiations, everything is made genuinely transparent the other spouse might not end up trusting you. You can solve the trust issues by being transparent.Negotiate a Divorce, Communication Is EssentialIt would be best if you did not forget that negotiation a divorce requires a lot of communication between both parties and the divorce lawyers. Communication can quickly help you solve all the issues and also help you to get to the crux of the matter.

    "question": "Watertight House Sale Agreement to avoid extensions",
    "answer": "The above section deals with the effect of failure to perform at a fixedtime, in contracts in whichtimeis essential. The question whethertimeis theessenceof the contract, with reference to the performance of a contract, what generally may arise for consideration either with reference to the contract as a whole or with reference to a particular term or condition of the contract which is breached. In a contract relating to sale ofimmovable property iftimeis specified for payment of the sale price  but not in regard to the execution of the sale deed,timewill become theessenceonly with reference to payment of sale price but not in regard to execution of the sale deed. Normally in regard to contracts relating to sale ofimmovableproperties,timeis not considered to be theessenceof the contract unless such an intention can be gathered either from the express terms of the contract or implied from the intention of the parties as expressed by the terms of the contract.\\Relying upon the observation of this court in N.Srinivasa v.Kuttukaran Machine Tools Ltd. [2009 (5) SCC 182] that \"in the contract relating toimmovable property,timecannot be theessenceof the contract\", the appellant put forth the contention that in all contracts relating to sale ofimmovable property,timestipulated for performance, even if expressed to be theessence, has to be read as not being theessenceof the contract and consequently the contract does not become voidable by the failure to perform before the specifiedtime. A careful reading of the said decision would show that the sentence relied on  apparently was not the statement of legal position, but a conclusion on facts regarding the contract that was being considered by the court in that case, with reference to its terms.Now what is your query?You may revert with specific question for which you have approached this forum.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88767 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

If the buyer fails to secure financing within the designated period, the agreement may be terminated.Termination Clause: You can include a clause stating that if the sale is not completed within a specified number of days (such as 90 days) from the date of the agreement, either party has the right to terminate the agreement.Representation and Warranty Clause: Include a clause where the buyer represents and warrants that they are not acting on behalf of any third party or disguising themselves as an agent, and that they are purchasing the property for their own use and not for re-sale.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Plot purchase - missing buyers signature in the current sale deed",
    "answer": "The information provided suggests a discrepancy in the execution of the sale deed for the plot purchased by Mr. Shankar and his mother from the builder, Ferns.Impact of the issue: The absence of Mr. Shankar's signature on the sale deed could raise questions about his consent and involvement in the transaction. It may affect the validity of the sale and potentially create complications in the future when you plan to purchase the plot from Mr. Shankar.Rectification deed: A rectification deed is typically used to correct errors or omissions in a previously executed deed. If there is an omission of Mr. Shankar's signature, a rectification deed may be an appropriate legal instrument to correct the issue. However, the availability and viability of a rectification deed would depend on the specific circumstances and the laws of your jurisdiction. Consulting with a real estate attorney would provide you with the best guidance.Confirmation deed: A confirmation deed is different from a rectification deed. While a rectification deed corrects errors or omissions, a confirmation deed reaffirms or confirms the terms of an existing agreement. In this case, a confirmation deed may be used to confirm that Mr. Shankar and his mother were indeed the buyers of the plot, even if their signatures were missing on certain pages of the original sale deed. Again, the availability and appropriateness of a confirmation deed would depend on the laws of your jurisdiction.Legal advice: It is crucial to consult with a real estate attorney who can carefully examine the sale deed, understand the specific laws and regulations governing property transactions in your jurisdiction, and provide you with the most accurate advice. They will be able to guide you on the best course of action, whether it involves a rectification deed, confirmation deed, or any other legal instrument necessary to address the issue.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Plot purchase - missing buyers signature in the current sale deed",
    "answer": "The information provided suggests a discrepancy in the execution of the sale deed for the plot purchased by Mr. Shankar and his mother from the builder, Ferns.Impact of the issue: The absence of Mr. Shankar's signature on the sale deed could raise questions about his consent and involvement in the transaction. It may affect the validity of the sale and potentially create complications in the future when you plan to purchase the plot from Mr. Shankar.Rectification deed: A rectification deed is typically used to correct errors or omissions in a previously executed deed. If there is an omission of Mr. Shankar's signature, a rectification deed may be an appropriate legal instrument to correct the issue. However, the availability and viability of a rectification deed would depend on the specific circumstances and the laws of your jurisdiction. Consulting with a real estate attorney would provide you with the best guidance.Confirmation deed: A confirmation deed is different from a rectification deed. While a rectification deed corrects errors or omissions, a confirmation deed reaffirms or confirms the terms of an existing agreement. In this case, a confirmation deed may be used to confirm that Mr. Shankar and his mother were indeed the buyers of the plot, even if their signatures were missing on certain pages of the original sale deed. Again, the availability and appropriateness of a confirmation deed would depend on the laws of your jurisdiction.Legal advice: It is crucial to consult with a real estate attorney who can carefully examine the sale deed, understand the specific laws and regulations governing property transactions in your jurisdiction, and provide you with the most accurate advice. They will be able to guide you on the best course of action, whether it involves a rectification deed, confirmation deed, or any other legal instrument necessary to address the issue.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Clause I: This clause provides the background and context for the sale of the property. It includes the details of the property being sold, its location, and the relevant approval and registration information. It seems comprehensive and covers the necessary information.Clause II: This clause acknowledges the existence of mistakes in the Principal Deed, specifically regarding the Second Party's signatures. It clarifies that the mistakes were accidental and requires rectification. However, it might be beneficial to specify the exact nature of the mistakes, such as the missing signatures, to provide more clarity and avoid any potential confusion.Clause III: This clause states the specific pages in the Principal Deed that require rectification due to the absence of the Second Party's signatures. It accurately highlights the pages that need to be corrected to reflect the intended agreement between the parties.Overall, the clauses you've provided appear to address the need for rectification and highlight the specific areas in the Principal Deed that require correction.

    "answer": "Consult a property lawyer: Engage the services of a property lawyer who can review the specific circumstances and provide advice tailored to your situation. They will be able to guide you through the legal requirements and options available to secure your mother's interests.Discuss with your sister: Have an open and honest conversation with your sister about your concerns regarding the gift deed and the need to secure your mother's interests. It may be possible to reach an agreement that addresses your concerns while still allowing your sister to support her daughter's education.Consider a family settlement agreement: A family settlement agreement is a legally binding agreement that can be created to settle property-related disputes among family members. It can outline the terms and conditions of the transfer of the property, including provisions for your mother's interests. This agreement would need to be drafted by a lawyer and signed by all parties involved.Explore other options: If obtaining a loan is difficult due to your father's age, you may want to explore alternative financing options. This could include seeking loans from private lenders or exploring other sources of funding for your sister's daughter's education.Regarding your additional question about executing an MOU (Memorandum of Understanding), it is possible to use an MOU to outline the conditions and expectations associated with the gift deed. However, it is important to note that an MOU is generally not legally binding in the same way as a contract. It may be helpful to have the MOU drafted by a lawyer and have all parties involved sign it. The specific details, including the date of the MOU in relation to the gift deed, would depend on the legal requirements in your jurisdiction.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This typically involves taking steps to ensure that the terms of the compromise decree are carried out.Since there is a compromise decree for 10 acres and you are in possession of 9 acres, it's advisable to follow the terms of the decree. If there are specific instructions or terms related to the division of land, you should adhere to those terms.If the compromise decree specifies that you are entitled to 10 acres and the judgment debtor (the other party) holds the remaining 1 acre, you would generally not need to file a separate sale deed for the 1 acre. The terms of the compromise decree should guide the transfer of ownership.Recovery of 1 Acre as per Court Compromise Decree:If the compromise decree specifies that you are entitled to a total of 10 acres, and the judgment debtor has received compensation for the land acquired by the government (1 acre), you might need to enforce the decree through the execution process.The execution process involves the court's assistance in ensuring that the judgment debtor complies with the terms of the compromise decree.

    "answer": "The above section deals with the effect of failure to perform at a fixedtime, in contracts in whichtimeis essential. The question whethertimeis theessenceof the contract, with reference to the performance of a contract, what generally may arise for consideration either with reference to the contract as a whole or with reference to a particular term or condition of the contract which is breached. In a contract relating to sale ofimmovable property iftimeis specified for payment of the sale price  but not in regard to the execution of the sale deed,timewill become theessenceonly with reference to payment of sale price but not in regard to execution of the sale deed. Normally in regard to contracts relating to sale ofimmovableproperties,timeis not considered to be theessenceof the contract unless such an intention can be gathered either from the express terms of the contract or implied from the intention of the parties as expressed by the terms of the contract.\\Relying upon the observation of this court in N.Srinivasa v.Kuttukaran Machine Tools Ltd. [2009 (5) SCC 182] that \"in the contract relating toimmovable property,timecannot be theessenceof the contract\", the appellant put forth the contention that in all contracts relating to sale ofimmovable property,timestipulated for performance, even if expressed to be theessence, has to be read as not being theessenceof the contract and consequently the contract does not become voidable by the failure to perform before the specifiedtime. A careful reading of the said decision would show that the sentence relied on  apparently was not the statement of legal position, but a conclusion on facts regarding the contract that was being considered by the court in that case, with reference to its terms.Now what is your query?You may revert with specific question for which you have approached this forum.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88767 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Plot purchase - missing buyers signature in the current sale deed",
    "answer": "The information provided suggests a discrepancy in the execution of the sale deed for the plot purchased by Mr. Shankar and his mother from the builder, Ferns.Impact of the issue: The absence of Mr. Shankar's signature on the sale deed could raise questions about his consent and involvement in the transaction. It may affect the validity of the sale and potentially create complications in the future when you plan to purchase the plot from Mr. Shankar.Rectification deed: A rectification deed is typically used to correct errors or omissions in a previously executed deed. If there is an omission of Mr. Shankar's signature, a rectification deed may be an appropriate legal instrument to correct the issue. However, the availability and viability of a rectification deed would depend on the specific circumstances and the laws of your jurisdiction. Consulting with a real estate attorney would provide you with the best guidance.Confirmation deed: A confirmation deed is different from a rectification deed. While a rectification deed corrects errors or omissions, a confirmation deed reaffirms or confirms the terms of an existing agreement. In this case, a confirmation deed may be used to confirm that Mr. Shankar and his mother were indeed the buyers of the plot, even if their signatures were missing on certain pages of the original sale deed. Again, the availability and appropriateness of a confirmation deed would depend on the laws of your jurisdiction.Legal advice: It is crucial to consult with a real estate attorney who can carefully examine the sale deed, understand the specific laws and regulations governing property transactions in your jurisdiction, and provide you with the most accurate advice. They will be able to guide you on the best course of action, whether it involves a rectification deed, confirmation deed, or any other legal instrument necessary to address the issue.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It includes the details of the property being sold, its location, and the relevant approval and registration information. It seems comprehensive and covers the necessary information.Clause II: This clause acknowledges the existence of mistakes in the Principal Deed, specifically regarding the Second Party's signatures. It clarifies that the mistakes were accidental and requires rectification. However, it might be beneficial to specify the exact nature of the mistakes, such as the missing signatures, to provide more clarity and avoid any potential confusion.Clause III: This clause states the specific pages in the Principal Deed that require rectification due to the absence of the Second Party's signatures. It accurately highlights the pages that need to be corrected to reflect the intended agreement between the parties.Overall, the clauses you've provided appear to address the need for rectification and highlight the specific areas in the Principal Deed that require correction.

    "answer": "Consult a property lawyer: Engage the services of a property lawyer who can review the specific circumstances and provide advice tailored to your situation. They will be able to guide you through the legal requirements and options available to secure your mother's interests.Discuss with your sister: Have an open and honest conversation with your sister about your concerns regarding the gift deed and the need to secure your mother's interests. It may be possible to reach an agreement that addresses your concerns while still allowing your sister to support her daughter's education.Consider a family settlement agreement: A family settlement agreement is a legally binding agreement that can be created to settle property-related disputes among family members. It can outline the terms and conditions of the transfer of the property, including provisions for your mother's interests. This agreement would need to be drafted by a lawyer and signed by all parties involved.Explore other options: If obtaining a loan is difficult due to your father's age, you may want to explore alternative financing options. This could include seeking loans from private lenders or exploring other sources of funding for your sister's daughter's education.Regarding your additional question about executing an MOU (Memorandum of Understanding), it is possible to use an MOU to outline the conditions and expectations associated with the gift deed. However, it is important to note that an MOU is generally not legally binding in the same way as a contract. It may be helpful to have the MOU drafted by a lawyer and have all parties involved sign it.

The question whethertimeis theessenceof the contract, with reference to the performance of a contract, what generally may arise for consideration either with reference to the contract as a whole or with reference to a particular term or condition of the contract which is breached. In a contract relating to sale ofimmovable property iftimeis specified for payment of the sale price  but not in regard to the execution of the sale deed,timewill become theessenceonly with reference to payment of sale price but not in regard to execution of the sale deed. Normally in regard to contracts relating to sale ofimmovableproperties,timeis not considered to be theessenceof the contract unless such an intention can be gathered either from the express terms of the contract or implied from the intention of the parties as expressed by the terms of the contract.\\Relying upon the observation of this court in N.Srinivasa v.Kuttukaran Machine Tools Ltd. [2009 (5) SCC 182] that \"in the contract relating toimmovable property,timecannot be theessenceof the contract\", the appellant put forth the contention that in all contracts relating to sale ofimmovable property,timestipulated for performance, even if expressed to be theessence, has to be read as not being theessenceof the contract and consequently the contract does not become voidable by the failure to perform before the specifiedtime. A careful reading of the said decision would show that the sentence relied on  apparently was not the statement of legal position, but a conclusion on facts regarding the contract that was being considered by the court in that case, with reference to its terms.Now what is your query?You may revert with specific question for which you have approached this forum.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88767 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Plot purchase - missing buyers signature in the current sale deed",
    "answer": "The information provided suggests a discrepancy in the execution of the sale deed for the plot purchased by Mr. Shankar and his mother from the builder, Ferns.Impact of the issue: The absence of Mr. Shankar's signature on the sale deed could raise questions about his consent and involvement in the transaction. It may affect the validity of the sale and potentially create complications in the future when you plan to purchase the plot from Mr. Shankar.Rectification deed: A rectification deed is typically used to correct errors or omissions in a previously executed deed. If there is an omission of Mr. Shankar's signature, a rectification deed may be an appropriate legal instrument to correct the issue. However, the availability and viability of a rectification deed would depend on the specific circumstances and the laws of your jurisdiction. Consulting with a real estate attorney would provide you with the best guidance.Confirmation deed: A confirmation deed is different from a rectification deed. While a rectification deed corrects errors or omissions, a confirmation deed reaffirms or confirms the terms of an existing agreement. In this case, a confirmation deed may be used to confirm that Mr. Shankar and his mother were indeed the buyers of the plot, even if their signatures were missing on certain pages of the original sale deed. Again, the availability and appropriateness of a confirmation deed would depend on the laws of your jurisdiction.Legal advice: It is crucial to consult with a real estate attorney who can carefully examine the sale deed, understand the specific laws and regulations governing property transactions in your jurisdiction, and provide you with the most accurate advice. They will be able to guide you on the best course of action, whether it involves a rectification deed, confirmation deed, or any other legal instrument necessary to address the issue.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

They will be able to guide you through the legal requirements and options available to secure your mother's interests.Discuss with your sister: Have an open and honest conversation with your sister about your concerns regarding the gift deed and the need to secure your mother's interests. It may be possible to reach an agreement that addresses your concerns while still allowing your sister to support her daughter's education.Consider a family settlement agreement: A family settlement agreement is a legally binding agreement that can be created to settle property-related disputes among family members. It can outline the terms and conditions of the transfer of the property, including provisions for your mother's interests. This agreement would need to be drafted by a lawyer and signed by all parties involved.Explore other options: If obtaining a loan is difficult due to your father's age, you may want to explore alternative financing options. This could include seeking loans from private lenders or exploring other sources of funding for your sister's daughter's education.Regarding your additional question about executing an MOU (Memorandum of Understanding), it is possible to use an MOU to outline the conditions and expectations associated with the gift deed. However, it is important to note that an MOU is generally not legally binding in the same way as a contract. It may be helpful to have the MOU drafted by a lawyer and have all parties involved sign it.

    "question": "Is car parking allotted to flat or owner",
    "answer": "The ability to sell a flat without the parking allotment depends on the specific laws and regulations governing property transactions in your jurisdiction. Generally, if the parking allotment is a separate and distinct component from the flat, it may be possible for the previous owner to sell the flat without including the parking allotment. However, this can vary depending on the terms of the original agreement and any subsequent agreements or regulations that may apply.Whether parking is attached to a flat or to the owner can depend on various factors, including the specific provisions of the cooperative society's bylaws, any contractual agreements, and the applicable laws in your jurisdiction. In some cases, parking may be considered a separate entity that can be bought, sold, or transferred independently of the flat. In other cases, it may be considered an attached amenity that is automatically transferred with the ownership of the flat.Providing a comprehensive list of laws and acts is beyond the scope of this response, as it can vary depending on the jurisdiction. However, your cooperative society secretary can consult with a qualified attorney who specializes in real estate or cooperative housing laws to obtain the relevant legal provisions and case law that support the argument that the parking allotment belongs to the new owner or that the previous owner is no longer entitled to it.Whether the seller can continue to hold the parking allotment would depend on the specific agreements, regulations, and laws applicable in your situation. If the parking allotment was not specifically transferred to the new owner as part of the sale, and there are no provisions in the cooperative society's bylaws or any other relevant agreements indicating that the previous owner can retain the parking allotment, it may be argued that the parking allotment should be transferred to the new owner along with the flat.

    "question": "Plot purchase - missing buyers signature in the current sale deed",
    "answer": "- As per law, a deed can be rectified after executing Rectification deed with the consent of both the parities i.e. seller and buyer.- Further, Signature is a handwritten mark made as a proof of identity and intent;, hence no body can challenge the same, until there is refusal of the document by either of the parties of the deed.- Further, if the deed has been registered from the office of Registrar in the presence of witnesses, then authenticity of the deed cannot be challenged.- Further on a registered deed, signature is having less value than the figure print , thumb impression taken at the time of registration.- Hence, if the signature of buyer is missing on some of the pages of the deed , then it will not create any problem , as the sellers signature is mandatory.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Plot purchase - missing buyers signature in the current sale deed",
    "answer": "The information provided suggests a discrepancy in the execution of the sale deed for the plot purchased by Mr. Shankar and his mother from the builder, Ferns.Impact of the issue: The absence of Mr. Shankar's signature on the sale deed could raise questions about his consent and involvement in the transaction. It may affect the validity of the sale and potentially create complications in the future when you plan to purchase the plot from Mr. Shankar.Rectification deed: A rectification deed is typically used to correct errors or omissions in a previously executed deed. If there is an omission of Mr. Shankar's signature, a rectification deed may be an appropriate legal instrument to correct the issue. However, the availability and viability of a rectification deed would depend on the specific circumstances and the laws of your jurisdiction. Consulting with a real estate attorney would provide you with the best guidance.Confirmation deed: A confirmation deed is different from a rectification deed. While a rectification deed corrects errors or omissions, a confirmation deed reaffirms or confirms the terms of an existing agreement. In this case, a confirmation deed may be used to confirm that Mr. Shankar and his mother were indeed the buyers of the plot, even if their signatures were missing on certain pages of the original sale deed. Again, the availability and appropriateness of a confirmation deed would depend on the laws of your jurisdiction.Legal advice: It is crucial to consult with a real estate attorney who can carefully examine the sale deed, understand the specific laws and regulations governing property transactions in your jurisdiction, and provide you with the most accurate advice. They will be able to guide you on the best course of action, whether it involves a rectification deed, confirmation deed, or any other legal instrument necessary to address the issue.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,It is generally not permissible to file multiple suits on the same cause of action. If both suits involve the same cause of action and the same parties, the second suit may be stayed or consolidated with the first suit under Section 10 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC). You should discuss this matter with your lawyer, who can file the appropriate application to the court to request the stay of the second suit.The granting of a temporary injunction depends on various factors, including the merits of the case and the balance of convenience. If the other party can prove that there is a possibility of irreparable harm or loss if the injunction is not granted, they may be successful in obtaining temporary injunction relief. However, your lawyer will be in a better position to assess the strength of their argument and provide guidance on how to respond effectively.Possession can be established in various ways, and it is not always necessary for someone to be physically staying inside the house. However, having someone present at the property, even as a watchman or caretaker, can help demonstrate that you are in possession and taking steps to protect your property. You should discuss the best approach with your lawyer, taking into account the specific circumstances and risks involved.Blocking the front gate with a car may provide an additional physical barrier, but it's important to consider the legal implications and potential consequences. Blocking the gate could be seen as an obstruction, and it may not be advisable without proper legal authorization. It's best to consult with your lawyer to explore legal ways to protect your property.Remember, the information provided here is general in nature, and it's crucial to consult with a qualified property lawyer who can provide you with advice specific to your case.

    "question": "Protecting possession in case of fraudulent sale deed",
    "answer": "In general, when dealing with a criminal case, it's important to consider the potential consequences of any agreements or statements made to the police or other parties involved. If you agree to a settlement with the new buyers and provide a written statement indicating that you will withdraw the 156(3) case, it may have implications for your ability to pursue a criminal case in the future.By agreeing to a settlement, you may be effectively acknowledging that a resolution has been reached, and it could be difficult to later argue for the registration of an FIR if the new buyers fail to fulfill their part of the agreement. It may weaken your position in claiming that a criminal offense has taken place.Before making any decisions or providing any written statements, it is highly recommended to consult with your lawyer. They can review the specifics of your case, the proposed settlement, and provide advice on the potential consequences and risks involved. They can also guide you on how to protect your interests and ensure that your rights are safeguarded throughout the legal process.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "First set of queries:The presumption of summons being served may vary depending on the specific rules and procedures followed by the civil court in your jurisdiction. It's best to consult with your lawyer regarding this matter to understand the local rules and how they apply to your case.Again, the treatment of court vacation in relation to the filing of a written statement can depend on local rules and procedures. Typically, court vacations are excluded from the calculation of time limits. It's essential to consult with your lawyer to understand the specific rules applicable to your case.If you have already requested the relief of permanent injunction in your own suit, it may not be necessary to file a counterclaim for the same relief in their suit. Your lawyer can guide you on whether it's appropriate to include it as a counterclaim or if it should be pursued solely in your own suit.Whether to ask for consolidation of the suits or file a rejection of plaint application is a strategic decision that should be discussed with your lawyer. They will be familiar with the specific circumstances of your case and can advise you on the best course of action.Falsely stating facts in a suit can be a serious matter, but the decision to initiate a criminal case would depend on the specific laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. It's advisable to consult with your lawyer and possibly involve the police or appropriate authorities if there is evidence of fraudulent statements.Second set of queries:Once the FIR is lodged, it would be best to consult with your lawyer regarding the appropriate course of action. They can guide you on whether to inform the magistrate or file an application to withdraw the 156(3) application.The contents of the FIR should ideally include all relevant details and allegations. If you have suspicions or additional information that you believe is relevant, it's generally advisable to include them in your statement. Your lawyer can provide more specific guidance based on the laws and practices in your jurisdiction.Contacting the IO to provide your statement or inquire about the progress of the investigation may be a reasonable step. However, it's important to follow the guidance of your lawyer, who can advise you on the best way to proceed in your specific case.The status of arrests and the appropriate follow-up procedures can vary depending on the laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. Your lawyer would be the best person to guide you on the appropriate actions and who can provide updates on the progress of the case.Third set of queries:If you withdraw the 156(3) application after the FIR is registered, it may be possible to file a subsequent 156(3) application if you are dissatisfied with the police investigation. However, the availability and maintainability of such an application would depend on the specific laws and procedures in your jurisdiction.

    "question": "Who is responsible for paying Khata bifurcation charges in BBMP limits, builder or the buyer of flat",
    "answer": "In Bangalore, the responsibility for paying the khata bifurcation charges can vary depending on various factors such as the builder's policy, local regulations, and the terms and conditions mentioned in the sales agreement. Generally, the khata bifurcation charges are associated with the process of dividing or separating the khata (property assessment account) for individual units within a larger development.Here are a few possibilities regarding who typically pays for khata bifurcation charges:Builder's responsibility: Some builders may include the khata bifurcation charges as part of their development costs and take care of the expenses themselves. This means that the builder would bear the cost, and it should not be passed on to the flat owners.Flat owners' responsibility: In some cases, the builders may expect the flat owners to pay for the khata bifurcation charges as part of the individual property registration process. This could be mentioned explicitly in the sales agreement or conveyed to the buyers separately.Negotiation: If there is no clear mention of khata bifurcation charges in the sales agreement or pricing documents, you could negotiate with the builder to clarify who is responsible for these charges. Review the terms and conditions of the sales agreement and consult with fellow flat owners to understand their understanding of the situation. If necessary, seek legal advice to determine your rights and obligations.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Plot purchase - missing buyers signature in the current sale deed",
    "answer": "The information provided suggests a discrepancy in the execution of the sale deed for the plot purchased by Mr. Shankar and his mother from the builder, Ferns.Impact of the issue: The absence of Mr. Shankar's signature on the sale deed could raise questions about his consent and involvement in the transaction. It may affect the validity of the sale and potentially create complications in the future when you plan to purchase the plot from Mr. Shankar.Rectification deed: A rectification deed is typically used to correct errors or omissions in a previously executed deed. If there is an omission of Mr. Shankar's signature, a rectification deed may be an appropriate legal instrument to correct the issue. However, the availability and viability of a rectification deed would depend on the specific circumstances and the laws of your jurisdiction. Consulting with a real estate attorney would provide you with the best guidance.Confirmation deed: A confirmation deed is different from a rectification deed. While a rectification deed corrects errors or omissions, a confirmation deed reaffirms or confirms the terms of an existing agreement. In this case, a confirmation deed may be used to confirm that Mr. Shankar and his mother were indeed the buyers of the plot, even if their signatures were missing on certain pages of the original sale deed. Again, the availability and appropriateness of a confirmation deed would depend on the laws of your jurisdiction.Legal advice: It is crucial to consult with a real estate attorney who can carefully examine the sale deed, understand the specific laws and regulations governing property transactions in your jurisdiction, and provide you with the most accurate advice. They will be able to guide you on the best course of action, whether it involves a rectification deed, confirmation deed, or any other legal instrument necessary to address the issue.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Clause I: This clause provides the background and context for the sale of the property. It includes the details of the property being sold, its location, and the relevant approval and registration information. It seems comprehensive and covers the necessary information.Clause II: This clause acknowledges the existence of mistakes in the Principal Deed, specifically regarding the Second Party's signatures. It clarifies that the mistakes were accidental and requires rectification. However, it might be beneficial to specify the exact nature of the mistakes, such as the missing signatures, to provide more clarity and avoid any potential confusion.Clause III: This clause states the specific pages in the Principal Deed that require rectification due to the absence of the Second Party's signatures. It accurately highlights the pages that need to be corrected to reflect the intended agreement between the parties.Overall, the clauses you've provided appear to address the need for rectification and highlight the specific areas in the Principal Deed that require correction. However, it's essential to work closely with your lawyer to ensure that the rectification draft accurately represents your situation and complies with the relevant legal requirements.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Protecting possession in case of fraudulent sale deed",
    "answer": "Dear client,It is generally not permissible to file multiple suits on the same cause of action. If both suits involve the same cause of action and the same parties, the second suit may be stayed or consolidated with the first suit under Section 10 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC). You should discuss this matter with your lawyer, who can file the appropriate application to the court to request the stay of the second suit.The granting of a temporary injunction depends on various factors, including the merits of the case and the balance of convenience. If the other party can prove that there is a possibility of irreparable harm or loss if the injunction is not granted, they may be successful in obtaining temporary injunction relief. However, your lawyer will be in a better position to assess the strength of their argument and provide guidance on how to respond effectively.Possession can be established in various ways, and it is not always necessary for someone to be physically staying inside the house. However, having someone present at the property, even as a watchman or caretaker, can help demonstrate that you are in possession and taking steps to protect your property. You should discuss the best approach with your lawyer, taking into account the specific circumstances and risks involved.Blocking the front gate with a car may provide an additional physical barrier, but it's important to consider the legal implications and potential consequences. Blocking the gate could be seen as an obstruction, and it may not be advisable without proper legal authorization. It's best to consult with your lawyer to explore legal ways to protect your property.Remember, the information provided here is general in nature, and it's crucial to consult with a qualified property lawyer who can provide you with advice specific to your case. They will be able to review the details of your situation, assess the relevant laws and regulations, and guide you through the legal process..Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Protecting possession in case of fraudulent sale deed",
    "answer": "In general, when dealing with a criminal case, it's important to consider the potential consequences of any agreements or statements made to the police or other parties involved. If you agree to a settlement with the new buyers and provide a written statement indicating that you will withdraw the 156(3) case, it may have implications for your ability to pursue a criminal case in the future.By agreeing to a settlement, you may be effectively acknowledging that a resolution has been reached, and it could be difficult to later argue for the registration of an FIR if the new buyers fail to fulfill their part of the agreement. It may weaken your position in claiming that a criminal offense has taken place.Before making any decisions or providing any written statements, it is highly recommended to consult with your lawyer. They can review the specifics of your case, the proposed settlement, and provide advice on the potential consequences and risks involved. They can also guide you on how to protect your interests and ensure that your rights are safeguarded throughout the legal process.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "First set of queries:The presumption of summons being served may vary depending on the specific rules and procedures followed by the civil court in your jurisdiction. It's best to consult with your lawyer regarding this matter to understand the local rules and how they apply to your case.Again, the treatment of court vacation in relation to the filing of a written statement can depend on local rules and procedures. Typically, court vacations are excluded from the calculation of time limits. It's essential to consult with your lawyer to understand the specific rules applicable to your case.If you have already requested the relief of permanent injunction in your own suit, it may not be necessary to file a counterclaim for the same relief in their suit. Your lawyer can guide you on whether it's appropriate to include it as a counterclaim or if it should be pursued solely in your own suit.Whether to ask for consolidation of the suits or file a rejection of plaint application is a strategic decision that should be discussed with your lawyer. They will be familiar with the specific circumstances of your case and can advise you on the best course of action.Falsely stating facts in a suit can be a serious matter, but the decision to initiate a criminal case would depend on the specific laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. It's advisable to consult with your lawyer and possibly involve the police or appropriate authorities if there is evidence of fraudulent statements.Second set of queries:Once the FIR is lodged, it would be best to consult with your lawyer regarding the appropriate course of action. They can guide you on whether to inform the magistrate or file an application to withdraw the 156(3) application.The contents of the FIR should ideally include all relevant details and allegations. If you have suspicions or additional information that you believe is relevant, it's generally advisable to include them in your statement. Your lawyer can provide more specific guidance based on the laws and practices in your jurisdiction.Contacting the IO to provide your statement or inquire about the progress of the investigation may be a reasonable step. However, it's important to follow the guidance of your lawyer, who can advise you on the best way to proceed in your specific case.The status of arrests and the appropriate follow-up procedures can vary depending on the laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. Your lawyer would be the best person to guide you on the appropriate actions and who can provide updates on the progress of the case.Third set of queries:If you withdraw the 156(3) application after the FIR is registered, it may be possible to file a subsequent 156(3) application if you are dissatisfied with the police investigation. However, the availability and maintainability of such an application would depend on the specific laws and procedures in your jurisdiction.

    "question": "Protecting possession in case of fraudulent sale deed",
    "answer": "Dear client,It is generally not permissible to file multiple suits on the same cause of action. If both suits involve the same cause of action and the same parties, the second suit may be stayed or consolidated with the first suit under Section 10 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC). You should discuss this matter with your lawyer, who can file the appropriate application to the court to request the stay of the second suit.The granting of a temporary injunction depends on various factors, including the merits of the case and the balance of convenience. If the other party can prove that there is a possibility of irreparable harm or loss if the injunction is not granted, they may be successful in obtaining temporary injunction relief. However, your lawyer will be in a better position to assess the strength of their argument and provide guidance on how to respond effectively.Possession can be established in various ways, and it is not always necessary for someone to be physically staying inside the house. However, having someone present at the property, even as a watchman or caretaker, can help demonstrate that you are in possession and taking steps to protect your property. You should discuss the best approach with your lawyer, taking into account the specific circumstances and risks involved.Blocking the front gate with a car may provide an additional physical barrier, but it's important to consider the legal implications and potential consequences. Blocking the gate could be seen as an obstruction, and it may not be advisable without proper legal authorization. It's best to consult with your lawyer to explore legal ways to protect your property.Remember, the information provided here is general in nature, and it's crucial to consult with a qualified property lawyer who can provide you with advice specific to your case.

    "question": "Protecting possession in case of fraudulent sale deed",
    "answer": "In general, when dealing with a criminal case, it's important to consider the potential consequences of any agreements or statements made to the police or other parties involved. If you agree to a settlement with the new buyers and provide a written statement indicating that you will withdraw the 156(3) case, it may have implications for your ability to pursue a criminal case in the future.By agreeing to a settlement, you may be effectively acknowledging that a resolution has been reached, and it could be difficult to later argue for the registration of an FIR if the new buyers fail to fulfill their part of the agreement. It may weaken your position in claiming that a criminal offense has taken place.Before making any decisions or providing any written statements, it is highly recommended to consult with your lawyer. They can review the specifics of your case, the proposed settlement, and provide advice on the potential consequences and risks involved. They can also guide you on how to protect your interests and ensure that your rights are safeguarded throughout the legal process.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "First set of queries:The presumption of summons being served may vary depending on the specific rules and procedures followed by the civil court in your jurisdiction. It's best to consult with your lawyer regarding this matter to understand the local rules and how they apply to your case.Again, the treatment of court vacation in relation to the filing of a written statement can depend on local rules and procedures. Typically, court vacations are excluded from the calculation of time limits. It's essential to consult with your lawyer to understand the specific rules applicable to your case.If you have already requested the relief of permanent injunction in your own suit, it may not be necessary to file a counterclaim for the same relief in their suit. Your lawyer can guide you on whether it's appropriate to include it as a counterclaim or if it should be pursued solely in your own suit.Whether to ask for consolidation of the suits or file a rejection of plaint application is a strategic decision that should be discussed with your lawyer. They will be familiar with the specific circumstances of your case and can advise you on the best course of action.Falsely stating facts in a suit can be a serious matter, but the decision to initiate a criminal case would depend on the specific laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. It's advisable to consult with your lawyer and possibly involve the police or appropriate authorities if there is evidence of fraudulent statements.Second set of queries:Once the FIR is lodged, it would be best to consult with your lawyer regarding the appropriate course of action. They can guide you on whether to inform the magistrate or file an application to withdraw the 156(3) application.The contents of the FIR should ideally include all relevant details and allegations. If you have suspicions or additional information that you believe is relevant, it's generally advisable to include them in your statement. Your lawyer can provide more specific guidance based on the laws and practices in your jurisdiction.Contacting the IO to provide your statement or inquire about the progress of the investigation may be a reasonable step. However, it's important to follow the guidance of your lawyer, who can advise you on the best way to proceed in your specific case.The status of arrests and the appropriate follow-up procedures can vary depending on the laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. Your lawyer would be the best person to guide you on the appropriate actions and who can provide updates on the progress of the case.Third set of queries:If you withdraw the 156(3) application after the FIR is registered, it may be possible to file a subsequent 156(3) application if you are dissatisfied with the police investigation. However, the availability and maintainability of such an application would depend on the specific laws and procedures in your jurisdiction.

    "question": "Plot purchase from Developer/Owner",
    "answer": "Since the sharing document is not registered in the sub-register office, it may not have legal validity or enforceability. Typically, agreements related to the sale or transfer of immovable property should be registered to ensure their legal validity. In most jurisdictions, an unregistered document may not be admissible as evidence in court. Therefore, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer to understand the specific legal requirements and consequences in your jurisdiction.If the developers have the authority to sell or transfer the undivided share of the landowners, they may have the power to execute a sale deed in favor of you. However, it is crucial to review the terms of the JDA, GPA, and any other relevant agreements to understand the extent of the developers' authority and obligations. A lawyer can help you analyze these documents to determine the specific rights and powers of the developers.The requirement for all landowners to be present at the sub-register office to sign the sale deed can depend on the laws and regulations of your jurisdiction, as well as the specific terms of the agreements involved. Generally, the consent of all co-owners may be required for a valid sale or transfer of the property. However, some jurisdictions may allow alternatives such as granting a power of attorney to one or more individuals to represent the absent landowners. Consulting with a lawyer who is familiar with the local laws and practices can provide you with accurate information about the specific requirements and alternatives in your jurisdiction.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Who is responsible for paying Khata bifurcation charges in BBMP limits, builder or the buyer of flat",
    "answer": "In Bangalore, the responsibility for paying the khata bifurcation charges can vary depending on various factors such as the builder's policy, local regulations, and the terms and conditions mentioned in the sales agreement. Generally, the khata bifurcation charges are associated with the process of dividing or separating the khata (property assessment account) for individual units within a larger development.Here are a few possibilities regarding who typically pays for khata bifurcation charges:Builder's responsibility: Some builders may include the khata bifurcation charges as part of their development costs and take care of the expenses themselves. This means that the builder would bear the cost, and it should not be passed on to the flat owners.Flat owners' responsibility: In some cases, the builders may expect the flat owners to pay for the khata bifurcation charges as part of the individual property registration process. This could be mentioned explicitly in the sales agreement or conveyed to the buyers separately.Negotiation: If there is no clear mention of khata bifurcation charges in the sales agreement or pricing documents, you could negotiate with the builder to clarify who is responsible for these charges. Review the terms and conditions of the sales agreement and consult with fellow flat owners to understand their understanding of the situation. If necessary, seek legal advice to determine your rights and obligations.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Is car parking allotted to flat or owner",
    "answer": "The ability to sell a flat without the parking allotment depends on the specific laws and regulations governing property transactions in your jurisdiction. Generally, if the parking allotment is a separate and distinct component from the flat, it may be possible for the previous owner to sell the flat without including the parking allotment. However, this can vary depending on the terms of the original agreement and any subsequent agreements or regulations that may apply.Whether parking is attached to a flat or to the owner can depend on various factors, including the specific provisions of the cooperative society's bylaws, any contractual agreements, and the applicable laws in your jurisdiction. In some cases, parking may be considered a separate entity that can be bought, sold, or transferred independently of the flat. In other cases, it may be considered an attached amenity that is automatically transferred with the ownership of the flat.Providing a comprehensive list of laws and acts is beyond the scope of this response, as it can vary depending on the jurisdiction. However, your cooperative society secretary can consult with a qualified attorney who specializes in real estate or cooperative housing laws to obtain the relevant legal provisions and case law that support the argument that the parking allotment belongs to the new owner or that the previous owner is no longer entitled to it.Whether the seller can continue to hold the parking allotment would depend on the specific agreements, regulations, and laws applicable in your situation. If the parking allotment was not specifically transferred to the new owner as part of the sale, and there are no provisions in the cooperative society's bylaws or any other relevant agreements indicating that the previous owner can retain the parking allotment, it may be argued that the parking allotment should be transferred to the new owner along with the flat.

    "question": "Who is responsible for paying Khata bifurcation charges in BBMP limits, builder or the buyer of flat",
    "answer": "In Bangalore, the responsibility for paying the khata bifurcation charges can vary depending on various factors such as the builder's policy, local regulations, and the terms and conditions mentioned in the sales agreement. Generally, the khata bifurcation charges are associated with the process of dividing or separating the khata (property assessment account) for individual units within a larger development.Here are a few possibilities regarding who typically pays for khata bifurcation charges:Builder's responsibility: Some builders may include the khata bifurcation charges as part of their development costs and take care of the expenses themselves. This means that the builder would bear the cost, and it should not be passed on to the flat owners.Flat owners' responsibility: In some cases, the builders may expect the flat owners to pay for the khata bifurcation charges as part of the individual property registration process. This could be mentioned explicitly in the sales agreement or conveyed to the buyers separately.Negotiation: If there is no clear mention of khata bifurcation charges in the sales agreement or pricing documents, you could negotiate with the builder to clarify who is responsible for these charges. Review the terms and conditions of the sales agreement and consult with fellow flat owners to understand their understanding of the situation.

    "question": "Is car parking allotted to flat or owner",
    "answer": "The ability to sell a flat without the parking allotment depends on the specific laws and regulations governing property transactions in your jurisdiction. Generally, if the parking allotment is a separate and distinct component from the flat, it may be possible for the previous owner to sell the flat without including the parking allotment. However, this can vary depending on the terms of the original agreement and any subsequent agreements or regulations that may apply.Whether parking is attached to a flat or to the owner can depend on various factors, including the specific provisions of the cooperative society's bylaws, any contractual agreements, and the applicable laws in your jurisdiction. In some cases, parking may be considered a separate entity that can be bought, sold, or transferred independently of the flat. In other cases, it may be considered an attached amenity that is automatically transferred with the ownership of the flat.Providing a comprehensive list of laws and acts is beyond the scope of this response, as it can vary depending on the jurisdiction. However, your cooperative society secretary can consult with a qualified attorney who specializes in real estate or cooperative housing laws to obtain the relevant legal provisions and case law that support the argument that the parking allotment belongs to the new owner or that the previous owner is no longer entitled to it.Whether the seller can continue to hold the parking allotment would depend on the specific agreements, regulations, and laws applicable in your situation. If the parking allotment was not specifically transferred to the new owner as part of the sale, and there are no provisions in the cooperative society's bylaws or any other relevant agreements indicating that the previous owner can retain the parking allotment, it may be argued that the parking allotment should be transferred to the new owner along with the flat.

    "question": "Who is responsible for paying Khata bifurcation charges in BBMP limits, builder or the buyer of flat",
    "answer": "In Bangalore, the responsibility for paying the khata bifurcation charges can vary depending on various factors such as the builder's policy, local regulations, and the terms and conditions mentioned in the sales agreement. Generally, the khata bifurcation charges are associated with the process of dividing or separating the khata (property assessment account) for individual units within a larger development.Here are a few possibilities regarding who typically pays for khata bifurcation charges:Builder's responsibility: Some builders may include the khata bifurcation charges as part of their development costs and take care of the expenses themselves. This means that the builder would bear the cost, and it should not be passed on to the flat owners.Flat owners' responsibility: In some cases, the builders may expect the flat owners to pay for the khata bifurcation charges as part of the individual property registration process. This could be mentioned explicitly in the sales agreement or conveyed to the buyers separately.Negotiation: If there is no clear mention of khata bifurcation charges in the sales agreement or pricing documents, you could negotiate with the builder to clarify who is responsible for these charges. Review the terms and conditions of the sales agreement and consult with fellow flat owners to understand their understanding of the situation.

    "question": "Is car parking allotted to flat or owner",
    "answer": "The ability to sell a flat without the parking allotment depends on the specific laws and regulations governing property transactions in your jurisdiction. Generally, if the parking allotment is a separate and distinct component from the flat, it may be possible for the previous owner to sell the flat without including the parking allotment. However, this can vary depending on the terms of the original agreement and any subsequent agreements or regulations that may apply.Whether parking is attached to a flat or to the owner can depend on various factors, including the specific provisions of the cooperative society's bylaws, any contractual agreements, and the applicable laws in your jurisdiction. In some cases, parking may be considered a separate entity that can be bought, sold, or transferred independently of the flat. In other cases, it may be considered an attached amenity that is automatically transferred with the ownership of the flat.Providing a comprehensive list of laws and acts is beyond the scope of this response, as it can vary depending on the jurisdiction. However, your cooperative society secretary can consult with a qualified attorney who specializes in real estate or cooperative housing laws to obtain the relevant legal provisions and case law that support the argument that the parking allotment belongs to the new owner or that the previous owner is no longer entitled to it.Whether the seller can continue to hold the parking allotment would depend on the specific agreements, regulations, and laws applicable in your situation. If the parking allotment was not specifically transferred to the new owner as part of the sale, and there are no provisions in the cooperative society's bylaws or any other relevant agreements indicating that the previous owner can retain the parking allotment, it may be argued that the parking allotment should be transferred to the new owner along with the flat. However, this will ultimately depend on the specific details of your case and the applicable laws in your jurisdiction.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Divorce Prospects: The prospects of your husband obtaining a divorce will depend on various factors, including the specific grounds for divorce recognized in your jurisdiction and the evidence presented during the divorce proceedings. Generally, if your husband can establish valid grounds for divorce under the applicable laws, such as irretrievable breakdown of the marriage, cruelty, or other legally recognized grounds, he may have a reasonable chance of obtaining a divorce. However, the final decision will depend on the court's assessment of the evidence and the specific facts of your case. It's important to consult with a lawyer who can provide guidance based on the laws and practices in your jurisdiction.Conducting the Case in Absence: If you are moving to Canada and your husband files for divorce, it may be possible for your lawyer to represent you in your absence, depending on the laws and procedures of your jurisdiction.

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. At times, despite our best efforts, life takes a turn for the worst. We may have wanted different things from life, but life’s got its own plan as well. A bad marriage is something which nobody hopes for, but at times, that’s exactly what we are given and forced to face head on. Marriages are hard. Divorces…even harder. Nobody enters marriage thinking about a divorce in the end. If some are unable to cope with the harsh realities of marriage, the only viable option in front of them is to approach the Court and seek legal separation.Chances of divorce at this stage of life is very bleak. However, Court may grant if your husband is able to prove the grounds alleged in the divorce petition. Hon'ble Supreme Court has allowed video conferencing in various matrimonial matters, though not as a matter of recourse.

It appears to be a proposal for a compromise, and whether it negatively impacts you would depend on your specific circumstances and desired outcomes. It's crucial to carefully review the terms and implications of the proposed agreement and consider seeking legal advice to ensure it aligns with your interests and protects your rights.Procedure for presenting the agreement: The procedure for presenting the agreement may vary depending on the court rules and practices in your jurisdiction. It's generally advisable to work with your lawyer to draft the agreement accurately, including all necessary terms and signatures. They can guide you on the specific procedure for submitting the agreement to the court, which may involve filing it with the appropriate court clerk, serving copies to the other party, and potentially presenting it during the next hearing.Duration of the case: The duration of the case and whether there will be another hearing can depend on various factors, such as the complexity of the case, the court's schedule, and any potential disputes or disagreements that may arise. It's difficult to predict with certainty whether the case will conclude on the same day or require additional hearings.

    "answer": "Dear client,It is generally not permissible to file multiple suits on the same cause of action. If both suits involve the same cause of action and the same parties, the second suit may be stayed or consolidated with the first suit under Section 10 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC). You should discuss this matter with your lawyer, who can file the appropriate application to the court to request the stay of the second suit.The granting of a temporary injunction depends on various factors, including the merits of the case and the balance of convenience. If the other party can prove that there is a possibility of irreparable harm or loss if the injunction is not granted, they may be successful in obtaining temporary injunction relief. However, your lawyer will be in a better position to assess the strength of their argument and provide guidance on how to respond effectively.Possession can be established in various ways, and it is not always necessary for someone to be physically staying inside the house. However, having someone present at the property, even as a watchman or caretaker, can help demonstrate that you are in possession and taking steps to protect your property. You should discuss the best approach with your lawyer, taking into account the specific circumstances and risks involved.Blocking the front gate with a car may provide an additional physical barrier, but it's important to consider the legal implications and potential consequences. Blocking the gate could be seen as an obstruction, and it may not be advisable without proper legal authorization. It's best to consult with your lawyer to explore legal ways to protect your property.Remember, the information provided here is general in nature, and it's crucial to consult with a qualified property lawyer who can provide you with advice specific to your case. They will be able to review the details of your situation, assess the relevant laws and regulations, and guide you through the legal process..Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Protecting possession in case of fraudulent sale deed",
    "answer": "In general, when dealing with a criminal case, it's important to consider the potential consequences of any agreements or statements made to the police or other parties involved. If you agree to a settlement with the new buyers and provide a written statement indicating that you will withdraw the 156(3) case, it may have implications for your ability to pursue a criminal case in the future.By agreeing to a settlement, you may be effectively acknowledging that a resolution has been reached, and it could be difficult to later argue for the registration of an FIR if the new buyers fail to fulfill their part of the agreement. It may weaken your position in claiming that a criminal offense has taken place.Before making any decisions or providing any written statements, it is highly recommended to consult with your lawyer. They can review the specifics of your case, the proposed settlement, and provide advice on the potential consequences and risks involved. They can also guide you on how to protect your interests and ensure that your rights are safeguarded throughout the legal process.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "First set of queries:The presumption of summons being served may vary depending on the specific rules and procedures followed by the civil court in your jurisdiction. It's best to consult with your lawyer regarding this matter to understand the local rules and how they apply to your case.Again, the treatment of court vacation in relation to the filing of a written statement can depend on local rules and procedures. Typically, court vacations are excluded from the calculation of time limits. It's essential to consult with your lawyer to understand the specific rules applicable to your case.If you have already requested the relief of permanent injunction in your own suit, it may not be necessary to file a counterclaim for the same relief in their suit. Your lawyer can guide you on whether it's appropriate to include it as a counterclaim or if it should be pursued solely in your own suit.Whether to ask for consolidation of the suits or file a rejection of plaint application is a strategic decision that should be discussed with your lawyer. They will be familiar with the specific circumstances of your case and can advise you on the best course of action.Falsely stating facts in a suit can be a serious matter, but the decision to initiate a criminal case would depend on the specific laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. It's advisable to consult with your lawyer and possibly involve the police or appropriate authorities if there is evidence of fraudulent statements.Second set of queries:Once the FIR is lodged, it would be best to consult with your lawyer regarding the appropriate course of action. They can guide you on whether to inform the magistrate or file an application to withdraw the 156(3) application.The contents of the FIR should ideally include all relevant details and allegations. If you have suspicions or additional information that you believe is relevant, it's generally advisable to include them in your statement. Your lawyer can provide more specific guidance based on the laws and practices in your jurisdiction.Contacting the IO to provide your statement or inquire about the progress of the investigation may be a reasonable step. However, it's important to follow the guidance of your lawyer, who can advise you on the best way to proceed in your specific case.The status of arrests and the appropriate follow-up procedures can vary depending on the laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. Your lawyer would be the best person to guide you on the appropriate actions and who can provide updates on the progress of the case.Third set of queries:If you withdraw the 156(3) application after the FIR is registered, it may be possible to file a subsequent 156(3) application if you are dissatisfied with the police investigation. However, the availability and maintainability of such an application would depend on the specific laws and procedures in your jurisdiction.

They can review your situation in detail and provide guidance on the best course of action based on the specific laws and procedures in your jurisdiction.File an RTI application: While you mentioned that you want alternatives to filing an RTI (Right to Information) application, it can be a viable option to obtain information from the government authorities. RTI allows citizens to seek information from public authorities, and it could be used to inquire about the availability of the Index 2 for your property. You can explore this option if all other avenues fail.Explore alternative documentation: In the absence of the original Index 2, check if there are any other relevant documents that can establish your ownership or provide necessary information about the property. This could include the sale deed, property tax receipts, maintenance bills, or any other records that can verify your ownership.Obtain an affidavit: If you are unable to obtain the Index 2 or any alternative documentation, consult with your attorney to determine if it is possible to obtain an affidavit or a declaration stating the circumstances of the missing document.

They may be able to provide guidance or offer alternative solutions. Visit the SRO in person or contact them through official channels to inquire about any available options. Do not rely upon third-party words.Get an Encumbrance Certificate from the SRO. An EC is an official document that provides information about encumbrances or transactions related to a property. It typically includes details such as ownership, mortgages, and charges on the property. Applying for an EC from the SRO may help provide evidence of your ownership and validate the registration of your apartment. The EC may serve as a substitute for the index 2 documents.In some cases, there may be additional documents or alternatives that can help establish your ownership, such as old tax receipts, maintenance bills, or any other supporting documents that demonstrate your possession and use of the property over the years. These documents can be useful in building a case to prove your ownership.Sukumar JadhavAdvocate, Mumbai35 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sukumar Jadhav"

They will help you understand the legal options available to you and guide you through the process.Review the property documents: Gather all the relevant property documents, including the patta and any wills or legal agreements regarding the property. Your attorney will need to review these documents to assess the situation accurately.Mediation and negotiation: Consider engaging in mediation or negotiation with your aunt and other family members involved. Sometimes, resolving conflicts through peaceful discussions can help reach a mutual agreement.

    "question": "While asking for maintenance, wife has registered on matrimony websites. How to use this exactly?",
    "answer": "In India, divorce, dowry, anddomestic violencecases are typically governed by the provisions of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, theDowry Prohibition Act, 1961, and the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005. Here are some general points to consider:Maintenance: Maintenance, also known as alimony, is a legal obligation for one spouse to provide financial support to the other after divorce. The court will consider several factors, such as the income and financial position of both parties, standard of living, earning capacity, and other relevant circumstances. Adultery or finding a new partner may impact the decision on maintenance, but it's crucial to consult with a lawyer to understand the specific provisions in your case.Matrimonial websites: If you have evidence that your wife is actively seeking a new marriage partner through matrimonial websites, it may be relevant to your case. This evidence could potentially be used to argue against her claim for maintenance, as it may indicate that she is capable of supporting herself or that her financial needs are different from what she claims.Case law and precedents: Indian courts rely on precedents and case law to interpret and apply the law. To understand the exact judgments that can be applied in your case, it's essential to consult with a lawyer who can research relevant case law and analyze how it may apply to your specific situation.Remember, it is crucial to consult with a qualified lawyer who can provide you with accurate advice based on your circumstances. They will be able to evaluate your evidence, guide you through the legal process, and represent your interests effectively in court.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Divorce Prospects: The prospects of your husband obtaining a divorce will depend on various factors, including the specific grounds for divorce recognized in your jurisdiction and the evidence presented during the divorce proceedings. Generally, if your husband can establish valid grounds for divorce under the applicable laws, such as irretrievable breakdown of the marriage, cruelty, or other legally recognized grounds, he may have a reasonable chance of obtaining a divorce. However, the final decision will depend on the court's assessment of the evidence and the specific facts of your case. It's important to consult with a lawyer who can provide guidance based on the laws and practices in your jurisdiction.Conducting the Case in Absence: If you are moving to Canada and your husband files for divorce, it may be possible for your lawyer to represent you in your absence, depending on the laws and procedures of your jurisdiction. However, it's important to note that family law procedures can vary from one jurisdiction to another, and there may be specific requirements or limitations on representing a party in their absence.

At times, despite our best efforts, life takes a turn for the worst. We may have wanted different things from life, but life’s got its own plan as well. A bad marriage is something which nobody hopes for, but at times, that’s exactly what we are given and forced to face head on. Marriages are hard. Divorces…even harder. Nobody enters marriage thinking about a divorce in the end. If some are unable to cope with the harsh realities of marriage, the only viable option in front of them is to approach the Court and seek legal separation.Chances of divorce at this stage of life is very bleak. However, Court may grant if your husband is able to prove the grounds alleged in the divorce petition.

It appears to be a proposal for a compromise, and whether it negatively impacts you would depend on your specific circumstances and desired outcomes. It's crucial to carefully review the terms and implications of the proposed agreement and consider seeking legal advice to ensure it aligns with your interests and protects your rights.Procedure for presenting the agreement: The procedure for presenting the agreement may vary depending on the court rules and practices in your jurisdiction. It's generally advisable to work with your lawyer to draft the agreement accurately, including all necessary terms and signatures. They can guide you on the specific procedure for submitting the agreement to the court, which may involve filing it with the appropriate court clerk, serving copies to the other party, and potentially presenting it during the next hearing.Duration of the case: The duration of the case and whether there will be another hearing can depend on various factors, such as the complexity of the case, the court's schedule, and any potential disputes or disagreements that may arise. It's difficult to predict with certainty whether the case will conclude on the same day or require additional hearings.

    "answer": "In India, divorce, dowry, anddomestic violencecases are typically governed by the provisions of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, theDowry Prohibition Act, 1961, and the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005. Here are some general points to consider:Maintenance: Maintenance, also known as alimony, is a legal obligation for one spouse to provide financial support to the other after divorce. The court will consider several factors, such as the income and financial position of both parties, standard of living, earning capacity, and other relevant circumstances. Adultery or finding a new partner may impact the decision on maintenance, but it's crucial to consult with a lawyer to understand the specific provisions in your case.Matrimonial websites: If you have evidence that your wife is actively seeking a new marriage partner through matrimonial websites, it may be relevant to your case. This evidence could potentially be used to argue against her claim for maintenance, as it may indicate that she is capable of supporting herself or that her financial needs are different from what she claims.Case law and precedents: Indian courts rely on precedents and case law to interpret and apply the law. To understand the exact judgments that can be applied in your case, it's essential to consult with a lawyer who can research relevant case law and analyze how it may apply to your specific situation.Remember, it is crucial to consult with a qualified lawyer who can provide you with accurate advice based on your circumstances.

    "question": "Divorce application by respondent while DVC is in process",
    "answer": "1. Divorce case is clearly a counter blast to your DVC case. As such, his prospects would not be good if you decided to counter his divorce case and made a counter claim against him. You can also claim maintenance, etc.2. You can appoint your special power of attorney to contest at your instruction and also to represent you in the divorce case. You would not be required to appear on every date in the divorce case. A lawyer can also represent you but for filing reply etc the appointed lawyer cannot sign on your behalf as respondent at your place. So SPA would be more appropriate.Siddharth SrivastavaAdvocate, Delhi1537 AnswersTalk to Advocate Siddharth Srivastava"

    "question": "Divorce application by respondent while DVC is in process",
    "answer": "Divorce Prospects: The prospects of your husband obtaining a divorce will depend on various factors, including the specific grounds for divorce recognized in your jurisdiction and the evidence presented during the divorce proceedings. Generally, if your husband can establish valid grounds for divorce under the applicable laws, such as irretrievable breakdown of the marriage, cruelty, or other legally recognized grounds, he may have a reasonable chance of obtaining a divorce. However, the final decision will depend on the court's assessment of the evidence and the specific facts of your case. It's important to consult with a lawyer who can provide guidance based on the laws and practices in your jurisdiction.Conducting the Case in Absence: If you are moving to Canada and your husband files for divorce, it may be possible for your lawyer to represent you in your absence, depending on the laws and procedures of your jurisdiction. However, it's important to note that family law procedures can vary from one jurisdiction to another, and there may be specific requirements or limitations on representing a party in their absence. Your lawyer will be able to guide you on the specific rules and requirements in your jurisdiction and advise you on the best course of action to ensure your interests are protected.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. At times, despite our best efforts, life takes a turn for the worst. We may have wanted different things from life, but life’s got its own plan as well. A bad marriage is something which nobody hopes for, but at times, that’s exactly what we are given and forced to face head on. Marriages are hard. Divorces…even harder. Nobody enters marriage thinking about a divorce in the end. If some are unable to cope with the harsh realities of marriage, the only viable option in front of them is to approach the Court and seek legal separation.Chances of divorce at this stage of life is very bleak. However, Court may grant if your husband is able to prove the grounds alleged in the divorce petition. Hon'ble Supreme Court has allowed video conferencing in various matrimonial matters, though not as a matter of recourse. It depends also on the availability of such facility.You may contact my secretary to connect with for clarification.

    "answer": "Content and its impact: The content you've provided outlines the petitioner's requests and intentions regarding the division of assets and access to premises. It appears to be a proposal for a compromise, and whether it negatively impacts you would depend on your specific circumstances and desired outcomes. It's crucial to carefully review the terms and implications of the proposed agreement and consider seeking legal advice to ensure it aligns with your interests and protects your rights.Procedure for presenting the agreement: The procedure for presenting the agreement may vary depending on the court rules and practices in your jurisdiction. It's generally advisable to work with your lawyer to draft the agreement accurately, including all necessary terms and signatures. They can guide you on the specific procedure for submitting the agreement to the court, which may involve filing it with the appropriate court clerk, serving copies to the other party, and potentially presenting it during the next hearing.Duration of the case: The duration of the case and whether there will be another hearing can depend on various factors, such as the complexity of the case, the court's schedule, and any potential disputes or disagreements that may arise. It's difficult to predict with certainty whether the case will conclude on the same day or require additional hearings. Your lawyer, who has a better understanding of the specific circumstances and the court's procedures, will be able to provide more accurate guidance on the expected timeline of your case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Protecting possession in case of fraudulent sale deed",
    "answer": "Dear client,It is generally not permissible to file multiple suits on the same cause of action. If both suits involve the same cause of action and the same parties, the second suit may be stayed or consolidated with the first suit under Section 10 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC). You should discuss this matter with your lawyer, who can file the appropriate application to the court to request the stay of the second suit.The granting of a temporary injunction depends on various factors, including the merits of the case and the balance of convenience. If the other party can prove that there is a possibility of irreparable harm or loss if the injunction is not granted, they may be successful in obtaining temporary injunction relief. However, your lawyer will be in a better position to assess the strength of their argument and provide guidance on how to respond effectively.Possession can be established in various ways, and it is not always necessary for someone to be physically staying inside the house. However, having someone present at the property, even as a watchman or caretaker, can help demonstrate that you are in possession and taking steps to protect your property. You should discuss the best approach with your lawyer, taking into account the specific circumstances and risks involved.Blocking the front gate with a car may provide an additional physical barrier, but it's important to consider the legal implications and potential consequences. Blocking the gate could be seen as an obstruction, and it may not be advisable without proper legal authorization. It's best to consult with your lawyer to explore legal ways to protect your property.Remember, the information provided here is general in nature, and it's crucial to consult with a qualified property lawyer who can provide you with advice specific to your case.

    "answer": "In general, when dealing with a criminal case, it's important to consider the potential consequences of any agreements or statements made to the police or other parties involved. If you agree to a settlement with the new buyers and provide a written statement indicating that you will withdraw the 156(3) case, it may have implications for your ability to pursue a criminal case in the future.By agreeing to a settlement, you may be effectively acknowledging that a resolution has been reached, and it could be difficult to later argue for the registration of an FIR if the new buyers fail to fulfill their part of the agreement. It may weaken your position in claiming that a criminal offense has taken place.Before making any decisions or providing any written statements, it is highly recommended to consult with your lawyer. They can review the specifics of your case, the proposed settlement, and provide advice on the potential consequences and risks involved. They can also guide you on how to protect your interests and ensure that your rights are safeguarded throughout the legal process.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "First set of queries:The presumption of summons being served may vary depending on the specific rules and procedures followed by the civil court in your jurisdiction. It's best to consult with your lawyer regarding this matter to understand the local rules and how they apply to your case.Again, the treatment of court vacation in relation to the filing of a written statement can depend on local rules and procedures. Typically, court vacations are excluded from the calculation of time limits. It's essential to consult with your lawyer to understand the specific rules applicable to your case.If you have already requested the relief of permanent injunction in your own suit, it may not be necessary to file a counterclaim for the same relief in their suit. Your lawyer can guide you on whether it's appropriate to include it as a counterclaim or if it should be pursued solely in your own suit.Whether to ask for consolidation of the suits or file a rejection of plaint application is a strategic decision that should be discussed with your lawyer. They will be familiar with the specific circumstances of your case and can advise you on the best course of action.Falsely stating facts in a suit can be a serious matter, but the decision to initiate a criminal case would depend on the specific laws and procedures in your jurisdiction.

They can guide you on whether to inform the magistrate or file an application to withdraw the 156(3) application.The contents of the FIR should ideally include all relevant details and allegations.

However, it's important to follow the guidance of your lawyer, who can advise you on the best way to proceed in your specific case.The status of arrests and the appropriate follow-up procedures can vary depending on the laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. Your lawyer would be the best person to guide you on the appropriate actions and who can provide updates on the progress of the case.Third set of queries:If you withdraw the 156(3) application after the FIR is registered, it may be possible to file a subsequent 156(3) application if you are dissatisfied with the police investigation. However, the availability and maintainability of such an application would depend on the specific laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. Consulting with your lawyer is crucial in this situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "While asking for maintenance, wife has registered on matrimony websites. How to use this exactly?",
    "answer": "In India, divorce, dowry, anddomestic violencecases are typically governed by the provisions of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, theDowry Prohibition Act, 1961, and the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005. Here are some general points to consider:Maintenance: Maintenance, also known as alimony, is a legal obligation for one spouse to provide financial support to the other after divorce. The court will consider several factors, such as the income and financial position of both parties, standard of living, earning capacity, and other relevant circumstances. Adultery or finding a new partner may impact the decision on maintenance, but it's crucial to consult with a lawyer to understand the specific provisions in your case.Matrimonial websites: If you have evidence that your wife is actively seeking a new marriage partner through matrimonial websites, it may be relevant to your case. This evidence could potentially be used to argue against her claim for maintenance, as it may indicate that she is capable of supporting herself or that her financial needs are different from what she claims.Case law and precedents: Indian courts rely on precedents and case law to interpret and apply the law. To understand the exact judgments that can be applied in your case, it's essential to consult with a lawyer who can research relevant case law and analyze how it may apply to your specific situation.Remember, it is crucial to consult with a qualified lawyer who can provide you with accurate advice based on your circumstances.

Subsequently, your brother filed a suit in the District Court, which ruled in your favor. However, your brother has now filed a suit in the High Court.Since the case is currently at the \"FINAL DISPOSAL AT MOTION HEARING STAGE\" in the High Court, it suggests that the court is in the process of making a final decision on the matter. At this stage, it is important to be prepared for the legal proceedings and to have proper legal representation to present your case effectively.It is difficult to predict the outcome of a legal case, as it depends on various factors such as the evidence presented, the arguments made, and the interpretation of the law by the court. However, since the District Court ruled in your favor, it may work in your favor in the High Court as well.To understand the specific legal implications and possible outcomes of your case, it is strongly recommended to consult with a lawyer who specializes in property law in your jurisdiction. They will be able to analyze the details of your case, guide you through the legal process, and provide you with the most accurate advice based on the specific laws and regulations applicable in your area.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Property Valuation for Capital Gains and Lower Tax Filing",
    "answer": "To obtain a property evaluation certificate for the purpose of calculating capital gains and potential tax benefits for your sister (a U.S. citizen) in India, it is advisable to consult with a qualified property valuer or a professional property appraisal firm. They will have the necessary expertise and resources to conduct a proper evaluation of the property and provide an official valuation certificate.The property evaluation certificate should ideally be prepared by a licensed and registered property valuer who is recognized by the government authorities. The certificate should include details such as the property's market value as of April 1, 2001, which is often used as a reference date for determining capital gains in India. The valuation certificate should be comprehensive and provide supporting documentation and justification for the determined property value.The certificate does not necessarily need to bear the seal and signature of the sub-registrar. However, it should be prepared by a qualified professional with expertise in property valuation and comply with the relevant standards and regulations.The cost of obtaining a property valuation certificate can vary depending on various factors such as the location, size, and complexity of the property, as well as the service provider's fees. It is recommended to contact different property valuation firms or professionals in your area to inquire about their fees and obtain quotes for their services.While a Chartered Accountant (CA) may be able to assist with certain financial calculations and tax matters, it is typically the role of a property valuer or appraiser to provide an official valuation certificate.

    "question": "Divorce in High court",
    "answer": "Transfer Petition and Divorce Decree: A transfer petition in the high court typically requests the transfer of a case from one jurisdiction (such as your husband's hometown) to another jurisdiction (such as your hometown). The purpose of the transfer petition is to have the case heard in a more convenient or suitable location for one or both parties. The high court can decide whether to transfer the case or not based on the circumstances presented. However, it's important to note that the high court typically does not directly pass a divorce decree. Instead, it may transfer the case to the appropriate family court for further proceedings.Role of the Family Court: Once the case is transferred to the family court, it will be responsible for conducting the divorce proceedings and making a decision on the divorce. The family court will consider the evidence presented by both parties, listen to arguments, and issue a divorce decree if it determines that the grounds for divorce are met. The family court has the authority to decide on divorce matters unless there are specific circumstances where the high court may exercise jurisdiction.Withdrawal of Section 306 Case: Section 306 of theIndian Penal Codepertains to abetment of suicide. If you have filed a case under this section, it is a criminal case and separate from the divorce proceedings. Whether you can withdraw the case depends on various factors, including the stage of the case, the consent of the court, and the specific laws in your jurisdiction. It's advisable to consult with your criminal law attorney to understand the implications and procedures for withdrawing the case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "To determine whether you can obtain a legal stay against the enforcement of garbage selection by the association in a place that is not in the approved BDA/BBMP plan, it is advisable to consult with a local legal professional who specializes in property law or municipal law in Bangalore, Karnataka. They will be able to provide you with accurate and up-to-date advice based on the specific laws and regulations applicable in your jurisdiction.In general, the legality of the association's enforcement of garbage selection would depend on various factors, including the relevant local laws and regulations, the terms of any applicable property agreements or bylaws, and the authority granted to the association to enforce such measures. The approved BDA/BBMP plan may also play a role in determining the permissibility of certain activities in specific areas.A legal professional can review the relevant documents and advise you on whether the association's actions are lawful and whether you have grounds to seek a legal stay or challenge their enforcement.

    "question": "Plot purchase from Developer/Owner",
    "answer": "Since the sharing document is not registered in the sub-register office, it may not have legal validity or enforceability. Typically, agreements related to the sale or transfer of immovable property should be registered to ensure their legal validity. In most jurisdictions, an unregistered document may not be admissible as evidence in court. Therefore, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer to understand the specific legal requirements and consequences in your jurisdiction.If the developers have the authority to sell or transfer the undivided share of the landowners, they may have the power to execute a sale deed in favor of you. However, it is crucial to review the terms of the JDA, GPA, and any other relevant agreements to understand the extent of the developers' authority and obligations. A lawyer can help you analyze these documents to determine the specific rights and powers of the developers.The requirement for all landowners to be present at the sub-register office to sign the sale deed can depend on the laws and regulations of your jurisdiction, as well as the specific terms of the agreements involved. Generally, the consent of all co-owners may be required for a valid sale or transfer of the property. However, some jurisdictions may allow alternatives such as granting a power of attorney to one or more individuals to represent the absent landowners. Consulting with a lawyer who is familiar with the local laws and practices can provide you with accurate information about the specific requirements and alternatives in your jurisdiction.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Divorce in High court",
    "answer": "Transfer Petition and Divorce Decree: A transfer petition in the high court typically requests the transfer of a case from one jurisdiction (such as your husband's hometown) to another jurisdiction (such as your hometown). The purpose of the transfer petition is to have the case heard in a more convenient or suitable location for one or both parties. The high court can decide whether to transfer the case or not based on the circumstances presented. However, it's important to note that the high court typically does not directly pass a divorce decree. Instead, it may transfer the case to the appropriate family court for further proceedings.Role of the Family Court: Once the case is transferred to the family court, it will be responsible for conducting the divorce proceedings and making a decision on the divorce. The family court will consider the evidence presented by both parties, listen to arguments, and issue a divorce decree if it determines that the grounds for divorce are met. The family court has the authority to decide on divorce matters unless there are specific circumstances where the high court may exercise jurisdiction.Withdrawal of Section 306 Case: Section 306 of theIndian Penal Codepertains to abetment of suicide. If you have filed a case under this section, it is a criminal case and separate from the divorce proceedings. Whether you can withdraw the case depends on various factors, including the stage of the case, the consent of the court, and the specific laws in your jurisdiction. It's advisable to consult with your criminal law attorney to understand the implications and procedures for withdrawing the case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Plot purchase from Developer/Owner",
    "answer": "Since the sharing document is not registered in the sub-register office, it may not have legal validity or enforceability. Typically, agreements related to the sale or transfer of immovable property should be registered to ensure their legal validity. In most jurisdictions, an unregistered document may not be admissible as evidence in court. Therefore, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer to understand the specific legal requirements and consequences in your jurisdiction.If the developers have the authority to sell or transfer the undivided share of the landowners, they may have the power to execute a sale deed in favor of you. However, it is crucial to review the terms of the JDA, GPA, and any other relevant agreements to understand the extent of the developers' authority and obligations. A lawyer can help you analyze these documents to determine the specific rights and powers of the developers.The requirement for all landowners to be present at the sub-register office to sign the sale deed can depend on the laws and regulations of your jurisdiction, as well as the specific terms of the agreements involved. Generally, the consent of all co-owners may be required for a valid sale or transfer of the property. However, some jurisdictions may allow alternatives such as granting a power of attorney to one or more individuals to represent the absent landowners. Consulting with a lawyer who is familiar with the local laws and practices can provide you with accurate information about the specific requirements and alternatives in your jurisdiction.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Divorce in High court",
    "answer": "Transfer Petition and Divorce Decree: A transfer petition in the high court typically requests the transfer of a case from one jurisdiction (such as your husband's hometown) to another jurisdiction (such as your hometown). The purpose of the transfer petition is to have the case heard in a more convenient or suitable location for one or both parties. The high court can decide whether to transfer the case or not based on the circumstances presented. However, it's important to note that the high court typically does not directly pass a divorce decree. Instead, it may transfer the case to the appropriate family court for further proceedings.Role of the Family Court: Once the case is transferred to the family court, it will be responsible for conducting the divorce proceedings and making a decision on the divorce. The family court will consider the evidence presented by both parties, listen to arguments, and issue a divorce decree if it determines that the grounds for divorce are met. The family court has the authority to decide on divorce matters unless there are specific circumstances where the high court may exercise jurisdiction.Withdrawal of Section 306 Case: Section 306 of theIndian Penal Codepertains to abetment of suicide. If you have filed a case under this section, it is a criminal case and separate from the divorce proceedings. Whether you can withdraw the case depends on various factors, including the stage of the case, the consent of the court, and the specific laws in your jurisdiction. It's advisable to consult with your criminal law attorney to understand the implications and procedures for withdrawing the case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Express the need to remove the entry from the Encumbrance Certificate (EC) and discuss the possibility of their cooperation. You may need to negotiate with them and potentially offer an incentive to encourage their cooperation.Serve a legal notice: If the tenant is uncooperative, you may need to serve them a legal notice requesting their presence for the cancellation of the agreement. Your lawyer can help you draft and serve this notice according to the relevant legal procedures.File a petition: If the tenant still refuses to cooperate, you may need to file a petition in a civil court to seek the cancellation of the agreement. Your lawyer can guide you through the necessary steps and represent you in court.Seek a court order: If the court finds in your favor, it can issue an order directing the registrar to remove the entry from the EC. This court order will then need to be submitted to the registrar's office for compliance.Disclose the situation to the potential buyer: It's important to be transparent with the potential buyer about the situation and inform them that you are actively working to resolve the issue.

    "question": "Divorce in High court",
    "answer": "Transfer Petition and Divorce Decree: A transfer petition in the high court typically requests the transfer of a case from one jurisdiction (such as your husband's hometown) to another jurisdiction (such as your hometown). The purpose of the transfer petition is to have the case heard in a more convenient or suitable location for one or both parties. The high court can decide whether to transfer the case or not based on the circumstances presented. However, it's important to note that the high court typically does not directly pass a divorce decree. Instead, it may transfer the case to the appropriate family court for further proceedings.Role of the Family Court: Once the case is transferred to the family court, it will be responsible for conducting the divorce proceedings and making a decision on the divorce. The family court will consider the evidence presented by both parties, listen to arguments, and issue a divorce decree if it determines that the grounds for divorce are met. The family court has the authority to decide on divorce matters unless there are specific circumstances where the high court may exercise jurisdiction.Withdrawal of Section 306 Case: Section 306 of theIndian Penal Codepertains to abetment of suicide. If you have filed a case under this section, it is a criminal case and separate from the divorce proceedings. Whether you can withdraw the case depends on various factors, including the stage of the case, the consent of the court, and the specific laws in your jurisdiction. It's advisable to consult with your criminal law attorney to understand the implications and procedures for withdrawing the case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "context": "Asked 2 years ago in Business Law",
    "question": "Money lending business",
    "answer": "You must know that in India, money lenders are governed by the Money Lenders Act in different states. The Tamil Nadu Government controls the money lending process in accordance with the Money Lenders Act, 1957. It is mandatory for every money lender to have a license. Even though getting a valid license under the Money Lending Act helps money lenders to carry on business lawfully and have legal recourse against the defaulters, one of the major reasons for non-registration is the ceiling on interest rate. Many lenders are not even aware about the requirement of such registration.Please note the following sections of Tamil Nadu Money Lenders Act:3. Money-lender to obtain licence.- (1) No person shall, on and after the date on which the provisions of this Act are brought into force in any area, carry on, or continue to carry on, business as a money-lender at any place in such area except under, and in accordance with, the terms of a licence.(2) Where a money-lender has more than one shop or place of business, whether in the same town or village or in different towns or villages, he shall obtain a separate licence in respect of each such shop or place of business.(3) (a) Where a money-lender is a registered firm, the licence shall be obtained in the firms name.(b) Where a money-lender is an undivided Hindu family, the licence shall be obtained in the name of the manager or the karnavan or the yajaman, as the case may be, described as such in the licence.(c) Where a money-lender is any other association of individuals, not required to be registered under the Companies Act, 1956 (Central Act 1 of 1956), a separate licence shall be obtained by each such individual in his name describing himself as a member of the association:Provided that nothing contained in this sub-section shall affect the operation of section 59 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 (Central Act IX of 1932).4. Grant and refusal of licence.- (1) Every application for a money-lenders licence shall be in writing and shall be made to the licensing authority prescribed under this Act:Provided that a person under the age of eighteen years shall be eligible to apply for a licence only through a guardian:Provided further that if any person acting as a guardian on behalf of a minor applies for, and obtains a licence under this Act, such guardian shall be subject to all the provisions of this Act as if the licence has been granted to himself.(2) Every licence shall be granted in such form and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed including conditions as to payment of licence fees not exceeding one hundred rupees.(3) The licensing authority may, by order in writing, refuse to grant a licence, if such authority is satisfied -(a) that the applicant has not complied with the provisions of this Act or the rules made thereunder in respect of an application for the grant of a licence; or(b) that the applicant has made wilful default in complying with, or knowingly acted in contravention of, any requirement of this Act; or(c) that the applicant has -(i) knowingly participated in or connived at any fraud or dishonesty in the conduct of, or in connection with, the business of money-lending; or(ii) been found guilty of an offence under Chapter XVII or Chapter XVIII of theIndian Penal Code(Central Act XLV of 1860); or(iii) been found guilty of an offence[under section 10-A or section 11]or section 13 on two or more occasions; or(d) that the applicant has had his licence cancelled within six months before the date of application.(4) Any person aggrieved by an order of the licensing authority under subsection (3) may, within one month from the date of communication of such order to him, appeal to the prescribed authority.(5) Every licence granted under this Act shall, subject to the provisions of sub-section (7), expire on the last day of the year in which it was granted.(6) A licence granted under sub-section (2) may be renewed from year to year and the provisions of sub-sections (1) to (5) shall apply in relation to the renewal of a licence as they apply in relation to the grant of a licence.(7) If orders refusing to renew a licence are not communicated to a moneylender by the licensing authority before the expiry of his current licence, the money-lender shall, notwithstanding such expiry, be deemed to have a valid licence till orders are received by him on his application for renewal.(8) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to disentitle a money-lender, whose licence has expired or has not been renewed, from taking steps to recover any loan advanced during the period when the licence was in force.Please note that an LLP has a separate legal entity under the law. A partnership firm has no separate legal status apart from its partners. The partner's liability of an LLP is limited to the extent of their capital contribution to the LLP. The partner's liability of a partnership firm has unlimited liability. Major advantages of LLP over partnership include separate legal entity, limited liability of partners, and the ability to purchase property in its own name. LLP or limited liability partnerships and general or traditional partnerships, both require a minimum of two individuals for their formation.

    "question": "Money lending business",
    "answer": "Individual Capacity: In some jurisdictions, individuals may be allowed to conduct money lending businesses in their individual capacity. However, specific licensing requirements and regulations may still apply.Money Lending License: Many jurisdictions require individuals or entities engaged in money lending activities to obtain a license or registration. The licensing requirements and procedures can differ from one jurisdiction to another. It's crucial to consult the laws and regulations of the specific state or region where the money lending business is intended to operate to determine whether a license is required.Cross-State Lending: If a person wants to lend money to individuals or companies in a different state, it's possible that additional licensing requirements may apply in the borrower's state. Some jurisdictions may require lenders to acquire licenses or fulfill specific criteria in the borrower's state as well. Again, it's important to consult with legal professionals who are well-versed in the laws and regulations of both the lender's and borrower's states to ensure compliance.Advantages and disadvantages of different business structures (individual, partnership firm, LLP, company) in money lending business:Individual: An individual conducting a money lending business may have simplicity in terms of decision-making and operations. However, they may bear unlimited personal liability for the debts and obligations of the business.Partnership Firm: A partnership firm allows for shared responsibilities, resources, and decision-making among partners. However, partners may also have unlimited personal liability for the partnership's debts and obligations.Limited Liability Partnership (LLP): An LLP provides limited liability protection to its partners, meaning their personal assets may be protected from business debts and obligations. It also offers flexibility in terms of management and tax advantages. However, LLPs may have additional compliance requirements and formalities compared to individual or partnership firms.Company: A company, such as a private limited company or a corporation, provides limited liability protection to its shareholders. It has a separate legal entity from its owners, and shareholders' personal assets are generally protected from business liabilities. However, companies may have more complex compliance requirements, legal formalities, and higher administrative costs.Tax implications on money lending business can vary based on the jurisdiction and the business structure. Tax laws and regulations related to money lending, such as interest income, deductions, and reporting requirements, can differ significantly. It's advisable to consult with tax professionals or accountants who can provide guidance specific to your jurisdiction and business structure.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Protecting possession in case of fraudulent sale deed",
    "answer": "Dear client,It is generally not permissible to file multiple suits on the same cause of action. If both suits involve the same cause of action and the same parties, the second suit may be stayed or consolidated with the first suit under Section 10 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC). You should discuss this matter with your lawyer, who can file the appropriate application to the court to request the stay of the second suit.The granting of a temporary injunction depends on various factors, including the merits of the case and the balance of convenience. If the other party can prove that there is a possibility of irreparable harm or loss if the injunction is not granted, they may be successful in obtaining temporary injunction relief. However, your lawyer will be in a better position to assess the strength of their argument and provide guidance on how to respond effectively.Possession can be established in various ways, and it is not always necessary for someone to be physically staying inside the house. However, having someone present at the property, even as a watchman or caretaker, can help demonstrate that you are in possession and taking steps to protect your property. You should discuss the best approach with your lawyer, taking into account the specific circumstances and risks involved.Blocking the front gate with a car may provide an additional physical barrier, but it's important to consider the legal implications and potential consequences. Blocking the gate could be seen as an obstruction, and it may not be advisable without proper legal authorization. It's best to consult with your lawyer to explore legal ways to protect your property.Remember, the information provided here is general in nature, and it's crucial to consult with a qualified property lawyer who can provide you with advice specific to your case.

    "question": "Protecting possession in case of fraudulent sale deed",
    "answer": "In general, when dealing with a criminal case, it's important to consider the potential consequences of any agreements or statements made to the police or other parties involved. If you agree to a settlement with the new buyers and provide a written statement indicating that you will withdraw the 156(3) case, it may have implications for your ability to pursue a criminal case in the future.By agreeing to a settlement, you may be effectively acknowledging that a resolution has been reached, and it could be difficult to later argue for the registration of an FIR if the new buyers fail to fulfill their part of the agreement. It may weaken your position in claiming that a criminal offense has taken place.Before making any decisions or providing any written statements, it is highly recommended to consult with your lawyer. They can review the specifics of your case, the proposed settlement, and provide advice on the potential consequences and risks involved. They can also guide you on how to protect your interests and ensure that your rights are safeguarded throughout the legal process.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "First set of queries:The presumption of summons being served may vary depending on the specific rules and procedures followed by the civil court in your jurisdiction. It's best to consult with your lawyer regarding this matter to understand the local rules and how they apply to your case.Again, the treatment of court vacation in relation to the filing of a written statement can depend on local rules and procedures. Typically, court vacations are excluded from the calculation of time limits. It's essential to consult with your lawyer to understand the specific rules applicable to your case.If you have already requested the relief of permanent injunction in your own suit, it may not be necessary to file a counterclaim for the same relief in their suit. Your lawyer can guide you on whether it's appropriate to include it as a counterclaim or if it should be pursued solely in your own suit.Whether to ask for consolidation of the suits or file a rejection of plaint application is a strategic decision that should be discussed with your lawyer. They will be familiar with the specific circumstances of your case and can advise you on the best course of action.Falsely stating facts in a suit can be a serious matter, but the decision to initiate a criminal case would depend on the specific laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. It's advisable to consult with your lawyer and possibly involve the police or appropriate authorities if there is evidence of fraudulent statements.Second set of queries:Once the FIR is lodged, it would be best to consult with your lawyer regarding the appropriate course of action. They can guide you on whether to inform the magistrate or file an application to withdraw the 156(3) application.The contents of the FIR should ideally include all relevant details and allegations. If you have suspicions or additional information that you believe is relevant, it's generally advisable to include them in your statement. Your lawyer can provide more specific guidance based on the laws and practices in your jurisdiction.Contacting the IO to provide your statement or inquire about the progress of the investigation may be a reasonable step. However, it's important to follow the guidance of your lawyer, who can advise you on the best way to proceed in your specific case.The status of arrests and the appropriate follow-up procedures can vary depending on the laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. Your lawyer would be the best person to guide you on the appropriate actions and who can provide updates on the progress of the case.Third set of queries:If you withdraw the 156(3) application after the FIR is registered, it may be possible to file a subsequent 156(3) application if you are dissatisfied with the police investigation. However, the availability and maintainability of such an application would depend on the specific laws and procedures in your jurisdiction.

    "question": "Divorce in High court",
    "answer": "Transfer Petition and Divorce Decree: A transfer petition in the high court typically requests the transfer of a case from one jurisdiction (such as your husband's hometown) to another jurisdiction (such as your hometown). The purpose of the transfer petition is to have the case heard in a more convenient or suitable location for one or both parties. The high court can decide whether to transfer the case or not based on the circumstances presented. However, it's important to note that the high court typically does not directly pass a divorce decree. Instead, it may transfer the case to the appropriate family court for further proceedings.Role of the Family Court: Once the case is transferred to the family court, it will be responsible for conducting the divorce proceedings and making a decision on the divorce. The family court will consider the evidence presented by both parties, listen to arguments, and issue a divorce decree if it determines that the grounds for divorce are met. The family court has the authority to decide on divorce matters unless there are specific circumstances where the high court may exercise jurisdiction.Withdrawal of Section 306 Case: Section 306 of theIndian Penal Codepertains to abetment of suicide. If you have filed a case under this section, it is a criminal case and separate from the divorce proceedings. Whether you can withdraw the case depends on various factors, including the stage of the case, the consent of the court, and the specific laws in your jurisdiction. It's advisable to consult with your criminal law attorney to understand the implications and procedures for withdrawing the case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Garbage collection happening in a place not approved in plan",
    "answer": "To determine whether you can obtain a legal stay against the enforcement of garbage selection by the association in a place that is not in the approved BDA/BBMP plan, it is advisable to consult with a local legal professional who specializes in property law or municipal law in Bangalore, Karnataka. They will be able to provide you with accurate and up-to-date advice based on the specific laws and regulations applicable in your jurisdiction.In general, the legality of the association's enforcement of garbage selection would depend on various factors, including the relevant local laws and regulations, the terms of any applicable property agreements or bylaws, and the authority granted to the association to enforce such measures. The approved BDA/BBMP plan may also play a role in determining the permissibility of certain activities in specific areas.A legal professional can review the relevant documents and advise you on whether the association's actions are lawful and whether you have grounds to seek a legal stay or challenge their enforcement. They will consider factors such as zoning regulations, health and sanitation laws, and any contractual obligations that may exist.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Protecting possession in case of fraudulent sale deed",
    "answer": "Dear client,It is generally not permissible to file multiple suits on the same cause of action. If both suits involve the same cause of action and the same parties, the second suit may be stayed or consolidated with the first suit under Section 10 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC). You should discuss this matter with your lawyer, who can file the appropriate application to the court to request the stay of the second suit.The granting of a temporary injunction depends on various factors, including the merits of the case and the balance of convenience. If the other party can prove that there is a possibility of irreparable harm or loss if the injunction is not granted, they may be successful in obtaining temporary injunction relief. However, your lawyer will be in a better position to assess the strength of their argument and provide guidance on how to respond effectively.Possession can be established in various ways, and it is not always necessary for someone to be physically staying inside the house. However, having someone present at the property, even as a watchman or caretaker, can help demonstrate that you are in possession and taking steps to protect your property. You should discuss the best approach with your lawyer, taking into account the specific circumstances and risks involved.Blocking the front gate with a car may provide an additional physical barrier, but it's important to consider the legal implications and potential consequences. Blocking the gate could be seen as an obstruction, and it may not be advisable without proper legal authorization. It's best to consult with your lawyer to explore legal ways to protect your property.Remember, the information provided here is general in nature, and it's crucial to consult with a qualified property lawyer who can provide you with advice specific to your case.

    "question": "Protecting possession in case of fraudulent sale deed",
    "answer": "In general, when dealing with a criminal case, it's important to consider the potential consequences of any agreements or statements made to the police or other parties involved. If you agree to a settlement with the new buyers and provide a written statement indicating that you will withdraw the 156(3) case, it may have implications for your ability to pursue a criminal case in the future.By agreeing to a settlement, you may be effectively acknowledging that a resolution has been reached, and it could be difficult to later argue for the registration of an FIR if the new buyers fail to fulfill their part of the agreement. It may weaken your position in claiming that a criminal offense has taken place.Before making any decisions or providing any written statements, it is highly recommended to consult with your lawyer. They can review the specifics of your case, the proposed settlement, and provide advice on the potential consequences and risks involved. They can also guide you on how to protect your interests and ensure that your rights are safeguarded throughout the legal process.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "First set of queries:The presumption of summons being served may vary depending on the specific rules and procedures followed by the civil court in your jurisdiction. It's best to consult with your lawyer regarding this matter to understand the local rules and how they apply to your case.Again, the treatment of court vacation in relation to the filing of a written statement can depend on local rules and procedures. Typically, court vacations are excluded from the calculation of time limits. It's essential to consult with your lawyer to understand the specific rules applicable to your case.If you have already requested the relief of permanent injunction in your own suit, it may not be necessary to file a counterclaim for the same relief in their suit. Your lawyer can guide you on whether it's appropriate to include it as a counterclaim or if it should be pursued solely in your own suit.Whether to ask for consolidation of the suits or file a rejection of plaint application is a strategic decision that should be discussed with your lawyer. They will be familiar with the specific circumstances of your case and can advise you on the best course of action.Falsely stating facts in a suit can be a serious matter, but the decision to initiate a criminal case would depend on the specific laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. It's advisable to consult with your lawyer and possibly involve the police or appropriate authorities if there is evidence of fraudulent statements.Second set of queries:Once the FIR is lodged, it would be best to consult with your lawyer regarding the appropriate course of action. They can guide you on whether to inform the magistrate or file an application to withdraw the 156(3) application.The contents of the FIR should ideally include all relevant details and allegations. If you have suspicions or additional information that you believe is relevant, it's generally advisable to include them in your statement. Your lawyer can provide more specific guidance based on the laws and practices in your jurisdiction.Contacting the IO to provide your statement or inquire about the progress of the investigation may be a reasonable step. However, it's important to follow the guidance of your lawyer, who can advise you on the best way to proceed in your specific case.The status of arrests and the appropriate follow-up procedures can vary depending on the laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. Your lawyer would be the best person to guide you on the appropriate actions and who can provide updates on the progress of the case.Third set of queries:If you withdraw the 156(3) application after the FIR is registered, it may be possible to file a subsequent 156(3) application if you are dissatisfied with the police investigation. However, the availability and maintainability of such an application would depend on the specific laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. Consulting with your lawyer is crucial in this situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Filing an application for injunction: If you are seeking peaceful entry and stay in your house, you may consider filing an application for an injunction under the Specific Relief Act, 1963. It is advisable to consult with a local lawyer who specializes in property law to determine the appropriate court to file the application. They can guide you on whether to approach the civil court or family court based on the specific circumstances and applicable laws in your jurisdiction.Filing the application yourself: It is possible to file the application yourself, especially if you are unable to afford legal representation. However, it is important to note that legal proceedings can be complex, and having a lawyer represent you can provide valuable expertise and guidance throughout the process. If you decide to proceed without a lawyer, it is recommended to thoroughly research the relevant laws, rules, and procedures governing injunction applications in your jurisdiction and ensure that you properly prepare and present your case.Possibility of a case under theDomestic ViolenceAct (DVA): The applicability of theDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005, would depend on the specific circumstances and evidence presented. Since I do not have all the details of your situation, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on the information you provided, it seems that there may not be a shared residence with your sister-in-law, which could be a relevant factor in determining the applicability of the DVA. It is advisable to consult with a local lawyer who can review the specific details of your case and provide accurate advice regarding the possibility of a case under the DVA.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Divorce in High court",
    "answer": "Transfer Petition and Divorce Decree: A transfer petition in the high court typically requests the transfer of a case from one jurisdiction (such as your husband's hometown) to another jurisdiction (such as your hometown). The purpose of the transfer petition is to have the case heard in a more convenient or suitable location for one or both parties. The high court can decide whether to transfer the case or not based on the circumstances presented. However, it's important to note that the high court typically does not directly pass a divorce decree. Instead, it may transfer the case to the appropriate family court for further proceedings.Role of the Family Court: Once the case is transferred to the family court, it will be responsible for conducting the divorce proceedings and making a decision on the divorce. The family court will consider the evidence presented by both parties, listen to arguments, and issue a divorce decree if it determines that the grounds for divorce are met. The family court has the authority to decide on divorce matters unless there are specific circumstances where the high court may exercise jurisdiction.Withdrawal of Section 306 Case: Section 306 of theIndian Penal Codepertains to abetment of suicide. If you have filed a case under this section, it is a criminal case and separate from the divorce proceedings. Whether you can withdraw the case depends on various factors, including the stage of the case, the consent of the court, and the specific laws in your jurisdiction. It's advisable to consult with your criminal law attorney to understand the implications and procedures for withdrawing the case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Protecting possession in case of fraudulent sale deed",
    "answer": "Dear client,It is generally not permissible to file multiple suits on the same cause of action. If both suits involve the same cause of action and the same parties, the second suit may be stayed or consolidated with the first suit under Section 10 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC). You should discuss this matter with your lawyer, who can file the appropriate application to the court to request the stay of the second suit.The granting of a temporary injunction depends on various factors, including the merits of the case and the balance of convenience. If the other party can prove that there is a possibility of irreparable harm or loss if the injunction is not granted, they may be successful in obtaining temporary injunction relief. However, your lawyer will be in a better position to assess the strength of their argument and provide guidance on how to respond effectively.Possession can be established in various ways, and it is not always necessary for someone to be physically staying inside the house. However, having someone present at the property, even as a watchman or caretaker, can help demonstrate that you are in possession and taking steps to protect your property. You should discuss the best approach with your lawyer, taking into account the specific circumstances and risks involved.Blocking the front gate with a car may provide an additional physical barrier, but it's important to consider the legal implications and potential consequences. Blocking the gate could be seen as an obstruction, and it may not be advisable without proper legal authorization. It's best to consult with your lawyer to explore legal ways to protect your property.Remember, the information provided here is general in nature, and it's crucial to consult with a qualified property lawyer who can provide you with advice specific to your case.

    "question": "Protecting possession in case of fraudulent sale deed",
    "answer": "In general, when dealing with a criminal case, it's important to consider the potential consequences of any agreements or statements made to the police or other parties involved. If you agree to a settlement with the new buyers and provide a written statement indicating that you will withdraw the 156(3) case, it may have implications for your ability to pursue a criminal case in the future.By agreeing to a settlement, you may be effectively acknowledging that a resolution has been reached, and it could be difficult to later argue for the registration of an FIR if the new buyers fail to fulfill their part of the agreement. It may weaken your position in claiming that a criminal offense has taken place.Before making any decisions or providing any written statements, it is highly recommended to consult with your lawyer. They can review the specifics of your case, the proposed settlement, and provide advice on the potential consequences and risks involved. They can also guide you on how to protect your interests and ensure that your rights are safeguarded throughout the legal process.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "First set of queries:The presumption of summons being served may vary depending on the specific rules and procedures followed by the civil court in your jurisdiction. It's best to consult with your lawyer regarding this matter to understand the local rules and how they apply to your case.Again, the treatment of court vacation in relation to the filing of a written statement can depend on local rules and procedures. Typically, court vacations are excluded from the calculation of time limits. It's essential to consult with your lawyer to understand the specific rules applicable to your case.If you have already requested the relief of permanent injunction in your own suit, it may not be necessary to file a counterclaim for the same relief in their suit. Your lawyer can guide you on whether it's appropriate to include it as a counterclaim or if it should be pursued solely in your own suit.Whether to ask for consolidation of the suits or file a rejection of plaint application is a strategic decision that should be discussed with your lawyer. They will be familiar with the specific circumstances of your case and can advise you on the best course of action.Falsely stating facts in a suit can be a serious matter, but the decision to initiate a criminal case would depend on the specific laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. It's advisable to consult with your lawyer and possibly involve the police or appropriate authorities if there is evidence of fraudulent statements.Second set of queries:Once the FIR is lodged, it would be best to consult with your lawyer regarding the appropriate course of action. They can guide you on whether to inform the magistrate or file an application to withdraw the 156(3) application.The contents of the FIR should ideally include all relevant details and allegations. If you have suspicions or additional information that you believe is relevant, it's generally advisable to include them in your statement. Your lawyer can provide more specific guidance based on the laws and practices in your jurisdiction.Contacting the IO to provide your statement or inquire about the progress of the investigation may be a reasonable step. However, it's important to follow the guidance of your lawyer, who can advise you on the best way to proceed in your specific case.The status of arrests and the appropriate follow-up procedures can vary depending on the laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. Your lawyer would be the best person to guide you on the appropriate actions and who can provide updates on the progress of the case.Third set of queries:If you withdraw the 156(3) application after the FIR is registered, it may be possible to file a subsequent 156(3) application if you are dissatisfied with the police investigation. However, the availability and maintainability of such an application would depend on the specific laws and procedures in your jurisdiction.

    "answer": "Filing an application for injunction: If you are seeking peaceful entry and stay in your house, you may consider filing an application for an injunction under the Specific Relief Act, 1963. It is advisable to consult with a local lawyer who specializes in property law to determine the appropriate court to file the application. They can guide you on whether to approach the civil court or family court based on the specific circumstances and applicable laws in your jurisdiction.Filing the application yourself: It is possible to file the application yourself, especially if you are unable to afford legal representation. However, it is important to note that legal proceedings can be complex, and having a lawyer represent you can provide valuable expertise and guidance throughout the process. If you decide to proceed without a lawyer, it is recommended to thoroughly research the relevant laws, rules, and procedures governing injunction applications in your jurisdiction and ensure that you properly prepare and present your case.Possibility of a case under theDomestic ViolenceAct (DVA): The applicability of theDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005, would depend on the specific circumstances and evidence presented. Since I do not have all the details of your situation, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on the information you provided, it seems that there may not be a shared residence with your sister-in-law, which could be a relevant factor in determining the applicability of the DVA. It is advisable to consult with a local lawyer who can review the specific details of your case and provide accurate advice regarding the possibility of a case under the DVA.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The approved BDA/BBMP plan may also play a role in determining the permissibility of certain activities in specific areas.A legal professional can review the relevant documents and advise you on whether the association's actions are lawful and whether you have grounds to seek a legal stay or challenge their enforcement.

    "question": "NRI sponsorship for college admission",
    "answer": "When you sign an undertaking to bear the entire expenditure of your nephew's studies, it is considered a legal contract between you and the university. Generally, contracts are enforceable, and if you fail to fulfill your obligations under the contract, the other party (in this case, the university) may have legal recourse.If you are unable to continue paying for the entire duration of the course, it may depend on the specific terms and conditions mentioned in the undertaking. If the undertaking does not specify any consequences for non-payment or breach of contract, it may be challenging for the university to pursue legal action against you or your assets.However, if the undertaking explicitly states that you will be liable for the entire course expenditure and does not provide any provisions for discontinuation or inability to pay, the university may potentially pursue legal action to recover the unpaid fees. In such cases, it's important to carefully review the specific terms and conditions of the undertaking to understand the potential consequences.Regarding the scenario where the student himself quits the course or is unable to complete or pass the exams, it would depend on the specific terms mentioned in the undertaking. If the undertaking only holds you responsible for the payment of fees, and there are no provisions regarding the student's performance or completion of the course, it may not affect your legal liability. However, it's crucial to review the terms of the undertaking to determine the exact obligations and responsibilities outlined.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "To obtain a property evaluation certificate for the purpose of calculating capital gains and potential tax benefits for your sister (a U.S. citizen) in India, it is advisable to consult with a qualified property valuer or a professional property appraisal firm. They will have the necessary expertise and resources to conduct a proper evaluation of the property and provide an official valuation certificate.The property evaluation certificate should ideally be prepared by a licensed and registered property valuer who is recognized by the government authorities. The certificate should include details such as the property's market value as of April 1, 2001, which is often used as a reference date for determining capital gains in India. The valuation certificate should be comprehensive and provide supporting documentation and justification for the determined property value.The certificate does not necessarily need to bear the seal and signature of the sub-registrar. However, it should be prepared by a qualified professional with expertise in property valuation and comply with the relevant standards and regulations.The cost of obtaining a property valuation certificate can vary depending on various factors such as the location, size, and complexity of the property, as well as the service provider's fees. It is recommended to contact different property valuation firms or professionals in your area to inquire about their fees and obtain quotes for their services.While a Chartered Accountant (CA) may be able to assist with certain financial calculations and tax matters, it is typically the role of a property valuer or appraiser to provide an official valuation certificate.

    "answer": "1. Registration in favor of the legal heirs of the deceased is not necessary, but if necessary you can get it mutated to all your names jointly in order to sell the property by executing a  sale deed jointly in favor of the prospective buyer.2. As the property has not been partitioned among all the legal heirs by a registered document, the mutually agreed division, if it was made by an unregistered deed, is not legally valid, besides the second floor was constructed by you without a permission or consent of your father or other legal heirs, hence if the others claim a share out of that floor also, you may have to move court to declare the title to your name based on the evidence, otherwise the sale consideration of that floor also shall have to eb divided among all the legal heirs, hence it is advisable that all the legal heirs may decide about sharing the sale consideration  amount mutually in an amicable manner..3. LTCG is different from that of the exemption claimed, if you would like to invest the LTCG in your wife's property then you can claim exemption. Relief on capital gains tax is available when LTCG is reinvested in the name of the spouse.4. Even though you constructed the second floor out of your own funds, but you do not own the land underneath, hence you cannot claim title to the property owned by your father.In the given situation if your cosharers claim a share in that property too, then you may have to amicably settle the issue instead of stretching it to legal solutions.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

For the second question:This can be done either way:a. You can do a single sale agreement where every brother has to sign the document and therefore, money will be distributed accordingly.b. You can make a Special Power of Attorney (SPA)and give it to one of the brother. This SPA gives power to one of the brother to sell off the property and accordingly distribute the money.

    "question": "Selling property of deceased father",
    "answer": "Transfer of ownership: Since your father passed away without a will, the property would generally be inherited by all his legal heirs, which includes you and your brothers. It is advisable to get the property registered or mutated in the names of all the legal heirs before proceeding with the sale. This will establish clear ownership and avoid any future disputes.Distribution of sale proceeds: If all the brothers are owners of the property, the sale proceeds should ideally be divided equally among the legal heirs, unless there is a mutual agreement specifying a different distribution. It is recommended to have a clear written agreement among all the brothers regarding the division of proceeds to avoid any conflicts.Adding spouses' names: From a legal perspective, it is possible to add the names of the respective wives in the sale agreement. However, it is important to consult with a lawyer to understand the implications and tax considerations involved in such a transaction, including the applicability of Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax.Division of the plot: If you have constructed the second floor using a bank loan, it does not necessarily mean that the plot itself will be divided. The division of the plot would depend on the legal provisions and any specific agreements or arrangements made among the brothers. It is advisable to consult with a lawyer to understand the specific laws and regulations governing property division in your jurisdiction.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Selling property of deceased father",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the absence of a will, the property is typically divided according to the laws of intestate succession. This could mean that the property is equally divided among the legal heirs, which would include you and your brothers. However, if there was a mutual agreement dividing the property amongst the brothers, that agreement could potentially supersede the default rules of intestate succession. If you obtained a bank loan and built the second floor with the consent or knowledge of your father and brothers, you have a stronger claim to ownership of the second floor. However, the specifics of any agreements or understandings among the family members would be crucial in determining your rights. The valuation of the property will play a significant role in determining how compensation should be divided. If the valuation distinguishes between the land and the structures (i.e., the ground floor and the second floor), then it may be reasonable to allocate compensation accordingly.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Protecting possession in case of fraudulent sale deed",
    "answer": "Dear client,It is generally not permissible to file multiple suits on the same cause of action. If both suits involve the same cause of action and the same parties, the second suit may be stayed or consolidated with the first suit under Section 10 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC). You should discuss this matter with your lawyer, who can file the appropriate application to the court to request the stay of the second suit.The granting of a temporary injunction depends on various factors, including the merits of the case and the balance of convenience. If the other party can prove that there is a possibility of irreparable harm or loss if the injunction is not granted, they may be successful in obtaining temporary injunction relief. However, your lawyer will be in a better position to assess the strength of their argument and provide guidance on how to respond effectively.Possession can be established in various ways, and it is not always necessary for someone to be physically staying inside the house. However, having someone present at the property, even as a watchman or caretaker, can help demonstrate that you are in possession and taking steps to protect your property. You should discuss the best approach with your lawyer, taking into account the specific circumstances and risks involved.Blocking the front gate with a car may provide an additional physical barrier, but it's important to consider the legal implications and potential consequences. Blocking the gate could be seen as an obstruction, and it may not be advisable without proper legal authorization. It's best to consult with your lawyer to explore legal ways to protect your property.Remember, the information provided here is general in nature, and it's crucial to consult with a qualified property lawyer who can provide you with advice specific to your case.

    "question": "Protecting possession in case of fraudulent sale deed",
    "answer": "In general, when dealing with a criminal case, it's important to consider the potential consequences of any agreements or statements made to the police or other parties involved. If you agree to a settlement with the new buyers and provide a written statement indicating that you will withdraw the 156(3) case, it may have implications for your ability to pursue a criminal case in the future.By agreeing to a settlement, you may be effectively acknowledging that a resolution has been reached, and it could be difficult to later argue for the registration of an FIR if the new buyers fail to fulfill their part of the agreement. It may weaken your position in claiming that a criminal offense has taken place.Before making any decisions or providing any written statements, it is highly recommended to consult with your lawyer. They can review the specifics of your case, the proposed settlement, and provide advice on the potential consequences and risks involved. They can also guide you on how to protect your interests and ensure that your rights are safeguarded throughout the legal process.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It's best to consult with your lawyer regarding this matter to understand the local rules and how they apply to your case.Again, the treatment of court vacation in relation to the filing of a written statement can depend on local rules and procedures. Typically, court vacations are excluded from the calculation of time limits. It's essential to consult with your lawyer to understand the specific rules applicable to your case.If you have already requested the relief of permanent injunction in your own suit, it may not be necessary to file a counterclaim for the same relief in their suit. Your lawyer can guide you on whether it's appropriate to include it as a counterclaim or if it should be pursued solely in your own suit.Whether to ask for consolidation of the suits or file a rejection of plaint application is a strategic decision that should be discussed with your lawyer. They will be familiar with the specific circumstances of your case and can advise you on the best course of action.Falsely stating facts in a suit can be a serious matter, but the decision to initiate a criminal case would depend on the specific laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. It's advisable to consult with your lawyer and possibly involve the police or appropriate authorities if there is evidence of fraudulent statements.Second set of queries:Once the FIR is lodged, it would be best to consult with your lawyer regarding the appropriate course of action. They can guide you on whether to inform the magistrate or file an application to withdraw the 156(3) application.The contents of the FIR should ideally include all relevant details and allegations. If you have suspicions or additional information that you believe is relevant, it's generally advisable to include them in your statement. Your lawyer can provide more specific guidance based on the laws and practices in your jurisdiction.Contacting the IO to provide your statement or inquire about the progress of the investigation may be a reasonable step. However, it's important to follow the guidance of your lawyer, who can advise you on the best way to proceed in your specific case.The status of arrests and the appropriate follow-up procedures can vary depending on the laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. Your lawyer would be the best person to guide you on the appropriate actions and who can provide updates on the progress of the case.Third set of queries:If you withdraw the 156(3) application after the FIR is registered, it may be possible to file a subsequent 156(3) application if you are dissatisfied with the police investigation. However, the availability and maintainability of such an application would depend on the specific laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. Consulting with your lawyer is crucial in this situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

As the property has not been partitioned among all the legal heirs by a registered document, the mutually agreed division, if it was made by an unregistered deed, is not legally valid, besides the second floor was constructed by you without a permission or consent of your father or other legal heirs, hence if the others claim a share out of that floor also, you may have to move court to declare the title to your name based on the evidence, otherwise the sale consideration of that floor also shall have to eb divided among all the legal heirs, hence it is advisable that all the legal heirs may decide about sharing the sale consideration  amount mutually in an amicable manner..3.

    "answer": "- As per law, the government cannot acquire any private land without sending a notice to the owner of the land and also without publishing the proposal in the two news papers, if the notice not served upon the owner.- Further, without deciding the compensation and paying the same, the government department cannot take possession of the land for the specified purposes like construction of road etc.- As per the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Bill, 2007, the payment for acquired land must be made within one year from the date of the declaration, and the Collector can extend this time limit by six months with a penalty of 5% per month, and further if payment has not been made within one year nor has the Collector granted an extension, the land acquisition proceedings shall lapse.- Further, after the compensation amount is determined, the Collector must ensure that payment occurs within 60 days. Possession of land shall not be taken unless full compensation is paid or tendered to the land owner.- Further, the land owners whose property has been acquired under urgency shall be compensated an additional 75% of the market value of the land.- If your land has taken without your consent and without paying /deciding the compensation, then you should file a written complaint with the Collector.- Further, the Collector is bound to resolve the issue 15 days from the receipt of the complaint, and if the Collector fails to act, then you can direct complaint with the authority which has taken the land for road construction.- Hence you are entitled to get 75% more than the market value of the said land acquired by the government.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

The determination of equivalent compensation can be difficult, particularly when land markets are weak or do not exist, when land is held communally, or when people have only rights to use the land. Many factors can lead to inadequate compensation.During the valuation phase, the acquiring agency and the people whose land is being acquired gather information and evidence to support their arguments for the compensation values they believe to be equitable. This work is triggered by the notice of intention to compulsorily acquire land. The notice of intention should set a deadline by which each affected owner or occupant submits a claim for compensation.Owners and occupants are given the chance to contest the compulsory acquisition, including the decision to acquire the land, the process by which the land was acquired, and the amount of compensation offeredT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

Possession of land shall not be taken unless full compensation is paid or tendered to the land owner.- Further, the land owners whose property has been acquired under urgency shall be compensated an additional 75% of the market value of the land.- If your land has taken without your consent and without paying /deciding the compensation, then you should file a written complaint with the Collector.- Further, the Collector is bound to resolve the issue 15 days from the receipt of the complaint, and if the Collector fails to act, then you can direct complaint with the authority which has taken the land for road construction.- Hence you are entitled to get 75% more than the market value of the said land acquired by the government.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Divide construction property",
    "answer": "Dear client, below I have provided some important information.Dividing the property equally: To divide the property equally among the three brothers, you have a few options.a) Partition Deed: A partition deed is a legal document that allows for the division of jointly owned property. It can be used to allocate specific portions of the property to each brother, specifying their respective rights and responsibilities. This can be a tax-efficient solution as it ensures each brother receives his fair share without additional tax implications.b) Will: If your mother is willing, she can draft a will that clearly states her intentions to divide the property equally among her three sons. However, it's important to consider the potential tax implications of inheriting the property through a will, as inheritance tax laws vary by jurisdiction.c) Registration of individual floors: Another option could be to register each floor or apartment in the name of each brother individually. This would provide individual ownership and may simplify the process of selling individual units in the future. However, it's crucial to consult with a local attorney to understand the legal and tax implications of this option.Selling the property in the future: If you wish to sell the property in the future, the method of sale would depend on how the property was divided among the brothers.If a partition deed was executed, each brother would have a specified portion of the property in his name, allowing for independent sale of their respective portions.If the property was divided through a will, the property would pass to the brothers as per the terms of the will. To sell the property, the brothers would need to follow the legal procedures and requirements for selling inherited property.If individual floors were registered in each brother's name, they would have independent ownership, and selling their respective units would be similar to selling any other individual property.In any case, it is advisable to consult with a local attorney to understand the specific legal requirements and procedures for selling property in your jurisdiction.Stilt parking and roof rights: To address the issue of stilt parking and roof rights, it would be advisable to have a clear agreement or documentation that outlines the rights and responsibilities of each brother. This agreement could specify the allocated parking spaces for each unit and any restrictions or guidelines for the use of the roof area. Having a legally binding agreement can help prevent conflicts in the future and ensure that everyone understands their rights and obligations.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The determination of equivalent compensation can be difficult, particularly when land markets are weak or do not exist, when land is held communally, or when people have only rights to use the land. Many factors can lead to inadequate compensation.During the valuation phase, the acquiring agency and the people whose land is being acquired gather information and evidence to support their arguments for the compensation values they believe to be equitable. This work is triggered by the notice of intention to compulsorily acquire land. The notice of intention should set a deadline by which each affected owner or occupant submits a claim for compensation.Owners and occupants are given the chance to contest the compulsory acquisition, including the decision to acquire the land, the process by which the land was acquired, and the amount of compensation offeredT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Land acquisition for road",
    "answer": "Under the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (RFCTLARR Act), if your land is being acquired by the government for public purposes, including the construction of roads, you are entitled to fair compensation and rehabilitation and resettlement benefits.To claim compensation for the acquisition of your land, you would need to follow the process outlined in the RFCTLARR Act. Here are the general steps involved:Notification: The government will issue a notification declaring its intention to acquire the land. This notification will include details of the land and the purpose of acquisition.Social Impact Assessment (SIA): The government will conduct a Social Impact Assessment to assess the impact of the acquisition on the affected persons and determine the extent of compensation and rehabilitation measures required.Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R) Plan: Based on the SIA, the government will prepare a Rehabilitation and Resettlement Plan, which outlines the measures and benefits that will be provided to the affected persons.Hearing and objections: You will have the opportunity to present your objections to the acquisition and the proposed compensation and rehabilitation measures at a hearing conducted by the relevant authorities.Award: After considering the objections, the government will issue an award specifying the compensation amount and the rehabilitation and resettlement benefits that you are entitled to receive.Compensation payment: The compensation amount will be determined based on the market value of the land. The RFCTLARR Act requires that the compensation amount should not be less than the market value, and it may include additional amounts for other losses, such as the value of structures and trees on the land. The compensation is generally paid in cash, through a cheque or direct bank transfer.Regarding the difference between the Guideline Value and Market Value, it is important to note that the compensation is generally based on the market value of the land. The market value represents the prevailing rates at which similar properties are being transacted in the area. The compensation amount should be determined based on a proper assessment of the market value.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Land acquisition for road",
    "answer": "- As per law, the government cannot acquire any private land without sending a notice to the owner of the land and also without publishing the proposal in the two news papers, if the notice not served upon the owner.- Further, without deciding the compensation and paying the same, the government department cannot take possession of the land for the specified purposes like construction of road etc.- As per the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Bill, 2007, the payment for acquired land must be made within one year from the date of the declaration, and the Collector can extend this time limit by six months with a penalty of 5% per month, and further if payment has not been made within one year nor has the Collector granted an extension, the land acquisition proceedings shall lapse.- Further, after the compensation amount is determined, the Collector must ensure that payment occurs within 60 days. Possession of land shall not be taken unless full compensation is paid or tendered to the land owner.- Further, the land owners whose property has been acquired under urgency shall be compensated an additional 75% of the market value of the land.- If your land has taken without your consent and without paying /deciding the compensation, then you should file a written complaint with the Collector.- Further, the Collector is bound to resolve the issue 15 days from the receipt of the complaint, and if the Collector fails to act, then you can direct complaint with the authority which has taken the land for road construction.- Hence you are entitled to get 75% more than the market value of the said land acquired by the government.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Land acquisition for road",
    "answer": "The calculation of compensation is based on the value of the land rights and improvements to the land, and on any related costs. The determination of equivalent compensation can be difficult, particularly when land markets are weak or do not exist, when land is held communally, or when people have only rights to use the land. Many factors can lead to inadequate compensation.During the valuation phase, the acquiring agency and the people whose land is being acquired gather information and evidence to support their arguments for the compensation values they believe to be equitable. This work is triggered by the notice of intention to compulsorily acquire land. The notice of intention should set a deadline by which each affected owner or occupant submits a claim for compensation.Owners and occupants are given the chance to contest the compulsory acquisition, including the decision to acquire the land, the process by which the land was acquired, and the amount of compensation offeredT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Land acquisition for road",
    "answer": "Under the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (RFCTLARR Act), if your land is being acquired by the government for public purposes, including the construction of roads, you are entitled to fair compensation and rehabilitation and resettlement benefits.To claim compensation for the acquisition of your land, you would need to follow the process outlined in the RFCTLARR Act. Here are the general steps involved:Notification: The government will issue a notification declaring its intention to acquire the land. This notification will include details of the land and the purpose of acquisition.Social Impact Assessment (SIA): The government will conduct a Social Impact Assessment to assess the impact of the acquisition on the affected persons and determine the extent of compensation and rehabilitation measures required.Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R) Plan: Based on the SIA, the government will prepare a Rehabilitation and Resettlement Plan, which outlines the measures and benefits that will be provided to the affected persons.Hearing and objections: You will have the opportunity to present your objections to the acquisition and the proposed compensation and rehabilitation measures at a hearing conducted by the relevant authorities.Award: After considering the objections, the government will issue an award specifying the compensation amount and the rehabilitation and resettlement benefits that you are entitled to receive.Compensation payment: The compensation amount will be determined based on the market value of the land. The RFCTLARR Act requires that the compensation amount should not be less than the market value, and it may include additional amounts for other losses, such as the value of structures and trees on the land. The compensation is generally paid in cash, through a cheque or direct bank transfer.Regarding the difference between the Guideline Value and Market Value, it is important to note that the compensation is generally based on the market value of the land. The market value represents the prevailing rates at which similar properties are being transacted in the area. The compensation amount should be determined based on a proper assessment of the market value.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Requesting the Judge to dispose of the first DV case: If you believe that the case has been pending for an extended period and there has been no progress, you can discuss the matter with your lawyer. They can advise you on the appropriate steps to request the court to dispose of the case or expedite the proceedings. This may involve filing an application or petition with the court, explaining the reasons for seeking a prompt resolution.Filing two DV cases: Generally, it is possible for a person to file multiple cases under the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005, if they allege different incidents or instances ofdomestic violence. However, it is important to note that the specific provisions of the law and the legal requirements may vary depending on your jurisdiction. It would be best to consult with your lawyer to understand the applicable laws and regulations in your situation.Requesting the Judge to dispose of the second DV case: Similar to the first case, if you believe that the second DV case is duplicative or lacks merit, you can discuss this concern with your lawyer. They can guide you on the appropriate legal steps to address the issue. This may involve requesting the court to dismiss the second case or consolidate it with the first case, depending on the circumstances.Filing a misconduct case against the prosecution attorney: If you believe that the prosecution attorney has acted unethically or inappropriately, you may consider filing a complaint with the appropriate Bar Council or legal authority in your jurisdiction.

Generally, if your husband can establish valid grounds for divorce under the applicable laws, such as irretrievable breakdown of the marriage, cruelty, or other legally recognized grounds, he may have a reasonable chance of obtaining a divorce.

It's crucial to carefully review the terms and implications of the proposed agreement and consider seeking legal advice to ensure it aligns with your interests and protects your rights.Procedure for presenting the agreement: The procedure for presenting the agreement may vary depending on the court rules and practices in your jurisdiction. It's generally advisable to work with your lawyer to draft the agreement accurately, including all necessary terms and signatures. They can guide you on the specific procedure for submitting the agreement to the court, which may involve filing it with the appropriate court clerk, serving copies to the other party, and potentially presenting it during the next hearing.Duration of the case: The duration of the case and whether there will be another hearing can depend on various factors, such as the complexity of the case, the court's schedule, and any potential disputes or disagreements that may arise. It's difficult to predict with certainty whether the case will conclude on the same day or require additional hearings.

    "question": "Money lending business",
    "answer": "You must know that in India, money lenders are governed by the Money Lenders Act in different states. The Tamil Nadu Government controls the money lending process in accordance with the Money Lenders Act, 1957. It is mandatory for every money lender to have a license. Even though getting a valid license under the Money Lending Act helps money lenders to carry on business lawfully and have legal recourse against the defaulters, one of the major reasons for non-registration is the ceiling on interest rate. Many lenders are not even aware about the requirement of such registration.Please note the following sections of Tamil Nadu Money Lenders Act:3. Money-lender to obtain licence.- (1) No person shall, on and after the date on which the provisions of this Act are brought into force in any area, carry on, or continue to carry on, business as a money-lender at any place in such area except under, and in accordance with, the terms of a licence.(2) Where a money-lender has more than one shop or place of business, whether in the same town or village or in different towns or villages, he shall obtain a separate licence in respect of each such shop or place of business.(3) (a) Where a money-lender is a registered firm, the licence shall be obtained in the firms name.(b) Where a money-lender is an undivided Hindu family, the licence shall be obtained in the name of the manager or the karnavan or the yajaman, as the case may be, described as such in the licence.(c) Where a money-lender is any other association of individuals, not required to be registered under the Companies Act, 1956 (Central Act 1 of 1956), a separate licence shall be obtained by each such individual in his name describing himself as a member of the association:Provided that nothing contained in this sub-section shall affect the operation of section 59 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 (Central Act IX of 1932).4. Grant and refusal of licence.- (1) Every application for a money-lenders licence shall be in writing and shall be made to the licensing authority prescribed under this Act:Provided that a person under the age of eighteen years shall be eligible to apply for a licence only through a guardian:Provided further that if any person acting as a guardian on behalf of a minor applies for, and obtains a licence under this Act, such guardian shall be subject to all the provisions of this Act as if the licence has been granted to himself.(2) Every licence shall be granted in such form and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed including conditions as to payment of licence fees not exceeding one hundred rupees.(3) The licensing authority may, by order in writing, refuse to grant a licence, if such authority is satisfied -(a) that the applicant has not complied with the provisions of this Act or the rules made thereunder in respect of an application for the grant of a licence; or(b) that the applicant has made wilful default in complying with, or knowingly acted in contravention of, any requirement of this Act; or(c) that the applicant has -(i) knowingly participated in or connived at any fraud or dishonesty in the conduct of, or in connection with, the business of money-lending; or(ii) been found guilty of an offence under Chapter XVII or Chapter XVIII of theIndian Penal Code(Central Act XLV of 1860); or(iii) been found guilty of an offence[under section 10-A or section 11]or section 13 on two or more occasions; or(d) that the applicant has had his licence cancelled within six months before the date of application.(4) Any person aggrieved by an order of the licensing authority under subsection (3) may, within one month from the date of communication of such order to him, appeal to the prescribed authority.(5) Every licence granted under this Act shall, subject to the provisions of sub-section (7), expire on the last day of the year in which it was granted.(6) A licence granted under sub-section (2) may be renewed from year to year and the provisions of sub-sections (1) to (5) shall apply in relation to the renewal of a licence as they apply in relation to the grant of a licence.(7) If orders refusing to renew a licence are not communicated to a moneylender by the licensing authority before the expiry of his current licence, the money-lender shall, notwithstanding such expiry, be deemed to have a valid licence till orders are received by him on his application for renewal.(8) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to disentitle a money-lender, whose licence has expired or has not been renewed, from taking steps to recover any loan advanced during the period when the licence was in force.Please note that an LLP has a separate legal entity under the law. A partnership firm has no separate legal status apart from its partners. The partner's liability of an LLP is limited to the extent of their capital contribution to the LLP. The partner's liability of a partnership firm has unlimited liability. Major advantages of LLP over partnership include separate legal entity, limited liability of partners, and the ability to purchase property in its own name. LLP or limited liability partnerships and general or traditional partnerships, both require a minimum of two individuals for their formation. Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete facts and documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on Record & Amicus CuriaeSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "question": "Money lending business",
    "answer": "Individual Capacity: In some jurisdictions, individuals may be allowed to conduct money lending businesses in their individual capacity. However, specific licensing requirements and regulations may still apply.Money Lending License: Many jurisdictions require individuals or entities engaged in money lending activities to obtain a license or registration. The licensing requirements and procedures can differ from one jurisdiction to another. It's crucial to consult the laws and regulations of the specific state or region where the money lending business is intended to operate to determine whether a license is required.Cross-State Lending: If a person wants to lend money to individuals or companies in a different state, it's possible that additional licensing requirements may apply in the borrower's state. Some jurisdictions may require lenders to acquire licenses or fulfill specific criteria in the borrower's state as well. Again, it's important to consult with legal professionals who are well-versed in the laws and regulations of both the lender's and borrower's states to ensure compliance.Advantages and disadvantages of different business structures (individual, partnership firm, LLP, company) in money lending business:Individual: An individual conducting a money lending business may have simplicity in terms of decision-making and operations. However, they may bear unlimited personal liability for the debts and obligations of the business.Partnership Firm: A partnership firm allows for shared responsibilities, resources, and decision-making among partners. However, partners may also have unlimited personal liability for the partnership's debts and obligations.Limited Liability Partnership (LLP): An LLP provides limited liability protection to its partners, meaning their personal assets may be protected from business debts and obligations. It also offers flexibility in terms of management and tax advantages. However, LLPs may have additional compliance requirements and formalities compared to individual or partnership firms.Company: A company, such as a private limited company or a corporation, provides limited liability protection to its shareholders. It has a separate legal entity from its owners, and shareholders' personal assets are generally protected from business liabilities. However, companies may have more complex compliance requirements, legal formalities, and higher administrative costs.Tax implications on money lending business can vary based on the jurisdiction and the business structure. Tax laws and regulations related to money lending, such as interest income, deductions, and reporting requirements, can differ significantly. It's advisable to consult with tax professionals or accountants who can provide guidance specific to your jurisdiction and business structure.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "In general, when purchasing property, it is advisable to conduct a thorough due diligence process to ensure that the title is clear and marketable. This typically involves reviewing the chain of ownership, verifying the authenticity of documents, and ensuring that all necessary legal requirements have been fulfilled.Regarding your specific questions:Q1) Whether Mrs. E should be included as a party in the sale deed would depend on the ownership rights she holds in the property. If she has a legal share in the property, it may be necessary to include her as a party to the transaction. However, if she does not have any ownership rights, it may not be required. A lawyer can provide guidance based on the applicable laws and the specific circumstances.Q2) The inclusion of the grandchildren as sellers/vendors would depend on their ownership rights and the laws governing the transfer of property in your jurisdiction. If the grandchildren have a legal share in the property, they may need to be included as parties to the transaction. However, if they do not have ownership rights or if they are minors, their participation may not be necessary or possible. Again, consulting with a lawyer will help clarify the requirements in your specific case.Regarding the potential for future legal challenges based on ancestral property rights, it is important to consider the relevant laws and regulations in your jurisdiction. In some cases, there may be laws that provide for inheritance rights or ancestral property rights, which could potentially be invoked by the grandchildren in the future. Consulting with a lawyer who is familiar with the local property and inheritance laws will help you understand the potential risks and take appropriate measures to mitigate them.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "context": "Asked 2 years ago in Business Law",
    "question": "Money lending business",
    "answer": "You must know that in India, money lenders are governed by the Money Lenders Act in different states. The Tamil Nadu Government controls the money lending process in accordance with the Money Lenders Act, 1957. It is mandatory for every money lender to have a license. Even though getting a valid license under the Money Lending Act helps money lenders to carry on business lawfully and have legal recourse against the defaulters, one of the major reasons for non-registration is the ceiling on interest rate. Many lenders are not even aware about the requirement of such registration.Please note the following sections of Tamil Nadu Money Lenders Act:3. Money-lender to obtain licence.- (1) No person shall, on and after the date on which the provisions of this Act are brought into force in any area, carry on, or continue to carry on, business as a money-lender at any place in such area except under, and in accordance with, the terms of a licence.(2) Where a money-lender has more than one shop or place of business, whether in the same town or village or in different towns or villages, he shall obtain a separate licence in respect of each such shop or place of business.(3) (a) Where a money-lender is a registered firm, the licence shall be obtained in the firms name.(b) Where a money-lender is an undivided Hindu family, the licence shall be obtained in the name of the manager or the karnavan or the yajaman, as the case may be, described as such in the licence.(c) Where a money-lender is any other association of individuals, not required to be registered under the Companies Act, 1956 (Central Act 1 of 1956), a separate licence shall be obtained by each such individual in his name describing himself as a member of the association:Provided that nothing contained in this sub-section shall affect the operation of section 59 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 (Central Act IX of 1932).4. Grant and refusal of licence.- (1) Every application for a money-lenders licence shall be in writing and shall be made to the licensing authority prescribed under this Act:Provided that a person under the age of eighteen years shall be eligible to apply for a licence only through a guardian:Provided further that if any person acting as a guardian on behalf of a minor applies for, and obtains a licence under this Act, such guardian shall be subject to all the provisions of this Act as if the licence has been granted to himself.(2) Every licence shall be granted in such form and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed including conditions as to payment of licence fees not exceeding one hundred rupees.(3) The licensing authority may, by order in writing, refuse to grant a licence, if such authority is satisfied -(a) that the applicant has not complied with the provisions of this Act or the rules made thereunder in respect of an application for the grant of a licence; or(b) that the applicant has made wilful default in complying with, or knowingly acted in contravention of, any requirement of this Act; or(c) that the applicant has -(i) knowingly participated in or connived at any fraud or dishonesty in the conduct of, or in connection with, the business of money-lending; or(ii) been found guilty of an offence under Chapter XVII or Chapter XVIII of theIndian Penal Code(Central Act XLV of 1860); or(iii) been found guilty of an offence[under section 10-A or section 11]or section 13 on two or more occasions; or(d) that the applicant has had his licence cancelled within six months before the date of application.(4) Any person aggrieved by an order of the licensing authority under subsection (3) may, within one month from the date of communication of such order to him, appeal to the prescribed authority.(5) Every licence granted under this Act shall, subject to the provisions of sub-section (7), expire on the last day of the year in which it was granted.(6) A licence granted under sub-section (2) may be renewed from year to year and the provisions of sub-sections (1) to (5) shall apply in relation to the renewal of a licence as they apply in relation to the grant of a licence.(7) If orders refusing to renew a licence are not communicated to a moneylender by the licensing authority before the expiry of his current licence, the money-lender shall, notwithstanding such expiry, be deemed to have a valid licence till orders are received by him on his application for renewal.(8) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to disentitle a money-lender, whose licence has expired or has not been renewed, from taking steps to recover any loan advanced during the period when the licence was in force.Please note that an LLP has a separate legal entity under the law. A partnership firm has no separate legal status apart from its partners. The partner's liability of an LLP is limited to the extent of their capital contribution to the LLP. The partner's liability of a partnership firm has unlimited liability. Major advantages of LLP over partnership include separate legal entity, limited liability of partners, and the ability to purchase property in its own name. LLP or limited liability partnerships and general or traditional partnerships, both require a minimum of two individuals for their formation. Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete facts and documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on Record & Amicus CuriaeSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "question": "Money lending business",
    "answer": "Individual Capacity: In some jurisdictions, individuals may be allowed to conduct money lending businesses in their individual capacity. However, specific licensing requirements and regulations may still apply.Money Lending License: Many jurisdictions require individuals or entities engaged in money lending activities to obtain a license or registration. The licensing requirements and procedures can differ from one jurisdiction to another. It's crucial to consult the laws and regulations of the specific state or region where the money lending business is intended to operate to determine whether a license is required.Cross-State Lending: If a person wants to lend money to individuals or companies in a different state, it's possible that additional licensing requirements may apply in the borrower's state. Some jurisdictions may require lenders to acquire licenses or fulfill specific criteria in the borrower's state as well. Again, it's important to consult with legal professionals who are well-versed in the laws and regulations of both the lender's and borrower's states to ensure compliance.Advantages and disadvantages of different business structures (individual, partnership firm, LLP, company) in money lending business:Individual: An individual conducting a money lending business may have simplicity in terms of decision-making and operations. However, they may bear unlimited personal liability for the debts and obligations of the business.Partnership Firm: A partnership firm allows for shared responsibilities, resources, and decision-making among partners. However, partners may also have unlimited personal liability for the partnership's debts and obligations.Limited Liability Partnership (LLP): An LLP provides limited liability protection to its partners, meaning their personal assets may be protected from business debts and obligations. It also offers flexibility in terms of management and tax advantages. However, LLPs may have additional compliance requirements and formalities compared to individual or partnership firms.Company: A company, such as a private limited company or a corporation, provides limited liability protection to its shareholders. It has a separate legal entity from its owners, and shareholders' personal assets are generally protected from business liabilities. However, companies may have more complex compliance requirements, legal formalities, and higher administrative costs.Tax implications on money lending business can vary based on the jurisdiction and the business structure. Tax laws and regulations related to money lending, such as interest income, deductions, and reporting requirements, can differ significantly. It's advisable to consult with tax professionals or accountants who can provide guidance specific to your jurisdiction and business structure.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Blood relative secretly buying life insurance on my life -- how to prevent?",
    "answer": "The special status of a blood relation, such as a father, can vary depending on the specific legal and financial circumstances in your jurisdictionBuying an insurance policy without your consent: In most cases, an adult son does not require the consent of their father to purchase an insurance policy on their own life. Insurance companies generally allow individuals to buy policies on their own lives without the need for consent from family members.Buying insurance without financial impact: Even if there is no direct financial impact on your father in the event of your death, he may still be allowed to purchase an insurance policy on your life, depending on the laws and regulations in your jurisdiction. However, the insurable interest principle might apply, which requires that the person purchasing the insurance policy has a financial interest or a reasonable expectation of financial loss upon your death. If there is no financial impact on your father, it could potentially affect the validity of the policy.Filing affidavits with insurance companies: If you do not consent to your father purchasing an insurance policy on your life, it may be advisable to inform the insurance companies in writing about your lack of consent and lack of financial interest. This can help ensure that the insurance company is aware of your position and can take it into consideration when processing any claims or dealing with any disputes.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Blood relative secretly buying life insurance on my life -- how to prevent?",
    "answer": "The special status of a blood relation, such as a father, can vary depending on the specific legal and financial circumstances in your jurisdictionBuying an insurance policy without your consent: In most cases, an adult son does not require the consent of their father to purchase an insurance policy on their own life. Insurance companies generally allow individuals to buy policies on their own lives without the need for consent from family members.Buying insurance without financial impact: Even if there is no direct financial impact on your father in the event of your death, he may still be allowed to purchase an insurance policy on your life, depending on the laws and regulations in your jurisdiction. However, the insurable interest principle might apply, which requires that the person purchasing the insurance policy has a financial interest or a reasonable expectation of financial loss upon your death. If there is no financial impact on your father, it could potentially affect the validity of the policy.Filing affidavits with insurance companies: If you do not consent to your father purchasing an insurance policy on your life, it may be advisable to inform the insurance companies in writing about your lack of consent and lack of financial interest. This can help ensure that the insurance company is aware of your position and can take it into consideration when processing any claims or dealing with any disputes.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Money lending business",
    "answer": "You must know that in India, money lenders are governed by the Money Lenders Act in different states. The Tamil Nadu Government controls the money lending process in accordance with the Money Lenders Act, 1957. It is mandatory for every money lender to have a license. Even though getting a valid license under the Money Lending Act helps money lenders to carry on business lawfully and have legal recourse against the defaulters, one of the major reasons for non-registration is the ceiling on interest rate. Many lenders are not even aware about the requirement of such registration.Please note the following sections of Tamil Nadu Money Lenders Act:3. Money-lender to obtain licence.- (1) No person shall, on and after the date on which the provisions of this Act are brought into force in any area, carry on, or continue to carry on, business as a money-lender at any place in such area except under, and in accordance with, the terms of a licence.(2) Where a money-lender has more than one shop or place of business, whether in the same town or village or in different towns or villages, he shall obtain a separate licence in respect of each such shop or place of business.(3) (a) Where a money-lender is a registered firm, the licence shall be obtained in the firms name.(b) Where a money-lender is an undivided Hindu family, the licence shall be obtained in the name of the manager or the karnavan or the yajaman, as the case may be, described as such in the licence.(c) Where a money-lender is any other association of individuals, not required to be registered under the Companies Act, 1956 (Central Act 1 of 1956), a separate licence shall be obtained by each such individual in his name describing himself as a member of the association:Provided that nothing contained in this sub-section shall affect the operation of section 59 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 (Central Act IX of 1932).4. Grant and refusal of licence.- (1) Every application for a money-lenders licence shall be in writing and shall be made to the licensing authority prescribed under this Act:Provided that a person under the age of eighteen years shall be eligible to apply for a licence only through a guardian:Provided further that if any person acting as a guardian on behalf of a minor applies for, and obtains a licence under this Act, such guardian shall be subject to all the provisions of this Act as if the licence has been granted to himself.(2) Every licence shall be granted in such form and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed including conditions as to payment of licence fees not exceeding one hundred rupees.(3) The licensing authority may, by order in writing, refuse to grant a licence, if such authority is satisfied -(a) that the applicant has not complied with the provisions of this Act or the rules made thereunder in respect of an application for the grant of a licence; or(b) that the applicant has made wilful default in complying with, or knowingly acted in contravention of, any requirement of this Act; or(c) that the applicant has -(i) knowingly participated in or connived at any fraud or dishonesty in the conduct of, or in connection with, the business of money-lending; or(ii) been found guilty of an offence under Chapter XVII or Chapter XVIII of theIndian Penal Code(Central Act XLV of 1860); or(iii) been found guilty of an offence[under section 10-A or section 11]or section 13 on two or more occasions; or(d) that the applicant has had his licence cancelled within six months before the date of application.(4) Any person aggrieved by an order of the licensing authority under subsection (3) may, within one month from the date of communication of such order to him, appeal to the prescribed authority.(5) Every licence granted under this Act shall, subject to the provisions of sub-section (7), expire on the last day of the year in which it was granted.(6) A licence granted under sub-section (2) may be renewed from year to year and the provisions of sub-sections (1) to (5) shall apply in relation to the renewal of a licence as they apply in relation to the grant of a licence.(7) If orders refusing to renew a licence are not communicated to a moneylender by the licensing authority before the expiry of his current licence, the money-lender shall, notwithstanding such expiry, be deemed to have a valid licence till orders are received by him on his application for renewal.(8) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to disentitle a money-lender, whose licence has expired or has not been renewed, from taking steps to recover any loan advanced during the period when the licence was in force.Please note that an LLP has a separate legal entity under the law. A partnership firm has no separate legal status apart from its partners. The partner's liability of an LLP is limited to the extent of their capital contribution to the LLP. The partner's liability of a partnership firm has unlimited liability. Major advantages of LLP over partnership include separate legal entity, limited liability of partners, and the ability to purchase property in its own name. LLP or limited liability partnerships and general or traditional partnerships, both require a minimum of two individuals for their formation.

    "question": "Money lending business",
    "answer": "Individual Capacity: In some jurisdictions, individuals may be allowed to conduct money lending businesses in their individual capacity. However, specific licensing requirements and regulations may still apply.Money Lending License: Many jurisdictions require individuals or entities engaged in money lending activities to obtain a license or registration. The licensing requirements and procedures can differ from one jurisdiction to another. It's crucial to consult the laws and regulations of the specific state or region where the money lending business is intended to operate to determine whether a license is required.Cross-State Lending: If a person wants to lend money to individuals or companies in a different state, it's possible that additional licensing requirements may apply in the borrower's state. Some jurisdictions may require lenders to acquire licenses or fulfill specific criteria in the borrower's state as well. Again, it's important to consult with legal professionals who are well-versed in the laws and regulations of both the lender's and borrower's states to ensure compliance.Advantages and disadvantages of different business structures (individual, partnership firm, LLP, company) in money lending business:Individual: An individual conducting a money lending business may have simplicity in terms of decision-making and operations.

    "question": "Purchase of Agricultural Land",
    "answer": "In general, when purchasing property, it is advisable to conduct a thorough due diligence process to ensure that the title is clear and marketable. This typically involves reviewing the chain of ownership, verifying the authenticity of documents, and ensuring that all necessary legal requirements have been fulfilled.Regarding your specific questions:Q1) Whether Mrs. E should be included as a party in the sale deed would depend on the ownership rights she holds in the property. If she has a legal share in the property, it may be necessary to include her as a party to the transaction. However, if she does not have any ownership rights, it may not be required. A lawyer can provide guidance based on the applicable laws and the specific circumstances.Q2) The inclusion of the grandchildren as sellers/vendors would depend on their ownership rights and the laws governing the transfer of property in your jurisdiction. If the grandchildren have a legal share in the property, they may need to be included as parties to the transaction. However, if they do not have ownership rights or if they are minors, their participation may not be necessary or possible. Again, consulting with a lawyer will help clarify the requirements in your specific case.Regarding the potential for future legal challenges based on ancestral property rights, it is important to consider the relevant laws and regulations in your jurisdiction. In some cases, there may be laws that provide for inheritance rights or ancestral property rights, which could potentially be invoked by the grandchildren in the future. Consulting with a lawyer who is familiar with the local property and inheritance laws will help you understand the potential risks and take appropriate measures to mitigate them.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Blood relative secretly buying life insurance on my life -- how to prevent?",
    "answer": "The special status of a blood relation, such as a father, can vary depending on the specific legal and financial circumstances in your jurisdictionBuying an insurance policy without your consent: In most cases, an adult son does not require the consent of their father to purchase an insurance policy on their own life. Insurance companies generally allow individuals to buy policies on their own lives without the need for consent from family members.Buying insurance without financial impact: Even if there is no direct financial impact on your father in the event of your death, he may still be allowed to purchase an insurance policy on your life, depending on the laws and regulations in your jurisdiction. However, the insurable interest principle might apply, which requires that the person purchasing the insurance policy has a financial interest or a reasonable expectation of financial loss upon your death. If there is no financial impact on your father, it could potentially affect the validity of the policy.Filing affidavits with insurance companies: If you do not consent to your father purchasing an insurance policy on your life, it may be advisable to inform the insurance companies in writing about your lack of consent and lack of financial interest. This can help ensure that the insurance company is aware of your position and can take it into consideration when processing any claims or dealing with any disputes.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Protecting possession in case of fraudulent sale deed",
    "answer": "Dear client,It is generally not permissible to file multiple suits on the same cause of action. If both suits involve the same cause of action and the same parties, the second suit may be stayed or consolidated with the first suit under Section 10 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC). You should discuss this matter with your lawyer, who can file the appropriate application to the court to request the stay of the second suit.The granting of a temporary injunction depends on various factors, including the merits of the case and the balance of convenience. If the other party can prove that there is a possibility of irreparable harm or loss if the injunction is not granted, they may be successful in obtaining temporary injunction relief. However, your lawyer will be in a better position to assess the strength of their argument and provide guidance on how to respond effectively.Possession can be established in various ways, and it is not always necessary for someone to be physically staying inside the house. However, having someone present at the property, even as a watchman or caretaker, can help demonstrate that you are in possession and taking steps to protect your property. You should discuss the best approach with your lawyer, taking into account the specific circumstances and risks involved.Blocking the front gate with a car may provide an additional physical barrier, but it's important to consider the legal implications and potential consequences. Blocking the gate could be seen as an obstruction, and it may not be advisable without proper legal authorization. It's best to consult with your lawyer to explore legal ways to protect your property.Remember, the information provided here is general in nature, and it's crucial to consult with a qualified property lawyer who can provide you with advice specific to your case.

    "question": "Protecting possession in case of fraudulent sale deed",
    "answer": "In general, when dealing with a criminal case, it's important to consider the potential consequences of any agreements or statements made to the police or other parties involved. If you agree to a settlement with the new buyers and provide a written statement indicating that you will withdraw the 156(3) case, it may have implications for your ability to pursue a criminal case in the future.By agreeing to a settlement, you may be effectively acknowledging that a resolution has been reached, and it could be difficult to later argue for the registration of an FIR if the new buyers fail to fulfill their part of the agreement. It may weaken your position in claiming that a criminal offense has taken place.Before making any decisions or providing any written statements, it is highly recommended to consult with your lawyer. They can review the specifics of your case, the proposed settlement, and provide advice on the potential consequences and risks involved. They can also guide you on how to protect your interests and ensure that your rights are safeguarded throughout the legal process.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "First set of queries:The presumption of summons being served may vary depending on the specific rules and procedures followed by the civil court in your jurisdiction. It's best to consult with your lawyer regarding this matter to understand the local rules and how they apply to your case.Again, the treatment of court vacation in relation to the filing of a written statement can depend on local rules and procedures. Typically, court vacations are excluded from the calculation of time limits. It's essential to consult with your lawyer to understand the specific rules applicable to your case.If you have already requested the relief of permanent injunction in your own suit, it may not be necessary to file a counterclaim for the same relief in their suit. Your lawyer can guide you on whether it's appropriate to include it as a counterclaim or if it should be pursued solely in your own suit.Whether to ask for consolidation of the suits or file a rejection of plaint application is a strategic decision that should be discussed with your lawyer. They will be familiar with the specific circumstances of your case and can advise you on the best course of action.Falsely stating facts in a suit can be a serious matter, but the decision to initiate a criminal case would depend on the specific laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. It's advisable to consult with your lawyer and possibly involve the police or appropriate authorities if there is evidence of fraudulent statements.Second set of queries:Once the FIR is lodged, it would be best to consult with your lawyer regarding the appropriate course of action. They can guide you on whether to inform the magistrate or file an application to withdraw the 156(3) application.The contents of the FIR should ideally include all relevant details and allegations. If you have suspicions or additional information that you believe is relevant, it's generally advisable to include them in your statement. Your lawyer can provide more specific guidance based on the laws and practices in your jurisdiction.Contacting the IO to provide your statement or inquire about the progress of the investigation may be a reasonable step. However, it's important to follow the guidance of your lawyer, who can advise you on the best way to proceed in your specific case.The status of arrests and the appropriate follow-up procedures can vary depending on the laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. Your lawyer would be the best person to guide you on the appropriate actions and who can provide updates on the progress of the case.Third set of queries:If you withdraw the 156(3) application after the FIR is registered, it may be possible to file a subsequent 156(3) application if you are dissatisfied with the police investigation. However, the availability and maintainability of such an application would depend on the specific laws and procedures in your jurisdiction.

    "question": "Land divided and sold to multiple buyers",
    "answer": "Dear client,In this scenario, the division of the land into two portions of 300 sq yards and 150 sq yards indicates that there are two separate buyers involved. The distribution of the original copies and certified copies of the link documents may vary depending on the agreement between the parties involved and the customary practices in the jurisdiction where the transaction takes place. However, here is a general understanding:Original Copies of Link Documents: Typically, the original copies of link documents, such as the title deed, previous sale deeds, and other relevant documents establishing the chain of ownership, are handed over to the buyer who purchases the larger portion of the land, in this case, buyer1 with 300 sq yards. The larger portion is often deemed more significant and thus granted the original copies.Certified Copies of Link Documents: The buyer who purchases the smaller portion of the land, buyer2 with 150 sq yards, usually receives certified copies of the link documents. These certified copies serve as evidence of ownership and provide necessary information about the history of the land's ownership.It's important to note that the actual distribution of the documents can be influenced by the agreement between the parties involved or specific circumstances surrounding the transaction. It is advisable to consult with a real estate lawyer or legal professional to ensure compliance with local laws and regulations and to clarify the specific terms and conditions of the land sale agreement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Land divided and sold to multiple buyers",
    "answer": "If buyer 2 receives only certified copies of the relevant documents, it may have some impact on the sale prospects in the future. Original documents are generally preferred and considered more reliable during property transactions. Having only certified copies may raise concerns for potential buyers about the authenticity and genuineness of the documents.To address this concern, it is advisable for buyer 1 and buyer 2 to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) or agreement that outlines the rights and obligations regarding the original link document. The MOU can specify that in case of any future necessity, such as the sale of the 150 sq yard land by buyer 2, the party possessing the original link document should provide it to facilitate the transaction.This agreement can help ensure transparency, clarity, and trust between the parties involved and mitigate potential disputes or complications in the future.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Then each of you will be legally entitled to an undivided share of the land over which the superstructure is built. Afterwards, the three of you can execute a partition deed dividing the construction floor wise for the sake of practicality, mentioning all the relevant facts, such as your mother's settlement deed, the share of undivided portion of land for each, the amount of contribution made by each of you for construction of flats etc., and register it.

    "question": "Divide construction property",
    "answer": "Dear client, below I have provided some important information.Dividing the property equally: To divide the property equally among the three brothers, you have a few options.a) Partition Deed: A partition deed is a legal document that allows for the division of jointly owned property. It can be used to allocate specific portions of the property to each brother, specifying their respective rights and responsibilities. This can be a tax-efficient solution as it ensures each brother receives his fair share without additional tax implications.b) Will: If your mother is willing, she can draft a will that clearly states her intentions to divide the property equally among her three sons. However, it's important to consider the potential tax implications of inheriting the property through a will, as inheritance tax laws vary by jurisdiction.c) Registration of individual floors: Another option could be to register each floor or apartment in the name of each brother individually. This would provide individual ownership and may simplify the process of selling individual units in the future. However, it's crucial to consult with a local attorney to understand the legal and tax implications of this option.Selling the property in the future: If you wish to sell the property in the future, the method of sale would depend on how the property was divided among the brothers.If a partition deed was executed, each brother would have a specified portion of the property in his name, allowing for independent sale of their respective portions.If the property was divided through a will, the property would pass to the brothers as per the terms of the will. To sell the property, the brothers would need to follow the legal procedures and requirements for selling inherited property.If individual floors were registered in each brother's name, they would have independent ownership, and selling their respective units would be similar to selling any other individual property.In any case, it is advisable to consult with a local attorney to understand the specific legal requirements and procedures for selling property in your jurisdiction.Stilt parking and roof rights: To address the issue of stilt parking and roof rights, it would be advisable to have a clear agreement or documentation that outlines the rights and responsibilities of each brother. This agreement could specify the allocated parking spaces for each unit and any restrictions or guidelines for the use of the roof area. Having a legally binding agreement can help prevent conflicts in the future and ensure that everyone understands their rights and obligations.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Protecting possession in case of fraudulent sale deed",
    "answer": "Dear client,It is generally not permissible to file multiple suits on the same cause of action. If both suits involve the same cause of action and the same parties, the second suit may be stayed or consolidated with the first suit under Section 10 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC). You should discuss this matter with your lawyer, who can file the appropriate application to the court to request the stay of the second suit.The granting of a temporary injunction depends on various factors, including the merits of the case and the balance of convenience. If the other party can prove that there is a possibility of irreparable harm or loss if the injunction is not granted, they may be successful in obtaining temporary injunction relief. However, your lawyer will be in a better position to assess the strength of their argument and provide guidance on how to respond effectively.Possession can be established in various ways, and it is not always necessary for someone to be physically staying inside the house. However, having someone present at the property, even as a watchman or caretaker, can help demonstrate that you are in possession and taking steps to protect your property. You should discuss the best approach with your lawyer, taking into account the specific circumstances and risks involved.Blocking the front gate with a car may provide an additional physical barrier, but it's important to consider the legal implications and potential consequences. Blocking the gate could be seen as an obstruction, and it may not be advisable without proper legal authorization. It's best to consult with your lawyer to explore legal ways to protect your property.Remember, the information provided here is general in nature, and it's crucial to consult with a qualified property lawyer who can provide you with advice specific to your case.

    "answer": "In general, when dealing with a criminal case, it's important to consider the potential consequences of any agreements or statements made to the police or other parties involved. If you agree to a settlement with the new buyers and provide a written statement indicating that you will withdraw the 156(3) case, it may have implications for your ability to pursue a criminal case in the future.By agreeing to a settlement, you may be effectively acknowledging that a resolution has been reached, and it could be difficult to later argue for the registration of an FIR if the new buyers fail to fulfill their part of the agreement. It may weaken your position in claiming that a criminal offense has taken place.Before making any decisions or providing any written statements, it is highly recommended to consult with your lawyer. They can review the specifics of your case, the proposed settlement, and provide advice on the potential consequences and risks involved.

    "question": "Protecting possession in case of fraudulent sale deed",
    "answer": "First set of queries:The presumption of summons being served may vary depending on the specific rules and procedures followed by the civil court in your jurisdiction. It's best to consult with your lawyer regarding this matter to understand the local rules and how they apply to your case.Again, the treatment of court vacation in relation to the filing of a written statement can depend on local rules and procedures. Typically, court vacations are excluded from the calculation of time limits. It's essential to consult with your lawyer to understand the specific rules applicable to your case.If you have already requested the relief of permanent injunction in your own suit, it may not be necessary to file a counterclaim for the same relief in their suit. Your lawyer can guide you on whether it's appropriate to include it as a counterclaim or if it should be pursued solely in your own suit.Whether to ask for consolidation of the suits or file a rejection of plaint application is a strategic decision that should be discussed with your lawyer. They will be familiar with the specific circumstances of your case and can advise you on the best course of action.Falsely stating facts in a suit can be a serious matter, but the decision to initiate a criminal case would depend on the specific laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. It's advisable to consult with your lawyer and possibly involve the police or appropriate authorities if there is evidence of fraudulent statements.Second set of queries:Once the FIR is lodged, it would be best to consult with your lawyer regarding the appropriate course of action. They can guide you on whether to inform the magistrate or file an application to withdraw the 156(3) application.The contents of the FIR should ideally include all relevant details and allegations. If you have suspicions or additional information that you believe is relevant, it's generally advisable to include them in your statement. Your lawyer can provide more specific guidance based on the laws and practices in your jurisdiction.Contacting the IO to provide your statement or inquire about the progress of the investigation may be a reasonable step. However, it's important to follow the guidance of your lawyer, who can advise you on the best way to proceed in your specific case.The status of arrests and the appropriate follow-up procedures can vary depending on the laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. Your lawyer would be the best person to guide you on the appropriate actions and who can provide updates on the progress of the case.Third set of queries:If you withdraw the 156(3) application after the FIR is registered, it may be possible to file a subsequent 156(3) application if you are dissatisfied with the police investigation. However, the availability and maintainability of such an application would depend on the specific laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. Consulting with your lawyer is crucial in this situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Land divided and sold to multiple buyers",
    "answer": "Dear client,In this scenario, the division of the land into two portions of 300 sq yards and 150 sq yards indicates that there are two separate buyers involved. The distribution of the original copies and certified copies of the link documents may vary depending on the agreement between the parties involved and the customary practices in the jurisdiction where the transaction takes place. However, here is a general understanding:Original Copies of Link Documents: Typically, the original copies of link documents, such as the title deed, previous sale deeds, and other relevant documents establishing the chain of ownership, are handed over to the buyer who purchases the larger portion of the land, in this case, buyer1 with 300 sq yards. The larger portion is often deemed more significant and thus granted the original copies.Certified Copies of Link Documents: The buyer who purchases the smaller portion of the land, buyer2 with 150 sq yards, usually receives certified copies of the link documents. These certified copies serve as evidence of ownership and provide necessary information about the history of the land's ownership.It's important to note that the actual distribution of the documents can be influenced by the agreement between the parties involved or specific circumstances surrounding the transaction. It is advisable to consult with a real estate lawyer or legal professional to ensure compliance with local laws and regulations and to clarify the specific terms and conditions of the land sale agreement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Original documents are generally preferred and considered more reliable during property transactions. Having only certified copies may raise concerns for potential buyers about the authenticity and genuineness of the documents.To address this concern, it is advisable for buyer 1 and buyer 2 to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) or agreement that outlines the rights and obligations regarding the original link document. The MOU can specify that in case of any future necessity, such as the sale of the 150 sq yard land by buyer 2, the party possessing the original link document should provide it to facilitate the transaction.This agreement can help ensure transparency, clarity, and trust between the parties involved and mitigate potential disputes or complications in the future.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The reason behind such setting aside is that appointment of arbitrator by one party alone without giving opportunity to the other party shall have an element of bias and partiality.On one hand, where parties are given autonomy to agree on the procedure to appoint an arbitrator under Section 11(2), on the other hand, it is not correct to say that the same is not an absolute right of the party. The right of the parties to agree on the procedure to appoint the arbitrator is now subject to reasonable restriction, and one such instance of reasonable restriction is the unilateral appointment of arbitrator.You can file a petition to set aside the award in the appellate courtT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

The relevant extract of the Court's observation is as follows:The reason is clear that whatever advantage a party may derive by nominating an arbitrator of its choice would get counter balanced by equal power with the other party. But, in a case where only one party has a right to appoint a sole arbitrator, its choice will always have an element of exclusivity in determining or charting the course for dispute resolution. Naturally, the person who has an interest in the outcome or decision of the dispute must not have the power to appoint a sole arbitrator. That has to be taken as the essence of the amendments brought in by the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015 (Act 3 of 2016).\"T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Protecting possession in case of fraudulent sale deed",
    "answer": "Dear client,It is generally not permissible to file multiple suits on the same cause of action. If both suits involve the same cause of action and the same parties, the second suit may be stayed or consolidated with the first suit under Section 10 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC). You should discuss this matter with your lawyer, who can file the appropriate application to the court to request the stay of the second suit.The granting of a temporary injunction depends on various factors, including the merits of the case and the balance of convenience. If the other party can prove that there is a possibility of irreparable harm or loss if the injunction is not granted, they may be successful in obtaining temporary injunction relief. However, your lawyer will be in a better position to assess the strength of their argument and provide guidance on how to respond effectively.Possession can be established in various ways, and it is not always necessary for someone to be physically staying inside the house. However, having someone present at the property, even as a watchman or caretaker, can help demonstrate that you are in possession and taking steps to protect your property. You should discuss the best approach with your lawyer, taking into account the specific circumstances and risks involved.Blocking the front gate with a car may provide an additional physical barrier, but it's important to consider the legal implications and potential consequences. Blocking the gate could be seen as an obstruction, and it may not be advisable without proper legal authorization. It's best to consult with your lawyer to explore legal ways to protect your property.Remember, the information provided here is general in nature, and it's crucial to consult with a qualified property lawyer who can provide you with advice specific to your case. They will be able to review the details of your situation, assess the relevant laws and regulations, and guide you through the legal process..Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Protecting possession in case of fraudulent sale deed",
    "answer": "In general, when dealing with a criminal case, it's important to consider the potential consequences of any agreements or statements made to the police or other parties involved. If you agree to a settlement with the new buyers and provide a written statement indicating that you will withdraw the 156(3) case, it may have implications for your ability to pursue a criminal case in the future.By agreeing to a settlement, you may be effectively acknowledging that a resolution has been reached, and it could be difficult to later argue for the registration of an FIR if the new buyers fail to fulfill their part of the agreement. It may weaken your position in claiming that a criminal offense has taken place.Before making any decisions or providing any written statements, it is highly recommended to consult with your lawyer. They can review the specifics of your case, the proposed settlement, and provide advice on the potential consequences and risks involved. They can also guide you on how to protect your interests and ensure that your rights are safeguarded throughout the legal process.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "First set of queries:The presumption of summons being served may vary depending on the specific rules and procedures followed by the civil court in your jurisdiction. It's best to consult with your lawyer regarding this matter to understand the local rules and how they apply to your case.Again, the treatment of court vacation in relation to the filing of a written statement can depend on local rules and procedures. Typically, court vacations are excluded from the calculation of time limits. It's essential to consult with your lawyer to understand the specific rules applicable to your case.If you have already requested the relief of permanent injunction in your own suit, it may not be necessary to file a counterclaim for the same relief in their suit. Your lawyer can guide you on whether it's appropriate to include it as a counterclaim or if it should be pursued solely in your own suit.Whether to ask for consolidation of the suits or file a rejection of plaint application is a strategic decision that should be discussed with your lawyer. They will be familiar with the specific circumstances of your case and can advise you on the best course of action.Falsely stating facts in a suit can be a serious matter, but the decision to initiate a criminal case would depend on the specific laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. It's advisable to consult with your lawyer and possibly involve the police or appropriate authorities if there is evidence of fraudulent statements.Second set of queries:Once the FIR is lodged, it would be best to consult with your lawyer regarding the appropriate course of action. They can guide you on whether to inform the magistrate or file an application to withdraw the 156(3) application.The contents of the FIR should ideally include all relevant details and allegations. If you have suspicions or additional information that you believe is relevant, it's generally advisable to include them in your statement. Your lawyer can provide more specific guidance based on the laws and practices in your jurisdiction.Contacting the IO to provide your statement or inquire about the progress of the investigation may be a reasonable step. However, it's important to follow the guidance of your lawyer, who can advise you on the best way to proceed in your specific case.The status of arrests and the appropriate follow-up procedures can vary depending on the laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. Your lawyer would be the best person to guide you on the appropriate actions and who can provide updates on the progress of the case.Third set of queries:If you withdraw the 156(3) application after the FIR is registered, it may be possible to file a subsequent 156(3) application if you are dissatisfied with the police investigation. However, the availability and maintainability of such an application would depend on the specific laws and procedures in your jurisdiction.

    "answer": "Getting Bail Again: The cancellation of bail by the trial judge means that you will need to apply for bail again. The likelihood of obtaining bail will depend on various factors, including the evidence presented, the seriousness of the charges, and the discretion of the court. If the newly added sections (325 and 323) are also bailable, you may be able to apply for bail again. Your lawyer will be able to guide you through the process and present the necessary evidence to support your bail application.Reinstatement of Sections 325 and 323: The decision to reinstate sections 325 and 323 by the judge may have been based on the opposition's arguments or other factors presented during the proceedings. The judge may have considered that there is enough material to warrant the inclusion of these sections in the chargesheet. However, the judge has also mentioned that you can challenge these sections during the trial. Your lawyer can evaluate the evidence and present your defense against these charges during the trial proceedings.Bail Cancellation and Chances of Getting Bail Again: The cancellation of bail may have been based on the judge's assessment of the evidence and other factors in the case. When applying for bail again, your lawyer can present the evidence that supports your defense, such as mobile phone location records and CCTV footage, to demonstrate that you were not present at the place of the alleged incident.

    "answer": "As such there is no contradiction in clauses as referred by you. Both clauses are required to be read in harmony. Since in the light of first clause as referred by you the Lessee I.e. govt has power to extend the lease hence govt can extend lease but terms of lease is liable to be settled amicably and if govt donot chose to extend then on expiry of lease govt I.e.lessee is liable to handover the vacant possession. Under the given circumstances, you have only liberty to negotiate the term. Time limit for eviction case cannot be predicted,  however, it will take minimum 3 years time if all goes well. There must be Arbitration clause in the agreement and if that would be so then eviction case, which is a civil remedy, would not be maintainable. So far cost is concern if govt chose to claim damages then cost will accordingly be increased beside damages etc. Since public interest is also involved so court may also be soft.

    "question": "Adoption son rights",
    "answer": "Based on the information you have provided, here are some general points to consider:Adoption Deed: The adoption deed registered in 1955, where your grandfather stated that all the property would be passed on to your father after the death of your grandparents, can be considered as a legal document. It signifies your father's right to inherit the property.Subsequent Will: The will written by your grandfather in 1958, dividing the properties into three parts, could impact the inheritance. However, if the adoption deed clearly stated that all the property would go to your father after the death of your grandparents, the subsequent will may be disputed based on the earlier adoption deed. A lawyer can review both documents to provide specific guidance.Will of Grandmothers: The wills written by your grandmothers, diverting the properties to their relative, may have legal implications. It would be important to assess the validity of these wills and the circumstances under which they were made. Factors such as the mental capacity of your grandmothers, undue influence, and the legal requirements for making a valid will should be considered.Rights of Minor: The fact that your father was a minor at the time of the adoption and subsequent wills may also impact the situation. Depending on the laws in your jurisdiction, special rules may apply to protect the rights of minors in inheritance matters.Undisclosed Properties: If there are properties that were not mentioned in the partition deed but were owned by your grandfather, the rights to those properties would need to be determined. The laws of succession and inheritance in your jurisdiction would apply to these undisclosed properties.Given the complexity of the situation and the need for a detailed analysis of the legal documents involved, it is highly recommended that you consult with a lawyer. They will be able to review the adoption deed, subsequent wills, and any other relevant documents, as well as consider the applicable laws to provide you with the specific advice you need.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Adoption son rights",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Validity of the Partition Deed:A Partition Deed is typically a legal document that divides property among co-owners. Your father's age at the time the deed was executed (around 10) could potentially be a factor in its validity.In many jurisdictions, a minor cannot enter into a legally binding contract. Therefore, the validity of the Partition Deed may be questioned if your father was a minor at the time.Court Permission for Partition Deed Involving a Minor:When a minor is involved in a property transaction, court permission or a guardian's consent may be required to ensure the minor's interests are protected.Whether court permission was obtained at the time of the Partition Deed should be assessed. If it wasn't, this could impact the deed's validity.Location of the Will:The location where a will is written does not necessarily invalidate it. However, the will should generally comply with the legal requirements of the jurisdiction where the properties are located.Limitation and Adverse Possession:The laws regarding adverse possession and property limitations would vary. In some cases, adverse possession may apply if someone openly occupies and uses property for an extended period without the owner's objection.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

You can go forward with the drafting of the legal agreement now and the agreement should contain the terms and conditions with which you handed over the amount to Mr. Iqbal.Under the Indian Contract Act, an agreement need not be written, it may be oral. The problem with oral agreement is that the burden is on you to prove that there existed an agreement between you and Mr. Iqbal.Kindly find the appropriate case law herewith. I have extracted the relevant segment from the Judgement. In the case ofS.V. Narayanaswamy vs. Savithramma2013R.F.A. No. 1163 of 2002 c/w R.F.A.No.1164 of 2002 Karnataka High Court,the Appellant sought to prove the existence of a oral agreement, which was vehemently claimed to exist, with respect to sale of property. With the onus to prove being on the Appellant, it did so, by producing cheques of several amounts, towards the entire consideration of the property. By producing various pieces of evidence, which indicated towards a whole, the court upheld the existence of the oral agreement, based on the scrutiny of the evidence provided.Also, you could send a legal Notice u/s 138 of N.I. Act,1881 to Mr. Iqbal to clear the outstanding amount. 15 days from the date of Legal Notice, you will have to wait for this reply and after the expiry of 15 days, you go ahead and file a PCR, then after the lapse of 30 days cognizance will be taken and the PCR will be converted to a Criminal Case after recording of sworn statement. I can help you draft the legal notice and we would also move for specific performance of the oral agreement basing our contention on the above case law, under Specific Relief Act,1963.Sanmathi S.

    "answer": "Dear Mr. A,Thank you for reaching out to me with your legal concerns. I understand the complexities of the situation you have described and will do my best to provide you with some guidance.Based on the information you have provided, there are a few legal implications that can be considered:Loan Agreement: Although you mentioned that there is no formal written agreement, the WhatsApp messages and audio recordings where Mr. Iqbal acknowledges his commitment to repay the borrowed amount, including the bank interest and profit, can serve as evidence of a verbal agreement. Verbal agreements can be legally binding, and these messages and recordings can be used to support your claim in case of a dispute.Use of Another Individual's Bank Account: Mr. Iqbal's use of Mr. Mohsin's bank account without his knowledge or consent raises concerns. It could potentially involve fraudulent activities, and Mr. Mohsin should be made aware of the situation if he is not already. Mr. Mohsin may choose to take legal action against Mr. Iqbal for any unauthorized use of his bank account.Property Sale and Fund Transfer: The purchase of land under Mr. Mohsin's name and subsequent sale of the property, with the funds being transferred into Mr. Iqbal's wife's account, raises questions about the legality of the transaction. This type of arrangement may be seen as an attempt to evade legal obligations or engage in fraudulent activities. It would be advisable to consult with a lawyer familiar with property and financial laws to further investigate this matter and determine the appropriate course of action.Given the circumstances, I recommend that you consult with a local lawyer who specializes in financial and property law. They will be able to review the specific details of your case, examine the evidence you have, and provide you with tailored advice based on the laws and regulations applicable in your jurisdiction. They can guide you on the best legal avenues available to recover the remaining amount owed to you and address any potential illegal activities that have taken place.Remember to gather and organize all relevant documents and evidence, such as bank statements, transaction records, and any other correspondence that supports your claims. This information will be valuable for your lawyer to assess the situation accurately.I hope this initial guidance helps you understand the potential legal implications and the steps you can take. It is important to consult with a professional lawyer who can provide you with personalized advice based on your specific circumstances. They will be in the best position to guide you through the legal process.Wishing you the best of luck in resolving this matter satisfactorily.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Father file case on sons self acquired property",
    "answer": "I understand your concerns regarding the property dispute with your father and brother. Here are some points to consider:Mediation: Mediation is an alternative dispute resolution process where a neutral third party helps facilitate negotiations between the parties involved in a dispute. While your lawyer may suggest mediation as a way to potentially resolve the dispute amicably, participation in mediation is voluntary. You have the right to decline mediation if you believe it will not lead to a satisfactory resolution or if you prefer to pursue the matter through the court.Court proceedings: If you choose not to pursue mediation or if mediation does not result in a settlement, the court proceedings will continue. It is within your rights to proceed with the legal process and seek a resolution through the court. Your lawyer should represent your interests and present the evidence and arguments on your behalf.Property ownership: Based on the information you provided, the property appears to be self-acquired by you. You have the necessary documents, such as the sales deed, EC, and bank statements, to prove your ownership. If you can establish that the property was purchased with your own funds and that your father and brother did not contribute financially, it strengthens your case for exclusive ownership.Tenants eviction: If you have valid grounds for eviction, such as non-payment of rent or breach of tenancy agreement, you can consider pursuing the eviction process parallel to the ongoing property dispute. Consult with your lawyer regarding the specific procedures and requirements for evicting tenants in your jurisdiction.NRI representation: As an NRI, you have the right to be informed about the progress of your case and to be involved in the legal proceedings. You can request your lawyer to provide you with regular updates and copies of court documents. If you feel that you are not being adequately represented or if you have concerns about the progress of the case, you may consider engaging a different lawyer or directly contacting the court for information.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Leave and license agreement vs Lease agreeement",
    "answer": "It is general misconception and also wrong notion that in case of lease or license agreement for 11 months the stamp duty is not payable. As per stamp Act every document including lease or license agreement fetch prescribed stamp duty which required to be affixed on document and to give legal entity every document is to be registered. The only difference between lease and license is that in case of license a person is granted license and permitted to use the premises in lieu of monthly license fee and the premises remain with licensor while in case of lease possession is also handed over to the tenant in lieu to monthly rent or lease money. If a document is not properly stamped and registered then such document though can be looked into for corroborating purpose only. In case of dispute court can sent such under stamped or unstained document to registrar of stamp who can impose 10 times penalty beside applicable stamp duty.So in the light of above  your understanding is incorrect and misconstrued about law of land and there is ever catch everywhere in such cases as elaborated by you.Siddharth SrivastavaAdvocate, Delhi1537 AnswersTalk to Advocate Siddharth Srivastava"

    "question": "Leave and license agreement vs Lease agreeement",
    "answer": "Primary distinctions between Lease and Licence:1. A lease is a transfer of an interest in a specific immovable property, while licence is a bare permission, without any transfer of an interest.2. A lease creates an interest in favour of the leassee with respect of the property, but a licence does not create such an interest.3. A lease is both transferable and heritable, a sub tenancy can be created by the tenant and on the death of the tenant, the tenancy can be inherited by his/her legal heir, whereas, licence is neither transferable nor heritable.4. A licence comes to an end with the death of either the grantor or the grantee, since it is a personal contract, but a lease does not comes to an end on either the death of the grantor or grantee.5. A licence can be withdrawn at any time at the pleasure of the grantor but the lease can come to an end only in accordance with the terms and condition stipulated in the contract of tenancy agreement.6. A lease is unaffected by the transfer of the property by sale in favour of a third party. It continues and the purchaser has to wait till the time period for which the tenancy was created is over before he can get the possession, whereas, in case of a licence, if the property is sold to a third party, it comes to n end immediately.In the case ofMunicipal Corporation of Delhi vs. Pradip Oil Corporation and Anr. the Delhi High Court, made an important observation that a mere license does not create interest in the property to which it relates. Lease on the other hand, would amount to transfer of property. License may be personal or contractual.In the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi,it is mandatory to register the leave and license agreement for the rental period of more than 11 months.

    "question": "Leave and license agreement vs Lease agreeement",
    "answer": "Lease Agreement: A lease agreement typically grants exclusive possession and control of the property to the tenant for a specified duration. Here are some pros and cons to consider:Pros:Stability: A lease provides stability as it is usually for a longer duration, such as 1 year or more, and ensures consistent rental income.Rent Increase Control: The lease agreement can include clauses that limit the frequency and amount of rent increases during the lease term.Legal Protections: A lease agreement provides legal protections to both parties, outlining their rights and responsibilities.Cons:Limited Flexibility: A lease agreement restricts the landlord's ability to terminate the tenancy before the specified duration, which may be a disadvantage if the landlord wants to use or sell the property.Longer Vacancy Periods: If a tenant chooses not to renew the lease, there may be a longer period of vacancy between tenants.Leave and License Agreement: A leave and license agreement grants permission or a license to occupy the property for a specific period. Here are some pros and cons to consider:Pros:Flexibility: A leave and license agreement provides more flexibility to the landlord as it allows for the termination of the agreement after the license period expires.Quick Possession: Since the agreement is typically for a shorter duration, the landlord can regain possession of the property relatively quickly if needed.Cons:Uncertainty: A leave and license agreement gives the licensee the right to occupy the property, which means the licensee may have certain rights that can make eviction more challenging compared to a lease agreement.Frequent Renewals: If the licensee wants to continue occupying the property, the agreement may require frequent renewals, resulting in more administrative work and potential negotiation of terms.Regarding the issue of stamp duty, please note that stamp duty laws and regulations can vary by jurisdiction. It's essential to consult with a local lawyer to understand the specific stamp duty requirements and exemptions in your area.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard.Please understand that in your case, the nominee can claim the FD by submitting the death certificate of the account holder and KYC documents. The nominee also has to submit prescribed identity proof. You can retain the entire SB account.Upon the death of the joint account holder, the FD value can be claimed in either of the following ways in different scenarios.- Either or survivor joint account: The survivor can continue with the FD account after producing the death certificate of the primary account holder.-Jointly or survivor account: The survivor can keep up the FD account till maturity and assume its ownership after submitting the death certificate of the primary account holder.-Former or survivor joint account: Former here means the primary account holder. Upon his/her death, the survivor can assume FD account ownership after submitting the death certificate of the primary account holder.-Anyone or survivor joint account: After the demise of the primary account holder, the next member can assume the primary role till FD maturity. In the case of more than two account holders, the next member needs the consent of all account holders for this transition.Note that if a Hindu female (mother) dies without a will, then the property is divided among legal heirs as per theHindu Succession Act's provisions. The legal heirs are: Husband, sons and daughters (if predeceased, their children).Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "question": "Nominee of accounts  and house property",
    "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about the loss of your mother. I'll provide you with some general guidance.Regarding the distribution of your mother's assets, here are some general points to consider:Fixed Deposits (FD) and Savings Bank (SB) Account: As you mentioned, you are the major nominee for both the FDs and the SB account. If you are the nominee, you may have the legal right to the proceeds of those accounts. However, it's important to understand that being a nominee does not necessarily mean you become the sole owner of the assets. The nominee is often considered as a custodian of the assets until the legal heirs are determined.House: Since the house was constructed by your father and your mother was the caretaker, it's essential to review the property documents to determine the ownership structure. If your mother was the sole owner, the property may be part of her estate and subject to distribution among the legal heirs. In such cases, it's advisable to consult with a lawyer to understand the specific laws and regulations in your jurisdiction regarding the division of property among legal heirs.Gold and other assets: Similar to the house, the gold and other assets would generally form part of your mother's estate. In the absence of a will or specific instructions, they would typically be divided equally among the legal heirs.While it's important to consider your mother's intentions and the care provided by you and your wife, it's crucial to understand that the final distribution of assets should generally adhere to the applicable laws. Consulting with a lawyer who specializes in inheritance and property laws can help you navigate the legal aspects and ensure a fair and proper distribution of assets..Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Land divided and sold to multiple buyers",
    "answer": "Dear client,In this scenario, the division of the land into two portions of 300 sq yards and 150 sq yards indicates that there are two separate buyers involved. The distribution of the original copies and certified copies of the link documents may vary depending on the agreement between the parties involved and the customary practices in the jurisdiction where the transaction takes place. However, here is a general understanding:Original Copies of Link Documents: Typically, the original copies of link documents, such as the title deed, previous sale deeds, and other relevant documents establishing the chain of ownership, are handed over to the buyer who purchases the larger portion of the land, in this case, buyer1 with 300 sq yards. The larger portion is often deemed more significant and thus granted the original copies.Certified Copies of Link Documents: The buyer who purchases the smaller portion of the land, buyer2 with 150 sq yards, usually receives certified copies of the link documents. These certified copies serve as evidence of ownership and provide necessary information about the history of the land's ownership.It's important to note that the actual distribution of the documents can be influenced by the agreement between the parties involved or specific circumstances surrounding the transaction. It is advisable to consult with a real estate lawyer or legal professional to ensure compliance with local laws and regulations and to clarify the specific terms and conditions of the land sale agreement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "If buyer 2 receives only certified copies of the relevant documents, it may have some impact on the sale prospects in the future. Original documents are generally preferred and considered more reliable during property transactions. Having only certified copies may raise concerns for potential buyers about the authenticity and genuineness of the documents.To address this concern, it is advisable for buyer 1 and buyer 2 to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) or agreement that outlines the rights and obligations regarding the original link document. The MOU can specify that in case of any future necessity, such as the sale of the 150 sq yard land by buyer 2, the party possessing the original link document should provide it to facilitate the transaction.This agreement can help ensure transparency, clarity, and trust between the parties involved and mitigate potential disputes or complications in the future.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Multiple Buyers: In case there is more than one buyer, theneach buyer shall deduct TDS from his share of sale consideration. However for the purpose of eligibility of TDS provisions, total value of the property shall be considered.If a property has more than one buyer and/or seller, you need to fill in separate Form 26QB for each set of buyer and seller. The details of all buyers and sellers, have to be submitted in each Form 26QB. So,you need to file form 26QB for each buyer .The seller’s capital gains would get calculated by the income tax department and would provide the certificate for nil or lower deduction of the TDS relied on the capital gains which comes from the property sale.The seller is needed to furnish the same certificate to the buyer and the buyer would deduct the TDS under the rates given in the income tax certificate.Towards the case, this certificate is not taken via seller from the income tax department. The TDS must be deducted from the total sale price and not on the capital gains. Thus it is crucial for the seller to get the certificate from the income tax officer.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Mother is Co Owner (housewife)- TDS Certificate Required?",
    "answer": "As an NRI buying a property with your mother as a co-owner, it's important to consider the relevant tax regulations and consult with a qualified tax professional or chartered accountant who specializes in NRI taxation to get accurate and up-to-date advice based on your specific circumstances. They will be able to guide you through the process and ensure compliance with the applicable tax laws.Regarding the TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) certificate, it's generally required when purchasing property from an NRI seller. The TDS rate for such transactions is typically 20% (plus applicable surcharges and cess) as per the Income Tax Act. However, there may be provisions for lower TDS rates or exemptions based on specific circumstances or if the buyer has obtained a certificate for a lower deduction or exemption from the Income Tax Department.The requirement for a TAN (Tax Deduction and Collection Account Number) typically applies to entities that are deducting or collecting tax at source. In the case of individuals, a TAN is generally not required unless they are conducting business or professional activities that mandate TDS compliance.Regarding the specific advice given by your friend about obtaining the TDS certificate in your mother's name, it's crucial to consult a tax professional who is familiar with your situation and the dispensation you have applied for with the Income Tax Department. They will be able to assess whether it is necessary or beneficial to obtain the TDS certificate in your mother's name, taking into account the applicable regulations and the specific dispensation you have sought.In summary, consulting with a qualified tax professional is strongly recommended to ensure that you understand and comply with the tax obligations associated with purchasing property as an NRI. They will be able to provide personalized advice based on your circumstances and guide you through the process of obtaining the necessary TDS certificate, if required.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

They can advise you on the appropriate steps to request the court to dispose of the case or expedite the proceedings. This may involve filing an application or petition with the court, explaining the reasons for seeking a prompt resolution.Filing two DV cases: Generally, it is possible for a person to file multiple cases under the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005, if they allege different incidents or instances ofdomestic violence. However, it is important to note that the specific provisions of the law and the legal requirements may vary depending on your jurisdiction. It would be best to consult with your lawyer to understand the applicable laws and regulations in your situation.Requesting the Judge to dispose of the second DV case: Similar to the first case, if you believe that the second DV case is duplicative or lacks merit, you can discuss this concern with your lawyer. They can guide you on the appropriate legal steps to address the issue. This may involve requesting the court to dismiss the second case or consolidate it with the first case, depending on the circumstances.Filing a misconduct case against the prosecution attorney: If you believe that the prosecution attorney has acted unethically or inappropriately, you may consider filing a complaint with the appropriate Bar Council or legal authority in your jurisdiction.

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard.Multiple proceedings on same cause of action are abuse of court process. A cause of action is the technical legal name for the set of facts which give rise to a claim enforceable in court. It is a legally recognized wrong that creates the right to sue. Each cause of action consists of points the plaintiff must prove and all of these elements must be satisfied in order to take court action.No two cases on same facts are maintainable. You can request the judge to dispose it and impose exorbitant cost. In case of Central Bureau of Investigation, Hyderabad Vs. K.Narayana decided in 2012, Hon’ble Supreme Court has ruled that a lawyer cannot be prosecuted for giving wrong advice to a bank unless there was proof to show that he was part of a conspiracy to defraud the bank.

    "question": "Divide construction property",
    "answer": "Dear client, below I have provided some important information.Dividing the property equally: To divide the property equally among the three brothers, you have a few options.a) Partition Deed: A partition deed is a legal document that allows for the division of jointly owned property. It can be used to allocate specific portions of the property to each brother, specifying their respective rights and responsibilities. This can be a tax-efficient solution as it ensures each brother receives his fair share without additional tax implications.b) Will: If your mother is willing, she can draft a will that clearly states her intentions to divide the property equally among her three sons. However, it's important to consider the potential tax implications of inheriting the property through a will, as inheritance tax laws vary by jurisdiction.c) Registration of individual floors: Another option could be to register each floor or apartment in the name of each brother individually. This would provide individual ownership and may simplify the process of selling individual units in the future. However, it's crucial to consult with a local attorney to understand the legal and tax implications of this option.Selling the property in the future: If you wish to sell the property in the future, the method of sale would depend on how the property was divided among the brothers.If a partition deed was executed, each brother would have a specified portion of the property in his name, allowing for independent sale of their respective portions.If the property was divided through a will, the property would pass to the brothers as per the terms of the will. To sell the property, the brothers would need to follow the legal procedures and requirements for selling inherited property.If individual floors were registered in each brother's name, they would have independent ownership, and selling their respective units would be similar to selling any other individual property.In any case, it is advisable to consult with a local attorney to understand the specific legal requirements and procedures for selling property in your jurisdiction.Stilt parking and roof rights: To address the issue of stilt parking and roof rights, it would be advisable to have a clear agreement or documentation that outlines the rights and responsibilities of each brother. This agreement could specify the allocated parking spaces for each unit and any restrictions or guidelines for the use of the roof area. Having a legally binding agreement can help prevent conflicts in the future and ensure that everyone understands their rights and obligations.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If the Will comes to force, then it can be executed for the remaining properties as on the date of death.If you suspect the transfer of certain properties by settlement was done fraudulently then you can challenge the same with the support of substantial documentary evidence to prove the fraudulent activities.As a matter of fact your grandmother chose your grandfather as first beneficiary, though it was a life interest alone.It is not known what suit has been filed and why you people did not take any action to restrain your grandfather from alienating the other properties during the pendency of this litigation.You should have filed an injunction petition simultaneously.Further the stage of the case as well as the pleadings from your side to protect your interests are also not known hence any advise rendered now in this regard may be a misguidance, therefore you may be in touch with your own lawyer on all such further issues.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Will and settlement forgery",
    "answer": "Dear client,From the information you've provided, it appears that there are multiple legal issues involved, including the validity of the will, the alleged fraudulent settlement, and the sale of the properties. Proving fraud can be challenging, as it requires substantial evidence and legal arguments. The lack of medical records for your grandmother's health and the uncertainty surrounding the fabrication of the settlement may complicate matters.To challenge the sale and potentially nullify it, you may need to present evidence and arguments to demonstrate that the sale was invalid or conducted unlawfully. This may include proving that the settlement was fraudulent, establishing that your grandfather did not have the legal right to sell the properties, or showing that the sale was made under duress or undue influence. A skilled attorney can guide you through the process and help you build a strong legal case.Regarding the priority between the will and the settlement, the specific language and terms of each document, as well as the applicable laws in your jurisdiction, will determine their legal standing. An attorney familiar with property and inheritance laws in your area can review the documents and advise you on their impact and validity.It is worth noting that legal proceedings can be lengthy, complex, and costly. The outcome of any legal case depends on the specific facts and evidence presented, as well as the interpretation and application of the law by the court. Consulting with a lawyer will give you a better understanding of the legal possibilities and the likelihood of success in your particular situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Land divided and sold to multiple buyers",
    "answer": "Dear client,In this scenario, the division of the land into two portions of 300 sq yards and 150 sq yards indicates that there are two separate buyers involved. The distribution of the original copies and certified copies of the link documents may vary depending on the agreement between the parties involved and the customary practices in the jurisdiction where the transaction takes place. However, here is a general understanding:Original Copies of Link Documents: Typically, the original copies of link documents, such as the title deed, previous sale deeds, and other relevant documents establishing the chain of ownership, are handed over to the buyer who purchases the larger portion of the land, in this case, buyer1 with 300 sq yards. The larger portion is often deemed more significant and thus granted the original copies.Certified Copies of Link Documents: The buyer who purchases the smaller portion of the land, buyer2 with 150 sq yards, usually receives certified copies of the link documents. These certified copies serve as evidence of ownership and provide necessary information about the history of the land's ownership.It's important to note that the actual distribution of the documents can be influenced by the agreement between the parties involved or specific circumstances surrounding the transaction. It is advisable to consult with a real estate lawyer or legal professional to ensure compliance with local laws and regulations and to clarify the specific terms and conditions of the land sale agreement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If he sells the entire holding, a suitable narration needs to be made stating clearly which one of the buyers gets the original and which other the certified copy.

    "answer": "If buyer 2 receives only certified copies of the relevant documents, it may have some impact on the sale prospects in the future. Original documents are generally preferred and considered more reliable during property transactions. Having only certified copies may raise concerns for potential buyers about the authenticity and genuineness of the documents.To address this concern, it is advisable for buyer 1 and buyer 2 to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) or agreement that outlines the rights and obligations regarding the original link document. The MOU can specify that in case of any future necessity, such as the sale of the 150 sq yard land by buyer 2, the party possessing the original link document should provide it to facilitate the transaction.This agreement can help ensure transparency, clarity, and trust between the parties involved and mitigate potential disputes or complications in the future.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Divide construction property",
    "answer": "Dear client, below I have provided some important information.Dividing the property equally: To divide the property equally among the three brothers, you have a few options.a) Partition Deed: A partition deed is a legal document that allows for the division of jointly owned property. It can be used to allocate specific portions of the property to each brother, specifying their respective rights and responsibilities. This can be a tax-efficient solution as it ensures each brother receives his fair share without additional tax implications.b) Will: If your mother is willing, she can draft a will that clearly states her intentions to divide the property equally among her three sons. However, it's important to consider the potential tax implications of inheriting the property through a will, as inheritance tax laws vary by jurisdiction.c) Registration of individual floors: Another option could be to register each floor or apartment in the name of each brother individually. This would provide individual ownership and may simplify the process of selling individual units in the future. However, it's crucial to consult with a local attorney to understand the legal and tax implications of this option.Selling the property in the future: If you wish to sell the property in the future, the method of sale would depend on how the property was divided among the brothers.If a partition deed was executed, each brother would have a specified portion of the property in his name, allowing for independent sale of their respective portions.If the property was divided through a will, the property would pass to the brothers as per the terms of the will. To sell the property, the brothers would need to follow the legal procedures and requirements for selling inherited property.If individual floors were registered in each brother's name, they would have independent ownership, and selling their respective units would be similar to selling any other individual property.In any case, it is advisable to consult with a local attorney to understand the specific legal requirements and procedures for selling property in your jurisdiction.Stilt parking and roof rights: To address the issue of stilt parking and roof rights, it would be advisable to have a clear agreement or documentation that outlines the rights and responsibilities of each brother. This agreement could specify the allocated parking spaces for each unit and any restrictions or guidelines for the use of the roof area. Having a legally binding agreement can help prevent conflicts in the future and ensure that everyone understands their rights and obligations.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"
