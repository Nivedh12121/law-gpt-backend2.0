Whatever existing documents you have and the documents that stand in the name of the original tenant , would sufficeHowever as rightly apprehended by you the landlord may intentionally create complications by requiring you to get the noc of your aunt and uncle who are the other heirs of your GM who was the original tenant.However if they are ok and consenting then you can always take their consent affidavit for record for submission to the landlord or any other authorityI don't know under which regulation of the DCPR 2034 the property can be taken up for redevelopment since its held by two entities,  the land is owned by the landlord and the flats in the building are owned by the individual tenants (except you) who seem to have formed a societyHowever whenever such redevelopment takes place you will get the benefit of the redevelopment in the form of the new rehab  premises in lieu of the old premises held by you at presentJust because you do not have ownership right over the flat and still hold tenancy rights,  would not mean that you will be denied the redevelopment benefitYou should continue paying the rent to the landlord , even if he refuses and does not issue any receiptYou can write the amount and month on the covering letter that you would send to the landlord which will  be an evidence that you regularly pay the rent. If you want to make payment by UPI ensure that the amount is credited to the correct account standing in the landlord's name. Otherwise you can continue issuing cheque or a DD (for consolidated rent of several months together , say for a year) which is also sufficient. Cheque has a validity period , however when you make a DD the amount would be debited right away to your account. So it's a good thing that you issue DD to the landlord towards rent.Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Dear Client,First, despite the absence of a current Pagdi tenancy agreement, you may still have rights under the original 1974 agreement. Legal action could be necessary to enforce your tenancy and ensure fair treatment during redevelopment. Updating documents from your deceased grandmother’s name to yours is advisable to avoid complications. Bank transactions showing rent payments can be proof if the landlord refuses to provide receipts. Society's registration might be questionable without land ownership transfer, which would affect redevelopment.

    "answer": "Fair Rent, which has different interpretations in different states,deals with the subject of rent that is fair between a landlord and tenant in a particular state.It should be within the range of 8% to 10% of the property value, including construction costs and fixtures. Tenants can approach the court if they feel the rent exceeds this value.No doubt you cannot fix the rent on your own even if you name it as fair rent, the process of law is to be adopted.If the landlord is not accepting the rental amount you can adopt the legally valid method to send the rental amount to his account, and if that also fails then you can approach court with an application to permit you to deposit the rent in the court.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear client,Your situation involves several complex legal aspects related to Pagdi tenancy and redevelopment. Here are the answers to your questions:Possibility of Refusal to Allot New Units:The owner or builder might refuse to allot new units if there is no clear Pagdi tenancy agreement between you and the current landlord. However, your long-term occupancy and the rent receipt from 1988 can serve as evidence of your tenancy. The Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999, protects tenants under the Pagdi system, and you should be eligible for a new unit during redevelopment.Validity of the Old Agreement:The old agreement signed in 1974 between your grandmother and the owner’s grandmother is still valid, even though both parties have passed away. The tenancy rights are typically inherited by legal heirs. The refusal of the landlord to transfer the tenancy agreement to your name, despite encashing the DD, can be contested in court.Eligibility for Redevelopment Benefits:As a Pagdi tenant, you should be eligible for all the benefits during redevelopment, including additional carpet area. The Maharashtra Rent Control Act ensures that tenants are provided with new flats during redevelopment.Requirement of NOC from Relatives:The landlord or builder might ask for an NOC from your aunts and uncle to complicate the situation. However, since they do not have any rights in the unit, you can contest this requirement. It is advisable to consult a legal expert to handle this aspect effectively.Proof of Rent Payment:Bank transactions with descriptions mentioning rent and the month can serve as proof of rent payment in court. If the landlord refuses to accept rent, you can deposit the rent in court through an application in the small causes court.Changing Names on Utility Bills:It is advisable to change the names on the electric, gas, and ration card to your name. This will help establish your continuous occupancy and strengthen your case during redevelopment. The existing Pagdi tenancy agreement under your grandmother’s name should not pose an issue if you have other supporting documents.Documents Required During Redevelopment:The builder might ask for the following documents during redevelopment:Proof of tenancy (old rent receipts, bank transaction records)Identity proof (Aadhar card, PAN card, passport, voter ID)Proof of residence (electricity bill, gas bill, ration card)Legal heir certificate (if applicable)Any correspondence with the landlord regarding tenancyGiven the complexity of your situation, it is highly recommended to consult with a legal expert specializing in tenancy and redevelopment issues to ensure that your rights are protected and to navigate the legal processes effectively.Thank you.

On the other hand, if you prefer retaining control over the property during your lifetime and are okay with the time consuming and costly probate process, a Will with Probate offers flexibility but involves higher costs and potential delays.

    "answer": "From the information provided in the query, assuming it's correct, you should have filed a PIL rather than a writ petitionIt appears that the petition was listed on board and was called out but your advocate was not presentThe court dismissed the petition for want of prosecution as nobody appeared for the PetitionerThe court could have passed over the matter instead of dismissing itAs there is a restoration application filed and pending , the court will decide the sameYou need to know that you can maintain a bar council complaint against the advocate only if he had circulated the petition for urgent hearing and despite that he absented himself when the matter was called out. I don't know what reason is given in the restoration application,  but that also needs to be factored in. May be the advocate was actually in some genuine personal difficulty due to which he could not appear when the matter was called out.However if he deliberately absented himself then that amounts to a gross professional misconduct against which the bar council will take disciplinary action as per lawI am curious to know what was the settlement offer that your erstwhile advocate offered and for whatYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Given the situation of misconduct by your advocate, it is advisable to file a detailed complaint with the Bar Council of West Bengal. If the Bar Council finds your advocate guilty of misconduct, you may have grounds to seek redressal and damages for any losses incurred due to his negligence or unethical behaviour. Consider engaging a new advocate who id diligent and committed to representing your interests effectively. Ensure your new advocate is fully informed about the previous advocate’s misconduct and the details of your case.With your new advocate, draft a detailed writ petition highlighting the illegal constructions and violations of building, fire safety, and lift rules. Consider filing a PIL if the illegal construction poses a significant risk to public safety. File RTI applications with KMC, Fire Department, and other relevant authorities to gather evidence and official records. You can also consider filing complaints with the KMC, Fire Safety Department, and Lift Inspectorate.

    "question": "Partition suit - clarification",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The signature on the regular piece of paper acknowledging the receipt of the jewellery can be legally significant. It might be interpreted as Meena accepting that she has received her share of the jewellery. This could potentially weaken her claim in the ongoing partition suit, as Kumar could argue that Meena has already received her due share and has acknowledged it in writing. Given Meena's concerns about Kumar's reliability and the ongoing court case, it is generally not advisable to sign any documents or accept the jewellery without taking proper precautions. Signing the receipt could be construed as an acknowledgment of settlement outside the court, which might adversely affect her legal standing in the ongoing partition suit. If Meena decides to proceed with signing and receiving the jewellery, she should ask for a receipt specifying the items being received and sign it in the presence of witnesses. If possible, specify that the receipt of the jewellery does not affect the ongoing partition suit or any other legal claims Meena may have. If proper steps are not taken Kumar might claim that the receipt of the jewellery constitutes a full and final settlement by presenting the signed receipt in court.Yes, it is possible that Kumar could claim that a compromise discussion is underway or that a settlement has been reached if Meena signs the receipt. He might request the court to cancel or halt the proceedings based on the alleged settlement. This could complicate Meena's legal standing in the case. Hence, Meena should ideally avoid signing any documents until the court case is resolved. If Meena decides to sign, she must take the safety steps mentioned above to protect her interests. She should explicitly state in the receipt that the acknowledgment of the jewellery does not settle any ongoing disputes or legal claims.

The Supreme Court will consider whether there are substantial grounds to admit the SLP and potentially overturn the High Court's decision.

Ensure you have competent legal representation experienced in land acquisition cases.

    "question": "Surrender of Indian Passport after acquiring British Citizenship",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Using your Indian passport after acquiring British citizenship can lead to legal complications as per Indian law. According to Section 9 of the Indian Citizenship Act, 1955, if you voluntarily acquire the citizenship of another country, you automatically lose your Indian citizenship. This means that once you acquire British citizenship, your Indian citizenship is terminated. If you use your Indian passport after acquiring British citizenship, you are effectively using a passport that you are no longer legally entitled to hold. This is illegal and can lead to penalties, including fines and imprisonment. Hence, it is advisable to not use your Indian passport for travel after acquiring British citizenship. Instead, use your British passport or apply for a British emergency travel document if you need to travel urgently. As soon as possible after acquiring British citizenship, surrender your Indian passport to the nearest Indian consulate or embassy and obtain a surrender certificate. Once you have surrendered your Indian passport, consider applying for OCI status, which allows you visa-free travel to India and some other privileges.

    "question": "Partition suit - clarification",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The signature on the regular piece of paper acknowledging the receipt of the jewellery can be legally significant. It might be interpreted as Meena accepting that she has received her share of the jewellery. This could potentially weaken her claim in the ongoing partition suit, as Kumar could argue that Meena has already received her due share and has acknowledged it in writing. Given Meena's concerns about Kumar's reliability and the ongoing court case, it is generally not advisable to sign any documents or accept the jewellery without taking proper precautions. Signing the receipt could be construed as an acknowledgment of settlement outside the court, which might adversely affect her legal standing in the ongoing partition suit. If Meena decides to proceed with signing and receiving the jewellery, she should ask for a receipt specifying the items being received and sign it in the presence of witnesses. If possible, specify that the receipt of the jewellery does not affect the ongoing partition suit or any other legal claims Meena may have. If proper steps are not taken Kumar might claim that the receipt of the jewellery constitutes a full and final settlement by presenting the signed receipt in court.Yes, it is possible that Kumar could claim that a compromise discussion is underway or that a settlement has been reached if Meena signs the receipt. He might request the court to cancel or halt the proceedings based on the alleged settlement. This could complicate Meena's legal standing in the case. Hence, Meena should ideally avoid signing any documents until the court case is resolved. If Meena decides to sign, she must take the safety steps mentioned above to protect her interests. She should explicitly state in the receipt that the acknowledgment of the jewellery does not settle any ongoing disputes or legal claims.

    "question": "Trademark dispute: can I challenge a recently registered trademark that we have used since 2018",
    "answer": "If another company alleges it was using the business name before you, it is necessary for you to prove otherwise. You must be able to show you were using the name before the other company claiming it. The best way to do so is to produce records, product labels, or advertising that predates the other company’s claim.If you are not required to register and if you have not trademarked your business name, you still have rights to it that may be enforceable. Not only that, but the other company’s name does not need to be identical for you to charge infringement. However, you need more than a similarity of the name to win your case.You need to show that both your business and the one sharing your name are sufficiently similar or related that it causes confusion with customers.A potential remedy that could be a win-win for both parties is if you consent to another company using the same name. If you determine that there will be no unfair competition and the other company courteously requests it, you canconsent in writingto allow the other business to use the same name or a similar one to yours.Acease-and-desist letteris the first remedy to use if you have not given consent for another business to use your name. It must be carefully worded, so the other business is more willing to comply. Unless you are prepared to take it to court, you should keep the tone neutral and polite. It is possible they were unaware of your company when they began using the name; give them the benefit of the doubt while making it clear you wish them to stop.If two companies are in entirely different industries, they can have the same name. For instance, “Delta” is a trademarked name for both an airline and a faucet manufacturer.Only trademark registration can provide legal rights of exclusive use of a mark under the trademark class it was registered under. Company or LLP registration on the other hand creates a legal entity for undertaking business activities.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Trademark dispute: can I challenge a recently registered trademark that we have used since 2018",
    "answer": "Yes, you can file a case against Milktech for illegally registering the trademark \"Lactodaily.\" Since you have been using the trademark continuously since 2018 and have evidence to prove it (purchase orders, supply notes, and tax invoices), you fall under the protection of Section 34 of the Trade Marks Act, which safeguards the rights of prior users.Legal Grounds:Section 34: Saving for Vested RightsPrior Continuous Use: You have been using the trademark \"Lactodaily\" since 2018, which is prior to Milktech's use and registration in 2021.Protection Against Interference: Milktech, as the current registered owner, cannot interfere with or stop your use of the trademark \"Lactodaily\" since your use dates back to a time before their registration and use.Section 28: Rights of the Registered ProprietorWhile Section 28 gives the registered proprietor exclusive rights to use the trademark, Section 34 provides an exception for prior users like you. This means your continuous use of \"Lactodaily\" since 2018 grants you protection even against a registered proprietor.Likelihood of Court Ruling in Your Favor:Given the legal framework:Evidence of Prior Use: Your documentation from 2018 (purchase orders, supply notes, and tax invoices) supports your claim of prior use.Section 34: This section explicitly protects the rights of prior users, which strengthens your case.Previous Case Reference:In the case of Société des Produits Nestlé, S.A and Another v. Kaira District Cooperative Milk Producers Union Ltd. and Another [ FAO(OS) (COMM), 34 of 2018], the court ruled in favor of Nestlé, who were prior users of the trademark \"A+\" despite Kaira being the registered proprietor. The court allowed Nestlé to continue using the trademark based on their prior use.Similarly, your situation aligns with Nestlé's case, where the court upheld the rights of the prior user over the registered proprietor due to evidence of prior use.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It would thus appear that the death of customer terminates his authority to order payment and operates as a countermand of the outstanding cheque.2) On the moment of demise of customer, the bank, in terms of its contract, is holding the money not to the order of the deceased customer, but to the order of his nominees or legal representatives. The bank cannot thus act on the order of the deceased customer. The cheque, which has been held to be merely an order, thus, on demise of drawer, ceases to be a cheque\".

    "question": "Payment received by nominee (legal heir also) of cheque that was signed by account holder before his death",
    "answer": "Dear Client,A nominee is someone who has been appointed to receive funds from an account when the account holder dies. However, a nominee is often regarded as a trustee of the funds for the legal heirs and does not have complete control of the funds.Funds withdrawn from an account following the account holder's death must be utilized in line with the account holder's desires and for legitimate purposes, such as completing last rites and ceremonies.If all legal heirs agreed to the withdrawal and use of the assets, a claim against the nominee is less likely to be successful. However, disagreements may emerge if an heir later withdraws their consent.In the case of Vishin N. Khanchandani v. Vidya Lachmandas Khanchandani & Anr. (2000)[AIR 2000, SC 2747] the Supreme Court clarified the duty of the nominee under Section 45ZA of the Banking Regulation Act of 1949.The nominee serves solely as a trustee for the legal heirs and does not acquire complete ownership of the monies.A nominee has the ability to withdraw funds from the deceased's account, but they must also act as trustee for the legal heirs. The Supreme Court's decision in Vishin N. Khanchandani vs. Vidya Lachmandas Khanchandani & Anr. establishes that a nominee does not have complete control over the funds and must distribute them in accordance with the law. Proper documentation of the heirs' approval, as well as legal assistance, can help to safeguard the nominee from bogus claims.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The Supreme Court will consider whether there are substantial grounds to admit the SLP and potentially overturn the High Court's decision. The chances of the Chandigarh administration succeeding in the Supreme Court will depend on the strength of their arguments regarding the necessity and public purpose of the acquisition, as well as procedural adherence to the 2013 Act. Ensure you have competent legal representation experienced in land acquisition cases. Your defense should focus on emphasizing the High Court's findings, challenging the public necessity behind the acquisition if possible, and ensuring any future acquisition strictly adheres to the 2013 Act's provisions for fair compensation and rehabilitation.

All four children of your grandfather have coparcenary rights in the ancestral property. This means your mother, as a coparcener, has a right to claim her share. And since the property as ancestral, your grandfather had no absolute right to give away the plot to one son without the consent of other coparceners. Your mother can file a suit for partition in the appropriate civil court to claim her share in the ancestral property, including the plot given to one son. Along with the suit for partition, your mother can also seek a declaration that the transaction done by your grandfather in 1953 is void and seek an injunction to prevent further alienation of the property. Provide all necessary documents proving the ancestral nature of the property, such as the title deeds, revenue records, and any other relevant documents.

    "question": "Probate of Will - Who will sign the surety bond if beneficiary and executor is same person in Will",
    "answer": "A perusal of Section 375 of the ISA clearly shows that the imposition of a condition of security/surety/indemnity bond is in order to indemnify person(s) or safeguard the interests of such persons who may be entitled to the whole or any part of the debt and security. A condition is imposed where the Court comes to the conclusion that it is necessary for any purpose, including any debt to be satisfied, any other claimants, any dues to statutory authorities etc.2) There are a stream of cases, where having regard to the fact that the petitioners in testamentary cases where probate/letters of administration were sought in respect of the estate of the deceased, had been exempted from furnishing Surety Bond/Administration Bond on the ground that the will was in favour of the natural heirs and there was no contest to the request for grant of letters of administration/Probate. It was observed that where the petitioners/applicants were natural heirs/sole beneficiary of the deceased, any order directing the said petitioner(s) to stand as an administrator/surety of the estate of the deceased would amount to their/his standing surety for themselves/himself.3)In a recent decision in the case of Rajesh Sinha and Ors. vs. State in TEST CAS. 84/2011 decided on 06.04.2015, taking note of the judicial precedents on the above aspect, delhi HC  Court had dispensed with the requirement of the petitioner therein furnishing the Administration and Surety Bond by observing as below:-\"9. On a conspectus of the above legal position on the requirement of furnishing a surety and Administration Bond, it may be noted that in a majority of decisions, it has been held that where a sole beneficiary/legatee is involved, the requirement of offering an indemnity bond/surety bond is dispensable for the simple reason that it would be an exercise in futility to call upon a sole beneficiary/legatee under a will that has been duly proved, to furnish an Administration Bond/Surety Bond when the estate of the deceased has been bequeathed in favour of the very same personAjay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98557 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In your situation, where you are both the executor and a beneficiary of the will, you are required to provide an \"Administration cum Surety Bond\" as directed by the court. You can sign the surety bond yourself because you hold dual roles. Typically, this bond ensures that you will administer the estate according to the will's terms and conditions and fulfill any obligations the court sets. However, to provide additional security to the court, you might also consider having a third-party surety co-sign the bond. This third-party surety should be someone reliable who can be a guarantor for the bond, ensuring there is no financial risk to the estate or any discrepancies in administration. In summary, while you can sign the bond yourself, involving an additional surety could offer extra assurance to the court.

The Supreme Court will consider whether there are substantial grounds to admit the SLP and potentially overturn the High Court's decision.

It would thus appear that the death of customer terminates his authority to order payment and operates as a countermand of the outstanding cheque.2) On the moment of demise of customer, the bank, in terms of its contract, is holding the money not to the order of the deceased customer, but to the order of his nominees or legal representatives. The bank cannot thus act on the order of the deceased customer. The cheque, which has been held to be merely an order, thus, on demise of drawer, ceases to be a cheque\".

    "question": "Payment received by nominee (legal heir also) of cheque that was signed by account holder before his death",
    "answer": "Dear Client,A nominee is someone who has been appointed to receive funds from an account when the account holder dies. However, a nominee is often regarded as a trustee of the funds for the legal heirs and does not have complete control of the funds.Funds withdrawn from an account following the account holder's death must be utilized in line with the account holder's desires and for legitimate purposes, such as completing last rites and ceremonies.If all legal heirs agreed to the withdrawal and use of the assets, a claim against the nominee is less likely to be successful. However, disagreements may emerge if an heir later withdraws their consent.In the case of Vishin N. Khanchandani v. Vidya Lachmandas Khanchandani & Anr. (2000)[AIR 2000, SC 2747] the Supreme Court clarified the duty of the nominee under Section 45ZA of the Banking Regulation Act of 1949.The nominee serves solely as a trustee for the legal heirs and does not acquire complete ownership of the monies.A nominee has the ability to withdraw funds from the deceased's account, but they must also act as trustee for the legal heirs. The Supreme Court's decision in Vishin N. Khanchandani vs. Vidya Lachmandas Khanchandani & Anr. establishes that a nominee does not have complete control over the funds and must distribute them in accordance with the law. Proper documentation of the heirs' approval, as well as legal assistance, can help to safeguard the nominee from bogus claims.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Need Infomration",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Since the land was received by your grandfather from his father, it is considered ancestral property. All four children of your grandfather have coparcenary rights in the ancestral property. This means your mother, as a coparcener, has a right to claim her share. And since the property as ancestral, your grandfather had no absolute right to give away the plot to one son without the consent of other coparceners. Your mother can file a suit for partition in the appropriate civil court to claim her share in the ancestral property, including the plot given to one son. Along with the suit for partition, your mother can also seek a declaration that the transaction done by your grandfather in 1953 is void and seek an injunction to prevent further alienation of the property. Provide all necessary documents proving the ancestral nature of the property, such as the title deeds, revenue records, and any other relevant documents. Engage a competent lawyer who specializes in property law to draft and file the suit and represent your mother in court.

Since the land was inherited by your grandfather, it would generally be considered ancestral property. Under Hindu law, ancestral property is typically shared equally among all descendants.To challenge the transaction, your mother can file a partition suit in the relevant civil court, asserting her right to an equal share of the ancestral property. She may need to provide evidence that the property was ancestral and that the transfer of the 1 plot was unjust.Rajveer SinghAdvocate, Ranchi31 AnswersTalk to Advocate Rajveer Singh"

If you want to make payment by UPI ensure that the amount is credited to the correct account standing in the landlord's name. Otherwise you can continue issuing cheque or a DD (for consolidated rent of several months together , say for a year) which is also sufficient. Cheque has a validity period , however when you make a DD the amount would be debited right away to your account.

    "answer": "Dear client,Your situation involves several complex legal aspects related to Pagdi tenancy and redevelopment. Here are the answers to your questions:Possibility of Refusal to Allot New Units:The owner or builder might refuse to allot new units if there is no clear Pagdi tenancy agreement between you and the current landlord. However, your long-term occupancy and the rent receipt from 1988 can serve as evidence of your tenancy. The Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999, protects tenants under the Pagdi system, and you should be eligible for a new unit during redevelopment.Validity of the Old Agreement:The old agreement signed in 1974 between your grandmother and the owner’s grandmother is still valid, even though both parties have passed away. The tenancy rights are typically inherited by legal heirs. The refusal of the landlord to transfer the tenancy agreement to your name, despite encashing the DD, can be contested in court.Eligibility for Redevelopment Benefits:As a Pagdi tenant, you should be eligible for all the benefits during redevelopment, including additional carpet area. The Maharashtra Rent Control Act ensures that tenants are provided with new flats during redevelopment.Requirement of NOC from Relatives:The landlord or builder might ask for an NOC from your aunts and uncle to complicate the situation. However, since they do not have any rights in the unit, you can contest this requirement. It is advisable to consult a legal expert to handle this aspect effectively.Proof of Rent Payment:Bank transactions with descriptions mentioning rent and the month can serve as proof of rent payment in court. If the landlord refuses to accept rent, you can deposit the rent in court through an application in the small causes court.Changing Names on Utility Bills:It is advisable to change the names on the electric, gas, and ration card to your name. This will help establish your continuous occupancy and strengthen your case during redevelopment. The existing Pagdi tenancy agreement under your grandmother’s name should not pose an issue if you have other supporting documents.Documents Required During Redevelopment:The builder might ask for the following documents during redevelopment:Proof of tenancy (old rent receipts, bank transaction records)Identity proof (Aadhar card, PAN card, passport, voter ID)Proof of residence (electricity bill, gas bill, ration card)Legal heir certificate (if applicable)Any correspondence with the landlord regarding tenancyGiven the complexity of your situation, it is highly recommended to consult with a legal expert specializing in tenancy and redevelopment issues to ensure that your rights are protected and to navigate the legal processes effectively.Thank you.

The nominee does not get any title over the property unless such nominee is also an heir of the deceasedAfter your grandparents demise, their 4 children were entitled to the flat. One son (your uncle) was a joint nominee with you and your wife.So all 3 of you were holding the flat IN TRUST for the other heirs of your grandparents (your father and 2 aunts), your uncle doubled up as a joint nominee as well as a co-heirJust by entering name in the share certificate the title does not get completed.Ideally an heirship certificate ought to have been obtained for declaring the heirs of the deceasedNow your uncle died. So his 33.33% would go to his heirs. As he was unmarried, his share would devolve on his siblings as per Shariat.It appears from your query that your father predeceased your uncleSo the uncle's share would go to his 2 sisters. Whether the children of the predeceased brother would get any share from their paternal uncle's estate, I need to check. Will get back.However please note that after your uncle's demise , an heirship certificate should be obtained for declaration of his heirs, so that the title of the persons to whom the property is transferred ultimately , stands completed and there is no issue in future at the time of selling the flatAlso the view of few committee members that the procedure of devolution of uncle's share to his heirs, is the correct legal viewThe view that upon demise of the joint shareholder,  the surviving joint shareholders automatically become the exclusive shareholders is not correct.The flat is held by the parties as tenants in common (co owners) and not as 'joint tenants' (where upon death of any joint tenant, the right survives to the surviving joint tenants). There is a difference between the 2 concepts. In a society , the flat , when held by more than 1 person, is held as tenants in common.Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

The bank cannot thus act on the order of the deceased customer. The cheque, which has been held to be merely an order, thus, on demise of drawer, ceases to be a cheque\".

    "question": "Payment received by nominee (legal heir also) of cheque that was signed by account holder before his death",
    "answer": "Dear Client,A nominee is someone who has been appointed to receive funds from an account when the account holder dies. However, a nominee is often regarded as a trustee of the funds for the legal heirs and does not have complete control of the funds.Funds withdrawn from an account following the account holder's death must be utilized in line with the account holder's desires and for legitimate purposes, such as completing last rites and ceremonies.If all legal heirs agreed to the withdrawal and use of the assets, a claim against the nominee is less likely to be successful. However, disagreements may emerge if an heir later withdraws their consent.In the case of Vishin N. Khanchandani v. Vidya Lachmandas Khanchandani & Anr. (2000)[AIR 2000, SC 2747] the Supreme Court clarified the duty of the nominee under Section 45ZA of the Banking Regulation Act of 1949.The nominee serves solely as a trustee for the legal heirs and does not acquire complete ownership of the monies.A nominee has the ability to withdraw funds from the deceased's account, but they must also act as trustee for the legal heirs. The Supreme Court's decision in Vishin N. Khanchandani vs. Vidya Lachmandas Khanchandani & Anr. establishes that a nominee does not have complete control over the funds and must distribute them in accordance with the law. Proper documentation of the heirs' approval, as well as legal assistance, can help to safeguard the nominee from bogus claims.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

All four children of your grandfather have coparcenary rights in the ancestral property. This means your mother, as a coparcener, has a right to claim her share. And since the property as ancestral, your grandfather had no absolute right to give away the plot to one son without the consent of other coparceners. Your mother can file a suit for partition in the appropriate civil court to claim her share in the ancestral property, including the plot given to one son. Along with the suit for partition, your mother can also seek a declaration that the transaction done by your grandfather in 1953 is void and seek an injunction to prevent further alienation of the property. Provide all necessary documents proving the ancestral nature of the property, such as the title deeds, revenue records, and any other relevant documents. Engage a competent lawyer who specializes in property law to draft and file the suit and represent your mother in court.

Along with the above-mentioned changes, the 2019 Act has also changed the means for the determination of the pecuniary jurisdiction on the basis of the valuation of goods and services payable as consideration, unlike the 1986 Act where, pecuniary jurisdiction was determined by the value of the goods and services as well as the compensation sought, therefore not escalating the amount of compensation claimed to bring the complaint within the pecuniary jurisdiction of State or National Commission.For determining the value of the complaint, the aggregate value of the goods or services and compensation claimed by the complainant. This was held in the case of “M/s Pyaridevi Chabiraj Steels Pvt. Ltd. v. National Insurance Corporation Ltd.Therefore you can file the case in the district commission itself.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Query regarding a medical negligence case",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Yes, you are correct in your interpretation based on Section 34(1) of theConsumer Protection Act, 2019. The pecuniary jurisdiction of the District Commission is determined by the value of the goods or services paid as consideration, not the compensation claimed. Since the hospital bill (the value of the services paid as consideration) is ₹26 lakhs, it falls within the jurisdiction of the District Consumer Forum, which handles cases where the value does not exceed ₹1 crore. Hence, you should file your complaint in the District Consumer Forum, irrespective of the compensation amount of ₹3 crores you are claiming.

    "question": "Trademark dispute: can I challenge a recently registered trademark that we have used since 2018",
    "answer": "If another company alleges it was using the business name before you, it is necessary for you to prove otherwise. You must be able to show you were using the name before the other company claiming it. The best way to do so is to produce records, product labels, or advertising that predates the other company’s claim.If you are not required to register and if you have not trademarked your business name, you still have rights to it that may be enforceable. Not only that, but the other company’s name does not need to be identical for you to charge infringement. However, you need more than a similarity of the name to win your case.You need to show that both your business and the one sharing your name are sufficiently similar or related that it causes confusion with customers.A potential remedy that could be a win-win for both parties is if you consent to another company using the same name. If you determine that there will be no unfair competition and the other company courteously requests it, you canconsent in writingto allow the other business to use the same name or a similar one to yours.Acease-and-desist letteris the first remedy to use if you have not given consent for another business to use your name. It must be carefully worded, so the other business is more willing to comply. Unless you are prepared to take it to court, you should keep the tone neutral and polite. It is possible they were unaware of your company when they began using the name; give them the benefit of the doubt while making it clear you wish them to stop.If two companies are in entirely different industries, they can have the same name. For instance, “Delta” is a trademarked name for both an airline and a faucet manufacturer.Only trademark registration can provide legal rights of exclusive use of a mark under the trademark class it was registered under. Company or LLP registration on the other hand creates a legal entity for undertaking business activities.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Trademark dispute: can I challenge a recently registered trademark that we have used since 2018",
    "answer": "Yes, you can file a case against Milktech for illegally registering the trademark \"Lactodaily.\" Since you have been using the trademark continuously since 2018 and have evidence to prove it (purchase orders, supply notes, and tax invoices), you fall under the protection of Section 34 of the Trade Marks Act, which safeguards the rights of prior users.Legal Grounds:Section 34: Saving for Vested RightsPrior Continuous Use: You have been using the trademark \"Lactodaily\" since 2018, which is prior to Milktech's use and registration in 2021.Protection Against Interference: Milktech, as the current registered owner, cannot interfere with or stop your use of the trademark \"Lactodaily\" since your use dates back to a time before their registration and use.Section 28: Rights of the Registered ProprietorWhile Section 28 gives the registered proprietor exclusive rights to use the trademark, Section 34 provides an exception for prior users like you. This means your continuous use of \"Lactodaily\" since 2018 grants you protection even against a registered proprietor.Likelihood of Court Ruling in Your Favor:Given the legal framework:Evidence of Prior Use: Your documentation from 2018 (purchase orders, supply notes, and tax invoices) supports your claim of prior use.Section 34: This section explicitly protects the rights of prior users, which strengthens your case.Previous Case Reference:In the case of Société des Produits Nestlé, S.A and Another v. Kaira District Cooperative Milk Producers Union Ltd. and Another [ FAO(OS) (COMM), 34 of 2018], the court ruled in favor of Nestlé, who were prior users of the trademark \"A+\" despite Kaira being the registered proprietor. The court allowed Nestlé to continue using the trademark based on their prior use.Similarly, your situation aligns with Nestlé's case, where the court upheld the rights of the prior user over the registered proprietor due to evidence of prior use.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The bank cannot thus act on the order of the deceased customer. The cheque, which has been held to be merely an order, thus, on demise of drawer, ceases to be a cheque\".

    "question": "Payment received by nominee (legal heir also) of cheque that was signed by account holder before his death",
    "answer": "Dear Client,A nominee is someone who has been appointed to receive funds from an account when the account holder dies. However, a nominee is often regarded as a trustee of the funds for the legal heirs and does not have complete control of the funds.Funds withdrawn from an account following the account holder's death must be utilized in line with the account holder's desires and for legitimate purposes, such as completing last rites and ceremonies.If all legal heirs agreed to the withdrawal and use of the assets, a claim against the nominee is less likely to be successful. However, disagreements may emerge if an heir later withdraws their consent.In the case of Vishin N. Khanchandani v. Vidya Lachmandas Khanchandani & Anr. (2000)[AIR 2000, SC 2747] the Supreme Court clarified the duty of the nominee under Section 45ZA of the Banking Regulation Act of 1949.The nominee serves solely as a trustee for the legal heirs and does not acquire complete ownership of the monies.A nominee has the ability to withdraw funds from the deceased's account, but they must also act as trustee for the legal heirs. The Supreme Court's decision in Vishin N. Khanchandani vs. Vidya Lachmandas Khanchandani & Anr. establishes that a nominee does not have complete control over the funds and must distribute them in accordance with the law. Proper documentation of the heirs' approval, as well as legal assistance, can help to safeguard the nominee from bogus claims.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This means your continuous use of \"Lactodaily\" since 2018 grants you protection even against a registered proprietor.Likelihood of Court Ruling in Your Favor:Given the legal framework:Evidence of Prior Use: Your documentation from 2018 (purchase orders, supply notes, and tax invoices) supports your claim of prior use.Section 34: This section explicitly protects the rights of prior users, which strengthens your case.Previous Case Reference:In the case of Société des Produits Nestlé, S.A and Another v. Kaira District Cooperative Milk Producers Union Ltd. and Another [ FAO(OS) (COMM), 34 of 2018], the court ruled in favor of Nestlé, who were prior users of the trademark \"A+\" despite Kaira being the registered proprietor. The court allowed Nestlé to continue using the trademark based on their prior use.Similarly, your situation aligns with Nestlé's case, where the court upheld the rights of the prior user over the registered proprietor due to evidence of prior use.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "On death of a customer, the order of the customer comes to an end and only if the banker pays the cheque before notice of death, is it valid. It would thus appear that the death of customer terminates his authority to order payment and operates as a countermand of the outstanding cheque.2) On the moment of demise of customer, the bank, in terms of its contract, is holding the money not to the order of the deceased customer, but to the order of his nominees or legal representatives. The bank cannot thus act on the order of the deceased customer. The cheque, which has been held to be merely an order, thus, on demise of drawer, ceases to be a cheque\". Therefore, no money can be withdrawn form the account of deceased except under the order of legal representative or nominees.Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98557 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "question": "Payment received by nominee (legal heir also) of cheque that was signed by account holder before his death",
    "answer": "Dear Client,A nominee is someone who has been appointed to receive funds from an account when the account holder dies. However, a nominee is often regarded as a trustee of the funds for the legal heirs and does not have complete control of the funds.Funds withdrawn from an account following the account holder's death must be utilized in line with the account holder's desires and for legitimate purposes, such as completing last rites and ceremonies.If all legal heirs agreed to the withdrawal and use of the assets, a claim against the nominee is less likely to be successful. However, disagreements may emerge if an heir later withdraws their consent.In the case of Vishin N. Khanchandani v. Vidya Lachmandas Khanchandani & Anr. (2000)[AIR 2000, SC 2747] the Supreme Court clarified the duty of the nominee under Section 45ZA of the Banking Regulation Act of 1949.The nominee serves solely as a trustee for the legal heirs and does not acquire complete ownership of the monies.A nominee has the ability to withdraw funds from the deceased's account, but they must also act as trustee for the legal heirs. The Supreme Court's decision in Vishin N. Khanchandani vs. Vidya Lachmandas Khanchandani & Anr. establishes that a nominee does not have complete control over the funds and must distribute them in accordance with the law. Proper documentation of the heirs' approval, as well as legal assistance, can help to safeguard the nominee from bogus claims.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Along with the above-mentioned changes, the 2019 Act has also changed the means for the determination of the pecuniary jurisdiction on the basis of the valuation of goods and services payable as consideration, unlike the 1986 Act where, pecuniary jurisdiction was determined by the value of the goods and services as well as the compensation sought, therefore not escalating the amount of compensation claimed to bring the complaint within the pecuniary jurisdiction of State or National Commission.For determining the value of the complaint, the aggregate value of the goods or services and compensation claimed by the complainant.

    "question": "Trademark dispute: can I challenge a recently registered trademark that we have used since 2018",
    "answer": "If another company alleges it was using the business name before you, it is necessary for you to prove otherwise. You must be able to show you were using the name before the other company claiming it. The best way to do so is to produce records, product labels, or advertising that predates the other company’s claim.If you are not required to register and if you have not trademarked your business name, you still have rights to it that may be enforceable. Not only that, but the other company’s name does not need to be identical for you to charge infringement. However, you need more than a similarity of the name to win your case.You need to show that both your business and the one sharing your name are sufficiently similar or related that it causes confusion with customers.A potential remedy that could be a win-win for both parties is if you consent to another company using the same name. If you determine that there will be no unfair competition and the other company courteously requests it, you canconsent in writingto allow the other business to use the same name or a similar one to yours.Acease-and-desist letteris the first remedy to use if you have not given consent for another business to use your name. It must be carefully worded, so the other business is more willing to comply. Unless you are prepared to take it to court, you should keep the tone neutral and polite. It is possible they were unaware of your company when they began using the name; give them the benefit of the doubt while making it clear you wish them to stop.If two companies are in entirely different industries, they can have the same name. For instance, “Delta” is a trademarked name for both an airline and a faucet manufacturer.Only trademark registration can provide legal rights of exclusive use of a mark under the trademark class it was registered under. Company or LLP registration on the other hand creates a legal entity for undertaking business activities.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Trademark dispute: can I challenge a recently registered trademark that we have used since 2018",
    "answer": "Yes, you can file a case against Milktech for illegally registering the trademark \"Lactodaily.\" Since you have been using the trademark continuously since 2018 and have evidence to prove it (purchase orders, supply notes, and tax invoices), you fall under the protection of Section 34 of the Trade Marks Act, which safeguards the rights of prior users.Legal Grounds:Section 34: Saving for Vested RightsPrior Continuous Use: You have been using the trademark \"Lactodaily\" since 2018, which is prior to Milktech's use and registration in 2021.Protection Against Interference: Milktech, as the current registered owner, cannot interfere with or stop your use of the trademark \"Lactodaily\" since your use dates back to a time before their registration and use.Section 28: Rights of the Registered ProprietorWhile Section 28 gives the registered proprietor exclusive rights to use the trademark, Section 34 provides an exception for prior users like you. This means your continuous use of \"Lactodaily\" since 2018 grants you protection even against a registered proprietor.Likelihood of Court Ruling in Your Favor:Given the legal framework:Evidence of Prior Use: Your documentation from 2018 (purchase orders, supply notes, and tax invoices) supports your claim of prior use.Section 34: This section explicitly protects the rights of prior users, which strengthens your case.Previous Case Reference:In the case of Société des Produits Nestlé, S.A and Another v. Kaira District Cooperative Milk Producers Union Ltd. and Another [ FAO(OS) (COMM), 34 of 2018], the court ruled in favor of Nestlé, who were prior users of the trademark \"A+\" despite Kaira being the registered proprietor. The court allowed Nestlé to continue using the trademark based on their prior use.Similarly, your situation aligns with Nestlé's case, where the court upheld the rights of the prior user over the registered proprietor due to evidence of prior use.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Surrender of Indian Passport after acquiring British Citizenship",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Using your Indian passport after acquiring British citizenship can lead to legal complications as per Indian law. According to Section 9 of the Indian Citizenship Act, 1955, if you voluntarily acquire the citizenship of another country, you automatically lose your Indian citizenship. This means that once you acquire British citizenship, your Indian citizenship is terminated. If you use your Indian passport after acquiring British citizenship, you are effectively using a passport that you are no longer legally entitled to hold. This is illegal and can lead to penalties, including fines and imprisonment. Hence, it is advisable to not use your Indian passport for travel after acquiring British citizenship. Instead, use your British passport or apply for a British emergency travel document if you need to travel urgently. As soon as possible after acquiring British citizenship, surrender your Indian passport to the nearest Indian consulate or embassy and obtain a surrender certificate. Once you have surrendered your Indian passport, consider applying for OCI status, which allows you visa-free travel to India and some other privileges.

    "question": "Surrender of Indian Passport after acquiring British Citizenship",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Using your Indian passport after acquiring British citizenship can lead to legal complications as per Indian law. According to Section 9 of the Indian Citizenship Act, 1955, if you voluntarily acquire the citizenship of another country, you automatically lose your Indian citizenship. This means that once you acquire British citizenship, your Indian citizenship is terminated. If you use your Indian passport after acquiring British citizenship, you are effectively using a passport that you are no longer legally entitled to hold. This is illegal and can lead to penalties, including fines and imprisonment. Hence, it is advisable to not use your Indian passport for travel after acquiring British citizenship. Instead, use your British passport or apply for a British emergency travel document if you need to travel urgently. As soon as possible after acquiring British citizenship, surrender your Indian passport to the nearest Indian consulate or embassy and obtain a surrender certificate. Once you have surrendered your Indian passport, consider applying for OCI status, which allows you visa-free travel to India and some other privileges.

A condition is imposed where the Court comes to the conclusion that it is necessary for any purpose, including any debt to be satisfied, any other claimants, any dues to statutory authorities etc.2) There are a stream of cases, where having regard to the fact that the petitioners in testamentary cases where probate/letters of administration were sought in respect of the estate of the deceased, had been exempted from furnishing Surety Bond/Administration Bond on the ground that the will was in favour of the natural heirs and there was no contest to the request for grant of letters of administration/Probate. It was observed that where the petitioners/applicants were natural heirs/sole beneficiary of the deceased, any order directing the said petitioner(s) to stand as an administrator/surety of the estate of the deceased would amount to their/his standing surety for themselves/himself.3)In a recent decision in the case of Rajesh Sinha and Ors. vs. State in TEST CAS. 84/2011 decided on 06.04.2015, taking note of the judicial precedents on the above aspect, delhi HC  Court had dispensed with the requirement of the petitioner therein furnishing the Administration and Surety Bond by observing as below:-\"9. On a conspectus of the above legal position on the requirement of furnishing a surety and Administration Bond, it may be noted that in a majority of decisions, it has been held that where a sole beneficiary/legatee is involved, the requirement of offering an indemnity bond/surety bond is dispensable for the simple reason that it would be an exercise in futility to call upon a sole beneficiary/legatee under a will that has been duly proved, to furnish an Administration Bond/Surety Bond when the estate of the deceased has been bequeathed in favour of the very same personAjay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98557 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In your situation, where you are both the executor and a beneficiary of the will, you are required to provide an \"Administration cum Surety Bond\" as directed by the court. You can sign the surety bond yourself because you hold dual roles. Typically, this bond ensures that you will administer the estate according to the will's terms and conditions and fulfill any obligations the court sets. However, to provide additional security to the court, you might also consider having a third-party surety co-sign the bond. This third-party surety should be someone reliable who can be a guarantor for the bond, ensuring there is no financial risk to the estate or any discrepancies in administration. In summary, while you can sign the bond yourself, involving an additional surety could offer extra assurance to the court.

    "answer": "co-applicant can initiate the removal of their name from a loan, but this typically requires the consent of all parties involved, including the primary applicant and the lender. The lender will also need to assess whether the remaining applicant(s) can handle the loan responsibility on their own.Divorce or Separation: This is one of the most common reasons for wanting to remove a co-applicant's name. The individual retaining the property will want to refinance the loan solely in their name.Review Your Loan Agreement: Start by reviewing your original loan agreement. This document usually outlines the terms regarding changes in the guarantorship or co-applicant status. Understanding these terms will provide a clear guideline on the possibilities and legal standing for making such a change.Contact Your Lender: Your next step should be to contact your lender. You’ll need to discuss your intention and the reason for removing a co-applicant’s name. This is critical as lenders typically need to assess the remaining applicant's financial capability to sustain the loan independently.It is thus advisable that you come out of this liability amicably on mutually agreed conditions which will include divorce.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

A condition is imposed where the Court comes to the conclusion that it is necessary for any purpose, including any debt to be satisfied, any other claimants, any dues to statutory authorities etc.2) There are a stream of cases, where having regard to the fact that the petitioners in testamentary cases where probate/letters of administration were sought in respect of the estate of the deceased, had been exempted from furnishing Surety Bond/Administration Bond on the ground that the will was in favour of the natural heirs and there was no contest to the request for grant of letters of administration/Probate. It was observed that where the petitioners/applicants were natural heirs/sole beneficiary of the deceased, any order directing the said petitioner(s) to stand as an administrator/surety of the estate of the deceased would amount to their/his standing surety for themselves/himself.3)In a recent decision in the case of Rajesh Sinha and Ors. vs. State in TEST CAS. 84/2011 decided on 06.04.2015, taking note of the judicial precedents on the above aspect, delhi HC  Court had dispensed with the requirement of the petitioner therein furnishing the Administration and Surety Bond by observing as below:-\"9. On a conspectus of the above legal position on the requirement of furnishing a surety and Administration Bond, it may be noted that in a majority of decisions, it has been held that where a sole beneficiary/legatee is involved, the requirement of offering an indemnity bond/surety bond is dispensable for the simple reason that it would be an exercise in futility to call upon a sole beneficiary/legatee under a will that has been duly proved, to furnish an Administration Bond/Surety Bond when the estate of the deceased has been bequeathed in favour of the very same personAjay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98557 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "question": "Breach of contract as an intern (unpaid)",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Since your internship is unpaid, the contract terms, especially those related to financial penalties, may be unenforceable. The contract’s conflicting terms regarding a lock-in period and notice period could render it ambiguous and legally questionable. Contracts with unclear or contradictory terms can be challenged in court. If no substantial training or resources were provided, the demand for 60,000 INR could be seen as arbitrary and unfair. The firm would need to prove that they incurred actual damages due to your departure. If the contract appears unfair, especially to a young, unpaid intern, the court may rule in your favour. You can first give a formal response stating that you did not receive substantial training or resources, making their demand for 60,000 INR unjustified. Highlight that you only had one month remaining and question the logic of now asking for an additional 180 days.

    "answer": "co-applicant can initiate the removal of their name from a loan, but this typically requires the consent of all parties involved, including the primary applicant and the lender. The lender will also need to assess whether the remaining applicant(s) can handle the loan responsibility on their own.Divorce or Separation: This is one of the most common reasons for wanting to remove a co-applicant's name. The individual retaining the property will want to refinance the loan solely in their name.Review Your Loan Agreement: Start by reviewing your original loan agreement. This document usually outlines the terms regarding changes in the guarantorship or co-applicant status. Understanding these terms will provide a clear guideline on the possibilities and legal standing for making such a change.Contact Your Lender: Your next step should be to contact your lender. You’ll need to discuss your intention and the reason for removing a co-applicant’s name. This is critical as lenders typically need to assess the remaining applicant's financial capability to sustain the loan independently.It is thus advisable that you come out of this liability amicably on mutually agreed conditions which will include divorce.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

Whatever existing documents you have and the documents that stand in the name of the original tenant , would sufficeHowever as rightly apprehended by you the landlord may intentionally create complications by requiring you to get the noc of your aunt and uncle who are the other heirs of your GM who was the original tenant.However if they are ok and consenting then you can always take their consent affidavit for record for submission to the landlord or any other authorityI don't know under which regulation of the DCPR 2034 the property can be taken up for redevelopment since its held by two entities,  the land is owned by the landlord and the flats in the building are owned by the individual tenants (except you) who seem to have formed a societyHowever whenever such redevelopment takes place you will get the benefit of the redevelopment in the form of the new rehab  premises in lieu of the old premises held by you at presentJust because you do not have ownership right over the flat and still hold tenancy rights,  would not mean that you will be denied the redevelopment benefitYou should continue paying the rent to the landlord , even if he refuses and does not issue any receiptYou can write the amount and month on the covering letter that you would send to the landlord which will  be an evidence that you regularly pay the rent. If you want to make payment by UPI ensure that the amount is credited to the correct account standing in the landlord's name. Otherwise you can continue issuing cheque or a DD (for consolidated rent of several months together , say for a year) which is also sufficient. Cheque has a validity period , however when you make a DD the amount would be debited right away to your account.

Tenants can approach the court if they feel the rent exceeds this value.No doubt you cannot fix the rent on your own even if you name it as fair rent, the process of law is to be adopted.If the landlord is not accepting the rental amount you can adopt the legally valid method to send the rental amount to his account, and if that also fails then you can approach court with an application to permit you to deposit the rent in the court.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Pagdi tenant since 50+ years, is the agreement under deceased grandmothers name still valid?",
    "answer": "-  As per law, the tenant is a co-owner of the property who enjoys all the rights of an owner like selling or sub-letting the property in the pagdi rental system.- Further, under the pagdi system, the tenant has certain rights over the property but not over the land.- Further, the pagdi system was legalized by the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999. Generally, upon the death of a pagdi tenant, the tenancy rights are transferred to the legal heir/s who were living in the flat when the tenant died, by asking the landlord to issue the new rent receipts in the heir/s name/s.- Hence, after the death you should inform the landowner for transferring the tenancy in your name- Further , the landowner/builder cannot refuse to allot you with new units during redevelopment.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "Dear client,Your situation involves several complex legal aspects related to Pagdi tenancy and redevelopment. Here are the answers to your questions:Possibility of Refusal to Allot New Units:The owner or builder might refuse to allot new units if there is no clear Pagdi tenancy agreement between you and the current landlord. However, your long-term occupancy and the rent receipt from 1988 can serve as evidence of your tenancy. The Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999, protects tenants under the Pagdi system, and you should be eligible for a new unit during redevelopment.Validity of the Old Agreement:The old agreement signed in 1974 between your grandmother and the owner’s grandmother is still valid, even though both parties have passed away. The tenancy rights are typically inherited by legal heirs. The refusal of the landlord to transfer the tenancy agreement to your name, despite encashing the DD, can be contested in court.Eligibility for Redevelopment Benefits:As a Pagdi tenant, you should be eligible for all the benefits during redevelopment, including additional carpet area. The Maharashtra Rent Control Act ensures that tenants are provided with new flats during redevelopment.Requirement of NOC from Relatives:The landlord or builder might ask for an NOC from your aunts and uncle to complicate the situation. However, since they do not have any rights in the unit, you can contest this requirement. It is advisable to consult a legal expert to handle this aspect effectively.Proof of Rent Payment:Bank transactions with descriptions mentioning rent and the month can serve as proof of rent payment in court. If the landlord refuses to accept rent, you can deposit the rent in court through an application in the small causes court.Changing Names on Utility Bills:It is advisable to change the names on the electric, gas, and ration card to your name. This will help establish your continuous occupancy and strengthen your case during redevelopment. The existing Pagdi tenancy agreement under your grandmother’s name should not pose an issue if you have other supporting documents.Documents Required During Redevelopment:The builder might ask for the following documents during redevelopment:Proof of tenancy (old rent receipts, bank transaction records)Identity proof (Aadhar card, PAN card, passport, voter ID)Proof of residence (electricity bill, gas bill, ration card)Legal heir certificate (if applicable)Any correspondence with the landlord regarding tenancyGiven the complexity of your situation, it is highly recommended to consult with a legal expert specializing in tenancy and redevelopment issues to ensure that your rights are protected and to navigate the legal processes effectively.Thank you.

    "question": "Probate of Will - Who will sign the surety bond if beneficiary and executor is same person in Will",
    "answer": "A perusal of Section 375 of the ISA clearly shows that the imposition of a condition of security/surety/indemnity bond is in order to indemnify person(s) or safeguard the interests of such persons who may be entitled to the whole or any part of the debt and security. A condition is imposed where the Court comes to the conclusion that it is necessary for any purpose, including any debt to be satisfied, any other claimants, any dues to statutory authorities etc.2) There are a stream of cases, where having regard to the fact that the petitioners in testamentary cases where probate/letters of administration were sought in respect of the estate of the deceased, had been exempted from furnishing Surety Bond/Administration Bond on the ground that the will was in favour of the natural heirs and there was no contest to the request for grant of letters of administration/Probate. It was observed that where the petitioners/applicants were natural heirs/sole beneficiary of the deceased, any order directing the said petitioner(s) to stand as an administrator/surety of the estate of the deceased would amount to their/his standing surety for themselves/himself.3)In a recent decision in the case of Rajesh Sinha and Ors. vs. State in TEST CAS. 84/2011 decided on 06.04.2015, taking note of the judicial precedents on the above aspect, delhi HC  Court had dispensed with the requirement of the petitioner therein furnishing the Administration and Surety Bond by observing as below:-\"9. On a conspectus of the above legal position on the requirement of furnishing a surety and Administration Bond, it may be noted that in a majority of decisions, it has been held that where a sole beneficiary/legatee is involved, the requirement of offering an indemnity bond/surety bond is dispensable for the simple reason that it would be an exercise in futility to call upon a sole beneficiary/legatee under a will that has been duly proved, to furnish an Administration Bond/Surety Bond when the estate of the deceased has been bequeathed in favour of the very same personAjay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98557 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In your situation, where you are both the executor and a beneficiary of the will, you are required to provide an \"Administration cum Surety Bond\" as directed by the court. You can sign the surety bond yourself because you hold dual roles. Typically, this bond ensures that you will administer the estate according to the will's terms and conditions and fulfill any obligations the court sets. However, to provide additional security to the court, you might also consider having a third-party surety co-sign the bond. This third-party surety should be someone reliable who can be a guarantor for the bond, ensuring there is no financial risk to the estate or any discrepancies in administration. In summary, while you can sign the bond yourself, involving an additional surety could offer extra assurance to the court.

Whatever existing documents you have and the documents that stand in the name of the original tenant , would sufficeHowever as rightly apprehended by you the landlord may intentionally create complications by requiring you to get the noc of your aunt and uncle who are the other heirs of your GM who was the original tenant.However if they are ok and consenting then you can always take their consent affidavit for record for submission to the landlord or any other authorityI don't know under which regulation of the DCPR 2034 the property can be taken up for redevelopment since its held by two entities,  the land is owned by the landlord and the flats in the building are owned by the individual tenants (except you) who seem to have formed a societyHowever whenever such redevelopment takes place you will get the benefit of the redevelopment in the form of the new rehab  premises in lieu of the old premises held by you at presentJust because you do not have ownership right over the flat and still hold tenancy rights,  would not mean that you will be denied the redevelopment benefitYou should continue paying the rent to the landlord , even if he refuses and does not issue any receiptYou can write the amount and month on the covering letter that you would send to the landlord which will  be an evidence that you regularly pay the rent. If you want to make payment by UPI ensure that the amount is credited to the correct account standing in the landlord's name. Otherwise you can continue issuing cheque or a DD (for consolidated rent of several months together , say for a year) which is also sufficient. Cheque has a validity period , however when you make a DD the amount would be debited right away to your account. So it's a good thing that you issue DD to the landlord towards rent.Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Dear client,Your situation involves several complex legal aspects related to Pagdi tenancy and redevelopment. Here are the answers to your questions:Possibility of Refusal to Allot New Units:The owner or builder might refuse to allot new units if there is no clear Pagdi tenancy agreement between you and the current landlord. However, your long-term occupancy and the rent receipt from 1988 can serve as evidence of your tenancy. The Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999, protects tenants under the Pagdi system, and you should be eligible for a new unit during redevelopment.Validity of the Old Agreement:The old agreement signed in 1974 between your grandmother and the owner’s grandmother is still valid, even though both parties have passed away. The tenancy rights are typically inherited by legal heirs. The refusal of the landlord to transfer the tenancy agreement to your name, despite encashing the DD, can be contested in court.Eligibility for Redevelopment Benefits:As a Pagdi tenant, you should be eligible for all the benefits during redevelopment, including additional carpet area. The Maharashtra Rent Control Act ensures that tenants are provided with new flats during redevelopment.Requirement of NOC from Relatives:The landlord or builder might ask for an NOC from your aunts and uncle to complicate the situation. However, since they do not have any rights in the unit, you can contest this requirement. It is advisable to consult a legal expert to handle this aspect effectively.Proof of Rent Payment:Bank transactions with descriptions mentioning rent and the month can serve as proof of rent payment in court. If the landlord refuses to accept rent, you can deposit the rent in court through an application in the small causes court.Changing Names on Utility Bills:It is advisable to change the names on the electric, gas, and ration card to your name. This will help establish your continuous occupancy and strengthen your case during redevelopment. The existing Pagdi tenancy agreement under your grandmother’s name should not pose an issue if you have other supporting documents.Documents Required During Redevelopment:The builder might ask for the following documents during redevelopment:Proof of tenancy (old rent receipts, bank transaction records)Identity proof (Aadhar card, PAN card, passport, voter ID)Proof of residence (electricity bill, gas bill, ration card)Legal heir certificate (if applicable)Any correspondence with the landlord regarding tenancyGiven the complexity of your situation, it is highly recommended to consult with a legal expert specializing in tenancy and redevelopment issues to ensure that your rights are protected and to navigate the legal processes effectively.Thank you.

    "answer": "A perusal of Section 375 of the ISA clearly shows that the imposition of a condition of security/surety/indemnity bond is in order to indemnify person(s) or safeguard the interests of such persons who may be entitled to the whole or any part of the debt and security. A condition is imposed where the Court comes to the conclusion that it is necessary for any purpose, including any debt to be satisfied, any other claimants, any dues to statutory authorities etc.2) There are a stream of cases, where having regard to the fact that the petitioners in testamentary cases where probate/letters of administration were sought in respect of the estate of the deceased, had been exempted from furnishing Surety Bond/Administration Bond on the ground that the will was in favour of the natural heirs and there was no contest to the request for grant of letters of administration/Probate. It was observed that where the petitioners/applicants were natural heirs/sole beneficiary of the deceased, any order directing the said petitioner(s) to stand as an administrator/surety of the estate of the deceased would amount to their/his standing surety for themselves/himself.3)In a recent decision in the case of Rajesh Sinha and Ors. vs. State in TEST CAS. 84/2011 decided on 06.04.2015, taking note of the judicial precedents on the above aspect, delhi HC  Court had dispensed with the requirement of the petitioner therein furnishing the Administration and Surety Bond by observing as below:-\"9. On a conspectus of the above legal position on the requirement of furnishing a surety and Administration Bond, it may be noted that in a majority of decisions, it has been held that where a sole beneficiary/legatee is involved, the requirement of offering an indemnity bond/surety bond is dispensable for the simple reason that it would be an exercise in futility to call upon a sole beneficiary/legatee under a will that has been duly proved, to furnish an Administration Bond/Surety Bond when the estate of the deceased has been bequeathed in favour of the very same personAjay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98557 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In your situation, where you are both the executor and a beneficiary of the will, you are required to provide an \"Administration cum Surety Bond\" as directed by the court. You can sign the surety bond yourself because you hold dual roles. Typically, this bond ensures that you will administer the estate according to the will's terms and conditions and fulfill any obligations the court sets. However, to provide additional security to the court, you might also consider having a third-party surety co-sign the bond. This third-party surety should be someone reliable who can be a guarantor for the bond, ensuring there is no financial risk to the estate or any discrepancies in administration. In summary, while you can sign the bond yourself, involving an additional surety could offer extra assurance to the court.

In many jurisdictions, labor laws generally restricts severely obligatory clauses in unpaid Internships agreement.

Also there is penalty clause, which is unreasonable.

    "question": "Breach of contract as an intern (unpaid)",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Since your internship is unpaid, the contract terms, especially those related to financial penalties, may be unenforceable. The contract’s conflicting terms regarding a lock-in period and notice period could render it ambiguous and legally questionable. Contracts with unclear or contradictory terms can be challenged in court. If no substantial training or resources were provided, the demand for 60,000 INR could be seen as arbitrary and unfair. The firm would need to prove that they incurred actual damages due to your departure. If the contract appears unfair, especially to a young, unpaid intern, the court may rule in your favour. You can first give a formal response stating that you did not receive substantial training or resources, making their demand for 60,000 INR unjustified. Highlight that you only had one month remaining and question the logic of now asking for an additional 180 days. Keep your college informed about the situation, particularly if the firm continues to make threats. Consult a lawyer if the dispute goes to court.

Whatever existing documents you have and the documents that stand in the name of the original tenant , would sufficeHowever as rightly apprehended by you the landlord may intentionally create complications by requiring you to get the noc of your aunt and uncle who are the other heirs of your GM who was the original tenant.However if they are ok and consenting then you can always take their consent affidavit for record for submission to the landlord or any other authorityI don't know under which regulation of the DCPR 2034 the property can be taken up for redevelopment since its held by two entities,  the land is owned by the landlord and the flats in the building are owned by the individual tenants (except you) who seem to have formed a societyHowever whenever such redevelopment takes place you will get the benefit of the redevelopment in the form of the new rehab  premises in lieu of the old premises held by you at presentJust because you do not have ownership right over the flat and still hold tenancy rights,  would not mean that you will be denied the redevelopment benefitYou should continue paying the rent to the landlord , even if he refuses and does not issue any receiptYou can write the amount and month on the covering letter that you would send to the landlord which will  be an evidence that you regularly pay the rent. If you want to make payment by UPI ensure that the amount is credited to the correct account standing in the landlord's name. Otherwise you can continue issuing cheque or a DD (for consolidated rent of several months together , say for a year) which is also sufficient. Cheque has a validity period , however when you make a DD the amount would be debited right away to your account. So it's a good thing that you issue DD to the landlord towards rent.Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Dear client,Your situation involves several complex legal aspects related to Pagdi tenancy and redevelopment. Here are the answers to your questions:Possibility of Refusal to Allot New Units:The owner or builder might refuse to allot new units if there is no clear Pagdi tenancy agreement between you and the current landlord. However, your long-term occupancy and the rent receipt from 1988 can serve as evidence of your tenancy. The Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999, protects tenants under the Pagdi system, and you should be eligible for a new unit during redevelopment.Validity of the Old Agreement:The old agreement signed in 1974 between your grandmother and the owner’s grandmother is still valid, even though both parties have passed away. The tenancy rights are typically inherited by legal heirs. The refusal of the landlord to transfer the tenancy agreement to your name, despite encashing the DD, can be contested in court.Eligibility for Redevelopment Benefits:As a Pagdi tenant, you should be eligible for all the benefits during redevelopment, including additional carpet area. The Maharashtra Rent Control Act ensures that tenants are provided with new flats during redevelopment.Requirement of NOC from Relatives:The landlord or builder might ask for an NOC from your aunts and uncle to complicate the situation. However, since they do not have any rights in the unit, you can contest this requirement. It is advisable to consult a legal expert to handle this aspect effectively.Proof of Rent Payment:Bank transactions with descriptions mentioning rent and the month can serve as proof of rent payment in court. If the landlord refuses to accept rent, you can deposit the rent in court through an application in the small causes court.Changing Names on Utility Bills:It is advisable to change the names on the electric, gas, and ration card to your name. This will help establish your continuous occupancy and strengthen your case during redevelopment. The existing Pagdi tenancy agreement under your grandmother’s name should not pose an issue if you have other supporting documents.Documents Required During Redevelopment:The builder might ask for the following documents during redevelopment:Proof of tenancy (old rent receipts, bank transaction records)Identity proof (Aadhar card, PAN card, passport, voter ID)Proof of residence (electricity bill, gas bill, ration card)Legal heir certificate (if applicable)Any correspondence with the landlord regarding tenancyGiven the complexity of your situation, it is highly recommended to consult with a legal expert specializing in tenancy and redevelopment issues to ensure that your rights are protected and to navigate the legal processes effectively.Thank you.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Since your internship is unpaid, the contract terms, especially those related to financial penalties, may be unenforceable. The contract’s conflicting terms regarding a lock-in period and notice period could render it ambiguous and legally questionable. Contracts with unclear or contradictory terms can be challenged in court. If no substantial training or resources were provided, the demand for 60,000 INR could be seen as arbitrary and unfair. The firm would need to prove that they incurred actual damages due to your departure. If the contract appears unfair, especially to a young, unpaid intern, the court may rule in your favour. You can first give a formal response stating that you did not receive substantial training or resources, making their demand for 60,000 INR unjustified. Highlight that you only had one month remaining and question the logic of now asking for an additional 180 days.

Upon the mother’s death in 2013, the property would be inherited by her legal heirs. To sell the property, the surviving two brothers and one sister need to prove their legal ownership. It’s prudent to obtain a legal heir certificate to establish the current legal heirs of the mother. Once the legal heir certificate or succession certificate is obtained, the property should be mutated in the names of the legal heirs in the municipal or revenue records. Once they have this certificate and the property is mutated in their names, they can proceed with selling the property based on the relinquishment deed and other necessary documents.

    "answer": "This is because the Reserve Bank of India rules require banks to follow NPA classification at a borrower level and not at a product level.If a borrower defaults on a bank loan, his other loans drawn from the same bank too may become non-performing assets (NPAs) affecting the customer's credit worthiness.Since this is a RBI rules, the banks cannot deviate from the set of rules or guidelines in this regard.All loans may be tagged as NPAs even if the customer is prompt on the repayment of other loans to the same bank. For example, if you default on a credit card loan to a particular bank, your home loan or car loan in the same bank, on which the loan repayment is prompt, may also become a bad loan.Even though the act of bank refusing to return the title documents of the loan already discharged appears to be illegal, the bank will take shelter under the RBI rules hence it may not fetch you a favorable result even if you think of taking it legally through court or DRT."

    "question": "Unable to close home loan account and get NOC",
    "answer": "Dear Client,According to RBI guidelines, if one loan account of a borrower becomes a Non-Performing Asset (NPA), all other loan accounts with the same bank are also classified as NPA. This is done on a borrower-wise basis, not account-wise. The rationale is that if a borrower defaults on one loan, their creditworthiness is compromised, impacting their ability to repay other loans as well. However, this rule does not negate the bank’s responsibility to provide necessary documents once a loan is fully repaid. File a formal complaint with the bank’s grievance redressal cell, requesting the NOC and property papers. If the bank doesn’t resolve the issue, escalate it to the Banking Ombudsman through the RBI’s website. As a last resort, file a complaint in the Consumer Forum for redressal.

    "question": "Legal heirs",
    "answer": "14.In Sh. Vijay Singh & Ors vs Smt. Manali Malik & OrsDecided on 5 May, 2009 Honble High Court of Delhi in IA No. 6459/2008 in CS (OS) No. 930/2007 analyzed this kind of situation and discussed the whole law of negotiable instrument act. The relevant paras are:10. The relevant provisions of the Negotiable Instruments Act relating to a cheque have been perused. Section 6 defines the cheque as a bill of exchange drawn on a specified banker and not expressed to be payable otherwise than on demand.Normally cheques are issued on the banks holding the monies of the drawer of the cheque. The bank is in the position of the debtor of the drawer of the cheque. The cheque is thus an order of the drawer thereof as creditor, to the bank who is his debtor, to pay to the payee of the cheque on the date of presentment the amount thereof. The IA No.6459/2008 in CS(OS) No.930/2007Page 7 of 14 relationship between the drawer of the cheque andhis banker is contractual.11. Under Section 31, the liability of the bank as drawee of the cheque is, subject to having sufficient funds of the drawer in its hands properly applicable to the payment of such cheque, to pay the cheque when duly required so to do. It is only when the bank defaults in such payment that it becomes personally liable to compensate the drawer for any loss or damage caused by such default. Else, bank as a drawee of the cheque is not liable personally for default in payment thereof. The text book on the Negotiable Instruments Act by Bhashyam & Adiga (17th Edition) under Section 31 thereof states that at the instant of the deathSuit No.840/06 6of the drawer, the title to the balance vests in his legal representative and his own order is not competent to withdraw any part of that which is no longer his property. It is further stated that on death of a customer, the order of the customer comes to an end and only if the banker pays the cheque before notice of death, is it valid. It would thus appear that the death of customer terminates his authority to order payment and operates as a countermand of the outstanding cheque.Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98557 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

The suit under order 37, thus not maintainable on such cheque. In the above judgment it is also held that \"The said mandate, on demise of customer, ceases to be a mandate. On the moment of demise of customer, the bank, in terms of its contract, is holding the money not to the order of the deceased customer, but to the order of his nominees or legal representatives. The bank cannot thus act on the order of the deceased customer. The cheque, which has been held to be merely an order, thus, on demise of drawer, ceases to be a cheque\".

    "question": "Legal heirs",
    "answer": "In the event of death and there is a nominee to that account then the bank will oblige the payment too the nominee without seeking the consent of other legal heirs.However the nominee cannot use the entire money, he is just a trustee to receive the money on behalf of all the legal heirs and distribute the same to all the legal heirs and if he is one of the legal heirs then he can take his share alone.When a bank account has a registered nominee, the transfer process after the account holder's death is relatively straightforward.The nominee simply needs to provide identification documents and the deceased person's death certificate to claim the funds.The bank then processes the transfer based on the nomination.Whereas in your case it appears that the nominee has withdrawn the money from the account of the deceased mother post her death, it may be for funeral expenses or any other expenses involving the family expenses, but the procedure follows by him to withdraw the money in haste is contradiction to law.It was the duty of the nominee to intimate the bank about the death of the account holder and get the money lying in her account transferred to his account and distribute the same to all other legal heirs .it appears that the nominee did not follow the due process of law instead he had straightaway drawn the money by a cheque singed by the deceased prior o her death and he utilised the money for her funeral expenses, which clearly states that he violated the law and had usurped the money.This can be termed as abuse of law or misuse of his position as nominee for wrongful gains, hence in this situation no judgment will come to his rescue if the plaintiff conducts the case with the available substantial documentary evidences agaisnt the nominee for recovery or even if he is slapping a criminal case agaisnt the so called nominee/legal heir.If any or all of the other legal heir(s) of the deceased father lodge(s) a complaint with the police against the other son who withdrew the funds, then the police may book him under Section 379 IPC forimprisonment up to 3 years or with fine or both.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

Usha Devi 1984 AIR 346andShipra Sengupta vs. Mridul Sengupta & Ors. AIR ONLINE 2009 SC 408where the court held that the nominee merely has the right to receive the funds but must distribute them according to the applicable succession laws​.This is relevant as it underscores that the nominee does not gain beneficial ownership rather acts as a trustee of the funds.  To defend against allegations underIPC Section 420(cheating), the nominee should provide evidence of the initial consent from all legal heirs for the withdrawal, and clarify that the funds were used in good faith for legitimate purposes such as funeral expenses. Documented consent and proper accounting of the funds used can help mitigate accusations of fraudulent intent.

    "question": "Breach of contract as an intern (unpaid)",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Since your internship is unpaid, the contract terms, especially those related to financial penalties, may be unenforceable. The contract’s conflicting terms regarding a lock-in period and notice period could render it ambiguous and legally questionable. Contracts with unclear or contradictory terms can be challenged in court. If no substantial training or resources were provided, the demand for 60,000 INR could be seen as arbitrary and unfair. The firm would need to prove that they incurred actual damages due to your departure. If the contract appears unfair, especially to a young, unpaid intern, the court may rule in your favour. You can first give a formal response stating that you did not receive substantial training or resources, making their demand for 60,000 INR unjustified. Highlight that you only had one month remaining and question the logic of now asking for an additional 180 days. Keep your college informed about the situation, particularly if the firm continues to make threats. Consult a lawyer if the dispute goes to court.

    "answer": "Dear Client,The relinquishment deed made by the two brothers and two sisters in favour of their mother is valid and transfers their shares to the mother. Upon the mother’s death in 2013, the property would be inherited by her legal heirs. To sell the property, the surviving two brothers and one sister need to prove their legal ownership. It’s prudent to obtain a legal heir certificate to establish the current legal heirs of the mother. Once the legal heir certificate or succession certificate is obtained, the property should be mutated in the names of the legal heirs in the municipal or revenue records. Once they have this certificate and the property is mutated in their names, they can proceed with selling the property based on the relinquishment deed and other necessary documents.

    "question": "Unable to close home loan account and get NOC",
    "answer": "This is because the Reserve Bank of India rules require banks to follow NPA classification at a borrower level and not at a product level.If a borrower defaults on a bank loan, his other loans drawn from the same bank too may become non-performing assets (NPAs) affecting the customer's credit worthiness.Since this is a RBI rules, the banks cannot deviate from the set of rules or guidelines in this regard.All loans may be tagged as NPAs even if the customer is prompt on the repayment of other loans to the same bank. For example, if you default on a credit card loan to a particular bank, your home loan or car loan in the same bank, on which the loan repayment is prompt, may also become a bad loan.Even though the act of bank refusing to return the title documents of the loan already discharged appears to be illegal, the bank will take shelter under the RBI rules hence it may not fetch you a favorable result even if you think of taking it legally through court or DRT."

    "answer": "Dear Client,According to RBI guidelines, if one loan account of a borrower becomes a Non-Performing Asset (NPA), all other loan accounts with the same bank are also classified as NPA. This is done on a borrower-wise basis, not account-wise. The rationale is that if a borrower defaults on one loan, their creditworthiness is compromised, impacting their ability to repay other loans as well. However, this rule does not negate the bank’s responsibility to provide necessary documents once a loan is fully repaid. File a formal complaint with the bank’s grievance redressal cell, requesting the NOC and property papers. If the bank doesn’t resolve the issue, escalate it to the Banking Ombudsman through the RBI’s website. As a last resort, file a complaint in the Consumer Forum for redressal.

    "answer": "14.In Sh. Vijay Singh & Ors vs Smt. Manali Malik & OrsDecided on 5 May, 2009 Honble High Court of Delhi in IA No. 6459/2008 in CS (OS) No. 930/2007 analyzed this kind of situation and discussed the whole law of negotiable instrument act. The relevant paras are:10. The relevant provisions of the Negotiable Instruments Act relating to a cheque have been perused. Section 6 defines the cheque as a bill of exchange drawn on a specified banker and not expressed to be payable otherwise than on demand.Normally cheques are issued on the banks holding the monies of the drawer of the cheque. The bank is in the position of the debtor of the drawer of the cheque. The cheque is thus an order of the drawer thereof as creditor, to the bank who is his debtor, to pay to the payee of the cheque on the date of presentment the amount thereof. The IA No.6459/2008 in CS(OS) No.930/2007Page 7 of 14 relationship between the drawer of the cheque andhis banker is contractual.11. Under Section 31, the liability of the bank as drawee of the cheque is, subject to having sufficient funds of the drawer in its hands properly applicable to the payment of such cheque, to pay the cheque when duly required so to do. It is only when the bank defaults in such payment that it becomes personally liable to compensate the drawer for any loss or damage caused by such default. Else, bank as a drawee of the cheque is not liable personally for default in payment thereof. The text book on the Negotiable Instruments Act by Bhashyam & Adiga (17th Edition) under Section 31 thereof states that at the instant of the deathSuit No.840/06 6of the drawer, the title to the balance vests in his legal representative and his own order is not competent to withdraw any part of that which is no longer his property. It is further stated that on death of a customer, the order of the customer comes to an end and only if the banker pays the cheque before notice of death, is it valid. It would thus appear that the death of customer terminates his authority to order payment and operates as a countermand of the outstanding cheque.Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98557 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

The suit under order 37, thus not maintainable on such cheque. In the above judgment it is also held that \"The said mandate, on demise of customer, ceases to be a mandate. On the moment of demise of customer, the bank, in terms of its contract, is holding the money not to the order of the deceased customer, but to the order of his nominees or legal representatives. The bank cannot thus act on the order of the deceased customer. The cheque, which has been held to be merely an order, thus, on demise of drawer, ceases to be a cheque\".

    "question": "Legal heirs",
    "answer": "In the event of death and there is a nominee to that account then the bank will oblige the payment too the nominee without seeking the consent of other legal heirs.However the nominee cannot use the entire money, he is just a trustee to receive the money on behalf of all the legal heirs and distribute the same to all the legal heirs and if he is one of the legal heirs then he can take his share alone.When a bank account has a registered nominee, the transfer process after the account holder's death is relatively straightforward.The nominee simply needs to provide identification documents and the deceased person's death certificate to claim the funds.The bank then processes the transfer based on the nomination.Whereas in your case it appears that the nominee has withdrawn the money from the account of the deceased mother post her death, it may be for funeral expenses or any other expenses involving the family expenses, but the procedure follows by him to withdraw the money in haste is contradiction to law.It was the duty of the nominee to intimate the bank about the death of the account holder and get the money lying in her account transferred to his account and distribute the same to all other legal heirs .it appears that the nominee did not follow the due process of law instead he had straightaway drawn the money by a cheque singed by the deceased prior o her death and he utilised the money for her funeral expenses, which clearly states that he violated the law and had usurped the money.This can be termed as abuse of law or misuse of his position as nominee for wrongful gains, hence in this situation no judgment will come to his rescue if the plaintiff conducts the case with the available substantial documentary evidences agaisnt the nominee for recovery or even if he is slapping a criminal case agaisnt the so called nominee/legal heir.If any or all of the other legal heir(s) of the deceased father lodge(s) a complaint with the police against the other son who withdrew the funds, then the police may book him under Section 379 IPC forimprisonment up to 3 years or with fine or both.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The nominee acts as a trustee for the legal heirs and does not gain ownership rights over the funds. This position was reinforced in the Supreme Court casesSarbati Devi v. Usha Devi 1984 AIR 346andShipra Sengupta vs. Mridul Sengupta & Ors. AIR ONLINE 2009 SC 408where the court held that the nominee merely has the right to receive the funds but must distribute them according to the applicable succession laws​.This is relevant as it underscores that the nominee does not gain beneficial ownership rather acts as a trustee of the funds.  To defend against allegations underIPC Section 420(cheating), the nominee should provide evidence of the initial consent from all legal heirs for the withdrawal, and clarify that the funds were used in good faith for legitimate purposes such as funeral expenses. Documented consent and proper accounting of the funds used can help mitigate accusations of fraudulent intent. Consulting with a legal professional for personalized advice and representation in court is also recommended to navigate the complexities of such disputes.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "FEMA - can we receive payment from overseas for goods supplied in India",
    "answer": "Export payments have the potential to be conducted in Indian Rupee (INR), subject to specific regulations established by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).These regulations delineate the conditions under which such transactions are permissible. For instance, RBI allows export transactions to be denominated in INR in certain cases, particularly for exports to countries with which India maintains bilateral trade agreements facilitating settlements in INR.Exporters opting for INR transactions must ensure adherence to RBI guidelines, particularly regarding the timely repatriation of proceeds to India. Compliance necessitates meticulous documentation, encompassing export invoices, shipping records, and evidence of payment receipt.Despite transactions being conducted in INR, exporters remain subject to foreign exchange regulations, encompassing reporting obligations and constraints on fund utilization. Additionally, exporters should prudently assess currency risk, recognizing that fluctuations in exchange rates could impact the value of received proceeds.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "The deceased are MuslimsSo the Shariat law will applyFrom your query it seems that they had 4 children ie 2 sons (your late father and uncle) and 2 daughters (your paternal aunts )As per Shariat the son takes double the share of the daughterThus after your grandparents demise their flat will go to their children in the following ratios:Son 1 - 33.33%Son 2 -  33.33%Daughter 1 - 16.67%Daughter 2 - 16.67%After your father's demise his 33% would devolve on you and your sister as follows:You - 22.22%Your sister- 11.11%Now your grandparents had made a nomination in favor of your uncle, yourself and your wifeIt is settled law that a nominee only holds the property in trust for the heirs of the deceased member. The nominee does not get any title over the property unless such nominee is also an heir of the deceasedAfter your grandparents demise, their 4 children were entitled to the flat. One son (your uncle) was a joint nominee with you and your wife.So all 3 of you were holding the flat IN TRUST for the other heirs of your grandparents (your father and 2 aunts), your uncle doubled up as a joint nominee as well as a co-heirJust by entering name in the share certificate the title does not get completed.Ideally an heirship certificate ought to have been obtained for declaring the heirs of the deceasedNow your uncle died. So his 33.33% would go to his heirs. As he was unmarried, his share would devolve on his siblings as per Shariat.It appears from your query that your father predeceased your uncleSo the uncle's share would go to his 2 sisters. Whether the children of the predeceased brother would get any share from their paternal uncle's estate, I need to check. Will get back.However please note that after your uncle's demise , an heirship certificate should be obtained for declaration of his heirs, so that the title of the persons to whom the property is transferred ultimately , stands completed and there is no issue in future at the time of selling the flatAlso the view of few committee members that the procedure of devolution of uncle's share to his heirs, is the correct legal viewThe view that upon demise of the joint shareholder,  the surviving joint shareholders automatically become the exclusive shareholders is not correct.The flat is held by the parties as tenants in common (co owners) and not as 'joint tenants' (where upon death of any joint tenant, the right survives to the surviving joint tenants). There is a difference between the 2 concepts. In a society , the flat , when held by more than 1 person, is held as tenants in common.Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

Whereas, In Legal Heirship Actual ownership rights are transferred according to the legal heirship or a will, if available. Since all the necessary formalities were completed after your grandparents' death, including affidavits from legal heirs and public notice, this needs to be revisited in the context of your uncle’s share. Obtain a legal heir certificate for your deceased uncle. Alternatively, you may need a succession certificate from the court to manage the transfer of your uncle's share. Collect the death certificate of your uncle, affidavits, legal heir certificate, and any previously obtained NOCs.

This step is crucial to preventing future legal claims.Ensure that all co-owners (your father and his three brothers) are in agreement about selling the land. This collective agreement is essential to proceed with the sale and to avoid any internal disputes.If necessary, file a petition in court seeking a declaratory judgement on the validity and enforceability of the unregistered contracts and to obtain a clear directive on the land's title status.

Kasthuri\" indicates that an unregistered agreement to sell can be admissible in specific performance suits under certain conditions.In your agreement from 1991, which outlines a development scheme with a 75–25 percent cost and profit-sharing ratio but lacks a specified time period, its admissibility may hinge on its nature. If the court considers it a contract for sale, it may require registration under the Registration Act. However, if it is deemed a mutual understanding or development agreement, it may not need to be registered.Given that the plaintiff's suit was filed within the three-year limitation period, counted from the discovery of the notice in 2015, your unregistered agreement might still be considered valid evidence for the specific performance suit. Ultimately, the court will decide based on the specifics of your case and relevant legal precedents. It is advisable to consult with your legal counsel to ensure that the agreement is presented effectively in court.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, as per Order XVII Rule 2, the court should not grant more than three adjournments to a party during the hearing of the suit. If the plaintiff's side has already been granted multiple adjournments, you can bring this to the notice of the court and request a limitation on further adjournments. You or your legal representative can file an application under the provisions of the CPC requesting the court to expedite the matter and limit further adjournments.

    "question": "Inheritance rights of converted Kumki land",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Typically, kumki land refers to land in Karnataka which is assigned for agricultural purposes or grazing and is attached to a patta land. Kumki land itself does not confer ownership rights and is subject to restrictions on transfer and use. The conversion of kumki land to a residential layout must be properly sanctioned by the relevant authorities. Ensure that all necessary permissions were obtained legally, and the conversion is properly documented. Check for any conditions or restrictions attached to the grant or conversion. If the layout land was originally part of ancestral property, minor children might have a claim upon reaching adulthood, asserting their right to a share. While obtaining consent from family elders is a positive step, it is crucial that all legal heirs are part of the consent process. For minors, this usually requires court approval to ensure their interests are protected. Consulting a property lawyer to thoroughly review all documents and potential risks is highly recommended to avoid future disputes.

    "answer": "14.In Sh. Vijay Singh & Ors vs Smt. Manali Malik & OrsDecided on 5 May, 2009 Honble High Court of Delhi in IA No. 6459/2008 in CS (OS) No. 930/2007 analyzed this kind of situation and discussed the whole law of negotiable instrument act. The relevant paras are:10. The relevant provisions of the Negotiable Instruments Act relating to a cheque have been perused. Section 6 defines the cheque as a bill of exchange drawn on a specified banker and not expressed to be payable otherwise than on demand.Normally cheques are issued on the banks holding the monies of the drawer of the cheque. The bank is in the position of the debtor of the drawer of the cheque. The cheque is thus an order of the drawer thereof as creditor, to the bank who is his debtor, to pay to the payee of the cheque on the date of presentment the amount thereof. The IA No.6459/2008 in CS(OS) No.930/2007Page 7 of 14 relationship between the drawer of the cheque andhis banker is contractual.11. Under Section 31, the liability of the bank as drawee of the cheque is, subject to having sufficient funds of the drawer in its hands properly applicable to the payment of such cheque, to pay the cheque when duly required so to do. It is only when the bank defaults in such payment that it becomes personally liable to compensate the drawer for any loss or damage caused by such default. Else, bank as a drawee of the cheque is not liable personally for default in payment thereof. The text book on the Negotiable Instruments Act by Bhashyam & Adiga (17th Edition) under Section 31 thereof states that at the instant of the deathSuit No.840/06 6of the drawer, the title to the balance vests in his legal representative and his own order is not competent to withdraw any part of that which is no longer his property. It is further stated that on death of a customer, the order of the customer comes to an end and only if the banker pays the cheque before notice of death, is it valid. It would thus appear that the death of customer terminates his authority to order payment and operates as a countermand of the outstanding cheque.Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98557 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

The suit under order 37, thus not maintainable on such cheque. In the above judgment it is also held that \"The said mandate, on demise of customer, ceases to be a mandate. On the moment of demise of customer, the bank, in terms of its contract, is holding the money not to the order of the deceased customer, but to the order of his nominees or legal representatives. The bank cannot thus act on the order of the deceased customer. The cheque, which has been held to be merely an order, thus, on demise of drawer, ceases to be a cheque\".

    "answer": "In the event of death and there is a nominee to that account then the bank will oblige the payment too the nominee without seeking the consent of other legal heirs.However the nominee cannot use the entire money, he is just a trustee to receive the money on behalf of all the legal heirs and distribute the same to all the legal heirs and if he is one of the legal heirs then he can take his share alone.When a bank account has a registered nominee, the transfer process after the account holder's death is relatively straightforward.The nominee simply needs to provide identification documents and the deceased person's death certificate to claim the funds.The bank then processes the transfer based on the nomination.Whereas in your case it appears that the nominee has withdrawn the money from the account of the deceased mother post her death, it may be for funeral expenses or any other expenses involving the family expenses, but the procedure follows by him to withdraw the money in haste is contradiction to law.It was the duty of the nominee to intimate the bank about the death of the account holder and get the money lying in her account transferred to his account and distribute the same to all other legal heirs .it appears that the nominee did not follow the due process of law instead he had straightaway drawn the money by a cheque singed by the deceased prior o her death and he utilised the money for her funeral expenses, which clearly states that he violated the law and had usurped the money.This can be termed as abuse of law or misuse of his position as nominee for wrongful gains, hence in this situation no judgment will come to his rescue if the plaintiff conducts the case with the available substantial documentary evidences agaisnt the nominee for recovery or even if he is slapping a criminal case agaisnt the so called nominee/legal heir.If any or all of the other legal heir(s) of the deceased father lodge(s) a complaint with the police against the other son who withdrew the funds, then the police may book him under Section 379 IPC forimprisonment up to 3 years or with fine or both.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

The nominee does not get any title over the property unless such nominee is also an heir of the deceasedAfter your grandparents demise, their 4 children were entitled to the flat. One son (your uncle) was a joint nominee with you and your wife.So all 3 of you were holding the flat IN TRUST for the other heirs of your grandparents (your father and 2 aunts), your uncle doubled up as a joint nominee as well as a co-heirJust by entering name in the share certificate the title does not get completed.Ideally an heirship certificate ought to have been obtained for declaring the heirs of the deceasedNow your uncle died. So his 33.33% would go to his heirs. As he was unmarried, his share would devolve on his siblings as per Shariat.It appears from your query that your father predeceased your uncleSo the uncle's share would go to his 2 sisters. Whether the children of the predeceased brother would get any share from their paternal uncle's estate, I need to check. Will get back.However please note that after your uncle's demise , an heirship certificate should be obtained for declaration of his heirs, so that the title of the persons to whom the property is transferred ultimately , stands completed and there is no issue in future at the time of selling the flatAlso the view of few committee members that the procedure of devolution of uncle's share to his heirs, is the correct legal viewThe view that upon demise of the joint shareholder,  the surviving joint shareholders automatically become the exclusive shareholders is not correct.The flat is held by the parties as tenants in common (co owners) and not as 'joint tenants' (where upon death of any joint tenant, the right survives to the surviving joint tenants). There is a difference between the 2 concepts.

    "question": "Inheritance rights of converted Kumki land",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Typically, kumki land refers to land in Karnataka which is assigned for agricultural purposes or grazing and is attached to a patta land. Kumki land itself does not confer ownership rights and is subject to restrictions on transfer and use. The conversion of kumki land to a residential layout must be properly sanctioned by the relevant authorities. Ensure that all necessary permissions were obtained legally, and the conversion is properly documented. Check for any conditions or restrictions attached to the grant or conversion. If the layout land was originally part of ancestral property, minor children might have a claim upon reaching adulthood, asserting their right to a share. While obtaining consent from family elders is a positive step, it is crucial that all legal heirs are part of the consent process. For minors, this usually requires court approval to ensure their interests are protected. Consulting a property lawyer to thoroughly review all documents and potential risks is highly recommended to avoid future disputes.

    "answer": "Export payments have the potential to be conducted in Indian Rupee (INR), subject to specific regulations established by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).These regulations delineate the conditions under which such transactions are permissible. For instance, RBI allows export transactions to be denominated in INR in certain cases, particularly for exports to countries with which India maintains bilateral trade agreements facilitating settlements in INR.Exporters opting for INR transactions must ensure adherence to RBI guidelines, particularly regarding the timely repatriation of proceeds to India. Compliance necessitates meticulous documentation, encompassing export invoices, shipping records, and evidence of payment receipt.Despite transactions being conducted in INR, exporters remain subject to foreign exchange regulations, encompassing reporting obligations and constraints on fund utilization. Additionally, exporters should prudently assess currency risk, recognizing that fluctuations in exchange rates could impact the value of received proceeds.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,It is generally not permitted to receive payment from an overseas buyer for goods that are supplied and consumed within India. Such transactions are typically classified as “deemed exports” or domestic transactions and should follow local transaction protocols. However, there are specific exceptions and cases where this may be allowed under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) and related regulations.GST is applicable on the supply of goods within India, and the invoice must include the applicable GST. The rate and manner of GST application will depend on the nature of the goods and the applicable tax rates.Such transactions are generally considered domestic supplies and should ideally be billed to an Indian entity unless specific conditions under FEMA and the GST Act are met.Payments in foreign currency for domestic transactions are tightly regulated. The usual practice is to receive payments in Indian Rupees (INR) for domestic supplies, but there may be exceptions based on specific scenarios allowed by FEMA.Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) Regulations, FEMA governs all foreign exchange transactions in India, including receipt of payments in foreign currency for goods and services.If such transactions have occurred in the past, it's essential to assess whether they comply with FEMA regulations and GST laws. Seek guidance from a legal expert specializing in FEMA and GST to review past transactions and ensure compliance. If non-compliance is detected, consider filing a voluntary disclosure with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and GST authorities to rectify the situation.

However, there are some conditions under the IGST act regarding the export of services that must be followed.In order to prove the export of services, you need to maintain an export invoice, along with the description of services, the value of services, and currency (USD), Bank Realization Certificate (BRC) or Foreign Inward Remittance Certificate (FIRC) Issued by the bank confirming receipt of foreign exchange or INR against the export invoice, an export declaration as per the RBI guidelines and finally, a copy of the contract or agreement with the overseas client, detailing the services to be provided.According to the RBI and FEMA guidelines, payment for the export of services can be received in INR under certain circumstances, such as, Payments received through Vostro/Nostro accounts maintained by foreign banks in India and Payments received from units located in Special Economic Zones (SEZs), even if in INR.Maintain proper documentation, and consult with a legal or financial expert to ensure all regulatory requirements are met.

Ancestral property in a Hindu Joint Family spans four generations, remains undivided with equal shares, and is inherited by birth, not death.In your case the next generation of your great grandfather has inherited the intestate property thereby the nature of ancestral property stands automatically extinguished.The reply what your lawyer gave to your sister's legal notice in this regard is proper and perfect you can adopt the reply ion the same lines.The property transferred to you by your grandfather is your own and self acquired property hence the claim made by your father is not maintainable, at least not during the lifetime of your grandfather.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "More clarification on how properties become self acquired & four generation concept",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Self-acquired property refers to the property acquired by a person through his own efforts and not inherited from ancestors. Under Section 8 ofHindu Succession Act,1956, when a Hindu male dies intestate, his property devolves upon his heirs, including sons, daughters, widow, and mother. On the other hand, Ancestral property is property that is inherited up to four generations of male lineage. It should remain undivided until the fourth generation. The Four generation rule means that The property should remain undivided for at least four generations, meaning the original owner and three subsequent generations. When your GGF died intestate in 1969, the property was inherited by your GF. Based on theHindu Succession Act, 1956, the property inherited by your GF from your GGF would be considered self-acquired property in the hands of your GF. He has absolute rights to dispose of it as he wishes, including gifting it. In the case ofUttam Singh vs Subagh Singh AIR 2016 SC 1169, The Supreme Court held that property inherited by a Hindu from his paternal ancestors after theHindu Succession Act, 1956, would not be considered ancestral property but self-acquired property. Hence, you can argue that since your GF inherited the property after theHindu Succession Act, 1956, it is his self-acquired property, emphasizing that the property was not held undivided by four generations, and thus, it does not meet the criteria for ancestral property as defined under Hindu law.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In your ongoing case of specific performance, whether the unregistered agreement for the development of construction on your land can be admitted as evidence depends on several factors. The Supreme Court judgement in \"Hemlatha vs. . Kasthuri\" indicates that an unregistered agreement to sell can be admissible in specific performance suits under certain conditions.In your agreement from 1991, which outlines a development scheme with a 75–25 percent cost and profit-sharing ratio but lacks a specified time period, its admissibility may hinge on its nature. If the court considers it a contract for sale, it may require registration under the Registration Act. However, if it is deemed a mutual understanding or development agreement, it may not need to be registered.Given that the plaintiff's suit was filed within the three-year limitation period, counted from the discovery of the notice in 2015, your unregistered agreement might still be considered valid evidence for the specific performance suit. Ultimately, the court will decide based on the specifics of your case and relevant legal precedents.

    "answer": "Dear Client,According to Order XVII Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Code, a court is permitted to grant adjournments if there is sufficient cause. However, as per Order XVII Rule 2, the court should not grant more than three adjournments to a party during the hearing of the suit. If the plaintiff's side has already been granted multiple adjournments, you can bring this to the notice of the court and request a limitation on further adjournments. You or your legal representative can file an application under the provisions of the CPC requesting the court to expedite the matter and limit further adjournments. Formally file an application requesting the court to limit further adjournments, emphasizing that sufficient time has already been granted to the plaintiff. If the plaintiff continues to seek extensions without sufficient cause, seek the court's intervention to prevent further delays and to expedite the proceedings. Should you require any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Timely Delivery: Buyers can expect better adherence to project timelines, minimizing inconveniences. Quality Assurance: Redevelopment projects are held to the same quality standards as new constructionsA permanent alternate accommodation agreement (PAAA), which protects the rights and claims of the home-owner, should also be signed before vacating the flat and commencing redevelopment. .However, it appears that this has not happened in your Society.However in the absence of signing the PAAA the demand made by the developer towards the interest over the dues in this regard can be an unjustified claim and not maintainable because the builder is taking the advantage over the flat owners on such fictitious reason.You can proceed legally against the  developerYou can drag him to consumer grievances rederessal commission for deficiency in service and also for unfair trade practice adopted by the developer.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Delay in providing PAAA by the builder and charging interest",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Since the builder did not enter into a PAAA before you vacated the flat, he is in violation of RERA Section 13(1) which states that a promoter cannot accept more than 10% of the cost of the apartment as an advance payment without first entering into a written agreement for sale (PAAA) and registering the same. You can file a complaint with the RERA authority for this violation. A demand letter without a formal agreement does not create a legally enforceable obligation to pay interest. Interest can only be charged if there is a contractual provision for it. The builder cannot charge interest in the absence of a formal agreement. You can file a complaint with RERA, highlighting that no formal agreement (PAAA) was signed, and hence, the demand for interest is invalid. It is the builder’s obligation to provide flats to all members. It is advisable to draft a detailed complaint including all relevant information and submit it to the RERA authority.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Appeal Against Interim Maintenance Order: Yes, you can still appeal. According to Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963, you can file a petition for condonation of delay along with your appeal, explaining the reasons for the delay. The High Court may condone the delay if it finds the reasons satisfactory.Jurisdiction Issue Under Section125 CrPC: The proceedings under Section 125 can be initiated in places where the wife is residing, where the husband is residing or where the husband last resided with his wife. Since your wife was living with you in Delhi on the date of case filing, you can argue a jurisdictional issue. The case should ideally be filed where you both last resided together.Maintenance Order and Rajnish vs Neha Judgement: You can appeal this decision in the High Court, arguing that paying maintenance for the period during which you were already supporting your wife and children is unjust. The Rajnish vs. Neha judgement mandates interim maintenance from the date of application, but the facts of your case suggest you were already providing for them during that period.Evidence of Intent to Leave: Section 125(4) CrPC states that no wife shall be entitled to receive maintenance if she is living in adultery, or if, without any sufficient reason, she refuses to live with her husband, or if they are living separately by mutual consent. Your wife’s messages to the school can be used to demonstrate her intent to leave and could strengthen your appeal in the High Court.Concealing Job Details and Misleading Statements: Your wife hiding job details and misleading statements in the High Court can be used in the court to significantly impact the credibility of her claims.Filing Section 91 CrPC Application: Under Section 91 CrPC, you can request the court to summon documents necessary for your defence, including your wife's employer for salary detailsChargesheet in 498A Case: It's advisable not to ignore court proceedings. Failing to attend could lead to adverse consequences, including the issuance of non-bailable warrants. Engage with your lawyer to get a copy of the chargesheet and prepare your defenceUsing your 323, 506, 34 IPC case in 498A proceedings: While the two cases are separate, you can argue that your in-laws’ behavior and the pending case against them reflect on their credibility and possible malice. However, each case will be judged on its own merits.

    "question": "Appeal in High Court Against Interim maintenance order u/s 125 CrPC",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Given the judge's indication that the interim maintenance order could be dismissed if you prove your wife's employment status was hidden, it may be prudent to wait and present your evidence in the family court. If the family court sets aside the interim maintenance order based on the false affidavit, you will have resolved the issue without needing to appeal. However, if you do choose to appeal, you can request a stay on the interim maintenance order from the High Court. High Courts do consider stays in such cases, especially if there is evidence of false statements or concealment of material facts. The family court can still set aside the interim maintenance order based on your evidence, even if the High Court is considering the appeal.Generally, under the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness, the respondent should be provided with an advance copy of the evidence and the list of witnesses by the petitioner. In practice, this can vary, and sometimes such documents are only handed over in court on the date of hearing. However, you can request the court to ensure you receive these documents in advance.The average time for an appeal against an interim maintenance order in the High Court can vary significantly based on the court's backlog, complexity of the case, and efficiency of legal proceedings. It can take anywhere from a few months to years.Unemployment can be considered a reasonable ground for the delay in filing an appeal, particularly if it has caused financial constraints or other hardships.The High Court will review the family court's interim maintenance order to ensure it was made in accordance with the law and facts presented. The High Court may stay the family court's order if it finds merit in the appeal, especially if there is prima facie evidence of false statements or concealment. The High Court may also direct the family court to expedite the proceedings or provide specific instructions regarding the handling of the case.Should you require any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Certain significant modifications have been brought forth by the Act of 2019 concerning the pecuniary jurisdiction for all the forums i.e. the District, State, and National Commissions, respectively:The upper limit of pecuniary jurisdiction for the District Commission has been increased from Rs.20,00, 000 to Rs.100,00,000 as per Section 34,Consumer Protection Act, 2019.The limit of pecuniary jurisdiction for the State Commission  has been increased from Rs.100,00,000 to Rs.10,00,00,000 as per Section 47,Consumer Protection Act, 2019 and,The limit of pecuniary jurisdiction for the National Commission has been increased from above Rs.10,00,00,000 to above Rs.10,00,00,000 as per Section 58,Consumer Protection Act, 2019.These modifications have widened the scope of pecuniary jurisdiction to a much larger extent. Along with the above-mentioned changes, the 2019 Act has also changed the means for the determination of the pecuniary jurisdiction on the basis of the valuation of goods and services payable as consideration, unlike the 1986 Act where, pecuniary jurisdiction was determined by the value of the goods and services as well as the compensation sought, therefore not escalating the amount of compensation claimed to bring the complaint within the pecuniary jurisdiction of State or National Commission.For determining the value of the complaint, the aggregate value of the goods or services and compensation claimed by the complainant. This was held in the case of “M/s Pyaridevi Chabiraj Steels Pvt. Ltd. v.

The pecuniary jurisdiction of the District Commission is determined by the value of the goods or services paid as consideration, not the compensation claimed. Since the hospital bill (the value of the services paid as consideration) is ₹26 lakhs, it falls within the jurisdiction of the District Consumer Forum, which handles cases where the value does not exceed ₹1 crore.

    "question": "Legal option about land granted long ago",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The term “Kushki land” generally refers to dry or unirrigated land. Since it was granted by the government, ideally, there should be documentation proving the grant, including the year and conditions of the grant. The absence of a document proving the government grant can be a red flag. Gomala lands are grazing lands reserved for cattle by the government. If the land is indeed classified as gomala, it is typically not available for private purchase and may be subject to different regulations. The asterisk in the survey number can indicate several things, such as a sub-division or specific classification of land. Consult with the local land records office to clarify the meaning of the asterisk in the survey number. While an agreement on a ₹100 stamp paper indicates an intention to create a legal obligation, it is not a registered document, which weakens its enforceability. If the seller refuses to return the token advance, you can still file a suit for recovery of the amount based on the receipt as evidence of the transaction. Consulting with legal and property experts can help ensure that the land purchase is safe and legally sound.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Consult a legal expert to review the validity of the unregistered contracts and the implications of the ongoing court cases. Ensure that the partition deed, which is registered, clearly delineates ownership among your father and his brothers.Work with a legal expert to address the title clearance issues. This includes resolving the impact of the first party's suit under Article 54 and the ongoing partition suit filed by one of the sisters. The title clearance certificate can only be obtained if these disputes are resolved or clarified.Given that both the 1991 and 2015 contracts are unregistered and have no end date, you may need to negotiate with the current parties involved to formally terminate these contracts. This step is crucial to preventing future legal claims.Ensure that all co-owners (your father and his three brothers) are in agreement about selling the land. This collective agreement is essential to proceed with the sale and to avoid any internal disputes.If necessary, file a petition in court seeking a declaratory judgement on the validity and enforceability of the unregistered contracts and to obtain a clear directive on the land's title status.

    "question": "Land title clearance certificate",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your ongoing case of specific performance, whether the unregistered agreement for the development of construction on your land can be admitted as evidence depends on several factors. The Supreme Court judgement in \"Hemlatha vs. . Kasthuri\" indicates that an unregistered agreement to sell can be admissible in specific performance suits under certain conditions.In your agreement from 1991, which outlines a development scheme with a 75–25 percent cost and profit-sharing ratio but lacks a specified time period, its admissibility may hinge on its nature. If the court considers it a contract for sale, it may require registration under the Registration Act. However, if it is deemed a mutual understanding or development agreement, it may not need to be registered.Given that the plaintiff's suit was filed within the three-year limitation period, counted from the discovery of the notice in 2015, your unregistered agreement might still be considered valid evidence for the specific performance suit. Ultimately, the court will decide based on the specifics of your case and relevant legal precedents. It is advisable to consult with your legal counsel to ensure that the agreement is presented effectively in court.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Ownership transfer fee demanded by builder for resale",
    "answer": "- As per RERA, the buyer needs not to pay maintenance charges, till he possesses the apartment,- Further, the builder is not eligible to claim maintenance charge before the completion of the total facilities, and only after completing everything, the builder can ask for maintenance from the buyer.- Hence, if your builder has given you the letter of possession, then from that date onward you are bound to pay the maintenance charge.- Further, when you have taken possession of flat, you become liable to pay the maintenance charge as per rule.- Since, the earlier agreement was not having any clause for the payment of transfer fees , then the builder cannot enter into a afresh agreement for the same , and hence his demand is not legal- You can file a complaint against the builder before the consumer forum on the ground of illegal demand of transfer fees and delay in possession- Further, you can also also claim compensation plus 10% interest for the harassment caused due to delay in possessionMohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "More clarification on how properties become self acquired & four generation concept",
    "answer": "It is not an ancestral property either in your hands or in your father's hands or in the hands of your grandfather.Your grandfather inherited his share of property out of his father's property hence it becomes your grandfather's self acquired property.Therefore your grandfather was right in transferring his property to his grandson i.e., you because being an absolute owner he has full rights to dispose his property to anyone of his choice and by any mode, to which nobody has a right to challenge.The ancestral property  is a property that remains undivided forat least four generationswithin a Hindu Joint Family. Ancestral property in a Hindu Joint Family spans four generations, remains undivided with equal shares, and is inherited by birth, not death.In your case the next generation of your great grandfather has inherited the intestate property thereby the nature of ancestral property stands automatically extinguished.The reply what your lawyer gave to your sister's legal notice in this regard is proper and perfect you can adopt the reply ion the same lines.The property transferred to you by your grandfather is your own and self acquired property hence the claim made by your father is not maintainable, at least not during the lifetime of your grandfather.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "More clarification on how properties become self acquired & four generation concept",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Self-acquired property refers to the property acquired by a person through his own efforts and not inherited from ancestors. Under Section 8 ofHindu Succession Act,1956, when a Hindu male dies intestate, his property devolves upon his heirs, including sons, daughters, widow, and mother. On the other hand, Ancestral property is property that is inherited up to four generations of male lineage. It should remain undivided until the fourth generation. The Four generation rule means that The property should remain undivided for at least four generations, meaning the original owner and three subsequent generations. When your GGF died intestate in 1969, the property was inherited by your GF. Based on theHindu Succession Act, 1956, the property inherited by your GF from your GGF would be considered self-acquired property in the hands of your GF. He has absolute rights to dispose of it as he wishes, including gifting it. In the case ofUttam Singh vs Subagh Singh AIR 2016 SC 1169, The Supreme Court held that property inherited by a Hindu from his paternal ancestors after theHindu Succession Act, 1956, would not be considered ancestral property but self-acquired property. Hence, you can argue that since your GF inherited the property after theHindu Succession Act, 1956, it is his self-acquired property, emphasizing that the property was not held undivided by four generations, and thus, it does not meet the criteria for ancestral property as defined under Hindu law.

    "answer": "The process of society redevelopment involves obtaining consent from a minimum percentage of society members, appointing a developer, preparing a redevelopment agreement, obtaining approvals, demolishing existing structures, and constructing new ones, followed by the handover of redeveloped units to society memberst has been often noticed that during the process of redevelopment, the terms of Development Agreements as agreed upon, are later twisted and grossly violated by the Developers and the ground rules of MRTP and DCR by unlawful planning are flouted by constructing additional/unauthorized areas that are beyond the entitlement (i.e. beyond the plot FSI and the TDR/FSI loaded) for their hidden financial gains.RERAprovides legal protection to buyers and ensures that developers fulfill their commitments. Timely Delivery: Buyers can expect better adherence to project timelines, minimizing inconveniences. Quality Assurance: Redevelopment projects are held to the same quality standards as new constructionsA permanent alternate accommodation agreement (PAAA), which protects the rights and claims of the home-owner, should also be signed before vacating the flat and commencing redevelopment. .However, it appears that this has not happened in your Society.However in the absence of signing the PAAA the demand made by the developer towards the interest over the dues in this regard can be an unjustified claim and not maintainable because the builder is taking the advantage over the flat owners on such fictitious reason.You can proceed legally against the  developerYou can drag him to consumer grievances rederessal commission for deficiency in service and also for unfair trade practice adopted by the developer.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Since the builder did not enter into a PAAA before you vacated the flat, he is in violation of RERA Section 13(1) which states that a promoter cannot accept more than 10% of the cost of the apartment as an advance payment without first entering into a written agreement for sale (PAAA) and registering the same. You can file a complaint with the RERA authority for this violation. A demand letter without a formal agreement does not create a legally enforceable obligation to pay interest. Interest can only be charged if there is a contractual provision for it. The builder cannot charge interest in the absence of a formal agreement. You can file a complaint with RERA, highlighting that no formal agreement (PAAA) was signed, and hence, the demand for interest is invalid. It is the builder’s obligation to provide flats to all members. It is advisable to draft a detailed complaint including all relevant information and submit it to the RERA authority.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Land acquired by the government for a specific public purpose such as, establishing a cement factory is bound by the conditions set at the time of acquisition. If the land is no longer being used for the purpose for which it was acquired, there may be grounds for reclaiming it. In order to reclaim the land we have to check whether the land is genuinely not being used for the cement factory and for how long has it remained unutilized. If it remains unutilized for five years from the date of possession, it shall return to the original owner or their legal heirs. After that, file a petition in the appropriate court or tribunal seeking the return of the land. However, the consideration of the 1.32 acres of land for road given to the factory, complicates the reclamation process. You can also consider filing a Right to Information (RTI) application to get detailed information about the current status of the land. Consulting a lawyer is necessary to pursue this matter effectively.

    "answer": "It is not an ancestral property either in your hands or in your father's hands or in the hands of your grandfather.Your grandfather inherited his share of property out of his father's property hence it becomes your grandfather's self acquired property.Therefore your grandfather was right in transferring his property to his grandson i.e., you because being an absolute owner he has full rights to dispose his property to anyone of his choice and by any mode, to which nobody has a right to challenge.The ancestral property  is a property that remains undivided forat least four generationswithin a Hindu Joint Family. Ancestral property in a Hindu Joint Family spans four generations, remains undivided with equal shares, and is inherited by birth, not death.In your case the next generation of your great grandfather has inherited the intestate property thereby the nature of ancestral property stands automatically extinguished.The reply what your lawyer gave to your sister's legal notice in this regard is proper and perfect you can adopt the reply ion the same lines.The property transferred to you by your grandfather is your own and self acquired property hence the claim made by your father is not maintainable, at least not during the lifetime of your grandfather.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "More clarification on how properties become self acquired & four generation concept",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Self-acquired property refers to the property acquired by a person through his own efforts and not inherited from ancestors. Under Section 8 ofHindu Succession Act,1956, when a Hindu male dies intestate, his property devolves upon his heirs, including sons, daughters, widow, and mother. On the other hand, Ancestral property is property that is inherited up to four generations of male lineage. It should remain undivided until the fourth generation. The Four generation rule means that The property should remain undivided for at least four generations, meaning the original owner and three subsequent generations. When your GGF died intestate in 1969, the property was inherited by your GF. Based on theHindu Succession Act, 1956, the property inherited by your GF from your GGF would be considered self-acquired property in the hands of your GF. He has absolute rights to dispose of it as he wishes, including gifting it. In the case ofUttam Singh vs Subagh Singh AIR 2016 SC 1169, The Supreme Court held that property inherited by a Hindu from his paternal ancestors after theHindu Succession Act, 1956, would not be considered ancestral property but self-acquired property. Hence, you can argue that since your GF inherited the property after theHindu Succession Act, 1956, it is his self-acquired property, emphasizing that the property was not held undivided by four generations, and thus, it does not meet the criteria for ancestral property as defined under Hindu law.

You can file a complaint with the RERA authority for this violation. A demand letter without a formal agreement does not create a legally enforceable obligation to pay interest. Interest can only be charged if there is a contractual provision for it. The builder cannot charge interest in the absence of a formal agreement. You can file a complaint with RERA, highlighting that no formal agreement (PAAA) was signed, and hence, the demand for interest is invalid. It is the builder’s obligation to provide flats to all members. It is advisable to draft a detailed complaint including all relevant information and submit it to the RERA authority.

    "question": "Legal option about land granted long ago",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The term “Kushki land” generally refers to dry or unirrigated land. Since it was granted by the government, ideally, there should be documentation proving the grant, including the year and conditions of the grant. The absence of a document proving the government grant can be a red flag. Gomala lands are grazing lands reserved for cattle by the government. If the land is indeed classified as gomala, it is typically not available for private purchase and may be subject to different regulations. The asterisk in the survey number can indicate several things, such as a sub-division or specific classification of land. Consult with the local land records office to clarify the meaning of the asterisk in the survey number. While an agreement on a ₹100 stamp paper indicates an intention to create a legal obligation, it is not a registered document, which weakens its enforceability. If the seller refuses to return the token advance, you can still file a suit for recovery of the amount based on the receipt as evidence of the transaction. Consulting with legal and property experts can help ensure that the land purchase is safe and legally sound.

    "answer": "- Gomala land in Karnataka refers to areas designated as common grazing lands or pastures , and the government primarily assigned these land parcels to rural communities to graze livestock while preserving natural resources.- Further, the government has strict rules and regulations to protect Gomala land from being sold or misused, and any attempt to sell or privatize Gomala land is subject to legal action.- Hence, you may face trouble in future if you will purchase such lands.- You can recover your advance payment from the seller on this ground.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "First of all Rera will not apply to your case as you are being allotted a rehab flat (even if it be from the sale component) in lieu of your old flat and despite you opting to buy extra space against monetary considerationSo you would not be an allottee as is understood under ReraAs the builder has refused to allot the flat to you and has demanded interest for alleged delayed payment, you will have to file a suit against himIn that suit you will have to seek the relief of allotment of the flat and for a declaration that the demand letter is not binding on you and you are not liable to pay any interestYou will also have to seek the relief of registering the PAAA with youI feel that the Court will mostly grant you the relief of allotment of the flat and the question of your liability to pay any interest will be decided by the courtAs you have the bank sanction letter, you would be in a position to pay the consideration for extra space , however without any interest, which would be decided by the court at the time of trial in the suit. If you get the relief of registering of paaa and allotment of flat, then you can deposit the registered paaa with the bank so that it can release the payment to the builder,  minus the interestThis is my prima facie viewYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "The process of society redevelopment involves obtaining consent from a minimum percentage of society members, appointing a developer, preparing a redevelopment agreement, obtaining approvals, demolishing existing structures, and constructing new ones, followed by the handover of redeveloped units to society memberst has been often noticed that during the process of redevelopment, the terms of Development Agreements as agreed upon, are later twisted and grossly violated by the Developers and the ground rules of MRTP and DCR by unlawful planning are flouted by constructing additional/unauthorized areas that are beyond the entitlement (i.e. beyond the plot FSI and the TDR/FSI loaded) for their hidden financial gains.RERAprovides legal protection to buyers and ensures that developers fulfill their commitments. Timely Delivery: Buyers can expect better adherence to project timelines, minimizing inconveniences. Quality Assurance: Redevelopment projects are held to the same quality standards as new constructionsA permanent alternate accommodation agreement (PAAA), which protects the rights and claims of the home-owner, should also be signed before vacating the flat and commencing redevelopment. .However, it appears that this has not happened in your Society.However in the absence of signing the PAAA the demand made by the developer towards the interest over the dues in this regard can be an unjustified claim and not maintainable because the builder is taking the advantage over the flat owners on such fictitious reason.You can proceed legally against the  developerYou can drag him to consumer grievances rederessal commission for deficiency in service and also for unfair trade practice adopted by the developer.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Delay in providing PAAA by the builder and charging interest",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Since the builder did not enter into a PAAA before you vacated the flat, he is in violation of RERA Section 13(1) which states that a promoter cannot accept more than 10% of the cost of the apartment as an advance payment without first entering into a written agreement for sale (PAAA) and registering the same. You can file a complaint with the RERA authority for this violation. A demand letter without a formal agreement does not create a legally enforceable obligation to pay interest. Interest can only be charged if there is a contractual provision for it. The builder cannot charge interest in the absence of a formal agreement. You can file a complaint with RERA, highlighting that no formal agreement (PAAA) was signed, and hence, the demand for interest is invalid. It is the builder’s obligation to provide flats to all members. It is advisable to draft a detailed complaint including all relevant information and submit it to the RERA authority. Consult a property lawyer to help you draft a RERA complaint and represent you if necessary.

    "question": "Appeal in High Court Against Interim maintenance order u/s 125 CrPC",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Appeal Against Interim Maintenance Order: Yes, you can still appeal. According to Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963, you can file a petition for condonation of delay along with your appeal, explaining the reasons for the delay. The High Court may condone the delay if it finds the reasons satisfactory.Jurisdiction Issue Under Section125 CrPC: The proceedings under Section 125 can be initiated in places where the wife is residing, where the husband is residing or where the husband last resided with his wife. Since your wife was living with you in Delhi on the date of case filing, you can argue a jurisdictional issue. The case should ideally be filed where you both last resided together.Maintenance Order and Rajnish vs Neha Judgement: You can appeal this decision in the High Court, arguing that paying maintenance for the period during which you were already supporting your wife and children is unjust. The Rajnish vs. Neha judgement mandates interim maintenance from the date of application, but the facts of your case suggest you were already providing for them during that period.Evidence of Intent to Leave: Section 125(4) CrPC states that no wife shall be entitled to receive maintenance if she is living in adultery, or if, without any sufficient reason, she refuses to live with her husband, or if they are living separately by mutual consent. Your wife’s messages to the school can be used to demonstrate her intent to leave and could strengthen your appeal in the High Court.Concealing Job Details and Misleading Statements: Your wife hiding job details and misleading statements in the High Court can be used in the court to significantly impact the credibility of her claims.Filing Section 91 CrPC Application: Under Section 91 CrPC, you can request the court to summon documents necessary for your defence, including your wife's employer for salary detailsChargesheet in 498A Case: It's advisable not to ignore court proceedings. Failing to attend could lead to adverse consequences, including the issuance of non-bailable warrants. Engage with your lawyer to get a copy of the chargesheet and prepare your defenceUsing your 323, 506, 34 IPC case in 498A proceedings: While the two cases are separate, you can argue that your in-laws’ behavior and the pending case against them reflect on their credibility and possible malice. However, each case will be judged on its own merits. It may not directly influence the 498A case but can be part of the overall narrative of your defense.Work with your lawyer to come over this issue efficiently.

    "question": "Appeal in High Court Against Interim maintenance order u/s 125 CrPC",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Given the judge's indication that the interim maintenance order could be dismissed if you prove your wife's employment status was hidden, it may be prudent to wait and present your evidence in the family court. If the family court sets aside the interim maintenance order based on the false affidavit, you will have resolved the issue without needing to appeal. However, if you do choose to appeal, you can request a stay on the interim maintenance order from the High Court. High Courts do consider stays in such cases, especially if there is evidence of false statements or concealment of material facts. The family court can still set aside the interim maintenance order based on your evidence, even if the High Court is considering the appeal.Generally, under the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness, the respondent should be provided with an advance copy of the evidence and the list of witnesses by the petitioner. In practice, this can vary, and sometimes such documents are only handed over in court on the date of hearing. However, you can request the court to ensure you receive these documents in advance.The average time for an appeal against an interim maintenance order in the High Court can vary significantly based on the court's backlog, complexity of the case, and efficiency of legal proceedings. It can take anywhere from a few months to years.Unemployment can be considered a reasonable ground for the delay in filing an appeal, particularly if it has caused financial constraints or other hardships.The High Court will review the family court's interim maintenance order to ensure it was made in accordance with the law and facts presented. The High Court may stay the family court's order if it finds merit in the appeal, especially if there is prima facie evidence of false statements or concealment. The High Court may also direct the family court to expedite the proceedings or provide specific instructions regarding the handling of the case.Should you require any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Ancestral property in a Hindu Joint Family spans four generations, remains undivided with equal shares, and is inherited by birth, not death.In your case the next generation of your great grandfather has inherited the intestate property thereby the nature of ancestral property stands automatically extinguished.The reply what your lawyer gave to your sister's legal notice in this regard is proper and perfect you can adopt the reply ion the same lines.The property transferred to you by your grandfather is your own and self acquired property hence the claim made by your father is not maintainable, at least not during the lifetime of your grandfather.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "More clarification on how properties become self acquired & four generation concept",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Self-acquired property refers to the property acquired by a person through his own efforts and not inherited from ancestors. Under Section 8 ofHindu Succession Act,1956, when a Hindu male dies intestate, his property devolves upon his heirs, including sons, daughters, widow, and mother. On the other hand, Ancestral property is property that is inherited up to four generations of male lineage. It should remain undivided until the fourth generation. The Four generation rule means that The property should remain undivided for at least four generations, meaning the original owner and three subsequent generations. When your GGF died intestate in 1969, the property was inherited by your GF. Based on theHindu Succession Act, 1956, the property inherited by your GF from your GGF would be considered self-acquired property in the hands of your GF. He has absolute rights to dispose of it as he wishes, including gifting it. In the case ofUttam Singh vs Subagh Singh AIR 2016 SC 1169, The Supreme Court held that property inherited by a Hindu from his paternal ancestors after theHindu Succession Act, 1956, would not be considered ancestral property but self-acquired property. Hence, you can argue that since your GF inherited the property after theHindu Succession Act, 1956, it is his self-acquired property, emphasizing that the property was not held undivided by four generations, and thus, it does not meet the criteria for ancestral property as defined under Hindu law.

    "answer": "Certain significant modifications have been brought forth by the Act of 2019 concerning the pecuniary jurisdiction for all the forums i.e. the District, State, and National Commissions, respectively:The upper limit of pecuniary jurisdiction for the District Commission has been increased from Rs.20,00, 000 to Rs.100,00,000 as per Section 34,Consumer Protection Act, 2019.The limit of pecuniary jurisdiction for the State Commission  has been increased from Rs.100,00,000 to Rs.10,00,00,000 as per Section 47,Consumer Protection Act, 2019 and,The limit of pecuniary jurisdiction for the National Commission has been increased from above Rs.10,00,00,000 to above Rs.10,00,00,000 as per Section 58,Consumer Protection Act, 2019.These modifications have widened the scope of pecuniary jurisdiction to a much larger extent. Along with the above-mentioned changes, the 2019 Act has also changed the means for the determination of the pecuniary jurisdiction on the basis of the valuation of goods and services payable as consideration, unlike the 1986 Act where, pecuniary jurisdiction was determined by the value of the goods and services as well as the compensation sought, therefore not escalating the amount of compensation claimed to bring the complaint within the pecuniary jurisdiction of State or National Commission.For determining the value of the complaint, the aggregate value of the goods or services and compensation claimed by the complainant. This was held in the case of “M/s Pyaridevi Chabiraj Steels Pvt. Ltd. v.

The pecuniary jurisdiction of the District Commission is determined by the value of the goods or services paid as consideration, not the compensation claimed. Since the hospital bill (the value of the services paid as consideration) is ₹26 lakhs, it falls within the jurisdiction of the District Consumer Forum, which handles cases where the value does not exceed ₹1 crore.

If the land is no longer being used for the purpose for which it was acquired, there may be grounds for reclaiming it. In order to reclaim the land we have to check whether the land is genuinely not being used for the cement factory and for how long has it remained unutilized. If it remains unutilized for five years from the date of possession, it shall return to the original owner or their legal heirs. After that, file a petition in the appropriate court or tribunal seeking the return of the land. However, the consideration of the 1.32 acres of land for road given to the factory, complicates the reclamation process.

Ancestral property in a Hindu Joint Family spans four generations, remains undivided with equal shares, and is inherited by birth, not death.In your case the next generation of your great grandfather has inherited the intestate property thereby the nature of ancestral property stands automatically extinguished.The reply what your lawyer gave to your sister's legal notice in this regard is proper and perfect you can adopt the reply ion the same lines.The property transferred to you by your grandfather is your own and self acquired property hence the claim made by your father is not maintainable, at least not during the lifetime of your grandfather.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "More clarification on how properties become self acquired & four generation concept",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Self-acquired property refers to the property acquired by a person through his own efforts and not inherited from ancestors. Under Section 8 ofHindu Succession Act,1956, when a Hindu male dies intestate, his property devolves upon his heirs, including sons, daughters, widow, and mother. On the other hand, Ancestral property is property that is inherited up to four generations of male lineage. It should remain undivided until the fourth generation. The Four generation rule means that The property should remain undivided for at least four generations, meaning the original owner and three subsequent generations. When your GGF died intestate in 1969, the property was inherited by your GF. Based on theHindu Succession Act, 1956, the property inherited by your GF from your GGF would be considered self-acquired property in the hands of your GF. He has absolute rights to dispose of it as he wishes, including gifting it. In the case ofUttam Singh vs Subagh Singh AIR 2016 SC 1169, The Supreme Court held that property inherited by a Hindu from his paternal ancestors after theHindu Succession Act, 1956, would not be considered ancestral property but self-acquired property. Hence, you can argue that since your GF inherited the property after theHindu Succession Act, 1956, it is his self-acquired property, emphasizing that the property was not held undivided by four generations, and thus, it does not meet the criteria for ancestral property as defined under Hindu law.

Ensure that the partition deed, which is registered, clearly delineates ownership among your father and his brothers.Work with a legal expert to address the title clearance issues. This includes resolving the impact of the first party's suit under Article 54 and the ongoing partition suit filed by one of the sisters. The title clearance certificate can only be obtained if these disputes are resolved or clarified.Given that both the 1991 and 2015 contracts are unregistered and have no end date, you may need to negotiate with the current parties involved to formally terminate these contracts. This step is crucial to preventing future legal claims.Ensure that all co-owners (your father and his three brothers) are in agreement about selling the land. This collective agreement is essential to proceed with the sale and to avoid any internal disputes.If necessary, file a petition in court seeking a declaratory judgement on the validity and enforceability of the unregistered contracts and to obtain a clear directive on the land's title status.

    "question": "Land title clearance certificate",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your ongoing case of specific performance, whether the unregistered agreement for the development of construction on your land can be admitted as evidence depends on several factors. The Supreme Court judgement in \"Hemlatha vs. . Kasthuri\" indicates that an unregistered agreement to sell can be admissible in specific performance suits under certain conditions.In your agreement from 1991, which outlines a development scheme with a 75–25 percent cost and profit-sharing ratio but lacks a specified time period, its admissibility may hinge on its nature. If the court considers it a contract for sale, it may require registration under the Registration Act. However, if it is deemed a mutual understanding or development agreement, it may not need to be registered.Given that the plaintiff's suit was filed within the three-year limitation period, counted from the discovery of the notice in 2015, your unregistered agreement might still be considered valid evidence for the specific performance suit. Ultimately, the court will decide based on the specifics of your case and relevant legal precedents.

If the land is no longer being used for the purpose for which it was acquired, there may be grounds for reclaiming it.

Since you and your brother hold the sale deed for the land and building, you are effectively co-owners of the property. You can apply to the local authority (Panchayat) to recognize and register your co-ownership of the building. Draft a joint ownership declaration agreement with your brother. This agreement should clearly state that both of you are co-owners of the entire building and the land, specifying the division of 11 square meters each. This document can be notarized to add legal weight. File a joint application for the mutation of property records with the Panchayat office. If the local authorities insist on a single building number and refuse to issue separate numbers, you can still proceed with a partition deed. If you still face resistance from the local authority, you may need to approach the civil court. File a suit for partition and declaration of co-ownership. Seek legal advice from a property lawyer who can guide you through drafting the joint ownership declaration, partition deed, and filing for mutation or a suit for partition.

    "question": "Ad Valorem Court Fees in suit for declaration of title and injunction",
    "answer": "in order to find out whether the suit is properly valued or not, one has to look into the averments in the plaint, the relief sought for and then decide the provision which is to be invoked for payment of court fee. In this context, it is also necessary to keep in mind Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963.The declaration that a particular sale deed is not binding on the plaintiff would become necessary only when a person who has interest in the property, but is not a signatory to the document, and some other person purports to convey the said title.in other cases, whether the subject matter of the suit is capable of valuation or not, fee shall be computed on the amount at which the relief sought is valued in the plaint or on rupees one thousand whichever is higher.That is precisely what Section 31 of the Specific Performance Act provides. Any person against whom a written instrument is void or voidable and who has reasonable apprehension that such instrument, if left outstanding may cause him serious injury, may sue to have it adjudged void or voidable. Therefore, only a person who is a party to the instrument is entitled to such relief. Any person against whom the instrument is void/voidable reasonably apprehends that such instrument if left outstanding, it may cause him serious injury, he may bring a suit to get the document annulled. That is precisely what is done by the plaintiff by filing the suit. A clever drafting would not enable the plaintiff to avoid payment of court fee. Instead of seeking possession after cancellation, the relief is sought is by way of mandatory injunction directing the defendant to surrender the schedule property, failing which he would get it through process of court. In other words, after the sale deed is cancelled, the plaintiff wants delivery of possession. Therefore, he ought to have sought for cancellation of the sale deed under Section 31 of the Specific Performance Act, sought for consequential reliefs then the valuation of suit may not be proper.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

In the case ofTara Devi v. Sri Thakur Radha Krishna Maharaj through Sebaits Chandeshwar Prasad & Meshwar Prasad & Anr.[AIR 1987 SC 2085], the Supreme Court held that \"whenever the suit is for declaration and consequential relief, the value put forward by the plaintiff for the purpose of court fees and for the purpose of suit valuation is to be generally accepted by the court, except where the same is 'demonstratively arbitrary' or 'unreasonable'.” Therefore, in your case, as you are already in settled possession of the property based on the GPA/Will/ATS transaction, the court fees paid for the injunction and declaration reliefs should be sufficient. In order to address the court order, you can draft an application requesting the reconsideration of the court fee order through your lawyer emphasizing that you have been in continuous and settled possession of the property for 32 years and that your suit primarily seeks to confirm your existing rights rather than recover possession.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "How can my father legally protect his assets from my stepmother and ensure his children inherit his wealth",
    "answer": "Hello,If it was a family decision to disregard your grandfather's Will, there's nothing you can do about it now, unless you want to approach the Court to make everyone honour the registered agreement by which the property was transferred in your name, unless this had been cancelled subsequently with your consent and the family's joint decision for a fair division.Now as far as your father desiring to secure the larger share in favour of you and your sister, there are two ways of doing it. Your father can transfer through a registered gift deed whatever properties he wants to transfer to the three of you. Alternately, he can make Will bequeathing his property, movable and immovable in the proportion that he chooses.S J MathewAdvocate, Mumbai3603 Answers175 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate S J Mathew"

    "question": "How can my father legally protect his assets from my stepmother and ensure his children inherit his wealth",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Your father can take several legal steps to protect his assets and ensure that they benefit you and your sister while giving your stepmother a fair but limited share. Firstly, he should consider creating a comprehensive will that clearly outlines the distribution of his assets. He can specify that certain properties and financial assets are to be inherited by you and your sister, ensuring that your stepmother receives only a limited portion.Secondly, he can set up a trust for you and your sister, which would manage and protect the assets from any potential claims by your stepmother. The trust can be structured to provide income or benefits to your stepmother while preserving the principal for you and your sister.Thirdly, he can change the ownership and beneficiary designations on any joint properties, financial accounts, or insurance policies to reflect his wishes. This might involve removing her as a joint owner or beneficiary and designating you and your sister instead.Lastly, your father should consult with a family law attorney to explore any legal avenues for separation or divorce if the relationship with your stepmother is untenable. This could potentially reduce her claims on his assets.By taking these steps, your father can better ensure that his wealth is distributed according to his wishes and minimize the risk of your stepmother acquiring more than her fair share.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "How can my father legally protect his assets from my stepmother and ensure his children inherit his wealth",
    "answer": "Dear Client,There are various strategies to ensure that your stepmother cannot transfer the property to her relatives if she becomes the sole owner.If the property is held in joint tenancy with rights of survivorship your father could consider restructuring the ownership to tenants-in-common, where each owner has a defined share that can be bequeathed separately through a will. This way, your father's share can be passed directly to you or your sister, ensuring your stepmother does not become the sole owner.Your father can specify in his will that his share of the property will go to you and your sister upon his death. If the property is jointly owned, he can only bequeath his share, not the entire property. Alternatively, he could set up a trust where the property is placed, and you, your sister, and your stepmother are all beneficiaries. The trust can specify that your stepmother has the right to reside in the property for her lifetime, but cannot sell or transfer it to anyone else. After her death, the property would automatically transfer to you and your sister.Your father could include a clause in the deed with your stepmother, preventing her from selling or transferring the property without the consent of all co-owners or beneficiaries. Another option is to draft an agreement or contract with her now that explicitly states that she cannot transfer the property to anyone outside the immediate family without your consent.If your father grants her power of attorney over his affairs, he can place limitations on it, such as prohibiting the sale or transfer of the property without his consent or without following certain procedures.To implement these strategies effectively, your father should work closely with a property lawyer. The lawyer can draft the necessary documents, ensuring they are legally binding and enforceable.

    "answer": "Dear Client,It is not legally permissible to transfer the land property of a residential apartment building condominium to an unregistered building association in Karnataka as the transfer of property generally requires the recipient to be a legally recognized entity. An unregistered building association does not have a separate legal identity and cannot hold property in its name. To comply with legal requirements, the building association must be registered under the Karnataka Societies Registration Act, 1960. Once the association is registered, a conveyance deed should be prepared, signed and registered at the sub registrar’s office in order to transfer the property from the current owners to the registered association. After the conveyance deed is registered, update the property records with the municipal corporation to reflect the new ownership by the registered association. Following the proper legal procedures ensures the transfer is valid and recognized by authorities.  It is advisable to hire a lawyer to help you in following these procedures.

    "answer": "Dear Client,If you sign a written declaration agreeing to give your child a share of any property that might be transferred to you in the future, this could become a binding legal obligation. This might include any property inherited from your father or acquired by you later. Your wife could potentially use this declaration in the future to claim a share of the property for your child, even if your financial situation changes or if you have other children later. This declaration might also limit your ability to freely transfer or sell property without fulfilling the obligation first. Under Hindu law, your father’s property will only become your self-acquired property after it is legally transferred to you. Until then, you have no legal ownership, and any declaration made now might be challenged for being premature or speculative.Explain to your wife that it is legally premature to make a declaration about property you do not currently own. Offer alternative arrangements, such as setting up a fixed deposit or a trust in your child’s name, which can provide financial security without committing to a future property share. You might also propose to include a clause stating that any future property distribution will be done according to mutual agreement, allowing flexibility. Politely but firmly refuse to sign any declaration that might bind you to future property distribution.

    "question": "I have already bought a house from a society which has got the layout with govt",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Unless the stay order clearly names specific plots or dwellings, your home may not be immediately affected if it is limited to the survey number. That being said, there may be unintended consequences for future ownership clarity and real estate transactions if the entire survey number is placed under hold. The government's seizure of land and its subsequent distribution to society are made more legitimate by a recent High Court decision that upholds the land acquisition procedure and the landowner's compensation. The High Court's ruling is upheld unless the landowner takes legal action, which could result in more legal scrutiny. An indemnity clause in the selling deed can shield you from lawsuits from other parties. This gives you some legal protection by committing the seller to pay for any loss or harm brought on by third parties. Even though the indemnity clause provides protection, it is wise to hold off until the stay order is resolved, particularly if the dispute goes all the way to the Supreme Court. By doing this, you can be sure that you won't run into any financial or legal problems. Getting a copy of the RSA24/2020 stay order is essential, as you correctly pointed out. The purpose and extent of the stay will become clearer as a result.

This document can be notarized to add legal weight. File a joint application for the mutation of property records with the Panchayat office. If the local authorities insist on a single building number and refuse to issue separate numbers, you can still proceed with a partition deed. If you still face resistance from the local authority, you may need to approach the civil court. File a suit for partition and declaration of co-ownership.

    "answer": "Dear Client,If the project completion date has expired, the developer should have sought an extension from RERA before the deadline. The status of \"blocked\" typically means that this process has not been followed, or the extension was not granted. This can have implications for the legal status of the project and any transactions related to it. Release Order from BIAAPA and Individual Kathas indicate that the local planning authority (BIAAPA) and municipal authorities have recognized the project and its individual plots, which is a positive sign regarding the legitimacy of the development. It is advisable to Confirm with the RERA authority why the project is blocked and if there is any possibility for the developer to resolve this issue. Contact the developer and ensure that the developer resolves the RERA blocking issue, either by extending the project completion date or addressing any other compliance requirements. It is a plus point that you are satisfied with the development and amenities but legal compliance is crucial. Proceeding with registration in a blocked project can result in future legal complications. Hence, before registration make sure that the project status is updated and compliant.

An unregistered building association does not have a separate legal identity and cannot hold property in its name. To comply with legal requirements, the building association must be registered under the Karnataka Societies Registration Act, 1960. Once the association is registered, a conveyance deed should be prepared, signed and registered at the sub registrar’s office in order to transfer the property from the current owners to the registered association. After the conveyance deed is registered, update the property records with the municipal corporation to reflect the new ownership by the registered association. Following the proper legal procedures ensures the transfer is valid and recognized by authorities.  It is advisable to hire a lawyer to help you in following these procedures.

Since you and your brother hold the sale deed for the land and building, you are effectively co-owners of the property. You can apply to the local authority (Panchayat) to recognize and register your co-ownership of the building. Draft a joint ownership declaration agreement with your brother. This agreement should clearly state that both of you are co-owners of the entire building and the land, specifying the division of 11 square meters each. This document can be notarized to add legal weight. File a joint application for the mutation of property records with the Panchayat office. If the local authorities insist on a single building number and refuse to issue separate numbers, you can still proceed with a partition deed. If you still face resistance from the local authority, you may need to approach the civil court. File a suit for partition and declaration of co-ownership. Seek legal advice from a property lawyer who can guide you through drafting the joint ownership declaration, partition deed, and filing for mutation or a suit for partition.

If sub-division and obtaining separate building numbers are not feasible, you can establish co-ownership of the building by Preparing and registering a partition deed to formalize the division of the property between you and your brother. Once the partition is done, file a mutation application to update the property records to reflect ownership details.

    "question": "Transfer of land property to an unregistered building association in Karnataka",
    "answer": "Dear Client,It is not legally permissible to transfer the land property of a residential apartment building condominium to an unregistered building association in Karnataka as the transfer of property generally requires the recipient to be a legally recognized entity. An unregistered building association does not have a separate legal identity and cannot hold property in its name. To comply with legal requirements, the building association must be registered under the Karnataka Societies Registration Act, 1960. Once the association is registered, a conveyance deed should be prepared, signed and registered at the sub registrar’s office in order to transfer the property from the current owners to the registered association. After the conveyance deed is registered, update the property records with the municipal corporation to reflect the new ownership by the registered association. Following the proper legal procedures ensures the transfer is valid and recognized by authorities.  It is advisable to hire a lawyer to help you in following these procedures.

However, they do acquire some rights under your states’ rent control act. The tenant may claim rights under rent control laws, making it difficult to evict them or increase rent.

Include clear grounds for termination of the lease by both parties. Ensure the agreement clearly establishes the terms of the new tenancy and includes provisions that protect your interests.

Since you and your brother hold the sale deed for the land and building, you are effectively co-owners of the property. You can apply to the local authority (Panchayat) to recognize and register your co-ownership of the building. Draft a joint ownership declaration agreement with your brother. This agreement should clearly state that both of you are co-owners of the entire building and the land, specifying the division of 11 square meters each. This document can be notarized to add legal weight. File a joint application for the mutation of property records with the Panchayat office. If the local authorities insist on a single building number and refuse to issue separate numbers, you can still proceed with a partition deed. If you still face resistance from the local authority, you may need to approach the civil court. File a suit for partition and declaration of co-ownership. Seek legal advice from a property lawyer who can guide you through drafting the joint ownership declaration, partition deed, and filing for mutation or a suit for partition.

One of the simplest ways to transfer ownership is through a gift deed. You and your father can execute a gift deed in favor of your wife, transferring your respective shares in the apartment to her. Another option is to sell the property to your wife by executing a sale deed in her favour, even if it's for a nominal amount. If the apartment is considered joint family property, you and your father can execute a relinquishment deed to relinquish your respective shares in favor of your wife. You and your father can also prepare a will bequeathing your respective shares in the apartment to your wife. This will take effect after your demise and your father's demise.

In Maharashtra the stamp duty for a gift deed of immovable property gifted to a family member is typically between 2% - 6% subject to worth of the property. The registration fee is also a percentage of the property value. In Maharashtra, the registration fee for a gift deed is usually around 1% of the property value, subject to a maximum cap. Once the gift deed is executed, the ownership of the property will transfer to your wife. Consequently, she will have the right to execute rental agreements.

According to Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963, you can file a petition for condonation of delay along with your appeal, explaining the reasons for the delay. The High Court may condone the delay if it finds the reasons satisfactory.Jurisdiction Issue Under Section125 CrPC: The proceedings under Section 125 can be initiated in places where the wife is residing, where the husband is residing or where the husband last resided with his wife. Since your wife was living with you in Delhi on the date of case filing, you can argue a jurisdictional issue. The case should ideally be filed where you both last resided together.Maintenance Order and Rajnish vs Neha Judgement: You can appeal this decision in the High Court, arguing that paying maintenance for the period during which you were already supporting your wife and children is unjust. The Rajnish vs. Neha judgement mandates interim maintenance from the date of application, but the facts of your case suggest you were already providing for them during that period.Evidence of Intent to Leave: Section 125(4) CrPC states that no wife shall be entitled to receive maintenance if she is living in adultery, or if, without any sufficient reason, she refuses to live with her husband, or if they are living separately by mutual consent. Your wife’s messages to the school can be used to demonstrate her intent to leave and could strengthen your appeal in the High Court.Concealing Job Details and Misleading Statements: Your wife hiding job details and misleading statements in the High Court can be used in the court to significantly impact the credibility of her claims.Filing Section 91 CrPC Application: Under Section 91 CrPC, you can request the court to summon documents necessary for your defence, including your wife's employer for salary detailsChargesheet in 498A Case: It's advisable not to ignore court proceedings. Failing to attend could lead to adverse consequences, including the issuance of non-bailable warrants. Engage with your lawyer to get a copy of the chargesheet and prepare your defenceUsing your 323, 506, 34 IPC case in 498A proceedings: While the two cases are separate, you can argue that your in-laws’ behavior and the pending case against them reflect on their credibility and possible malice. However, each case will be judged on its own merits. It may not directly influence the 498A case but can be part of the overall narrative of your defense.Work with your lawyer to come over this issue efficiently.

    "question": "Appeal in High Court Against Interim maintenance order u/s 125 CrPC",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Given the judge's indication that the interim maintenance order could be dismissed if you prove your wife's employment status was hidden, it may be prudent to wait and present your evidence in the family court. If the family court sets aside the interim maintenance order based on the false affidavit, you will have resolved the issue without needing to appeal. However, if you do choose to appeal, you can request a stay on the interim maintenance order from the High Court. High Courts do consider stays in such cases, especially if there is evidence of false statements or concealment of material facts. The family court can still set aside the interim maintenance order based on your evidence, even if the High Court is considering the appeal.Generally, under the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness, the respondent should be provided with an advance copy of the evidence and the list of witnesses by the petitioner. In practice, this can vary, and sometimes such documents are only handed over in court on the date of hearing. However, you can request the court to ensure you receive these documents in advance.The average time for an appeal against an interim maintenance order in the High Court can vary significantly based on the court's backlog, complexity of the case, and efficiency of legal proceedings. It can take anywhere from a few months to years.Unemployment can be considered a reasonable ground for the delay in filing an appeal, particularly if it has caused financial constraints or other hardships.The High Court will review the family court's interim maintenance order to ensure it was made in accordance with the law and facts presented. The High Court may stay the family court's order if it finds merit in the appeal, especially if there is prima facie evidence of false statements or concealment. The High Court may also direct the family court to expedite the proceedings or provide specific instructions regarding the handling of the case.Should you require any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Expedite divorce case",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You have already filed an application under Section 21B of theHindu Marriage Act, which is the right step. Even though you are skeptical about approaching the High Court due to the backlog of cases, a writ petition under Article 227 of theConstitution of Indiacan be filed. A writ petition can be filed for the issuance of a writ of mandamus to direct the lower court to expedite the proceedings. Given your circumstances and the undue delay caused by the respondent, the High Court may take a sympathetic view and direct the lower court to expedite the case. Another choice you have is to file an affidavit in the trial court detailing the hardship caused by the delay, including your age, the health condition of your parents, and the undue financial burden due to the interim maintenance. This can sometimes persuade the judge to take more immediate action to expedite the proceedings. If there has been an order for speedy disposal and it is not being adhered to, you might consider filing a contempt petition. This step can be taken to enforce compliance with the court's order for expeditious disposal of the case. In exceptional cases where the judge is seen as biased or overly lenient towards the respondent, you can apply for a transfer of the case to another court. However, this is a rare remedy and is generally allowed under very compelling circumstances. It is advisable to consult with your advocate before taking any of these aforementioned steps.

    "context": "Asked 10 months ago in Property Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Can we buy 3rd floor 6 years flat without occupancy certificate",
    "answer": "Dear Client,An occupancy certificate is a crucial document that certifies a building's compliance with building codes and safety norms. It is issued by the local municipal authority. Without an OC, the building is technically considered unauthorized, and there can be significant legal and safety implications. The Building Regularization Scheme (BRS) allows for the regularization of unauthorized constructions by paying certain charges. However, as you mentioned, the BRS matter is pending in the Telangana High Court. This means the legality of the 5th floor and any construction regularized under BRS is uncertain until the court gives a verdict. Buying a flat without an OC means you have limited legal protection if the municipality decides to take action against the unauthorized construction. Also future resale of  the property may be difficult, as potential buyers might face the same issues with financing and legal compliance. Proceeding with the purchase without an OC is generally not advisable, especially when reputable institutions like HDFC Bank are refusing loans due to these issues. Consider waiting until there is a clear legal resolution regarding the BRS matter in the High Court or Look for properties that have the necessary legal clearances, including an occupancy certificate.

    "answer": "The reason why an OC is so important is because it is the final approval given to builders before home buyers can move into their newly-constructed flats, legally.Across the country, this certification is essential for developers to register housing units in the names of home-owners.If you decide to buy a flat without an O.C., it can cause a number of problems, including difficulty getting a home loan, difficulty getting insurance, and difficulty selling the property in the future.Additionally, you may be subject to fines or penalties for buying or occupying a property that does not have an O.C.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Can we buy 3rd floor 6 years flat without occupancy certificate",
    "answer": "Dear Client,An occupancy certificate is a crucial document that certifies a building's compliance with building codes and safety norms. It is issued by the local municipal authority. Without an OC, the building is technically considered unauthorized, and there can be significant legal and safety implications. The Building Regularization Scheme (BRS) allows for the regularization of unauthorized constructions by paying certain charges. However, as you mentioned, the BRS matter is pending in the Telangana High Court. This means the legality of the 5th floor and any construction regularized under BRS is uncertain until the court gives a verdict. Buying a flat without an OC means you have limited legal protection if the municipality decides to take action against the unauthorized construction. Also future resale of  the property may be difficult, as potential buyers might face the same issues with financing and legal compliance. Proceeding with the purchase without an OC is generally not advisable, especially when reputable institutions like HDFC Bank are refusing loans due to these issues. Consider waiting until there is a clear legal resolution regarding the BRS matter in the High Court or Look for properties that have the necessary legal clearances, including an occupancy certificate. Should you require any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "The reason why an OC is so important is because it is the final approval given to builders before home buyers can move into their newly-constructed flats, legally.Across the country, this certification is essential for developers to register housing units in the names of home-owners.If you decide to buy a flat without an O.C., it can cause a number of problems, including difficulty getting a home loan, difficulty getting insurance, and difficulty selling the property in the future.Additionally, you may be subject to fines or penalties for buying or occupying a property that does not have an O.C.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "- Occupancy Certificate evidences the completion of the building as per the approved plan and compliance of local laws.- If the builder is unable to obtain the occupancy certificate, it means that the builder has violated building law or deviated from Construction Plan, and further it is illegal to occupy in a building or apartment that doesn’t have an occupancy certificate.- Further, It is illegal to occupy in a building or apartment that doesn’t have an occupancy certificate. Buildings without OCs are not given a water connection and are charged a higher property tax.- Further, as per RERA,, A builder cannot give possession to buyers without OC- Hence, in the absence of an Occupancy Letter, you should not purchase the said flat, otherwise you may face the consequences in future.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Appeal in High Court Against Interim maintenance order u/s 125 CrPC",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Appeal Against Interim Maintenance Order: Yes, you can still appeal. According to Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963, you can file a petition for condonation of delay along with your appeal, explaining the reasons for the delay. The High Court may condone the delay if it finds the reasons satisfactory.Jurisdiction Issue Under Section125 CrPC: The proceedings under Section 125 can be initiated in places where the wife is residing, where the husband is residing or where the husband last resided with his wife. Since your wife was living with you in Delhi on the date of case filing, you can argue a jurisdictional issue. The case should ideally be filed where you both last resided together.Maintenance Order and Rajnish vs Neha Judgement: You can appeal this decision in the High Court, arguing that paying maintenance for the period during which you were already supporting your wife and children is unjust. The Rajnish vs. Neha judgement mandates interim maintenance from the date of application, but the facts of your case suggest you were already providing for them during that period.Evidence of Intent to Leave: Section 125(4) CrPC states that no wife shall be entitled to receive maintenance if she is living in adultery, or if, without any sufficient reason, she refuses to live with her husband, or if they are living separately by mutual consent. Your wife’s messages to the school can be used to demonstrate her intent to leave and could strengthen your appeal in the High Court.Concealing Job Details and Misleading Statements: Your wife hiding job details and misleading statements in the High Court can be used in the court to significantly impact the credibility of her claims.Filing Section 91 CrPC Application: Under Section 91 CrPC, you can request the court to summon documents necessary for your defence, including your wife's employer for salary detailsChargesheet in 498A Case: It's advisable not to ignore court proceedings. Failing to attend could lead to adverse consequences, including the issuance of non-bailable warrants.

    "question": "Appeal in High Court Against Interim maintenance order u/s 125 CrPC",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Given the judge's indication that the interim maintenance order could be dismissed if you prove your wife's employment status was hidden, it may be prudent to wait and present your evidence in the family court. If the family court sets aside the interim maintenance order based on the false affidavit, you will have resolved the issue without needing to appeal. However, if you do choose to appeal, you can request a stay on the interim maintenance order from the High Court. High Courts do consider stays in such cases, especially if there is evidence of false statements or concealment of material facts. The family court can still set aside the interim maintenance order based on your evidence, even if the High Court is considering the appeal.Generally, under the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness, the respondent should be provided with an advance copy of the evidence and the list of witnesses by the petitioner. In practice, this can vary, and sometimes such documents are only handed over in court on the date of hearing. However, you can request the court to ensure you receive these documents in advance.The average time for an appeal against an interim maintenance order in the High Court can vary significantly based on the court's backlog, complexity of the case, and efficiency of legal proceedings. It can take anywhere from a few months to years.Unemployment can be considered a reasonable ground for the delay in filing an appeal, particularly if it has caused financial constraints or other hardships.The High Court will review the family court's interim maintenance order to ensure it was made in accordance with the law and facts presented. The High Court may stay the family court's order if it finds merit in the appeal, especially if there is prima facie evidence of false statements or concealment. The High Court may also direct the family court to expedite the proceedings or provide specific instructions regarding the handling of the case.Should you require any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Ad Valorem Court Fees in suit for declaration of title and injunction",
    "answer": "in order to find out whether the suit is properly valued or not, one has to look into the averments in the plaint, the relief sought for and then decide the provision which is to be invoked for payment of court fee. In this context, it is also necessary to keep in mind Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963.The declaration that a particular sale deed is not binding on the plaintiff would become necessary only when a person who has interest in the property, but is not a signatory to the document, and some other person purports to convey the said title.in other cases, whether the subject matter of the suit is capable of valuation or not, fee shall be computed on the amount at which the relief sought is valued in the plaint or on rupees one thousand whichever is higher.That is precisely what Section 31 of the Specific Performance Act provides. Any person against whom a written instrument is void or voidable and who has reasonable apprehension that such instrument, if left outstanding may cause him serious injury, may sue to have it adjudged void or voidable. Therefore, only a person who is a party to the instrument is entitled to such relief. Any person against whom the instrument is void/voidable reasonably apprehends that such instrument if left outstanding, it may cause him serious injury, he may bring a suit to get the document annulled. That is precisely what is done by the plaintiff by filing the suit. A clever drafting would not enable the plaintiff to avoid payment of court fee. Instead of seeking possession after cancellation, the relief is sought is by way of mandatory injunction directing the defendant to surrender the schedule property, failing which he would get it through process of court. In other words, after the sale deed is cancelled, the plaintiff wants delivery of possession. Therefore, he ought to have sought for cancellation of the sale deed under Section 31 of the Specific Performance Act, sought for consequential reliefs then the valuation of suit may not be proper.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Expedite divorce case",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You have already filed an application under Section 21B of theHindu Marriage Act, which is the right step. Even though you are skeptical about approaching the High Court due to the backlog of cases, a writ petition under Article 227 of theConstitution of Indiacan be filed. A writ petition can be filed for the issuance of a writ of mandamus to direct the lower court to expedite the proceedings. Given your circumstances and the undue delay caused by the respondent, the High Court may take a sympathetic view and direct the lower court to expedite the case. Another choice you have is to file an affidavit in the trial court detailing the hardship caused by the delay, including your age, the health condition of your parents, and the undue financial burden due to the interim maintenance. This can sometimes persuade the judge to take more immediate action to expedite the proceedings. If there has been an order for speedy disposal and it is not being adhered to, you might consider filing a contempt petition. This step can be taken to enforce compliance with the court's order for expeditious disposal of the case. In exceptional cases where the judge is seen as biased or overly lenient towards the respondent, you can apply for a transfer of the case to another court. However, this is a rare remedy and is generally allowed under very compelling circumstances. It is advisable to consult with your advocate before taking any of these aforementioned steps.

    "question": "Can we buy 3rd floor 6 years flat without occupancy certificate",
    "answer": "Dear Client,An occupancy certificate is a crucial document that certifies a building's compliance with building codes and safety norms. It is issued by the local municipal authority. Without an OC, the building is technically considered unauthorized, and there can be significant legal and safety implications. The Building Regularization Scheme (BRS) allows for the regularization of unauthorized constructions by paying certain charges. However, as you mentioned, the BRS matter is pending in the Telangana High Court. This means the legality of the 5th floor and any construction regularized under BRS is uncertain until the court gives a verdict. Buying a flat without an OC means you have limited legal protection if the municipality decides to take action against the unauthorized construction. Also future resale of  the property may be difficult, as potential buyers might face the same issues with financing and legal compliance. Proceeding with the purchase without an OC is generally not advisable, especially when reputable institutions like HDFC Bank are refusing loans due to these issues. Consider waiting until there is a clear legal resolution regarding the BRS matter in the High Court or Look for properties that have the necessary legal clearances, including an occupancy certificate.

    "question": "Jurisdictional limits of High courts in Regular Second appeal for Civil Suit by Section 100 order xLII Rule1",
    "answer": "The jurisdiction of the High Court to entertain a SecondAppeal is well-known. It is a unique jurisdiction of the High Courtwhere the High Court can entertain a Regular Second Appeal purelyon a “substantial” question of law not even a question of law or aquestion of fact. It is a settled law that the first appellatecourt is the final Court insofar as the question of facts areconcerned and it is only when substantial questions of law wouldarise in a case that the High Court can entertain a Regular SecondAppeal and if at the stage of admission such substantial questionsof law are discerned by the High Court the same would have to beframed and the appeal(s) would have to be admitted. It is onlythereafter that the parties have to be heard on the substantialquestions of law that are framed by the High Court at the stage ofadmission.2) However, the CPC gives power to the High Court to frameadditional substantial questions of law or to mould the substantialquestions of law already framed on hearing the parties at the timeof final hearing of a Second Appeal. In the event the respondentsbefore the High Court are on record even at the stage of admissionof a Regular Second Appeal and the same is to be disposed offinally even at this stage substantial questions of law must beframed and answered before the Regular Second Appeal is admittedand disposed.3)If no substantial question of law arose in the case then the appealcould not have been entertained and ought to have been dismissed atthe stage of admission4) HC  would modify judgment without specific prayer from Appellant5) SC IN State Bank of India vs. S.N. Goyal (2008) 8 SCC 9215:has held“15. It is a matter of concern that the scope of second appeals and as also the procedural aspects of second appealsare often ignored by the High Courts. Some of the oft-repeated errors are:(a) Admitting a second appeal when it does not give rise to asubstantial question of law.(b) Admitting second appeals without formulating substantialquestion of law.8(c) Admitting second appeals by formulating a standard ormechanical question such as “whether on the facts and circumstances the judgment of the first appellate court calls for interference” as the substantial question of law.(d) Failing to consider and formulate relevant and appropriate substantial question(s) of law involved in the second appeal.(e) Rejecting second appeals on the ground that the case doesnot involve any substantial question of law, when the case infact involves substantial questions of law.(f) Reformulating the substantial question of law after theconclusion of the hearing, while preparing the judgment,thereby denying an opportunity to the parties to make  submissions on the reformulated substantial question of law.(g) Deciding second appeals by reappreciating evidence andinterfering with findings of fact, ignoring the questions oflaw.These lapses or technical errors lead to injustice and alsogive rise to avoidable further appeals to this Court and remands by this Court, thereby prolonging the period of litigation. Care should be taken to ensure that the cases not involving substantial questions of law are not entertained, and at the same time ensure that cases involving substantialquestions of law are not rejected as not involving substantial questions of law.”Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98557 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "question": "Jurisdictional limits of High courts in Regular Second appeal for Civil Suit by Section 100 order xLII Rule1",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The High Court can entertain a second appeal if it involves a \"substantial question of law.\"The substantial question of law has to be explicitly stated in the memorandum of appeal. The appeal will only be heard on the basis of these substantial questions of law. The High Court must frame the substantial question of law at the time of admission of the appeal. Both appellants and respondents are given an opportunity to be heard on these questions. If the High Court answers the substantial question of law in favour of the respondent, it typically dismisses the appeal. If the High Court finds the question in favour of the appellant, it may set aside the lower court’s decision and may remand the case back for further proceedings or directly pass the final order. The High Court, under its appellate jurisdiction, can modify the judgment of the lower courts. However, it must stay within the boundaries of the questions of law framed and heard. The High Court is not expected to go beyond the formulated questions of law and make decisions on matters that were not part of the original appeal. Order XLVII Rule 1 CPC deals with the review of judgments, but it's generally not used to modify an appellate decree unless there is a clerical or arithmetical mistake or there is a discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence, was not within the knowledge of the party seeking the review. The High Court does have the authority to modify or vary an appellate court’s judgment, but this authority is restricted to the substantial questions of law that were framed and heard. Any modification beyond the framed questions of law or without a specific prayer from the appellant could be considered as exceeding the High Court’s jurisdiction. Should you require any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Second appeal.—(1) Save as otherwise expressly provided in the body of this Code or by any other law for the time being in force, an appeal shall lie to the High Court from every decree passed in appeal by any Court subordinate to the High Court, if the High Court is satisfied that the case involve a substantial question of law.(2) An appeal may lie under this section from an appellate decree passed ex-parte.(3) In an appeal under this section, the memorandum of appeal shall precisely state the substantial question of law involved in the appeal.(4) Where the High Court is satisfied that a substantial question of law is involved in any case, it shall formulate that question.(5) The appeal shall be heard on the question so formulated and the respondent shall, at the hearing of the appeal, be allowed to argue that the case does not involve such question:Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall be deemed to take away or abridge the power of the Court to hear, for reasons to be recorded, the appeal on any other substantial question of law, not formulated by it, if it is satisfied that the case involves such question.”Rules 1 to 3 of Order XLII of the CPC provide for procedure for deciding a second appealAn appeal is judicial examination by a higher court of a decision of a subordinate court to rectify any possible error(s) in the order under appeal. The law provides the remedy of an appeal because of the recognition that those manning the judicial tiers too commit errors.In Shankar Ramchandra Abhyankar v. Krishnaji Dattatreya Bapat1, it was held thus:“5.……In the well known work of Story on Constitution (of United States), Vol. 2, Article 1761, it is stated that the essential criterion of appellate jurisdiction is that it revises and corrects the proceedings in a cause already instituted and does not create that cause. The appellate jurisdiction may be exercised in a variety of forms and, indeed, in any form in which the Legislature may choose to prescribe. According to Article 1762 the most usual modes of exercising appellate jurisdiction, at least those which are most known in the United States, are by awrit of error, or by an appeal, or by some process of removal of a suit from an inferior tribunal. An appeal is a process of civil law origin and removes a cause, entirely subjecting the fact as well as the law, to a review and a retrial.Order XLII of the CPC provides for the procedure to be followed while deciding appeals from the appellate decrees. It states that the Rules of Order XLI shall apply, so far as may be, to the appeals from appellate decrees.Words such as “so far as may be” or “insofar as” mean ‘as much’ or ‘to the extent’ or ‘to such extent’. By virtue of Order XLII Rule 1, the provisions of Order XLI are applicable to second appeal as well, though not in their entirety, but to certain extent.If, however, the High Court is satisfied after hearing the appellant at the time of admission that the appeal does not involve any substantial question of law, then such appeal is liable to be dismissed in limine without any notice to the respondents after recording a finding in the dismissal order that the appeal does not involve any substantial question of law within the meaning of sub-section . It is needless to say that for passing such order in limine, the High Court is required to assign the reasons in support of its conclusion.”T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Expedite divorce case",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You have already filed an application under Section 21B of theHindu Marriage Act, which is the right step. Even though you are skeptical about approaching the High Court due to the backlog of cases, a writ petition under Article 227 of theConstitution of Indiacan be filed. A writ petition can be filed for the issuance of a writ of mandamus to direct the lower court to expedite the proceedings. Given your circumstances and the undue delay caused by the respondent, the High Court may take a sympathetic view and direct the lower court to expedite the case. Another choice you have is to file an affidavit in the trial court detailing the hardship caused by the delay, including your age, the health condition of your parents, and the undue financial burden due to the interim maintenance. This can sometimes persuade the judge to take more immediate action to expedite the proceedings. If there has been an order for speedy disposal and it is not being adhered to, you might consider filing a contempt petition. This step can be taken to enforce compliance with the court's order for expeditious disposal of the case. In exceptional cases where the judge is seen as biased or overly lenient towards the respondent, you can apply for a transfer of the case to another court. However, this is a rare remedy and is generally allowed under very compelling circumstances. It is advisable to consult with your advocate before taking any of these aforementioned steps.

    "question": "Can we buy 3rd floor 6 years flat without occupancy certificate",
    "answer": "Dear Client,An occupancy certificate is a crucial document that certifies a building's compliance with building codes and safety norms. It is issued by the local municipal authority. Without an OC, the building is technically considered unauthorized, and there can be significant legal and safety implications. The Building Regularization Scheme (BRS) allows for the regularization of unauthorized constructions by paying certain charges. However, as you mentioned, the BRS matter is pending in the Telangana High Court. This means the legality of the 5th floor and any construction regularized under BRS is uncertain until the court gives a verdict. Buying a flat without an OC means you have limited legal protection if the municipality decides to take action against the unauthorized construction. Also future resale of  the property may be difficult, as potential buyers might face the same issues with financing and legal compliance. Proceeding with the purchase without an OC is generally not advisable, especially when reputable institutions like HDFC Bank are refusing loans due to these issues. Consider waiting until there is a clear legal resolution regarding the BRS matter in the High Court or Look for properties that have the necessary legal clearances, including an occupancy certificate.

Release Order from BIAAPA and Individual Kathas indicate that the local planning authority (BIAAPA) and municipal authorities have recognized the project and its individual plots, which is a positive sign regarding the legitimacy of the development. It is advisable to Confirm with the RERA authority why the project is blocked and if there is any possibility for the developer to resolve this issue. Contact the developer and ensure that the developer resolves the RERA blocking issue, either by extending the project completion date or addressing any other compliance requirements. It is a plus point that you are satisfied with the development and amenities but legal compliance is crucial.

    "question": "Jurisdictional limits of High courts in Regular Second appeal for Civil Suit by Section 100 order xLII Rule1",
    "answer": "The jurisdiction of the High Court to entertain a SecondAppeal is well-known. It is a unique jurisdiction of the High Courtwhere the High Court can entertain a Regular Second Appeal purelyon a “substantial” question of law not even a question of law or aquestion of fact. It is a settled law that the first appellatecourt is the final Court insofar as the question of facts areconcerned and it is only when substantial questions of law wouldarise in a case that the High Court can entertain a Regular SecondAppeal and if at the stage of admission such substantial questionsof law are discerned by the High Court the same would have to beframed and the appeal(s) would have to be admitted. It is onlythereafter that the parties have to be heard on the substantialquestions of law that are framed by the High Court at the stage ofadmission.2) However, the CPC gives power to the High Court to frameadditional substantial questions of law or to mould the substantialquestions of law already framed on hearing the parties at the timeof final hearing of a Second Appeal. In the event the respondentsbefore the High Court are on record even at the stage of admissionof a Regular Second Appeal and the same is to be disposed offinally even at this stage substantial questions of law must beframed and answered before the Regular Second Appeal is admittedand disposed.3)If no substantial question of law arose in the case then the appealcould not have been entertained and ought to have been dismissed atthe stage of admission4) HC  would modify judgment without specific prayer from Appellant5) SC IN State Bank of India vs. S.N. Goyal (2008) 8 SCC 9215:has held“15. It is a matter of concern that the scope of second appeals and as also the procedural aspects of second appealsare often ignored by the High Courts. Some of the oft-repeated errors are:(a) Admitting a second appeal when it does not give rise to asubstantial question of law.(b) Admitting second appeals without formulating substantialquestion of law.8(c) Admitting second appeals by formulating a standard ormechanical question such as “whether on the facts and circumstances the judgment of the first appellate court calls for interference” as the substantial question of law.(d) Failing to consider and formulate relevant and appropriate substantial question(s) of law involved in the second appeal.(e) Rejecting second appeals on the ground that the case doesnot involve any substantial question of law, when the case infact involves substantial questions of law.(f) Reformulating the substantial question of law after theconclusion of the hearing, while preparing the judgment,thereby denying an opportunity to the parties to make  submissions on the reformulated substantial question of law.(g) Deciding second appeals by reappreciating evidence andinterfering with findings of fact, ignoring the questions oflaw.These lapses or technical errors lead to injustice and alsogive rise to avoidable further appeals to this Court and remands by this Court, thereby prolonging the period of litigation. Care should be taken to ensure that the cases not involving substantial questions of law are not entertained, and at the same time ensure that cases involving substantialquestions of law are not rejected as not involving substantial questions of law.”Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98557 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

The  power of High Court is exercised under statutory provision of Civil Procedure Code, 1908. High Court is not exercising inherent jurisdiction under Article 226. Jurisdiction exercised under provision of law is limited by rights of parties involved. High Court cannot be generous to one party at the  cost of another.

    "question": "Jurisdictional limits of High courts in Regular Second appeal for Civil Suit by Section 100 order xLII Rule1",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The High Court can entertain a second appeal if it involves a \"substantial question of law.\"The substantial question of law has to be explicitly stated in the memorandum of appeal. The appeal will only be heard on the basis of these substantial questions of law. The High Court must frame the substantial question of law at the time of admission of the appeal. Both appellants and respondents are given an opportunity to be heard on these questions. If the High Court answers the substantial question of law in favour of the respondent, it typically dismisses the appeal. If the High Court finds the question in favour of the appellant, it may set aside the lower court’s decision and may remand the case back for further proceedings or directly pass the final order. The High Court, under its appellate jurisdiction, can modify the judgment of the lower courts. However, it must stay within the boundaries of the questions of law framed and heard. The High Court is not expected to go beyond the formulated questions of law and make decisions on matters that were not part of the original appeal. Order XLVII Rule 1 CPC deals with the review of judgments, but it's generally not used to modify an appellate decree unless there is a clerical or arithmetical mistake or there is a discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence, was not within the knowledge of the party seeking the review. The High Court does have the authority to modify or vary an appellate court’s judgment, but this authority is restricted to the substantial questions of law that were framed and heard. Any modification beyond the framed questions of law or without a specific prayer from the appellant could be considered as exceeding the High Court’s jurisdiction. Should you require any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "In the case in Poyil Salim v Thazhe Kandoth Mariyam (2024:KER:4912In addressing the admission and maintenance of a Second Appeal, the Court emphasized the necessity of formulating substantial questions of law, as mandated by Order XLII Rule 2 in conjunction with Section 100 of the CPC. However, in this case, the Appellants failed to raise any substantial question of law warranting the admission of the Second Appeal. The Court emphasized that the existence of a substantial question of law is a prerequisite for entertaining a second appeal.Section 100 of the CPC reads as under:“100. Second appeal.—(1) Save as otherwise expressly provided in the body of this Code or by any other law for the time being in force, an appeal shall lie to the High Court from every decree passed in appeal by any Court subordinate to the High Court, if the High Court is satisfied that the case involve a substantial question of law.(2) An appeal may lie under this section from an appellate decree passed ex-parte.(3) In an appeal under this section, the memorandum of appeal shall precisely state the substantial question of law involved in the appeal.(4) Where the High Court is satisfied that a substantial question of law is involved in any case, it shall formulate that question.(5) The appeal shall be heard on the question so formulated and the respondent shall, at the hearing of the appeal, be allowed to argue that the case does not involve such question:Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall be deemed to take away or abridge the power of the Court to hear, for reasons to be recorded, the appeal on any other substantial question of law, not formulated by it, if it is satisfied that the case involves such question.”Rules 1 to 3 of Order XLII of the CPC provide for procedure for deciding a second appealAn appeal is judicial examination by a higher court of a decision of a subordinate court to rectify any possible error(s) in the order under appeal. The law provides the remedy of an appeal because of the recognition that those manning the judicial tiers too commit errors.In Shankar Ramchandra Abhyankar v. Krishnaji Dattatreya Bapat1, it was held thus:“5.……In the well known work of Story on Constitution (of United States), Vol. 2, Article 1761, it is stated that the essential criterion of appellate jurisdiction is that it revises and corrects the proceedings in a cause already instituted and does not create that cause. The appellate jurisdiction may be exercised in a variety of forms and, indeed, in any form in which the Legislature may choose to prescribe. According to Article 1762 the most usual modes of exercising appellate jurisdiction, at least those which are most known in the United States, are by awrit of error, or by an appeal, or by some process of removal of a suit from an inferior tribunal. An appeal is a process of civil law origin and removes a cause, entirely subjecting the fact as well as the law, to a review and a retrial.Order XLII of the CPC provides for the procedure to be followed while deciding appeals from the appellate decrees. It states that the Rules of Order XLI shall apply, so far as may be, to the appeals from appellate decrees.Words such as “so far as may be” or “insofar as” mean ‘as much’ or ‘to the extent’ or ‘to such extent’. By virtue of Order XLII Rule 1, the provisions of Order XLI are applicable to second appeal as well, though not in their entirety, but to certain extent.If, however, the High Court is satisfied after hearing the appellant at the time of admission that the appeal does not involve any substantial question of law, then such appeal is liable to be dismissed in limine without any notice to the respondents after recording a finding in the dismissal order that the appeal does not involve any substantial question of law within the meaning of sub-section . It is needless to say that for passing such order in limine, the High Court is required to assign the reasons in support of its conclusion.”T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Expedite divorce case",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You have already filed an application under Section 21B of theHindu Marriage Act, which is the right step. Even though you are skeptical about approaching the High Court due to the backlog of cases, a writ petition under Article 227 of theConstitution of Indiacan be filed. A writ petition can be filed for the issuance of a writ of mandamus to direct the lower court to expedite the proceedings. Given your circumstances and the undue delay caused by the respondent, the High Court may take a sympathetic view and direct the lower court to expedite the case. Another choice you have is to file an affidavit in the trial court detailing the hardship caused by the delay, including your age, the health condition of your parents, and the undue financial burden due to the interim maintenance. This can sometimes persuade the judge to take more immediate action to expedite the proceedings. If there has been an order for speedy disposal and it is not being adhered to, you might consider filing a contempt petition. This step can be taken to enforce compliance with the court's order for expeditious disposal of the case. In exceptional cases where the judge is seen as biased or overly lenient towards the respondent, you can apply for a transfer of the case to another court. However, this is a rare remedy and is generally allowed under very compelling circumstances. It is advisable to consult with your advocate before taking any of these aforementioned steps.

    "question": "Can we buy 3rd floor 6 years flat without occupancy certificate",
    "answer": "Dear Client,An occupancy certificate is a crucial document that certifies a building's compliance with building codes and safety norms. It is issued by the local municipal authority. Without an OC, the building is technically considered unauthorized, and there can be significant legal and safety implications. The Building Regularization Scheme (BRS) allows for the regularization of unauthorized constructions by paying certain charges. However, as you mentioned, the BRS matter is pending in the Telangana High Court. This means the legality of the 5th floor and any construction regularized under BRS is uncertain until the court gives a verdict. Buying a flat without an OC means you have limited legal protection if the municipality decides to take action against the unauthorized construction. Also future resale of  the property may be difficult, as potential buyers might face the same issues with financing and legal compliance. Proceeding with the purchase without an OC is generally not advisable, especially when reputable institutions like HDFC Bank are refusing loans due to these issues. Consider waiting until there is a clear legal resolution regarding the BRS matter in the High Court or Look for properties that have the necessary legal clearances, including an occupancy certificate.

One of the simplest ways to transfer ownership is through a gift deed. You and your father can execute a gift deed in favor of your wife, transferring your respective shares in the apartment to her. Another option is to sell the property to your wife by executing a sale deed in her favour, even if it's for a nominal amount. If the apartment is considered joint family property, you and your father can execute a relinquishment deed to relinquish your respective shares in favor of your wife. You and your father can also prepare a will bequeathing your respective shares in the apartment to your wife. This will take effect after your demise and your father's demise.

In Maharashtra the stamp duty for a gift deed of immovable property gifted to a family member is typically between 2% - 6% subject to worth of the property. The registration fee is also a percentage of the property value. In Maharashtra, the registration fee for a gift deed is usually around 1% of the property value, subject to a maximum cap. Once the gift deed is executed, the ownership of the property will transfer to your wife. Consequently, she will have the right to execute rental agreements.

As the owner of the property, you have the right to enjoy and use your property as you see fit, as long as it does not infringe on the rights of others.

    "question": "Jurisdictional limits of High courts in Regular Second appeal for Civil Suit by Section 100 order xLII Rule1",
    "answer": "The jurisdiction of the High Court to entertain a SecondAppeal is well-known. It is a unique jurisdiction of the High Courtwhere the High Court can entertain a Regular Second Appeal purelyon a “substantial” question of law not even a question of law or aquestion of fact. It is a settled law that the first appellatecourt is the final Court insofar as the question of facts areconcerned and it is only when substantial questions of law wouldarise in a case that the High Court can entertain a Regular SecondAppeal and if at the stage of admission such substantial questionsof law are discerned by the High Court the same would have to beframed and the appeal(s) would have to be admitted. It is onlythereafter that the parties have to be heard on the substantialquestions of law that are framed by the High Court at the stage ofadmission.2) However, the CPC gives power to the High Court to frameadditional substantial questions of law or to mould the substantialquestions of law already framed on hearing the parties at the timeof final hearing of a Second Appeal. In the event the respondentsbefore the High Court are on record even at the stage of admissionof a Regular Second Appeal and the same is to be disposed offinally even at this stage substantial questions of law must beframed and answered before the Regular Second Appeal is admittedand disposed.3)If no substantial question of law arose in the case then the appealcould not have been entertained and ought to have been dismissed atthe stage of admission4) HC  would modify judgment without specific prayer from Appellant5) SC IN State Bank of India vs. S.N. Goyal (2008) 8 SCC 9215:has held“15. It is a matter of concern that the scope of second appeals and as also the procedural aspects of second appealsare often ignored by the High Courts. Some of the oft-repeated errors are:(a) Admitting a second appeal when it does not give rise to asubstantial question of law.(b) Admitting second appeals without formulating substantialquestion of law.8(c) Admitting second appeals by formulating a standard ormechanical question such as “whether on the facts and circumstances the judgment of the first appellate court calls for interference” as the substantial question of law.(d) Failing to consider and formulate relevant and appropriate substantial question(s) of law involved in the second appeal.(e) Rejecting second appeals on the ground that the case doesnot involve any substantial question of law, when the case infact involves substantial questions of law.(f) Reformulating the substantial question of law after theconclusion of the hearing, while preparing the judgment,thereby denying an opportunity to the parties to make  submissions on the reformulated substantial question of law.(g) Deciding second appeals by reappreciating evidence andinterfering with findings of fact, ignoring the questions oflaw.These lapses or technical errors lead to injustice and alsogive rise to avoidable further appeals to this Court and remands by this Court, thereby prolonging the period of litigation. Care should be taken to ensure that the cases not involving substantial questions of law are not entertained, and at the same time ensure that cases involving substantialquestions of law are not rejected as not involving substantial questions of law.”Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98557 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "question": "Jurisdictional limits of High courts in Regular Second appeal for Civil Suit by Section 100 order xLII Rule1",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The High Court can entertain a second appeal if it involves a \"substantial question of law.\"The substantial question of law has to be explicitly stated in the memorandum of appeal. The appeal will only be heard on the basis of these substantial questions of law. The High Court must frame the substantial question of law at the time of admission of the appeal. Both appellants and respondents are given an opportunity to be heard on these questions. If the High Court answers the substantial question of law in favour of the respondent, it typically dismisses the appeal. If the High Court finds the question in favour of the appellant, it may set aside the lower court’s decision and may remand the case back for further proceedings or directly pass the final order. The High Court, under its appellate jurisdiction, can modify the judgment of the lower courts. However, it must stay within the boundaries of the questions of law framed and heard. The High Court is not expected to go beyond the formulated questions of law and make decisions on matters that were not part of the original appeal. Order XLVII Rule 1 CPC deals with the review of judgments, but it's generally not used to modify an appellate decree unless there is a clerical or arithmetical mistake or there is a discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence, was not within the knowledge of the party seeking the review. The High Court does have the authority to modify or vary an appellate court’s judgment, but this authority is restricted to the substantial questions of law that were framed and heard. Any modification beyond the framed questions of law or without a specific prayer from the appellant could be considered as exceeding the High Court’s jurisdiction. Should you require any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "In the case in Poyil Salim v Thazhe Kandoth Mariyam (2024:KER:4912In addressing the admission and maintenance of a Second Appeal, the Court emphasized the necessity of formulating substantial questions of law, as mandated by Order XLII Rule 2 in conjunction with Section 100 of the CPC. However, in this case, the Appellants failed to raise any substantial question of law warranting the admission of the Second Appeal. The Court emphasized that the existence of a substantial question of law is a prerequisite for entertaining a second appeal.Section 100 of the CPC reads as under:“100. Second appeal.—(1) Save as otherwise expressly provided in the body of this Code or by any other law for the time being in force, an appeal shall lie to the High Court from every decree passed in appeal by any Court subordinate to the High Court, if the High Court is satisfied that the case involve a substantial question of law.(2) An appeal may lie under this section from an appellate decree passed ex-parte.(3) In an appeal under this section, the memorandum of appeal shall precisely state the substantial question of law involved in the appeal.(4) Where the High Court is satisfied that a substantial question of law is involved in any case, it shall formulate that question.(5) The appeal shall be heard on the question so formulated and the respondent shall, at the hearing of the appeal, be allowed to argue that the case does not involve such question:Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall be deemed to take away or abridge the power of the Court to hear, for reasons to be recorded, the appeal on any other substantial question of law, not formulated by it, if it is satisfied that the case involves such question.”Rules 1 to 3 of Order XLII of the CPC provide for procedure for deciding a second appealAn appeal is judicial examination by a higher court of a decision of a subordinate court to rectify any possible error(s) in the order under appeal. The law provides the remedy of an appeal because of the recognition that those manning the judicial tiers too commit errors.In Shankar Ramchandra Abhyankar v. Krishnaji Dattatreya Bapat1, it was held thus:“5.……In the well known work of Story on Constitution (of United States), Vol. 2, Article 1761, it is stated that the essential criterion of appellate jurisdiction is that it revises and corrects the proceedings in a cause already instituted and does not create that cause. The appellate jurisdiction may be exercised in a variety of forms and, indeed, in any form in which the Legislature may choose to prescribe. According to Article 1762 the most usual modes of exercising appellate jurisdiction, at least those which are most known in the United States, are by awrit of error, or by an appeal, or by some process of removal of a suit from an inferior tribunal. An appeal is a process of civil law origin and removes a cause, entirely subjecting the fact as well as the law, to a review and a retrial.Order XLII of the CPC provides for the procedure to be followed while deciding appeals from the appellate decrees. It states that the Rules of Order XLI shall apply, so far as may be, to the appeals from appellate decrees.Words such as “so far as may be” or “insofar as” mean ‘as much’ or ‘to the extent’ or ‘to such extent’. By virtue of Order XLII Rule 1, the provisions of Order XLI are applicable to second appeal as well, though not in their entirety, but to certain extent.If, however, the High Court is satisfied after hearing the appellant at the time of admission that the appeal does not involve any substantial question of law, then such appeal is liable to be dismissed in limine without any notice to the respondents after recording a finding in the dismissal order that the appeal does not involve any substantial question of law within the meaning of sub-section . It is needless to say that for passing such order in limine, the High Court is required to assign the reasons in support of its conclusion.”T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

One of the simplest ways to transfer ownership is through a gift deed. You and your father can execute a gift deed in favor of your wife, transferring your respective shares in the apartment to her. Another option is to sell the property to your wife by executing a sale deed in her favour, even if it's for a nominal amount. If the apartment is considered joint family property, you and your father can execute a relinquishment deed to relinquish your respective shares in favor of your wife. You and your father can also prepare a will bequeathing your respective shares in the apartment to your wife. This will take effect after your demise and your father's demise. All of these aforementioned options require drafting, payment of stamp duty and registration at the sub- registrar’s office. Engaging a lawyer can help you navigate through the process.

    "answer": "Dear Client,As foreign citizens with OCI, you and your wife can execute a gift deed. The stamp duty on a gift deed varies from state to state. In Maharashtra the stamp duty for a gift deed of immovable property gifted to a family member is typically between 2% - 6% subject to worth of the property. The registration fee is also a percentage of the property value. In Maharashtra, the registration fee for a gift deed is usually around 1% of the property value, subject to a maximum cap. Once the gift deed is executed, the ownership of the property will transfer to your wife. Consequently, she will have the right to execute rental agreements. Since you and your wife are not in India, you can use a Power of Attorney (PoA) to allow your father to manage the property, including executing rental agreements.

One of the simplest ways to transfer ownership is through a gift deed. You and your father can execute a gift deed in favor of your wife, transferring your respective shares in the apartment to her. Another option is to sell the property to your wife by executing a sale deed in her favour, even if it's for a nominal amount. If the apartment is considered joint family property, you and your father can execute a relinquishment deed to relinquish your respective shares in favor of your wife. You and your father can also prepare a will bequeathing your respective shares in the apartment to your wife. This will take effect after your demise and your father's demise. All of these aforementioned options require drafting, payment of stamp duty and registration at the sub- registrar’s office. Engaging a lawyer can help you navigate through the process.

    "question": "I have already bought a house from a society which has got the layout with govt",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Unless the stay order clearly names specific plots or dwellings, your home may not be immediately affected if it is limited to the survey number. That being said, there may be unintended consequences for future ownership clarity and real estate transactions if the entire survey number is placed under hold. The government's seizure of land and its subsequent distribution to society are made more legitimate by a recent High Court decision that upholds the land acquisition procedure and the landowner's compensation. The High Court's ruling is upheld unless the landowner takes legal action, which could result in more legal scrutiny. An indemnity clause in the selling deed can shield you from lawsuits from other parties. This gives you some legal protection by committing the seller to pay for any loss or harm brought on by third parties. Even though the indemnity clause provides protection, it is wise to hold off until the stay order is resolved, particularly if the dispute goes all the way to the Supreme Court. By doing this, you can be sure that you won't run into any financial or legal problems. Getting a copy of the RSA24/2020 stay order is essential, as you correctly pointed out. The purpose and extent of the stay will become clearer as a result. Keep in constant contact with a property attorney to stay informed about the case's progress and legal status. Should you require any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "I have already bought a house from a society which has got the layout with govt",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Unless the stay order clearly names specific plots or dwellings, your home may not be immediately affected if it is limited to the survey number. That being said, there may be unintended consequences for future ownership clarity and real estate transactions if the entire survey number is placed under hold. The government's seizure of land and its subsequent distribution to society are made more legitimate by a recent High Court decision that upholds the land acquisition procedure and the landowner's compensation. The High Court's ruling is upheld unless the landowner takes legal action, which could result in more legal scrutiny. An indemnity clause in the selling deed can shield you from lawsuits from other parties. This gives you some legal protection by committing the seller to pay for any loss or harm brought on by third parties. Even though the indemnity clause provides protection, it is wise to hold off until the stay order is resolved, particularly if the dispute goes all the way to the Supreme Court. By doing this, you can be sure that you won't run into any financial or legal problems. Getting a copy of the RSA24/2020 stay order is essential, as you correctly pointed out. The purpose and extent of the stay will become clearer as a result. Keep in constant contact with a property attorney to stay informed about the case's progress and legal status. Should you require any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Sometimes, RTC entries provide hints about the issuing authority. Look for any additional information that may indicate whether it is from a District Court or High Court.

There is no legal restriction that prevents you from purchasing property while being a pagdi tenant. You can take a housing loan to buy another property. The bank will evaluate your financial capacity to repay the loan, but this has no bearing on your existing tenancy rights under the pagdi system. Owning another property in the same city does not directly lead to losing your pagdi tenancy. However, it is crucial to comply with all terms of your tenancy agreement and ensure you do not violate any conditions that might lead to eviction, such as misuse of the property.

However, given the current situation and apparent bias, filing an application to request enforcement and disciplinary action can help document your efforts and compel the authorities to act.Given that you are representing yourself, Document copies of the High Court orders granting your share and directing the removal of illegal possession. Document all complaints filed with the Tehsildar, SDM, and police. Include dates and responses. Include any RTI responses that indicate a lack of action or bias by the authorities. Emphasize on the point that the sale was made during the pendency of the partition suit, which renders it void under Section 52 of theTransfer of Property Act, 1882. The cases of Jayaram Mudaliar v. Ayyaswami and Ors., AIR 1973 SC 569 and Hardev Singh v.

    "answer": "Dear Client,As a pagdi tenant, you have the right to own property, including buying another property in the same city. There is no legal restriction that prevents you from purchasing property while being a pagdi tenant. You can take a housing loan to buy another property. The bank will evaluate your financial capacity to repay the loan, but this has no bearing on your existing tenancy rights under the pagdi system. Owning another property in the same city does not directly lead to losing your pagdi tenancy. However, it is crucial to comply with all terms of your tenancy agreement and ensure you do not violate any conditions that might lead to eviction, such as misuse of the property.

If the Tehsildar is not taking action, you have several options, which includes, filing a contempt petition against the Tehsildar, filing an Right To Information (RTI) application and approaching higher authorities if required.Generally, once a partition decree is passed by the High Court, it is binding on all parties. However, third parties may challenge it under specific circumstances, such as, if the third party's legal rights are directly affected by the partition decree, they may have grounds to challenge it.If you have already won the case under Section 250 of the Madhya Pradesh Land Revenue Code (MPLRC), 1959, but face repeated threats and legal hurdles, consider complaining to the police .

However, given the current situation and apparent bias, filing an application to request enforcement and disciplinary action can help document your efforts and compel the authorities to act.Given that you are representing yourself, Document copies of the High Court orders granting your share and directing the removal of illegal possession.

Emphasize on the point that the sale was made during the pendency of the partition suit, which renders it void under Section 52 of theTransfer of Property Act, 1882. The cases of Jayaram Mudaliar v.

Given such evidence, the landlord stands a strong chance of succeeding in the eviction case. If the landlord is proceeding with redevelopment with a 60% majority consent from other tenants, this specific eviction case should not significantly hinder the process.

    "answer": "Dear Client,The best way to get access to your well is through injunction. An injunction can prevent your neighbour from interfering with your access to water. Under Specific Relief Act, 1963, you can seek a permanent or temporary injunction to restrain your neighbour from obstructing your access to water. You can file an application for an expedited trial under Section 21 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC), 1908, which allows for the expeditious disposal of cases involving urgent matters. If you believe the police acted unfairly or abused their power, you can file a complaint with the Madhya Pradesh Human Rights Commission.  Another alternative you have is Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), under which you can either opt for mediation or arbitration or You can also approach the Lok Adalat, which is an alternative dispute resolution forum in India. Lok Adalat can settle disputes amicably and faster than regular courts. Gather all relevant documents, including the written agreement you were forced to sign, and any communication or notices related to the case. Seek legal advice from a local lawyer who specializes in civil disputes and property rights. They can guide you on the specific legal steps to take in your jurisdiction. Should you require any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,If you sign a written declaration agreeing to give your child a share of any property that might be transferred to you in the future, this could become a binding legal obligation. This might include any property inherited from your father or acquired by you later. Your wife could potentially use this declaration in the future to claim a share of the property for your child, even if your financial situation changes or if you have other children later. This declaration might also limit your ability to freely transfer or sell property without fulfilling the obligation first. Under Hindu law, your father’s property will only become your self-acquired property after it is legally transferred to you. Until then, you have no legal ownership, and any declaration made now might be challenged for being premature or speculative.Explain to your wife that it is legally premature to make a declaration about property you do not currently own. Offer alternative arrangements, such as setting up a fixed deposit or a trust in your child’s name, which can provide financial security without committing to a future property share. You might also propose to include a clause stating that any future property distribution will be done according to mutual agreement, allowing flexibility. Politely but firmly refuse to sign any declaration that might bind you to future property distribution.

    "question": "Gratuity in case of change of contract",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Under the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, an employee is entitled to gratuity after completing five years of continuous service with an organization. As per the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, continuous service includes periods where the employee is on approved leave. The Act considers such periods as part of continuous service. Based on this, your total period of continuous service can be considered from 2011 to June 2024, despite the sabbatical. The change in your status from a salaried employee to a consultant does not affect your entitlement to gratuity for the period you were a salaried employee. Gratuity is calculated based on your service as an employee, not as a consultant. You need to formally request your gratuity from your employer. This can be done by submitting an application in writing to the company. You can apply for gratuity immediately upon the change of your contract, or you can choose to apply later when you decide to part ways with the company. There is no restriction on the timing of your application as long as it is within a reasonable period after leaving employment. Consider consulting with a labour law attorney if your employer is unresponsive or disputes your claim.

That means if an employee works in the establishment for more than 6 months in a year, he shall be eligible to get gratuity , if the employee has had continuous service of 190 / 240 days.- Since, you have completed 5 years there , hence you are entitled to get gratuity, and company cannot refuse to continue the same even your position is going to be changed.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

This might include any property inherited from your father or acquired by you later. Your wife could potentially use this declaration in the future to claim a share of the property for your child, even if your financial situation changes or if you have other children later. This declaration might also limit your ability to freely transfer or sell property without fulfilling the obligation first. Under Hindu law, your father’s property will only become your self-acquired property after it is legally transferred to you. Until then, you have no legal ownership, and any declaration made now might be challenged for being premature or speculative.Explain to your wife that it is legally premature to make a declaration about property you do not currently own. Offer alternative arrangements, such as setting up a fixed deposit or a trust in your child’s name, which can provide financial security without committing to a future property share. You might also propose to include a clause stating that any future property distribution will be done according to mutual agreement, allowing flexibility.

    "question": "Gratuity in case of change of contract",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Under the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, an employee is entitled to gratuity after completing five years of continuous service with an organization. As per the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, continuous service includes periods where the employee is on approved leave. The Act considers such periods as part of continuous service. Based on this, your total period of continuous service can be considered from 2011 to June 2024, despite the sabbatical. The change in your status from a salaried employee to a consultant does not affect your entitlement to gratuity for the period you were a salaried employee. Gratuity is calculated based on your service as an employee, not as a consultant. You need to formally request your gratuity from your employer. This can be done by submitting an application in writing to the company. You can apply for gratuity immediately upon the change of your contract, or you can choose to apply later when you decide to part ways with the company. There is no restriction on the timing of your application as long as it is within a reasonable period after leaving employment. Consider consulting with a labour law attorney if your employer is unresponsive or disputes your claim.

    "answer": "The Pagdi system is a unique form of tenancy prevalent in Mumbai and other parts of Maharashtra. Under this system, tenants pay a lump sum amount to the landlord, known as the pagdi, and then pay a nominal rent for the property.The landlord can evict the tenants.They can only do so for specific reasons allowed under the law.The following are some of the reasons for which a landlord can evict a tenant in the Pagdi system: Non-payment of rent by the tenant:If the tenant fails to pay the rent on time, the landlord can initiate eviction proceedings against them.However, the redevelopment process in the Pagdi system can be complicated, with issues related to ownership, tenancy rights, and compensation.The Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999, lays down the procedures for redevelopment in the Pagdi system.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "What if Pagadi building planning to redevelopement but Eviction cases pending In small causes court?",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the case of a Pagadi building where an eviction suit is pending due to the tenant not residing in the property for the last 20 years, with electricity and water disconnected for 12 years, and no rent paid or attempts to send rent, the tenant is unlikely to benefit from the redevelopment. Given such evidence, the landlord stands a strong chance of succeeding in the eviction case. If the landlord is proceeding with redevelopment with a 60% majority consent from other tenants, this specific eviction case should not significantly hinder the process. However, to avoid potential legal complications, it is advisable for the landlord to resolve the pending eviction suit before proceeding with the redevelopment.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The best way to get access to your well is through injunction. An injunction can prevent your neighbour from interfering with your access to water. Under Specific Relief Act, 1963, you can seek a permanent or temporary injunction to restrain your neighbour from obstructing your access to water. You can file an application for an expedited trial under Section 21 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC), 1908, which allows for the expeditious disposal of cases involving urgent matters. If you believe the police acted unfairly or abused their power, you can file a complaint with the Madhya Pradesh Human Rights Commission.  Another alternative you have is Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), under which you can either opt for mediation or arbitration or You can also approach the Lok Adalat, which is an alternative dispute resolution forum in India. Lok Adalat can settle disputes amicably and faster than regular courts. Gather all relevant documents, including the written agreement you were forced to sign, and any communication or notices related to the case. Seek legal advice from a local lawyer who specializes in civil disputes and property rights.

    "answer": "Dear Client,After the completion of the talaq procedure, you need to file a suit in the Family Court for a divorce decree. Since you are an NRI, your advocate can file the suit on your behalf with a power of attorney. Your wife may contest the divorce in court but if the court is satisfied that the talaq was pronounced in compliance with the law, it will grant a divorce decree. Given your situation and the threats you are receiving, it is advisable to handle the legal proceedings through your advocate to avoid any confrontations or adverse consequences. Even if you have been separated for more than 10 years, your wife may be eligible for maintenance under Section 125 of theCode of Criminal Procedure(CrPC), provided she is unable to maintain herself. You sending monthly expenses, shows that you have been providing financial support.

As a Muslim man, you are permitted to have up to four wives at the same time, provided you can treat them equally. Therefore, your second marriage is not considered bigamy under Muslim personal law. Hence, it is advisable to Engage a competent lawyer to represent you in court.

    "question": "Gratuity in case of change of contract",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Under the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, an employee is entitled to gratuity after completing five years of continuous service with an organization. As per the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, continuous service includes periods where the employee is on approved leave. The Act considers such periods as part of continuous service. Based on this, your total period of continuous service can be considered from 2011 to June 2024, despite the sabbatical. The change in your status from a salaried employee to a consultant does not affect your entitlement to gratuity for the period you were a salaried employee. Gratuity is calculated based on your service as an employee, not as a consultant. You need to formally request your gratuity from your employer. This can be done by submitting an application in writing to the company. You can apply for gratuity immediately upon the change of your contract, or you can choose to apply later when you decide to part ways with the company. There is no restriction on the timing of your application as long as it is within a reasonable period after leaving employment. Consider consulting with a labour law attorney if your employer is unresponsive or disputes your claim.

    "question": "Agriculture water well dispute",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The best way to get access to your well is through injunction. An injunction can prevent your neighbour from interfering with your access to water. Under Specific Relief Act, 1963, you can seek a permanent or temporary injunction to restrain your neighbour from obstructing your access to water. You can file an application for an expedited trial under Section 21 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC), 1908, which allows for the expeditious disposal of cases involving urgent matters. If you believe the police acted unfairly or abused their power, you can file a complaint with the Madhya Pradesh Human Rights Commission.  Another alternative you have is Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), under which you can either opt for mediation or arbitration or You can also approach the Lok Adalat, which is an alternative dispute resolution forum in India. Lok Adalat can settle disputes amicably and faster than regular courts.

    "question": "Gratuity in case of change of contract",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Under the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, an employee is entitled to gratuity after completing five years of continuous service with an organization. As per the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, continuous service includes periods where the employee is on approved leave. The Act considers such periods as part of continuous service. Based on this, your total period of continuous service can be considered from 2011 to June 2024, despite the sabbatical. The change in your status from a salaried employee to a consultant does not affect your entitlement to gratuity for the period you were a salaried employee. Gratuity is calculated based on your service as an employee, not as a consultant. You need to formally request your gratuity from your employer. This can be done by submitting an application in writing to the company. You can apply for gratuity immediately upon the change of your contract, or you can choose to apply later when you decide to part ways with the company. There is no restriction on the timing of your application as long as it is within a reasonable period after leaving employment. Consider consulting with a labour law attorney if your employer is unresponsive or disputes your claim.
