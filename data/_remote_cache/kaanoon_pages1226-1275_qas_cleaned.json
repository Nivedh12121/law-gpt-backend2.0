    "answer": "Special Marriage Actvs. Indian Christian Marriage Act: Considerations for an Interfaith CoupleHere's a breakdown of theSpecial Marriage Act(SMA) and the Indian Christian Marriage Act (ICMA) to help the couple understand the implications of each:Special Marriage Act(SMA)Benefits:Secular: Doesn't require conversion for either partner.Simple Procedure: Relatively straightforward registration process.Equal Rights: Provides equal property and inheritance rights for both spouses.Drawbacks:Inter-religious Issues: Parents' concerns about cultural heritage and inheritance might persist. While the law protects women's property rights, social pressures regarding ancestral land might remain.Indian Christian Marriage Act (ICMA)Benefits:Religious Sanction: May hold religious significance for the Christian partner and their family.Drawbacks:Conversion Requirement: The non-Christian partner would need to convert to Christianity before marriage.Unequal Inheritance (Possible): In some Christian denominations, inheritance laws might favor male offspring. It's crucial to understand the specific denomination's practices.Rights to Consider:Property and Inheritance: Both SMA and ICMA provide women with inheritance rights. However, local customs and traditions regarding ancestral property, especially in the boy's case, might influence how inheritance is handled in practice. Open communication with both families is essential.Religious Freedom: The SMA safeguards the right to practice one's religion after marriage. ICMA doesn't restrict religious freedom, but social expectations within the Christian family might create pressure to conform to their practices.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": ". Legal Notice for False Advertisement and Website Information:Yes, you can send a legal notice. In India, theConsumer Protection Act, 2019 protects consumers from misleading advertisements and unfair trade practices. A legal notice can be a first step to address the issue.Sections Applicable: The relevant sections of theConsumer Protection Actinclude:Section 2(14): Defines \"unfair trade practice\" which can include false or misleading advertisements.Section 12(1)(d): Prohibits misleading advertisements.Punishment: The Act empowers authorities to impose penalties on companies engaging in unfair trade practices. These can include:Issuing directions to stop the practice.Ordering refunds or compensation to consumers.Imposing penalties.2. Defamation Notice on Social Media (Son Over 18):Yes, the mother can send a legal notice on her son's behalf. In India, a person has the right to defend their reputation. Even though the son is an adult, the mother can act on his behalf with his authorization.Section Applicable: TheIndian Penal Code(IPC) Section 499 defines defamation. A legal notice can reference this section to highlight the offense.3. Legal Notice for Unfulfilled WhatsApp Assurance:Potentially, a legal notice can be sent. The enforceability of a WhatsApp assurance depends on the content and context.Section Applicable: The Indian Contract Act, 1872 lays the foundation for contracts. A well-crafted WhatsApp message might be considered a valid contract, especially if it contains specific details about the agreement. Section 10 of the Act mentions a written contract not required by law to be in any specific form.Important Considerations:Legal Notice is a Pre-litigation Step: A legal notice serves as a formal warning to the company. It doesn't guarantee a resolution but can be a starting point for negotiation or further legal action.Consult a Lawyer: For all these scenarios, consulting a lawyer specializing in consumer protection or contract law is recommended. They can assess the specifics of your situation and advise on the most effective course of action.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "I understand this is a sensitive situation involving the well-being of a young orphan and a financial dispute. Here's some guidance based on Islamic principles and Indian legal aspects:Custody and Guardianship (Hiranat and ولاية Wilaayah):Paternal Preference: Under Islamic law, the paternal uncle (Khal) usually has the preferential right to custody (Hiranat) and guardianship (Wilaayah) of the orphaned child, especially a girl, unless there are compelling reasons to the contrary.Court's Decision: Ultimately, the court will decide guardianship based on the child's best interests. Both sides can present their case regarding their suitability to raise the child.Financial Matters (Mal):Child's Money: The money from the father's LIC policy belongs to the orphaned child. It should be used for her benefit, including education, healthcare, and future needs.Dispute Resolution:Sharia Council: Consider approaching a Sharia Council affiliated with a local mosque for mediation. They can help resolve the financial dispute based on Islamic inheritance principles.Legal Action: If mediation fails, a lawsuit can be filed in the civil court to recover the funds. This can be a lengthy process.Minimal Resistance Path:Negotiation and Agreement: Open communication and a written agreement outlining how the money will be managed for the child's benefit could be a solution. A neutral third party, perhaps a respected member of the community, could mediate the agreement.Joint Account: Consider a joint bank account with representatives from both sides to manage the money for the child's well-being. This can build trust and ensure transparency.Here are some resources that might be helpful:Sharia Councils: Local mosques might have affiliated Sharia councils that offer mediation services.Lawyers: Look for lawyers with expertise in Islamic law and inheritance in West Bengal.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Plot division and inherited property division",
    "answer": "1.  Assuming that the land was originally self acquired by your great grandfather (grandfather's father) and he gave a large piece of land to your grandfather through a registered deed, then in your grandfather's hands, it has to be treated as his seperate property having the characteristics of self acquired property and not his ancestral property. Then the registered Partition Deed dividing the land amongst his sons' is in order.Based on the partition deed, the land acquired by your father is his separate property and during your father's lifetime he will be independent to take any decision regarding this property including gifting or selling or executing WILL in favour of anyone.In case your great grandfather had given a large piece of land to your grandfather without a registered document and the name of your great grandfather still remains intact in the property documents, then the property qualifies to be ancestral property.2.  You and your sister may convince your father to execute registered Gift Deed/Partition Deed/WILL demarcating clearly the boundaries amongst siblings.3.  To stop/prevent construction on your father's owned land, let your father bring Injunction Order as the property is in your father's name, which has to be treated as his self acquired property and your brother, without your father's permission, can't unilaterally construct buildings, including school for poor kids.4.   Regarding the plot in your mother's name bought by your father, it's not clear as to whether your mother is dead or alive. If dead, then whether she died intestate (without executing a WILL) or testate (executed WILL) naming the beneficiaries to her property.5.  Assuming that your mother died intestate, then her property would devolve equally to her husband and children. In the instant case, 1/4th undivided share to your father, 1/4th undivided share to you, 1/4th undivided share to your sister and 1/4th undivided share to your brother.6.   If your brother tries to sell this plot to a prospective buyer, then send a legal notice to him so that the issue could be resolved.Shashidhar S.

    "question": "Plot division and inherited property division",
    "answer": "Here's some guidance on the property division situation:Regarding the Farm Land:Inheritance Rights: Since your grandfather divided the land and your father received a share, you and your siblings most likely have inheritance rights to that portion.Negotiation or Mediation: The ideal scenario would be to have an open and honest conversation with your father and brother about dividing the land fairly. Perhaps a mediator could facilitate a productive discussion to avoid putting stress on your parents.Legal Action: If communication fails, consider consulting a property lawyer specializing in inheritance. They can advise you on the legal options for partition, which might involve filing a lawsuit. However, legal action can be lengthy and expensive, so explore all possibilities before resorting to it.Your Brother's Construction Activities:Consent for Construction: If your brother hasn't obtained your consent for building on the property, it might be considered trespassing. A lawyer can advise on the legality of his actions.Impact on Land Value: Large-scale constructions might affect the land's future value when divided. It's crucial to document these constructions with photographs and receipts.The Plot Nominated to Your Brother:Nominee vs. Owner: Being a nominee on a plot doesn't necessarily grant ownership. Your mother likely remains the legal owner.Selling the Plot: If your father wants to sell and share the proceeds, but keeps delaying due to market fluctuations, it creates a complex situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can I sell 1 of 2 builder floors in a residential property that is co-owned?",
    "answer": "Selling your share of a jointly owned property like this can be tricky, but there are options. Here's a breakdown of the situation and potential solutions:Selling Your Share:Legally Not Possible: In most jurisdictions, you cannot directly sell your share of a residence within a single house. The property is most likely registered as one unit, even though it has separate floors and entrances.Alternative Solutions: Here are some approaches to consider:Negotiate with Your Brother: Explore the possibility of convincing your brother to agree to sell the entire property. Perhaps you can offer him a larger portion of the proceeds to incentivize him.Partition Suit: If negotiation fails, consider filing a partition suit in court. This legal process would compel the sale of the entire property and division of the proceeds based on your ownership share (usually 50/50 in this case). This can be a lengthy and expensive process, so weigh the pros and cons carefully.Rights of a Buyer in Your Scenario:Limited Rights: A buyer purchasing your share would technically own a portion of the entire property, including the house and compound. However, occupying the ground floor exclusively might be challenging due to your brother's residence on the first floor and shared access points (stairs, compound).Potential Issues for the Buyer:Shared Access and Usage: The buyer might face limitations on using certain areas like the compound or shared utilities due to your brother's occupancy.Difficulties with Future Sale: Reselling this kind of ownership structure can be difficult for the buyer as most buyers would prefer a property with sole ownership.Recommendations:Consult a Real Estate Lawyer: An experienced real estate lawyer can advise you on the best course of action based on your specific situation and local laws. They can explain the legal implications of a partition suit and explore other possibilities depending on your location.Mediation: Before resorting to legal action, consider mediation. A neutral third party can facilitate a discussion with your brother to explore solutions that work for both of you.Conclusion:Selling your share in this situation requires careful consideration. While selling the entire property with your brother's agreement is ideal, a partition suit or finding a buyer willing to navigate the complexities of shared ownership are other possibilities.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

While the law protects women's property rights, social pressures regarding ancestral land might remain.Indian Christian Marriage Act (ICMA)Benefits:Religious Sanction: May hold religious significance for the Christian partner and their family.Drawbacks:Conversion Requirement: The non-Christian partner would need to convert to Christianity before marriage.Unequal Inheritance (Possible): In some Christian denominations, inheritance laws might favor male offspring. It's crucial to understand the specific denomination's practices.Rights to Consider:Property and Inheritance: Both SMA and ICMA provide women with inheritance rights. However, local customs and traditions regarding ancestral property, especially in the boy's case, might influence how inheritance is handled in practice. Open communication with both families is essential.Religious Freedom: The SMA safeguards the right to practice one's religion after marriage.

    "answer": "I understand this is a sensitive situation involving the well-being of a young orphan and a financial dispute. Here's some guidance based on Islamic principles and Indian legal aspects:Custody and Guardianship (Hiranat and ولاية Wilaayah):Paternal Preference: Under Islamic law, the paternal uncle (Khal) usually has the preferential right to custody (Hiranat) and guardianship (Wilaayah) of the orphaned child, especially a girl, unless there are compelling reasons to the contrary.Court's Decision: Ultimately, the court will decide guardianship based on the child's best interests. Both sides can present their case regarding their suitability to raise the child.Financial Matters (Mal):Child's Money: The money from the father's LIC policy belongs to the orphaned child. It should be used for her benefit, including education, healthcare, and future needs.Dispute Resolution:Sharia Council: Consider approaching a Sharia Council affiliated with a local mosque for mediation. They can help resolve the financial dispute based on Islamic inheritance principles.Legal Action: If mediation fails, a lawsuit can be filed in the civil court to recover the funds. This can be a lengthy process.Minimal Resistance Path:Negotiation and Agreement: Open communication and a written agreement outlining how the money will be managed for the child's benefit could be a solution. A neutral third party, perhaps a respected member of the community, could mediate the agreement.Joint Account: Consider a joint bank account with representatives from both sides to manage the money for the child's well-being. This can build trust and ensure transparency.Here are some resources that might be helpful:Sharia Councils: Local mosques might have affiliated Sharia councils that offer mediation services.Lawyers: Look for lawyers with expertise in Islamic law and inheritance in West Bengal.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can I sell 1 of 2 builder floors in a residential property that is co-owned?",
    "answer": "Selling your share of a jointly owned property like this can be tricky, but there are options. Here's a breakdown of the situation and potential solutions:Selling Your Share:Legally Not Possible: In most jurisdictions, you cannot directly sell your share of a residence within a single house. The property is most likely registered as one unit, even though it has separate floors and entrances.Alternative Solutions: Here are some approaches to consider:Negotiate with Your Brother: Explore the possibility of convincing your brother to agree to sell the entire property. Perhaps you can offer him a larger portion of the proceeds to incentivize him.Partition Suit: If negotiation fails, consider filing a partition suit in court. This legal process would compel the sale of the entire property and division of the proceeds based on your ownership share (usually 50/50 in this case). This can be a lengthy and expensive process, so weigh the pros and cons carefully.Rights of a Buyer in Your Scenario:Limited Rights: A buyer purchasing your share would technically own a portion of the entire property, including the house and compound. However, occupying the ground floor exclusively might be challenging due to your brother's residence on the first floor and shared access points (stairs, compound).Potential Issues for the Buyer:Shared Access and Usage: The buyer might face limitations on using certain areas like the compound or shared utilities due to your brother's occupancy.Difficulties with Future Sale: Reselling this kind of ownership structure can be difficult for the buyer as most buyers would prefer a property with sole ownership.Recommendations:Consult a Real Estate Lawyer: An experienced real estate lawyer can advise you on the best course of action based on your specific situation and local laws. They can explain the legal implications of a partition suit and explore other possibilities depending on your location.Mediation: Before resorting to legal action, consider mediation. A neutral third party can facilitate a discussion with your brother to explore solutions that work for both of you.Conclusion:Selling your share in this situation requires careful consideration. While selling the entire property with your brother's agreement is ideal, a partition suit or finding a buyer willing to navigate the complexities of shared ownership are other possibilities.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Is it legal to demand compensation for out of court settlement",
    "answer": "Yes, it is legal to demand compensation for an out-of-court settlement in India. This is a common practice in resolving disputes outside of the court system.Here's a breakdown of the legal aspects:Contractual Freedom:The Indian Contract Act allows parties involved in a dispute to enter into a settlement agreement. This agreement can involve one party offering compensation to the other in exchange for resolving the dispute and avoiding litigation.Mutual Agreement:The key element is that the compensation amount must be agreed upon by both parties willingly. There should be no coercion or undue influence.Settlement Documentation:It's advisable to have a lawyer draft a formal settlement agreement outlining the terms of the settlement, including the compensation amount and how it will be paid. This document serves as legal proof of the agreement.Benefits of Out-of-Court Settlements:Faster Resolution:Settling disputes outside of court can be significantly faster and less expensive compared to a full-blown lawsuit.Confidentiality:The terms of the settlement can be kept confidential, unlike court proceedings which are generally public.Control Over Outcome:Both parties have more control over the resolution compared to an uncertain court verdict.Seeking Legal Advice:While demanding compensation for an out-of-court settlement is legal, it's always recommended to consult a lawyer specializing in the specific area of your dispute (contract disputes, property disputes etc.). They can advise on:Reasonable Compensation:What constitutes a fair compensation amount in your situation.Settlement Agreement:Drafting a watertight settlement agreement that protects your interests.Negotiation Strategy:Negotiating effectively to reach a favorable agreement."

    "question": "Is it legal to demand compensation for out of court settlement",
    "answer": "Yes, it is legal to demand compensation for an out-of-court settlement in India. This is a common practice in resolving disputes outside of the court system.Here's a breakdown of the legal aspects:Contractual Freedom:The Indian Contract Act allows parties involved in a dispute to enter into a settlement agreement. This agreement can involve one party offering compensation to the other in exchange for resolving the dispute and avoiding litigation.Mutual Agreement:The key element is that the compensation amount must be agreed upon by both parties willingly. There should be no coercion or undue influence.Settlement Documentation:It's advisable to have a lawyer draft a formal settlement agreement outlining the terms of the settlement, including the compensation amount and how it will be paid. This document serves as legal proof of the agreement.Benefits of Out-of-Court Settlements:Faster Resolution:Settling disputes outside of court can be significantly faster and less expensive compared to a full-blown lawsuit.Confidentiality:The terms of the settlement can be kept confidential, unlike court proceedings which are generally public.Control Over Outcome:Both parties have more control over the resolution compared to an uncertain court verdict.Seeking Legal Advice:While demanding compensation for an out-of-court settlement is legal, it's always recommended to consult a lawyer specializing in the specific area of your dispute (contract disputes, property disputes etc.). They can advise on:Reasonable Compensation:What constitutes a fair compensation amount in your situation.Settlement Agreement:Drafting a watertight settlement agreement that protects your interests.Negotiation Strategy:Negotiating effectively to reach a favorable agreement."

    "question": "Is it legal to demand compensation for out of court settlement",
    "answer": "Yes, it is legal to demand compensation for an out-of-court settlement in India. This is a common practice in resolving disputes outside of the court system.Here's a breakdown of the legal aspects:Contractual Freedom:The Indian Contract Act allows parties involved in a dispute to enter into a settlement agreement. This agreement can involve one party offering compensation to the other in exchange for resolving the dispute and avoiding litigation.Mutual Agreement:The key element is that the compensation amount must be agreed upon by both parties willingly. There should be no coercion or undue influence.Settlement Documentation:It's advisable to have a lawyer draft a formal settlement agreement outlining the terms of the settlement, including the compensation amount and how it will be paid. This document serves as legal proof of the agreement.Benefits of Out-of-Court Settlements:Faster Resolution:Settling disputes outside of court can be significantly faster and less expensive compared to a full-blown lawsuit.Confidentiality:The terms of the settlement can be kept confidential, unlike court proceedings which are generally public.Control Over Outcome:Both parties have more control over the resolution compared to an uncertain court verdict.Seeking Legal Advice:While demanding compensation for an out-of-court settlement is legal, it's always recommended to consult a lawyer specializing in the specific area of your dispute (contract disputes, property disputes etc.). They can advise on:Reasonable Compensation:What constitutes a fair compensation amount in your situation.Settlement Agreement:Drafting a watertight settlement agreement that protects your interests.Negotiation Strategy:Negotiating effectively to reach a favorable agreement."

    "question": "Land",
    "answer": "Dear client,I understand this is a stressful situation, and there are steps you can take to try and prevent the unauthorized sale of your ancestral property. Here's what you can do:1. Leverage Power of Attorney (POA):Consider appointing a trustworthy relative or friend in India with a Special Power of Attorney (POA). This grants them specific legal authority to act on your behalf regarding the property. Ensure the POA is limited to actions related to preventing the sale, not broader ownership rights.2. Public Notice and Caveat:Your lawyer can help place a public notice in local newspapers declaring your ownership of the property and stating it's not for sale. This can deter potential buyers and alert authorities.You can also explore filing a caveat with the local registrar's office. This puts a temporary stop on any property registration related to the sale.3. Contact Local Authorities:File a police complaint against the broker and anyone involved in the unauthorized sale attempt. This creates a record of the situation and may prompt them to halt their efforts.Gather all documents proving your ownership of the property, including ancestral property records, inheritance documents, and any communication with the broker.Maintain clear communication with your lawyer and keep them updated on any developments.Remember, this is just general advice, and the specific course of action will depend on the intricacies of your situation. Consulting a qualified lawyer specializing in property law is vital to protecting your ancestral property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "I understand this is a stressful situation. Here's some guidance on property inheritance and dealing with your brother in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, considering your Hindu religion:Inheritance Rights:In a Hindu Undivided Family (HUF), sons (including brothers) and daughters have coparcenary rights in ancestral property (inherited from grandparents or further generations).Since your mother passed away, her share would devolve upon your father and then be distributed as per the will or intestacy laws.Deed of Distribution:If your father has a registered deed dividing the assets, it will supersede intestacy laws and dictate the distribution of property.Selling the House:Selling While Father Alive:With a deed: If the deed allows selling the house, all co-owners (including your brother) must consent to the sale.Without a deed: All coparceners (father, you, and brother) have equal rights, and everyone's consent is required.Selling Part of the House (Floor-wise):This is not common in India but can be achieved through a partition suit in court. However, it's a complex and time-consuming process.Dealing with Brother:Negotiation:Try mediation or involving a respected family member to convince your brother to agree to a sale.Partition Suit:If negotiation fails, consider filing a partition suit in court to divide the property by metes and bounds (dividing the physical property) or selling it and dividing the proceeds.Legal Action Against Brother:Police Help:While police can't evict your brother as a co-owner, they can intervene if his behavior amounts to harassment or threats.Suit for Injunction:You or your father can file a suit for injunction to restrain your brother's disruptive behavior and ensure peaceful co-existence.Recommendations:Consult a lawyer specializing in property inheritance and family disputes in Lucknow. They can review the deed (if any) and advise on the most suitable course of action, including:Enforcing the terms of the deed (if it allows selling the house).Filing a partition suit if selling the entire house isn't feasible.Filing a suit for injunction against your brother's disruptive behavior."

You can inform the court during the next hearing.NOC Requirement:In Tamil Nadu, a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the current lawyer might not be strictly necessary for changing lawyers in a district court case.However, it can smoothen the transition.Hiring Temporary Lawyer:Yes, you can hire another lawyer temporarily to manage the upcoming hearing. This lawyer can then file a substitution of attorney motion with the court to formally take over the case.Resolving the Situation:Here's a possible approach:Send the revised letter to your current lawyer requesting the case documents and informing him about termination.Contact the new lawyer and discuss the situation. They can advise on the best course of action, including potentially negotiating a lower fee with your current lawyer or filing a motion with the court to obtain the case documents.Additional Tips:Keep copies of all communication with your current lawyer.Be prepared to discuss the reasons for changing lawyers with the court if necessary."

    "question": "Ancestral land dispute - Uttar Pradesh",
    "answer": "I'll provide a response regarding the potential land dispute in Gautam Buddha Nagar, Uttar Pradesh, considering your Hindu religion:Inheritance of Ancestral LandIn your scenario, the land is ancestral property if it was inherited by your grandfather from his parents or further generations.Under theHindu Succession Act(1956), upon your grandfather's demise, the land would be classified as coparcenary property.This means your father and uncle (both sons) have equal coparcenary rights.Father's Will or GiftWill:Your grandfather can create a will distributing the land as he wishes. However, he cannot completely disinherit a coparcener (your father) without a valid and justifiable reason. Courts may question such a will.Gift:During his lifetime, your grandfather can gift a portion of the land to your uncle. However, this gift cannot exceed his own share (i.e., half of the land).Taking Legal ActionIf your father feels disadvantaged by the will or gift, he can contest it in court.The court will consider the validity of the will or the reasonableness of the gift.Potential LossesMaximum Loss Through Will: In the worst-case scenario, your grandfather's will might leave a very small portion (e.g., 1%) to your father. However, challenging such a will can be time-consuming and expensive.Maximum Loss Through Gift: Your grandfather can potentially gift up to half of the land to your uncle. However, exceeding his own share and leaving your father with nothing might be deemed unreasonable by the court.RecommendationGiven your desire to minimize conflict and potential legal expenses, consider these options:Negotiation: If the \"minor favor\" to your uncle is manageable, discuss with your father if peaceful co-existence is preferable to a potentially lengthy legal battle.Mediation: Explore involving a neutral third party (mediator) to facilitate communication and find a solution acceptable to all parties.Consulting a LawyerWhile I've provided a general overview, a lawyer specializing in property inheritance in Gautam Buddha Nagar, Uttar Pradesh, can offer more specific guidance based on the details of your situation. They can advise on:The validity of a potential will or the reasonableness of a gift.The likelihood of success in a legal challenge.The potential costs and time involved in litigation.Alternative dispute resolution options like mediation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Your Letter and Questions Regarding Changing LawyersThe content of your letter looks good overall, but here are some suggestions for modifications and additions:Content of the Letter:Add a sentence at the beginning mentioning your intention to terminate the lawyer-client relationship.State the specific date you informed the lawyer about termination (e.g., \"I informed you via phone on [date] of my intention to terminate the lawyer-client relationship\").Mention any attempts to discuss fees with the lawyer (e.g., \"I have attempted to discuss a reasonable fee for your services, but we have not reached an agreement\").Informing the Court:It's not mandatory to inform the court at the same time you send the registered post. You can inform the court during the next hearing.NOC Requirement:In Tamil Nadu, a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the current lawyer might not be strictly necessary for changing lawyers in a district court case.However, it can smoothen the transition.Hiring Temporary Lawyer:Yes, you can hire another lawyer temporarily to manage the upcoming hearing. This lawyer can then file a substitution of attorney motion with the court to formally take over the case.Resolving the Situation:Here's a possible approach:Send the revised letter to your current lawyer requesting the case documents and informing him about termination.Contact the new lawyer and discuss the situation. They can advise on the best course of action, including potentially negotiating a lower fee with your current lawyer or filing a motion with the court to obtain the case documents.Additional Tips:Keep copies of all communication with your current lawyer.Be prepared to discuss the reasons for changing lawyers with the court if necessary."

    "answer": "I understand you're considering registering a flat on the 18th floor of an under-construction building in Mumbai. Here's some information to help you decide, but it's important to understand this isn't legal advice.Registering Flat with Pending Layout Plan:Potential Risk: Registering a flat where the layout plan for your specific floor (18th) is unavailable might be risky.Approval Uncertainties: Without the approved layout plan, there's no guarantee the 18th floor will be built as envisioned, impacting the flat's size, location, or configuration.Key Points to Consider:Developer's Assurance: While the developer might claim sufficient FSI (Floor Space Index) is available, rely only on official approvals, not verbal assurances.Sub-Registrar's Role: The sub-registrar might register the flat despite the missing layout plan, but it doesn't guarantee future approvals or the final configuration of your flat.Recommendations:Delay Registration: Consider waiting until the layout plan for the 18th floor is approved by the authorities. This provides clarity on the flat's specifics before registration.Consult Lawyer: A lawyer specializing in property law can review the agreement and advise on the risks and benefits of registering before the layout plan is finalized. They can also help negotiate terms that protect your interests in case of layout changes.Additional Considerations:Financial Implications: If the layout changes significantly after registration, you might have limited recourse, especially if the final flat size is smaller than what you envisioned.Time Factor: While waiting for the layout plan might delay registration, it could save you from potential issues later.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Ancestral land dispute - Uttar Pradesh",
    "answer": "I'll provide a response regarding the potential land dispute in Gautam Buddha Nagar, Uttar Pradesh, considering your Hindu religion:Inheritance of Ancestral LandIn your scenario, the land is ancestral property if it was inherited by your grandfather from his parents or further generations.Under theHindu Succession Act(1956), upon your grandfather's demise, the land would be classified as coparcenary property.This means your father and uncle (both sons) have equal coparcenary rights.Father's Will or GiftWill:Your grandfather can create a will distributing the land as he wishes. However, he cannot completely disinherit a coparcener (your father) without a valid and justifiable reason. Courts may question such a will.Gift:During his lifetime, your grandfather can gift a portion of the land to your uncle. However, this gift cannot exceed his own share (i.e., half of the land).Taking Legal ActionIf your father feels disadvantaged by the will or gift, he can contest it in court.The court will consider the validity of the will or the reasonableness of the gift.Potential LossesMaximum Loss Through Will: In the worst-case scenario, your grandfather's will might leave a very small portion (e.g., 1%) to your father. However, challenging such a will can be time-consuming and expensive.Maximum Loss Through Gift: Your grandfather can potentially gift up to half of the land to your uncle. However, exceeding his own share and leaving your father with nothing might be deemed unreasonable by the court.RecommendationGiven your desire to minimize conflict and potential legal expenses, consider these options:Negotiation: If the \"minor favor\" to your uncle is manageable, discuss with your father if peaceful co-existence is preferable to a potentially lengthy legal battle.Mediation: Explore involving a neutral third party (mediator) to facilitate communication and find a solution acceptable to all parties.Consulting a LawyerWhile I've provided a general overview, a lawyer specializing in property inheritance in Gautam Buddha Nagar, Uttar Pradesh, can offer more specific guidance based on the details of your situation. They can advise on:The validity of a potential will or the reasonableness of a gift.The likelihood of success in a legal challenge.The potential costs and time involved in litigation.Alternative dispute resolution options like mediation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "I understand this is a stressful situation. Here's some guidance on property inheritance and dealing with your brother in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, considering your Hindu religion:Inheritance Rights:In a Hindu Undivided Family (HUF), sons (including brothers) and daughters have coparcenary rights in ancestral property (inherited from grandparents or further generations).Since your mother passed away, her share would devolve upon your father and then be distributed as per the will or intestacy laws.Deed of Distribution:If your father has a registered deed dividing the assets, it will supersede intestacy laws and dictate the distribution of property.Selling the House:Selling While Father Alive:With a deed: If the deed allows selling the house, all co-owners (including your brother) must consent to the sale.Without a deed: All coparceners (father, you, and brother) have equal rights, and everyone's consent is required.Selling Part of the House (Floor-wise):This is not common in India but can be achieved through a partition suit in court. However, it's a complex and time-consuming process.Dealing with Brother:Negotiation:Try mediation or involving a respected family member to convince your brother to agree to a sale.Partition Suit:If negotiation fails, consider filing a partition suit in court to divide the property by metes and bounds (dividing the physical property) or selling it and dividing the proceeds.Legal Action Against Brother:Police Help:While police can't evict your brother as a co-owner, they can intervene if his behavior amounts to harassment or threats.Suit for Injunction:You or your father can file a suit for injunction to restrain your brother's disruptive behavior and ensure peaceful co-existence.Recommendations:Consult a lawyer specializing in property inheritance and family disputes in Lucknow. They can review the deed (if any) and advise on the most suitable course of action, including:Enforcing the terms of the deed (if it allows selling the house).Filing a partition suit if selling the entire house isn't feasible.Filing a suit for injunction against your brother's disruptive behavior."

    "answer": "Firstly you should remember that you are posting this query in a public domain where many people respond to the queries hence your question to engage a particular advocate will not be appropriate in this forum, you can contact the advocate of your choice through their personal contact, the details  are availble in this forum also.Secondly to your question about purchasing the property from the seller who is not a registered owner:Since the seller has entered into a registered sale agreement with the builder and if he has availed any loan, then he has to obtain NOC from both.However you can enter into a tripartite agreement involving the bank also to purchase this property on the terms as entered in the tripartite agreement.As far as purchase of property is concerned you should satisfy yourself properly about the genuineness of the property, i.e., clear title to the original owner, tax paid receipts, construction approved plan, commencement certificate, land conversion certificate , if any, encumbrance certificate and other issues that would be let known by the advocate from who you will be obtaining a legal opinion.Hence first obtain a proper legal opinion from an experienced lawyer and then proceed only if recommendedT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Ancestral land dispute - Uttar Pradesh",
    "answer": "I'll provide a response regarding the potential land dispute in Gautam Buddha Nagar, Uttar Pradesh, considering your Hindu religion:Inheritance of Ancestral LandIn your scenario, the land is ancestral property if it was inherited by your grandfather from his parents or further generations.Under theHindu Succession Act(1956), upon your grandfather's demise, the land would be classified as coparcenary property.This means your father and uncle (both sons) have equal coparcenary rights.Father's Will or GiftWill:Your grandfather can create a will distributing the land as he wishes. However, he cannot completely disinherit a coparcener (your father) without a valid and justifiable reason. Courts may question such a will.Gift:During his lifetime, your grandfather can gift a portion of the land to your uncle. However, this gift cannot exceed his own share (i.e., half of the land).Taking Legal ActionIf your father feels disadvantaged by the will or gift, he can contest it in court.The court will consider the validity of the will or the reasonableness of the gift.Potential LossesMaximum Loss Through Will: In the worst-case scenario, your grandfather's will might leave a very small portion (e.g., 1%) to your father. However, challenging such a will can be time-consuming and expensive.Maximum Loss Through Gift: Your grandfather can potentially gift up to half of the land to your uncle. However, exceeding his own share and leaving your father with nothing might be deemed unreasonable by the court.RecommendationGiven your desire to minimize conflict and potential legal expenses, consider these options:Negotiation: If the \"minor favor\" to your uncle is manageable, discuss with your father if peaceful co-existence is preferable to a potentially lengthy legal battle.Mediation: Explore involving a neutral third party (mediator) to facilitate communication and find a solution acceptable to all parties.Consulting a LawyerWhile I've provided a general overview, a lawyer specializing in property inheritance in Gautam Buddha Nagar, Uttar Pradesh, can offer more specific guidance based on the details of your situation. They can advise on:The validity of a potential will or the reasonableness of a gift.The likelihood of success in a legal challenge.The potential costs and time involved in litigation.Alternative dispute resolution options like mediation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "I understand you're considering registering a flat on the 18th floor of an under-construction building in Mumbai. Here's some information to help you decide, but it's important to understand this isn't legal advice.Registering Flat with Pending Layout Plan:Potential Risk: Registering a flat where the layout plan for your specific floor (18th) is unavailable might be risky.Approval Uncertainties: Without the approved layout plan, there's no guarantee the 18th floor will be built as envisioned, impacting the flat's size, location, or configuration.Key Points to Consider:Developer's Assurance: While the developer might claim sufficient FSI (Floor Space Index) is available, rely only on official approvals, not verbal assurances.Sub-Registrar's Role: The sub-registrar might register the flat despite the missing layout plan, but it doesn't guarantee future approvals or the final configuration of your flat.Recommendations:Delay Registration: Consider waiting until the layout plan for the 18th floor is approved by the authorities. This provides clarity on the flat's specifics before registration.Consult Lawyer: A lawyer specializing in property law can review the agreement and advise on the risks and benefits of registering before the layout plan is finalized. They can also help negotiate terms that protect your interests in case of layout changes.Additional Considerations:Financial Implications: If the layout changes significantly after registration, you might have limited recourse, especially if the final flat size is smaller than what you envisioned.Time Factor: While waiting for the layout plan might delay registration, it could save you from potential issues later.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

A new suit for divorce has to be filed in the court with the foreign order and then the court will decide with relation to foreign order.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Dispute over assets and alcoholic addiction",
    "answer": "I understand this is a stressful situation. Here's some guidance on property inheritance and dealing with your brother in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, considering your Hindu religion:Inheritance Rights:In a Hindu Undivided Family (HUF), sons (including brothers) and daughters have coparcenary rights in ancestral property (inherited from grandparents or further generations).Since your mother passed away, her share would devolve upon your father and then be distributed as per the will or intestacy laws.Deed of Distribution:If your father has a registered deed dividing the assets, it will supersede intestacy laws and dictate the distribution of property.Selling the House:Selling While Father Alive:With a deed: If the deed allows selling the house, all co-owners (including your brother) must consent to the sale.Without a deed: All coparceners (father, you, and brother) have equal rights, and everyone's consent is required.Selling Part of the House (Floor-wise):This is not common in India but can be achieved through a partition suit in court. However, it's a complex and time-consuming process.Dealing with Brother:Negotiation:Try mediation or involving a respected family member to convince your brother to agree to a sale.Partition Suit:If negotiation fails, consider filing a partition suit in court to divide the property by metes and bounds (dividing the physical property) or selling it and dividing the proceeds.Legal Action Against Brother:Police Help:While police can't evict your brother as a co-owner, they can intervene if his behavior amounts to harassment or threats.Suit for Injunction:You or your father can file a suit for injunction to restrain your brother's disruptive behavior and ensure peaceful co-existence.Recommendations:Consult a lawyer specializing in property inheritance and family disputes in Lucknow. They can review the deed (if any) and advise on the most suitable course of action, including:Enforcing the terms of the deed (if it allows selling the house).Filing a partition suit if selling the entire house isn't feasible.Filing a suit for injunction against your brother's disruptive behavior."

The surviving account holder can continue using the account, and the money in it, without any interruptions based on right to survivorship.Some banks may also have specific policies regarding how they should treat joint accounts upon death of any holder depending on terms of agreements between the bank and the holders.As the issue here if the bank has the policy which doesn't let you use the account after primary holder's death then it is feasible to open a new account. But at first verify the said policy which was stated by the bank. If there is policy then you can use the account lawfully under right to survivorship.On the 2nd question you have to report the amount to Income tax dept. or you'll face penalities.

If the survivor (s) do not have any other account, a new account may be opened after completion of the relevant formalities.When a joint account holder dies, in the absence of a clause like Either or Survivor ( E or S), Former or Survivor (F or S), Latter or Survivor (L or S), the balance can be paid jointly to the survivors and the legal heirs of the deceased.Example: If an account in the joint name of A and B, and if A dies, the balance will not be paid to B alone. It has to be paid jointly to B and to the legal heirs of A. The settlement can be made to the legal heirs of A either through legal representation or without legal representation as the case may be.Therefore you may not be able to dispute the rules that has been informed to you by bank on this subject matter.2.

    "question": "Ancestral land dispute - Uttar Pradesh",
    "answer": "I'll provide a response regarding the potential land dispute in Gautam Buddha Nagar, Uttar Pradesh, considering your Hindu religion:Inheritance of Ancestral LandIn your scenario, the land is ancestral property if it was inherited by your grandfather from his parents or further generations.Under theHindu Succession Act(1956), upon your grandfather's demise, the land would be classified as coparcenary property.This means your father and uncle (both sons) have equal coparcenary rights.Father's Will or GiftWill:Your grandfather can create a will distributing the land as he wishes. However, he cannot completely disinherit a coparcener (your father) without a valid and justifiable reason. Courts may question such a will.Gift:During his lifetime, your grandfather can gift a portion of the land to your uncle. However, this gift cannot exceed his own share (i.e., half of the land).Taking Legal ActionIf your father feels disadvantaged by the will or gift, he can contest it in court.The court will consider the validity of the will or the reasonableness of the gift.Potential LossesMaximum Loss Through Will: In the worst-case scenario, your grandfather's will might leave a very small portion (e.g., 1%) to your father. However, challenging such a will can be time-consuming and expensive.Maximum Loss Through Gift: Your grandfather can potentially gift up to half of the land to your uncle. However, exceeding his own share and leaving your father with nothing might be deemed unreasonable by the court.RecommendationGiven your desire to minimize conflict and potential legal expenses, consider these options:Negotiation: If the \"minor favor\" to your uncle is manageable, discuss with your father if peaceful co-existence is preferable to a potentially lengthy legal battle.Mediation: Explore involving a neutral third party (mediator) to facilitate communication and find a solution acceptable to all parties.Consulting a LawyerWhile I've provided a general overview, a lawyer specializing in property inheritance in Gautam Buddha Nagar, Uttar Pradesh, can offer more specific guidance based on the details of your situation. They can advise on:The validity of a potential will or the reasonableness of a gift.The likelihood of success in a legal challenge.The potential costs and time involved in litigation.Alternative dispute resolution options like mediation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "I understand you're considering registering a flat on the 18th floor of an under-construction building in Mumbai. Here's some information to help you decide, but it's important to understand this isn't legal advice.Registering Flat with Pending Layout Plan:Potential Risk: Registering a flat where the layout plan for your specific floor (18th) is unavailable might be risky.Approval Uncertainties: Without the approved layout plan, there's no guarantee the 18th floor will be built as envisioned, impacting the flat's size, location, or configuration.Key Points to Consider:Developer's Assurance: While the developer might claim sufficient FSI (Floor Space Index) is available, rely only on official approvals, not verbal assurances.Sub-Registrar's Role: The sub-registrar might register the flat despite the missing layout plan, but it doesn't guarantee future approvals or the final configuration of your flat.Recommendations:Delay Registration: Consider waiting until the layout plan for the 18th floor is approved by the authorities. This provides clarity on the flat's specifics before registration.Consult Lawyer: A lawyer specializing in property law can review the agreement and advise on the risks and benefits of registering before the layout plan is finalized. They can also help negotiate terms that protect your interests in case of layout changes.Additional Considerations:Financial Implications: If the layout changes significantly after registration, you might have limited recourse, especially if the final flat size is smaller than what you envisioned.Time Factor: While waiting for the layout plan might delay registration, it could save you from potential issues later.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "-  As per Section 90 of the IPC , When the accused gives promise to the victim to marry her, never had any intention to marry and the victim gave the consent for sexual intercourse on such an assurance by the accused that he would marry her, such a consent can be said to be a consent obtained on a misconception of fact and, in such a case, an offender can be said to have committed the rape as defined under Section 375 of IPC , and can be convicted for the offence under Section 376 of the IPC.- Hence, the consent for physical relation obtained by your boyfriend by giving false promise of marriage is amounts to rape.- Further , as per the Supreme Court,  When a man and a woman live together as husband and wife for a long term, the law will presume that they are legally married unless proved contrary.- Further, the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct 2005 provides for the protection, maintenance and right of palimony to a live-in partner, if she complains.- You should lodge a complaint against him before the police and higher official , after mentioning all the facts in details, and his message & phone talk recordings are enough evidence.- The age criteria is not a hurdle in such type of cases.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Sell 2 flats to buy one house - capital gains",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The seller of a residential property benefits from capital gains tax under Section 54 of the Income Tax Act if the seller uses that sum to build another residential property. In this instance, the goal is to purchase another acceptable home rather than to profit from the sale of the previous one. This provision allows you to claim an exemption from capital gains tax if you invest the sale proceeds in a new residential property.There are certain conditions that must be met to avail of this benefit:The new property must be a residential property. Investing in commercial property will not make you eligible for this exemption. You need to invest the proceeds in the new property either one year before the sale or within two years after the sale. Alternatively, you can also invest in the construction of a new property within three years. If you are unable to invest the proceeds before filing your income tax return, you can deposit the amount in a Capital Gains Account Scheme with a bank. This amount must be used for the new property within the stipulated time frame.The cost of interiors is not considered while calculating capital gains. Capital gains are generally calculated as the difference between the sale value and the indexed cost of acquisition/improvement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "At the present date, the long-term capital gain on property is calculated at a 20% tax rate with some additional cess and surcharge rates if applicable. However, short-term capital gain from a property is charged at the normal slab rate.While selling the properties:The cost of acquisition and improvement is indexed by applying CII (cost inflation index). It is done to adjust for inflation over the years of holding the asset. This increases one’s cost base and lowers the capital gains.The cost price is adjusted for inflation and indexed cost of acquisition is taken.indexation applies only to assets held for long-term.The exemption under Section 54 is available when the capital gains from the sale of house property are reinvested into buying or constructing two another house properties (prior to Budget 2019, the exemption of the capital gains was limited to only 1 house property).The exemption on two house properties will be allowed once in the lifetime of a taxpayer, provided the capital gains do not exceed Rs. 2 crores. The taxpayer has to invest the amount of capital gains and not the entire sale proceeds. If the purchase price of the new property is higher than the amount of capital gains, the exemption shall be limited to the total capital gain on saleT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Owner threatening to file police complaint if flat not vacated",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Ten days might not be enough time to vacate a flat, especially considering the circumstances you've described. Generally, landlords are required to give tenants a certain amount of notice before eviction, typically ranging from 30 to 90 days. If you do not leave the flat by the specified date in the eviction notice, the landlord may choose to pursue legal action to forcibly remove you from the property. This could involve going to court to obtain an eviction order, which could lead to law enforcement getting involved to enforce the eviction. It's important to seek legal advice to understand your rights and options. Additionally, you may need to communicate with the landlord or their legal representative to address the issues surrounding your tenancy and the eviction notice. While the situation involving your security deposit may constitute a civil matter rather than a criminal one, it's still advisable to document the situation and consider seeking assistance from the authorities if necessary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "1.  Actually if there is no provision for subletting the rented premise then you will be considered as an illegal occupant.  However the owner/landlord can take action against the original tenant to evict him for this illegal activity. As you are not considered as a legal tenant there is no necessity for the landlord to grant you even that 10 days time.2. You can refuse to vacate  the premises and approach court with an injunction suit to restrain the landlord from evicting you forcibly other than by due process of law on the basis of the rental agreement you entered with the middleman.Even though it may not be a proper and legally valid document, for now this will protect your interests and in the injunction suit you can implead the middleman also as one of the defendants and make a claim for return of your security deposit amount .3.  You can file a suit for injunction as suggested above. All these process will take at least 6 months to one year for disposal hence you may not be legally disturbed until then.4.

But at first verify the said policy which was stated by the bank. If there is policy then you can use the account lawfully under right to survivorship.On the 2nd question you have to report the amount to Income tax dept. or you'll face penalities.

If the survivor (s) do not have any other account, a new account may be opened after completion of the relevant formalities.When a joint account holder dies, in the absence of a clause like Either or Survivor ( E or S), Former or Survivor (F or S), Latter or Survivor (L or S), the balance can be paid jointly to the survivors and the legal heirs of the deceased.Example: If an account in the joint name of A and B, and if A dies, the balance will not be paid to B alone. It has to be paid jointly to B and to the legal heirs of A. The settlement can be made to the legal heirs of A either through legal representation or without legal representation as the case may be.Therefore you may not be able to dispute the rules that has been informed to you by bank on this subject matter.2.

    "answer": "-  As per Section 90 of the IPC , When the accused gives promise to the victim to marry her, never had any intention to marry and the victim gave the consent for sexual intercourse on such an assurance by the accused that he would marry her, such a consent can be said to be a consent obtained on a misconception of fact and, in such a case, an offender can be said to have committed the rape as defined under Section 375 of IPC , and can be convicted for the offence under Section 376 of the IPC.- Hence, the consent for physical relation obtained by your boyfriend by giving false promise of marriage is amounts to rape.- Further , as per the Supreme Court,  When a man and a woman live together as husband and wife for a long term, the law will presume that they are legally married unless proved contrary.- Further, the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct 2005 provides for the protection, maintenance and right of palimony to a live-in partner, if she complains.- You should lodge a complaint against him before the police and higher official , after mentioning all the facts in details, and his message & phone talk recordings are enough evidence.- The age criteria is not a hurdle in such type of cases.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Owner threatening to file police complaint if flat not vacated",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Ten days might not be enough time to vacate a flat, especially considering the circumstances you've described. Generally, landlords are required to give tenants a certain amount of notice before eviction, typically ranging from 30 to 90 days. If you do not leave the flat by the specified date in the eviction notice, the landlord may choose to pursue legal action to forcibly remove you from the property. This could involve going to court to obtain an eviction order, which could lead to law enforcement getting involved to enforce the eviction. It's important to seek legal advice to understand your rights and options. Additionally, you may need to communicate with the landlord or their legal representative to address the issues surrounding your tenancy and the eviction notice. While the situation involving your security deposit may constitute a civil matter rather than a criminal one, it's still advisable to document the situation and consider seeking assistance from the authorities if necessary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Owner threatening to file police complaint if flat not vacated",
    "answer": "1.  Actually if there is no provision for subletting the rented premise then you will be considered as an illegal occupant.  However the owner/landlord can take action against the original tenant to evict him for this illegal activity. As you are not considered as a legal tenant there is no necessity for the landlord to grant you even that 10 days time.2. You can refuse to vacate  the premises and approach court with an injunction suit to restrain the landlord from evicting you forcibly other than by due process of law on the basis of the rental agreement you entered with the middleman.Even though it may not be a proper and legally valid document, for now this will protect your interests and in the injunction suit you can implead the middleman also as one of the defendants and make a claim for return of your security deposit amount .3.  You can file a suit for injunction as suggested above. All these process will take at least 6 months to one year for disposal hence you may not be legally disturbed until then.4.

    "question": "If girl is older than boy and boy cheats with false marriage after being in relationship for 4 years",
    "answer": "-  As per Section 90 of the IPC , When the accused gives promise to the victim to marry her, never had any intention to marry and the victim gave the consent for sexual intercourse on such an assurance by the accused that he would marry her, such a consent can be said to be a consent obtained on a misconception of fact and, in such a case, an offender can be said to have committed the rape as defined under Section 375 of IPC , and can be convicted for the offence under Section 376 of the IPC.- Hence, the consent for physical relation obtained by your boyfriend by giving false promise of marriage is amounts to rape.- Further , as per the Supreme Court,  When a man and a woman live together as husband and wife for a long term, the law will presume that they are legally married unless proved contrary.- Further, the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct 2005 provides for the protection, maintenance and right of palimony to a live-in partner, if she complains.- You should lodge a complaint against him before the police and higher official , after mentioning all the facts in details, and his message & phone talk recordings are enough evidence.- The age criteria is not a hurdle in such type of cases.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

The State of Maharashtra, has held that \"Maintianing Sexual Relationship With Consent Is Not An Offence\".

    "question": "Owner threatening to file police complaint if flat not vacated",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Ten days might not be enough time to vacate a flat, especially considering the circumstances you've described. Generally, landlords are required to give tenants a certain amount of notice before eviction, typically ranging from 30 to 90 days. If you do not leave the flat by the specified date in the eviction notice, the landlord may choose to pursue legal action to forcibly remove you from the property. This could involve going to court to obtain an eviction order, which could lead to law enforcement getting involved to enforce the eviction. It's important to seek legal advice to understand your rights and options. Additionally, you may need to communicate with the landlord or their legal representative to address the issues surrounding your tenancy and the eviction notice. While the situation involving your security deposit may constitute a civil matter rather than a criminal one, it's still advisable to document the situation and consider seeking assistance from the authorities if necessary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "1.  Actually if there is no provision for subletting the rented premise then you will be considered as an illegal occupant.  However the owner/landlord can take action against the original tenant to evict him for this illegal activity. As you are not considered as a legal tenant there is no necessity for the landlord to grant you even that 10 days time.2. You can refuse to vacate  the premises and approach court with an injunction suit to restrain the landlord from evicting you forcibly other than by due process of law on the basis of the rental agreement you entered with the middleman.Even though it may not be a proper and legally valid document, for now this will protect your interests and in the injunction suit you can implead the middleman also as one of the defendants and make a claim for return of your security deposit amount .3.  You can file a suit for injunction as suggested above. All these process will take at least 6 months to one year for disposal hence you may not be legally disturbed until then.4.

    "question": "Owner threatening to file police complaint if flat not vacated",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Ten days might not be enough time to vacate a flat, especially considering the circumstances you've described. Generally, landlords are required to give tenants a certain amount of notice before eviction, typically ranging from 30 to 90 days. If you do not leave the flat by the specified date in the eviction notice, the landlord may choose to pursue legal action to forcibly remove you from the property. This could involve going to court to obtain an eviction order, which could lead to law enforcement getting involved to enforce the eviction. It's important to seek legal advice to understand your rights and options. Additionally, you may need to communicate with the landlord or their legal representative to address the issues surrounding your tenancy and the eviction notice. While the situation involving your security deposit may constitute a civil matter rather than a criminal one, it's still advisable to document the situation and consider seeking assistance from the authorities if necessary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "1.  Actually if there is no provision for subletting the rented premise then you will be considered as an illegal occupant.  However the owner/landlord can take action against the original tenant to evict him for this illegal activity. As you are not considered as a legal tenant there is no necessity for the landlord to grant you even that 10 days time.2. You can refuse to vacate  the premises and approach court with an injunction suit to restrain the landlord from evicting you forcibly other than by due process of law on the basis of the rental agreement you entered with the middleman.Even though it may not be a proper and legally valid document, for now this will protect your interests and in the injunction suit you can implead the middleman also as one of the defendants and make a claim for return of your security deposit amount .3.  You can file a suit for injunction as suggested above. All these process will take at least 6 months to one year for disposal hence you may not be legally disturbed until then.4.

The surviving account holder can continue using the account, and the money in it, without any interruptions based on right to survivorship.Some banks may also have specific policies regarding how they should treat joint accounts upon death of any holder depending on terms of agreements between the bank and the holders.As the issue here if the bank has the policy which doesn't let you use the account after primary holder's death then it is feasible to open a new account. But at first verify the said policy which was stated by the bank. If there is policy then you can use the account lawfully under right to survivorship.On the 2nd question you have to report the amount to Income tax dept. or you'll face penalities. Even if you have not informed the department, the bank will report the large amounts to the department.

If the survivor (s) do not have any other account, a new account may be opened after completion of the relevant formalities.When a joint account holder dies, in the absence of a clause like Either or Survivor ( E or S), Former or Survivor (F or S), Latter or Survivor (L or S), the balance can be paid jointly to the survivors and the legal heirs of the deceased.Example: If an account in the joint name of A and B, and if A dies, the balance will not be paid to B alone.

The surviving account holder can continue using the account, and the money in it, without any interruptions based on right to survivorship.Some banks may also have specific policies regarding how they should treat joint accounts upon death of any holder depending on terms of agreements between the bank and the holders.As the issue here if the bank has the policy which doesn't let you use the account after primary holder's death then it is feasible to open a new account. But at first verify the said policy which was stated by the bank. If there is policy then you can use the account lawfully under right to survivorship.On the 2nd question you have to report the amount to Income tax dept. or you'll face penalities. Even if you have not informed the department, the bank will report the large amounts to the department.

If the survivor (s) do not have any other account, a new account may be opened after completion of the relevant formalities.When a joint account holder dies, in the absence of a clause like Either or Survivor ( E or S), Former or Survivor (F or S), Latter or Survivor (L or S), the balance can be paid jointly to the survivors and the legal heirs of the deceased.Example: If an account in the joint name of A and B, and if A dies, the balance will not be paid to B alone. It has to be paid jointly to B and to the legal heirs of A. The settlement can be made to the legal heirs of A either through legal representation or without legal representation as the case may be.Therefore you may not be able to dispute the rules that has been informed to you by bank on this subject matter.2.

    "answer": "Dear client, after the primary account holder dies, the secondary holder retain ownership of the money in the account. The surviving account holder can continue using the account, and the money in it, without any interruptions based on right to survivorship.Some banks may also have specific policies regarding how they should treat joint accounts upon death of any holder depending on terms of agreements between the bank and the holders.As the issue here if the bank has the policy which doesn't let you use the account after primary holder's death then it is feasible to open a new account. But at first verify the said policy which was stated by the bank. If there is policy then you can use the account lawfully under right to survivorship.On the 2nd question you have to report the amount to Income tax dept. or you'll face penalities. Even if you have not informed the department, the bank will report the large amounts to the department.

If the survivor (s) do not have any other account, a new account may be opened after completion of the relevant formalities.When a joint account holder dies, in the absence of a clause like Either or Survivor ( E or S), Former or Survivor (F or S), Latter or Survivor (L or S), the balance can be paid jointly to the survivors and the legal heirs of the deceased.Example: If an account in the joint name of A and B, and if A dies, the balance will not be paid to B alone. It has to be paid jointly to B and to the legal heirs of A. The settlement can be made to the legal heirs of A either through legal representation or without legal representation as the case may be.Therefore you may not be able to dispute the rules that has been informed to you by bank on this subject matter.2.

If it can be shown that there were anomalies in the selling procedure or that the sale was not carried out in compliance with the terms specified in the will, then C's case concerning the remaining 1 acre in Survey No. 2 may have merit. Although it's possible to read C's use of the deposited money after she became a major as her approval of the deal, this may not be sufficient to establish the sale's legality.  Her knowledge of the sale and her assent would be taken into account, among other things. If it can be proven that the remaining 1 acre in Survey No. 2 was meant for C, in accordance with the terms of the bequest, then she might be entitled to it. Her failure to sign the sale deed, meanwhile, might make things more difficult.

    "answer": "1. If C had filed the suit within three years from the date of majority then it i maintainable.  The permission from court to sell her property was obtained when she was minor by age, whereas the remaining proeprty was sold when she became major, therefore it can be considered as a fraudulent sale by her father deceiving or depriving her rights.In fact C had become major at the time of execution of sale deed therefore B had no rights to sell this remaining portion of property2. The question is that you have not paid the consideration amount to the owner of the property that was purchased by sale deed in the year 2020, hence she is right in her claim.3. If the sale consideration amount for this property also was deposited to her bank account at the time of her minority then this suit can be prayed to be dismissed.4. She has to ratify the sale deed since she has already received the sale consideration amount5.

    "question": "Sell 2 flats to buy one house - capital gains",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The seller of a residential property benefits from capital gains tax under Section 54 of the Income Tax Act if the seller uses that sum to build another residential property. In this instance, the goal is to purchase another acceptable home rather than to profit from the sale of the previous one. This provision allows you to claim an exemption from capital gains tax if you invest the sale proceeds in a new residential property.There are certain conditions that must be met to avail of this benefit:The new property must be a residential property. Investing in commercial property will not make you eligible for this exemption. You need to invest the proceeds in the new property either one year before the sale or within two years after the sale. Alternatively, you can also invest in the construction of a new property within three years. If you are unable to invest the proceeds before filing your income tax return, you can deposit the amount in a Capital Gains Account Scheme with a bank. This amount must be used for the new property within the stipulated time frame.The cost of interiors is not considered while calculating capital gains. Capital gains are generally calculated as the difference between the sale value and the indexed cost of acquisition/improvement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "At the present date, the long-term capital gain on property is calculated at a 20% tax rate with some additional cess and surcharge rates if applicable. However, short-term capital gain from a property is charged at the normal slab rate.While selling the properties:The cost of acquisition and improvement is indexed by applying CII (cost inflation index). It is done to adjust for inflation over the years of holding the asset. This increases one’s cost base and lowers the capital gains.The cost price is adjusted for inflation and indexed cost of acquisition is taken.indexation applies only to assets held for long-term.The exemption under Section 54 is available when the capital gains from the sale of house property are reinvested into buying or constructing two another house properties (prior to Budget 2019, the exemption of the capital gains was limited to only 1 house property).The exemption on two house properties will be allowed once in the lifetime of a taxpayer, provided the capital gains do not exceed Rs. 2 crores. The taxpayer has to invest the amount of capital gains and not the entire sale proceeds. If the purchase price of the new property is higher than the amount of capital gains, the exemption shall be limited to the total capital gain on saleT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

The income from agriculture has already been exempted.However this privilege has not been exempted to the employees of private sector yet.The annual income from all the sources excluding agricultural income should not exceed Rs. 8 Lakhs  for the last three years, in case the income of private employees including the salary income exceeds Rs. 8 lakhs, then the children of  such employees will fall under the creamy layer category.In so far as wealth tax is concerned, as per the Finance Act, 2015, the filing of the Wealth Tax returns have been exempted with effect from 1st April, 2016.Whatever, you being an employee from private sector and your salary income and income from other sources, if any exceed Rs. 8 lakhs for the last three consecutive three years, then yor children will not come eligible for the privileges under OBC NCL category.For your information,  A committee was formed by NCBC in the year to lok into the reforms in this connection and the committee in its report has recommended to raise the ceiling limit of Rs. 8 Lakhs to 15 lakhs or above at least to the employees of private sector among other recommendations which includes the exemption to the former and current MPs and MLAs of the country to get the benefits under this category, whereas the recommendations and the report has still not been considered by central government and no changes are made yet to the existing law on this.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "GWOP after attaining major civil case",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The evidence offered, how the will is interpreted, and the specifics of the sale—most notably the timing of the transaction—will all play a role in C's ability to get an injunction order on the remaining 1 acre in Survey No. 2. If it can be shown that there were anomalies in the selling procedure or that the sale was not carried out in compliance with the terms specified in the will, then C's case concerning the remaining 1 acre in Survey No. 2 may have merit. Although it's possible to read C's use of the deposited money after she became a major as her approval of the deal, this may not be sufficient to establish the sale's legality.  Her knowledge of the sale and her assent would be taken into account, among other things. If it can be proven that the remaining 1 acre in Survey No. 2 was meant for C, in accordance with the terms of the bequest, then she might be entitled to it. Her failure to sign the sale deed, meanwhile, might make things more difficult. Nonetheless, bringing up the issue and resolving this scenario outside of court would also assist the parties in coming to a mutually beneficial resolution through negotiation or mediation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "1. If C had filed the suit within three years from the date of majority then it i maintainable.  The permission from court to sell her property was obtained when she was minor by age, whereas the remaining proeprty was sold when she became major, therefore it can be considered as a fraudulent sale by her father deceiving or depriving her rights.In fact C had become major at the time of execution of sale deed therefore B had no rights to sell this remaining portion of property2. The question is that you have not paid the consideration amount to the owner of the property that was purchased by sale deed in the year 2020, hence she is right in her claim.3. If the sale consideration amount for this property also was deposited to her bank account at the time of her minority then this suit can be prayed to be dismissed.4. She has to ratify the sale deed since she has already received the sale consideration amount5.

This means that if Mrs. Banu passed away after the amendment came into effect, daughter C would have a legal right to claim her share in the ancestral property, irrespective of what the will states.

    "answer": "Dear Client,The seller of a residential property benefits from capital gains tax under Section 54 of the Income Tax Act if the seller uses that sum to build another residential property. In this instance, the goal is to purchase another acceptable home rather than to profit from the sale of the previous one. This provision allows you to claim an exemption from capital gains tax if you invest the sale proceeds in a new residential property.There are certain conditions that must be met to avail of this benefit:The new property must be a residential property. Investing in commercial property will not make you eligible for this exemption. You need to invest the proceeds in the new property either one year before the sale or within two years after the sale. Alternatively, you can also invest in the construction of a new property within three years. If you are unable to invest the proceeds before filing your income tax return, you can deposit the amount in a Capital Gains Account Scheme with a bank. This amount must be used for the new property within the stipulated time frame.The cost of interiors is not considered while calculating capital gains. Capital gains are generally calculated as the difference between the sale value and the indexed cost of acquisition/improvement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, short-term capital gain from a property is charged at the normal slab rate.While selling the properties:The cost of acquisition and improvement is indexed by applying CII (cost inflation index). It is done to adjust for inflation over the years of holding the asset. This increases one’s cost base and lowers the capital gains.The cost price is adjusted for inflation and indexed cost of acquisition is taken.indexation applies only to assets held for long-term.The exemption under Section 54 is available when the capital gains from the sale of house property are reinvested into buying or constructing two another house properties (prior to Budget 2019, the exemption of the capital gains was limited to only 1 house property).The exemption on two house properties will be allowed once in the lifetime of a taxpayer, provided the capital gains do not exceed Rs. 2 crores. The taxpayer has to invest the amount of capital gains and not the entire sale proceeds.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Your sister's husband and son can execute a relinquishment deed in your favor, relinquishing their rights in the properties. This process generally involves a legal document stating their intention to give up their share in the properties. Also gifts from a nephew to an aunt may attract income tax implications. Alongside the relinquishment or gift deed, obtaining a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from your sister's husband and son would be prudent. It signifies that they have no objections to the transfer of the properties. The process might involve preparing the necessary documents, obtaining signatures, and registering the deed with the relevant authorities. Your brother-in-law may need to be involved in the process, especially if he is relinquishing or gifting his share.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In this instance, the goal is to purchase another acceptable home rather than to profit from the sale of the previous one. This provision allows you to claim an exemption from capital gains tax if you invest the sale proceeds in a new residential property.There are certain conditions that must be met to avail of this benefit:The new property must be a residential property. Investing in commercial property will not make you eligible for this exemption. You need to invest the proceeds in the new property either one year before the sale or within two years after the sale. Alternatively, you can also invest in the construction of a new property within three years. If you are unable to invest the proceeds before filing your income tax return, you can deposit the amount in a Capital Gains Account Scheme with a bank. This amount must be used for the new property within the stipulated time frame.The cost of interiors is not considered while calculating capital gains. Capital gains are generally calculated as the difference between the sale value and the indexed cost of acquisition/improvement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "At the present date, the long-term capital gain on property is calculated at a 20% tax rate with some additional cess and surcharge rates if applicable. However, short-term capital gain from a property is charged at the normal slab rate.While selling the properties:The cost of acquisition and improvement is indexed by applying CII (cost inflation index). It is done to adjust for inflation over the years of holding the asset. This increases one’s cost base and lowers the capital gains.The cost price is adjusted for inflation and indexed cost of acquisition is taken.indexation applies only to assets held for long-term.The exemption under Section 54 is available when the capital gains from the sale of house property are reinvested into buying or constructing two another house properties (prior to Budget 2019, the exemption of the capital gains was limited to only 1 house property).The exemption on two house properties will be allowed once in the lifetime of a taxpayer, provided the capital gains do not exceed Rs. 2 crores. The taxpayer has to invest the amount of capital gains and not the entire sale proceeds. If the purchase price of the new property is higher than the amount of capital gains, the exemption shall be limited to the total capital gain on saleT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "You are referring to old circulars in this regard.These circulars were superseded by latest circulars and the latest exemption of income is upto 8 lakhs annual income for the last three consecutive years.For computation of annual income the rule of exempting the salary income of the government employees and that of the employees of public sector including bank, insurance and other government public sector organisations have been exempted for clubbing the income. The income from agriculture has already been exempted.However this privilege has not been exempted to the employees of private sector yet.The annual income from all the sources excluding agricultural income should not exceed Rs. 8 Lakhs  for the last three years, in case the income of private employees including the salary income exceeds Rs. 8 lakhs, then the children of  such employees will fall under the creamy layer category.In so far as wealth tax is concerned, as per the Finance Act, 2015, the filing of the Wealth Tax returns have been exempted with effect from 1st April, 2016.Whatever, you being an employee from private sector and your salary income and income from other sources, if any exceed Rs. 8 lakhs for the last three consecutive three years, then yor children will not come eligible for the privileges under OBC NCL category.For your information,  A committee was formed by NCBC in the year to lok into the reforms in this connection and the committee in its report has recommended to raise the ceiling limit of Rs. 8 Lakhs to 15 lakhs or above at least to the employees of private sector among other recommendations which includes the exemption to the former and current MPs and MLAs of the country to get the benefits under this category, whereas the recommendations and the report has still not been considered by central government and no changes are made yet to the existing law on this.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

The income from agriculture has already been exempted.However this privilege has not been exempted to the employees of private sector yet.The annual income from all the sources excluding agricultural income should not exceed Rs. 8 Lakhs  for the last three years, in case the income of private employees including the salary income exceeds Rs. 8 lakhs, then the children of  such employees will fall under the creamy layer category.In so far as wealth tax is concerned, as per the Finance Act, 2015, the filing of the Wealth Tax returns have been exempted with effect from 1st April, 2016.Whatever, you being an employee from private sector and your salary income and income from other sources, if any exceed Rs. 8 lakhs for the last three consecutive three years, then yor children will not come eligible for the privileges under OBC NCL category.For your information,  A committee was formed by NCBC in the year to lok into the reforms in this connection and the committee in its report has recommended to raise the ceiling limit of Rs. 8 Lakhs to 15 lakhs or above at least to the employees of private sector among other recommendations which includes the exemption to the former and current MPs and MLAs of the country to get the benefits under this category, whereas the recommendations and the report has still not been considered by central government and no changes are made yet to the existing law on this.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

If the will is validly executed, it can determine how the property is to be distributed. However, there are legal provisions for daughters to claim their share in the ancestral property. The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, brought significant changes to the inheritance rights of daughters. Under this amendment, daughters have equal rights as sons in the ancestral property. This means that if Mrs. Banu passed away after the amendment came into effect, daughter C would have a legal right to claim her share in the ancestral property, irrespective of what the will states. If A and B sold or gifted portions of the self-acquired property to third persons, the validity of these transactions might be less likely to be challenged by daughter C, as the property is not considered ancestral.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

They might be open to working with your preferences or providing a refund for any inconveniences the mixed-use development may have created. A bank guarantee is an assurance provided by the bank to the applicant to satisfy a third-party payment obligation.

Make sure you are aware of the legal ramifications and the rationale behind your selection if you insist on a bank guarantee.

    "question": "Custody and maintenance issue",
    "answer": "Dear Client,A person may file for divorce or judicial separation under Section 13 of the Act if they are \"incurably of unsound mind\" or suffer from a \"mental disorder of such a kind and to such an extent that the petitioner cannot reasonably be expected to live with the respondent,\" either continuously or sporadically.The Guardians and Wards Act 1890 gives the family court the authority to decide child custody matters, however these decisions frequently clash with individual state legislation. Thus, in order to preserve equilibrium, the court consistently prioritizes the child's best interests and welfare over the parent's. This suggests that the child should live with the parent who can secure his financial interests, a solid education, and a good upbringing. Since the mother is typically regarded as the kid's natural guardian, she frequently receives custody, particularly when the child is younger. However, the father or any appropriate guardian may receive custody if the mother is determined to be unfit or incapable of giving the child the care and protection that the child needs.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "- As per Section 13(1)(iii) of theHindu Marriage Act, if one of the parties, i.e., either husband or wife, is of unsound mind, then it is a valid ground for divorce. The unsoundness may be continuous or intermittent and incurable to the extent that it is not possible for the petitioner to continue married life with the respondent- Hence, if she is suffering from mental disorders then it can be a ground of divorce legally- Further, under Hindu law, A mother usually gets custody of the minor child, under the age of five and fathers get custody of older boys, but it is not a strict rule and is primarily decided based on the child’s interests.- Further, to win sole physical and legal custody, you should show, the court that awarding you custody is in the best interests of your child due to factors such as your existing relationship with the child, stability of the home life you provide, inability of the mother  to meet the child's needs; mother's lack of involvement due to her mental conditions.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

A stay order may be issued for various reasons, including the need to further investigate the allegations or to protect against potential misuse of the law. The husband's filing of a case under Section 13A for divorce based on cruelty may be a valid. Cruelty in marriage can encompass various forms of physical or mental harm, and falsely accusing someone of a serious offense may be considered a form of cruelty. The husband would need to provide evidence to support his claim that the 498A case is false and has caused him mental distress. If the husband can establish that the 498A case is indeed false, it may strengthen his case for divorce based on cruelty.

Kuldeep Subhash Pawar case The Bombay High Court dismissed the state's appeal, ruling that both the elements of rashness and negligence must be met for the offence of reckless driving under Section 279 to be committed. The Court decided as follows: Driving offences are only prosecuted in cases where they are reckless and careless. Rashness is the inference of unjustified speed. On the other hand, driving while negligently implies not paying enough attention or care.Rajasthan State v. Ravi Kapoor It is necessary to evaluate reckless and rash driving in the context of the particular facts and circumstances of each instance. It is an irreducible fact that cannot be understood or viewed in a vacuum.In this situation, where while driving you took all the due care, you cannot be charged under sec 279 and 304 A and When a suspect is accused of a bailable offence, they must present Form 45 from the Second Schedule to the court hearing their case in order to be granted bail. The police officer in charge of the police station where the accused is being held has the authority to issue bail for offences that are subject to it.A criminal case might affect job searches, especially if there's police verification. It could also impact visa procedures. The process for reinstatement of your driving privileges varies depending on the reason your right to drive was suspended by the Department of Motor Vehicles or by the court .Your insurance may cover third-party liability.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In India, the granting of a stay order onSection 498Adoes not automatically imply that the case is false. A stay order may be issued for various reasons, including the need to further investigate the allegations or to protect against potential misuse of the law. The husband's filing of a case under Section 13A for divorce based on cruelty may be a valid. Cruelty in marriage can encompass various forms of physical or mental harm, and falsely accusing someone of a serious offense may be considered a form of cruelty. The husband would need to provide evidence to support his claim that the 498A case is false and has caused him mental distress. If the husband can establish that the 498A case is indeed false, it may strengthen his case for divorce based on cruelty.

In your situation, it might be harder for your neighbour to assert adverse possession because you are aware of how they use the land. Check your property on a regular basis to make sure the usage permitted under the agreement stays within the limits you've established.

Thus, in order to preserve equilibrium, the court consistently prioritizes the child's best interests and welfare over the parent's. This suggests that the child should live with the parent who can secure his financial interests, a solid education, and a good upbringing. Since the mother is typically regarded as the kid's natural guardian, she frequently receives custody, particularly when the child is younger. However, the father or any appropriate guardian may receive custody if the mother is determined to be unfit or incapable of giving the child the care and protection that the child needs.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

They might be open to working with your preferences or providing a refund for any inconveniences the mixed-use development may have created. A bank guarantee is an assurance provided by the bank to the applicant to satisfy a third-party payment obligation.

Make sure you are aware of the legal ramifications and the rationale behind your selection if you insist on a bank guarantee.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In India, the granting of a stay order onSection 498Adoes not automatically imply that the case is false. A stay order may be issued for various reasons, including the need to further investigate the allegations or to protect against potential misuse of the law. The husband's filing of a case under Section 13A for divorce based on cruelty may be a valid. Cruelty in marriage can encompass various forms of physical or mental harm, and falsely accusing someone of a serious offense may be considered a form of cruelty. The husband would need to provide evidence to support his claim that the 498A case is false and has caused him mental distress. If the husband can establish that the 498A case is indeed false, it may strengthen his case for divorce based on cruelty. However, the final decision will be made by the court after considering all relevant factors.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The following are the primary factors that the High Court may take into account in order to nullify the N.B.W. against the accused: that the applicant or accused has not been found to have committed any crimes.  There is a malicious intent behind the initiation of proceedings. The accused's covert intention to assist with the proceedings is being monitored. Circumstances that prevented the accused from appearing in court as a representative. Gather any evidence that supports your claim of being present on the two hearing dates where the court marked you as absent. This could include any documentation, records, or statements from witnesses who can testify to your presence.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Given that the renters are exhibiting appropriate behaviour, paying rent on schedule, and there is no evidence of damage or subletting, it may be difficult to discover grounds for eviction based on the information you have supplied. But still these grounds can be considered: You might be able to use non-payment or late rent as justification for eviction if there are any instances of late or unpaid rent. Verify whether the tenants have broken any particular clauses in the lease. This can involve making changes to the property without permission, doing things that aren't allowed under the lease, or breaking any other rules. If a renter needs the property for personal or family purposes, several laws permit landlords to evict them. But it appears that you have disregarded this.

    "answer": "Dear Client,According to a legal notion known as \"adverse possession,\" someone can legally take possession of someone else's property if they use it publicly, ostentatiously, and without the owner's consent for a predetermined amount of time. In your situation, it might be harder for your neighbour to assert adverse possession because you are aware of how they use the land. Check your property on a regular basis to make sure the usage permitted under the agreement stays within the limits you've established. Clearly mark the boundaries of your property with physical barriers such as fences or boundary markers. This can help prevent unintentional encroachment and reinforce your ownership.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear clientHandling a criminal complaint can be difficult, particularly if the complainant has not provided enough evidence or if there are questions about jurisdiction. As a precaution, it is usually advisable to file a bail petition for official records, particularly if there is a possibility of an arrest. It guarantees that you are ready in the event that the magistrate decides to order your arrest during the hearing. To bolster their case, the complainant ought to present pre-trial documentation. To adequately prepare your defence, your attorney can ask the opposing counsel for this material. The charges in the complaint, the gravity of the offences, and your financial situation are some of the variables that go into determining the bond amount. The magistrate's decision may be influenced by incomplete documentation. At the summons stage, the magistrate may set bail in accordance with the details in the complaint letter and any further arguments made during the hearing. Yes, the attorney is allowed to bring up these issues with the magistrate and ask the other side for pre-trial testimony.

    "question": "Settlement deed done and registered on 1-Jun-2010. Same got cancelled and registered on 20-Jun-2010",
    "answer": "Dear client,In Indian law, the cancellation of a settlement deed needs to be legally valid and should be done in accordance with the law. If the settlement deed cancellation by the father was executed properly, it might be considered legally valid. However, the lack of a reason mentioned for the cancellation might raise questions. The subsequent actions, such as the transfer of property and sale by the son after the cancellation of the settlement deed, could also be subject to scrutiny. If the properties were sold based on the canceled settlement deed and there are subsequent buyers (like yourself) involved, the legality of these transactions may be affected if the cancellation of the settlement deed is found to be invalid or illegal.Regarding your situation as the fourth buyer of one of the properties, the Sub-Registrar's requirement for a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from all successors of the father indicates that they want confirmation from all individuals who could potentially claim rights or interests in the property.To resolve this matter, you might need to:1. Confirm the legality of the settlement deed cancellation with a lawyer.2. Check if the subsequent transactions, including the transfer of property and sale, were conducted legally and if the cancellation affected their validity.3. Obtain the necessary NOCs or take legal action to address any disputes over the property.Your chances of getting a positive order from the court would depend on various factors, including the validity of the cancellation, the subsequent transactions, and any legal claims made by other successors or stakeholders in the property.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Yes, if Mr. B files a lawsuit for contempt of court within the relevant statute of limitations, the bank will be held liable for disobeying the Supreme Court's ruling.

    "question": "House re-painting - Asian paints",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You might choose to bring up the issue with a higher-ranking official if you have voiced your concerns to your line manager or an equivalent and they have either disregarded you or denied any misconduct. This can frequently assist in providing objectivity and oversight for your issues because your line manager or the concerned personnel might have to provide an explanation for their choice. Make sure you have a complete record of all the problems you've had, including pictures of any poor-quality work, emails you've had with Asian Paints, and any proof of the calibre of the materials used. Examine the contract you signed with Asian Paints carefully to make sure you understand your rights and responsibilities, as well as any provisions pertaining to warranties, guarantees, or dispute resolution. If you're not happy with Asian Paints' response, you might want to try hiring a third-party expert to review the work done and provide you a fair evaluation of the painting job's quality and thoroughness. You might need to look into your legal options if Asian Paints won't listen to you or offer a satisfactory settlement. Some of these include registering a complaint with consumer protection organizations, going through mediation or arbitration, or bringing a lawsuit for negligence or contract breach. You can bargain for a lower total cost if Asian Paints agrees to redo some of the house in order to make up for the inconvenience and possible loss of revenue from having to take more time off work. Ensure that any agreement is recorded in writing.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can my father write WILL on Partitioned/inherited agricultural land in Karnataka",
    "answer": "Dear Client,An undivided property that belongs to four generations of a single family is known as an ancestral property. An ancestral property would cease to be an ancestral property once it was divided among the stakeholders and became a self-acquired property. The ancestral character of a property that has been divided or partitioned through a partition deed, family arrangement, etc., is lost. The condition for an ancestral property to be considered valid is that it should never have been split up or partitioned by family members. This is because each coparcener's share of the divided ancestral property becomes their own property. Following division, a coparcener's share of the ancestral property that remains after partition belongs to his male offspring. The Supreme Court held in this case as well that \"if an ancestral property is divided and is held by a single person, it must be treated as separate property. This person is then entitled to dispose of the coparcenary property, treating it as his separate property, but the alienation made prior to the birth cannot be questioned if a son is subsequently born.\" However, the property turns into a coparcenary asset the moment a son is born, and he will then gain a stake in it and become a coparcener. An ancestral property no longer qualifies as such once it has been divided among the family members. It is up to a father whether or not to leave his son his own property. This, however, does not apply to ancestral properties.With respect to ancestral property, the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 grants daughters the position of coparcener, granting them equal rights with their son. Before the 1956 modification, only male family members were coparceners, the originalHindu Succession Act's Section 6 had not mentioned a daughter's claim in a coparcenary property.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Refund of fees and NOC from advocate",
    "answer": "The practice for asking for a NOC is arbitrary under Article 22(1) of theConstitution of India. (It guarantees every person the right to consult and be defended by any legal practitioner of their choice.)A litigant must be free to change their advocate in case they are not able to pay the fees.party to a litigation has an absolute right to appoint an advocate of his choice, to terminate his services, and to appoint a new advocate. Hence, a party cannot be compelled to obtain 'no objection' from the advocate already on record. Insisting for 'no objection' from the previous advocate will amount to putting a restriction on the right of a party to appoint an advocate of his choice.Recently Karnataka high court has observed and held that .if the Advocate feels that he has any genuine claim or grievance against his client, the appropriate course is to return the brief with endorsement of no objection and agitate such right in an appropriate forum, in accordance with law and not indulge in arm twisting methods by holding on to the brief.\"It was  also held that :There is nothing known as irrevocable vakalatnama. The right of a party to withdraw vakalatnama or authorization given to an advocate is absolute. Hence, a party may discharge his advocate any time, with or without cause by withdrawing his vakalatnama or authorization. On discharging the advocate, the party has the right to have the case file returned to him from the advocate, and any refusal by the advocate to return the fileamounts to misconduct under Section 35 of the Advocates Act, 1961. In any proceeding, including civil and criminal, a party has an absolute right to appoint a new Advocate. Under no circumstance, a party can be denied of his right to appoint a new advocate of his choice. Therefore, it follows that any rule or law imposing restriction on the said right can't be construed as mandatory. Accordingly, Courts, Tribunals or otherauthorities shall not ask for 'no objection' of the advocate already on record, to accept the vakalatnama filed by a new advocate.under no circumstance, a party can be denied of his right to appoint a new advocate of his choice hence you can proceed through a new advocate.You can demand at least half of the huge fee paid by you, if he or she is refusing you may give a complaint against the advocate in the bar council of Karnataka.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

Give a detailed account of the problems you are having, the reasons for the delays in your case, and the effects they are having on your personal and work life. Provide pertinent papers to back up your assertions. Make sure your letter is factual, succinct, and formatted correctly to be addressed to a senior authority.

    "question": "Settlement deed done and registered on 1-Jun-2010. Same got cancelled and registered on 20-Jun-2010",
    "answer": "Dear client,In Indian law, the cancellation of a settlement deed needs to be legally valid and should be done in accordance with the law. If the settlement deed cancellation by the father was executed properly, it might be considered legally valid. However, the lack of a reason mentioned for the cancellation might raise questions. The subsequent actions, such as the transfer of property and sale by the son after the cancellation of the settlement deed, could also be subject to scrutiny. If the properties were sold based on the canceled settlement deed and there are subsequent buyers (like yourself) involved, the legality of these transactions may be affected if the cancellation of the settlement deed is found to be invalid or illegal.Regarding your situation as the fourth buyer of one of the properties, the Sub-Registrar's requirement for a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from all successors of the father indicates that they want confirmation from all individuals who could potentially claim rights or interests in the property.To resolve this matter, you might need to:1. Confirm the legality of the settlement deed cancellation with a lawyer.2. Check if the subsequent transactions, including the transfer of property and sale, were conducted legally and if the cancellation affected their validity.3. Obtain the necessary NOCs or take legal action to address any disputes over the property.Your chances of getting a positive order from the court would depend on various factors, including the validity of the cancellation, the subsequent transactions, and any legal claims made by other successors or stakeholders in the property.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Every legal heir normally owns a portion of the property, and any legal transactions involving the property frequently need their approval.  Clear title transfer to the buyer may be complicated if one legal heir fails to produce a NOC. The legal heir who is not providing the NOC may have rights to challenge the transaction or claim their share in the property at a later date. If you have obtained NOCs from the majority of legal heirs, you might be able to proceed with the sale of the property you obtained from them.

Kuldeep Subhash Pawar case The Bombay High Court dismissed the state's appeal, ruling that both the elements of rashness and negligence must be met for the offence of reckless driving under Section 279 to be committed. The Court decided as follows: Driving offences are only prosecuted in cases where they are reckless and careless. Rashness is the inference of unjustified speed. On the other hand, driving while negligently implies not paying enough attention or care.Rajasthan State v. Ravi Kapoor It is necessary to evaluate reckless and rash driving in the context of the particular facts and circumstances of each instance. It is an irreducible fact that cannot be understood or viewed in a vacuum.In this situation, where while driving you took all the due care, you cannot be charged under sec 279 and 304 A and When a suspect is accused of a bailable offence, they must present Form 45 from the Second Schedule to the court hearing their case in order to be granted bail. The police officer in charge of the police station where the accused is being held has the authority to issue bail for offences that are subject to it.A criminal case might affect job searches, especially if there's police verification. It could also impact visa procedures. The process for reinstatement of your driving privileges varies depending on the reason your right to drive was suspended by the Department of Motor Vehicles or by the court .Your insurance may cover third-party liability.

    "question": "Custody and maintenance issue",
    "answer": "Dear Client,A person may file for divorce or judicial separation under Section 13 of the Act if they are \"incurably of unsound mind\" or suffer from a \"mental disorder of such a kind and to such an extent that the petitioner cannot reasonably be expected to live with the respondent,\" either continuously or sporadically.The Guardians and Wards Act 1890 gives the family court the authority to decide child custody matters, however these decisions frequently clash with individual state legislation. Thus, in order to preserve equilibrium, the court consistently prioritizes the child's best interests and welfare over the parent's. This suggests that the child should live with the parent who can secure his financial interests, a solid education, and a good upbringing. Since the mother is typically regarded as the kid's natural guardian, she frequently receives custody, particularly when the child is younger. However, the father or any appropriate guardian may receive custody if the mother is determined to be unfit or incapable of giving the child the care and protection that the child needs.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Settlement deed done and registered on 1-Jun-2010. Same got cancelled and registered on 20-Jun-2010",
    "answer": "Dear client,In Indian law, the cancellation of a settlement deed needs to be legally valid and should be done in accordance with the law. If the settlement deed cancellation by the father was executed properly, it might be considered legally valid. However, the lack of a reason mentioned for the cancellation might raise questions. The subsequent actions, such as the transfer of property and sale by the son after the cancellation of the settlement deed, could also be subject to scrutiny. If the properties were sold based on the canceled settlement deed and there are subsequent buyers (like yourself) involved, the legality of these transactions may be affected if the cancellation of the settlement deed is found to be invalid or illegal.Regarding your situation as the fourth buyer of one of the properties, the Sub-Registrar's requirement for a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from all successors of the father indicates that they want confirmation from all individuals who could potentially claim rights or interests in the property.To resolve this matter, you might need to:1. Confirm the legality of the settlement deed cancellation with a lawyer.2. Check if the subsequent transactions, including the transfer of property and sale, were conducted legally and if the cancellation affected their validity.3. Obtain the necessary NOCs or take legal action to address any disputes over the property.Your chances of getting a positive order from the court would depend on various factors, including the validity of the cancellation, the subsequent transactions, and any legal claims made by other successors or stakeholders in the property.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Kuldeep Subhash Pawar case The Bombay High Court dismissed the state's appeal, ruling that both the elements of rashness and negligence must be met for the offence of reckless driving under Section 279 to be committed. The Court decided as follows: Driving offences are only prosecuted in cases where they are reckless and careless. Rashness is the inference of unjustified speed. On the other hand, driving while negligently implies not paying enough attention or care.Rajasthan State v. Ravi Kapoor It is necessary to evaluate reckless and rash driving in the context of the particular facts and circumstances of each instance. It is an irreducible fact that cannot be understood or viewed in a vacuum.In this situation, where while driving you took all the due care, you cannot be charged under sec 279 and 304 A and When a suspect is accused of a bailable offence, they must present Form 45 from the Second Schedule to the court hearing their case in order to be granted bail. The police officer in charge of the police station where the accused is being held has the authority to issue bail for offences that are subject to it.A criminal case might affect job searches, especially if there's police verification. It could also impact visa procedures. The process for reinstatement of your driving privileges varies depending on the reason your right to drive was suspended by the Department of Motor Vehicles or by the court .Your insurance may cover third-party liability.

It's important to remember, though, that a property's khata, or revenue record, is an important factor in real estate deals. A khata transfer that is ongoing or incomplete could have an impact on the registration procedure. A gift deed can be prepared ahead of time and stored in a ready state. The real registration, though, might have to wait till the khata transfer is finished. It is vital to adhere to the correct legal processes as the unregistered gift deed might not possess legal validity. In general, an unregistered gift deed might not be enforceable or have any legal standing. Consequently, in order to guarantee the legitimacy and legality of the transaction, it is advised to finish the registration process.

    "question": "Section 22(5) Orissa Land Reforms Act, 1960",
    "answer": "Section 22 of the OLR Actrequires permission of the competent revenue authority for transfer of any land belonging to S.C. or S.T. in favour of a person not belonging to such S.C. or S.T.Sub-Section(1) of Section 22 of OLR.Act explicitly makes a declaration that any transfer of a holding or part thereof by a S.C. or S.T. to a non-S.C. or non-S.T. shall be void, meaning thereby that the sale shall be invalid ab initio.However, in Section 12 of the C.P. Tenancy (Orissa Amendment) Act there is no such provision that the sale in contravention of the proviso to Section 12(1)(b) shall be void. The consequence of a transfer in violation of the proviso as aforesaid is envisaged under Sub-section (4) of Section 12, which is to the effect that in a proceeding initiated before the Deputy Commissioner either suo motu or an application of a transferee or his successor-in-interest, the sale can be declared void.The proviso to sub-section (4) further stipulates that no transfer shall be declared void or such transferee be liable for eviction after expiry of 12 years from the date of his coming into possession of the holder.Therefore, it is quite evident that a transfer without permission of the competent authority under the proviso to Section 12(1)(b) of the Act does not ipso facto become void unless and until it is so declared in an appropriate proceeding initiated under sub-section (4) of Section 12. In other words, it means that the sale shall continue to be valid unless it is declared void in an appropriate proceeding.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

The OLR Act's Sub-Section(1) of Section 22 expressly states that any transfer of a holding, in whole or in part, by a S.C. or S.T. to a non-S.C. or non-S.T. is null and void, effectively rendering the sale null and void from the beginning.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,A person may file for divorce or judicial separation under Section 13 of the Act if they are \"incurably of unsound mind\" or suffer from a \"mental disorder of such a kind and to such an extent that the petitioner cannot reasonably be expected to live with the respondent,\" either continuously or sporadically.The Guardians and Wards Act 1890 gives the family court the authority to decide child custody matters, however these decisions frequently clash with individual state legislation. Thus, in order to preserve equilibrium, the court consistently prioritizes the child's best interests and welfare over the parent's. This suggests that the child should live with the parent who can secure his financial interests, a solid education, and a good upbringing. Since the mother is typically regarded as the kid's natural guardian, she frequently receives custody, particularly when the child is younger. However, the father or any appropriate guardian may receive custody if the mother is determined to be unfit or incapable of giving the child the care and protection that the child needs.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Gift Deed while transfer is in progress",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In Karnataka, the sub-registrar office is usually where a gift deed is registered. It's important to remember, though, that a property's khata, or revenue record, is an important factor in real estate deals. A khata transfer that is ongoing or incomplete could have an impact on the registration procedure. A gift deed can be prepared ahead of time and stored in a ready state. The real registration, though, might have to wait till the khata transfer is finished. It is vital to adhere to the correct legal processes as the unregistered gift deed might not possess legal validity. In general, an unregistered gift deed might not be enforceable or have any legal standing. Consequently, in order to guarantee the legitimacy and legality of the transaction, it is advised to finish the registration process.

    "question": "Settlement deed done and registered on 1-Jun-2010. Same got cancelled and registered on 20-Jun-2010",
    "answer": "Dear client,In Indian law, the cancellation of a settlement deed needs to be legally valid and should be done in accordance with the law. If the settlement deed cancellation by the father was executed properly, it might be considered legally valid. However, the lack of a reason mentioned for the cancellation might raise questions. The subsequent actions, such as the transfer of property and sale by the son after the cancellation of the settlement deed, could also be subject to scrutiny. If the properties were sold based on the canceled settlement deed and there are subsequent buyers (like yourself) involved, the legality of these transactions may be affected if the cancellation of the settlement deed is found to be invalid or illegal.Regarding your situation as the fourth buyer of one of the properties, the Sub-Registrar's requirement for a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from all successors of the father indicates that they want confirmation from all individuals who could potentially claim rights or interests in the property.To resolve this matter, you might need to:1. Confirm the legality of the settlement deed cancellation with a lawyer.2. Check if the subsequent transactions, including the transfer of property and sale, were conducted legally and if the cancellation affected their validity.3. Obtain the necessary NOCs or take legal action to address any disputes over the property.Your chances of getting a positive order from the court would depend on various factors, including the validity of the cancellation, the subsequent transactions, and any legal claims made by other successors or stakeholders in the property.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Obtaining NOCs from the majority of legal heirs may be sufficient for certain transactions. Every legal heir normally owns a portion of the property, and any legal transactions involving the property frequently need their approval.  Clear title transfer to the buyer may be complicated if one legal heir fails to produce a NOC. The legal heir who is not providing the NOC may have rights to challenge the transaction or claim their share in the property at a later date. If you have obtained NOCs from the majority of legal heirs, you might be able to proceed with the sale of the property you obtained from them. However, the property with the non-consenting heir's share may be challenging to sell without their cooperation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Gift Deed while transfer is in progress",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In Karnataka, the sub-registrar office is usually where a gift deed is registered. It's important to remember, though, that a property's khata, or revenue record, is an important factor in real estate deals. A khata transfer that is ongoing or incomplete could have an impact on the registration procedure. A gift deed can be prepared ahead of time and stored in a ready state. The real registration, though, might have to wait till the khata transfer is finished. It is vital to adhere to the correct legal processes as the unregistered gift deed might not possess legal validity. In general, an unregistered gift deed might not be enforceable or have any legal standing. Consequently, in order to guarantee the legitimacy and legality of the transaction, it is advised to finish the registration process. If the sister wishes to ensure that the brother becomes the absolute owner regardless of the khata transfer status, a will can be an option.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Thus, in order to preserve equilibrium, the court consistently prioritizes the child's best interests and welfare over the parent's. This suggests that the child should live with the parent who can secure his financial interests, a solid education, and a good upbringing. Since the mother is typically regarded as the kid's natural guardian, she frequently receives custody, particularly when the child is younger. However, the father or any appropriate guardian may receive custody if the mother is determined to be unfit or incapable of giving the child the care and protection that the child needs.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Section 22 of the OLR Actrequires permission of the competent revenue authority for transfer of any land belonging to S.C. or S.T. in favour of a person not belonging to such S.C. or S.T.Sub-Section(1) of Section 22 of OLR.Act explicitly makes a declaration that any transfer of a holding or part thereof by a S.C. or S.T. to a non-S.C. or non-S.T. shall be void, meaning thereby that the sale shall be invalid ab initio.However, in Section 12 of the C.P. Tenancy (Orissa Amendment) Act there is no such provision that the sale in contravention of the proviso to Section 12(1)(b) shall be void. The consequence of a transfer in violation of the proviso as aforesaid is envisaged under Sub-section (4) of Section 12, which is to the effect that in a proceeding initiated before the Deputy Commissioner either suo motu or an application of a transferee or his successor-in-interest, the sale can be declared void.The proviso to sub-section (4) further stipulates that no transfer shall be declared void or such transferee be liable for eviction after expiry of 12 years from the date of his coming into possession of the holder.Therefore, it is quite evident that a transfer without permission of the competent authority under the proviso to Section 12(1)(b) of the Act does not ipso facto become void unless and until it is so declared in an appropriate proceeding initiated under sub-section (4) of Section 12. In other words, it means that the sale shall continue to be valid unless it is declared void in an appropriate proceeding.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Section 22(5) of the Orissa Land Reforms Act, 1960 states that “Where any raiyat or tenant surrenders or abandons his holding or any part thereof without the previous approval of the Revenue Officer and the holding or part thereof so surrendered or abandoned is taken possession of by the landlord, then, it shall be competent for the Revenue Officer (after giving to the landlord an opportunity of being heard) to impose on the landlord a penalty of an amount not exceeding two hundred rupees per acre of the land so surrendered or abandoned for each year or any part thereof during which the possession is continued”.According to Section 22 of the OLR Act, any land transfer in favor of a person who is not a member of a S.C. or S.T. requires approval from the relevant revenue body. The OLR Act's Sub-Section(1) of Section 22 expressly states that any transfer of a holding, in whole or in part, by a S.C. or S.T. to a non-S.C. or non-S.T. is null and void, effectively rendering the sale null and void from the beginning.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Generally speaking, you could want authorization from the trial court in order to go overseas while you are being prosecuted for a crime. It is best to return to the trial court and request permission to travel.Permission to travel may not always be granted by the trial court in a timely manner. It relies on a number of things, such as the volume of cases and the workings of the court.You might look into alternate conflict resolution procedures like mediation or arbitration if the opposing party isn't open to negotiating.The particulars of your case and the court's discretion may determine the amount of bail that is necessary, if any.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can X write a will saying property should go to Y and then on the death of Y to go to Z?",
    "answer": "Sadhu Singh v. Gurdwara Sahib Narike And OthersSupreme Court Of IndiaSep 8, 2006An owner ofpropertyhas normally the right to deal with thatpropertyincluding the right to devise or bequeath theproperty. He could thus dispose it of by a testament. Section 30 of the Act, not only does not curtail or affect this right, it actually reaffirms that right. Thus, a Hindu male could testamentarily dispose of hisproperty. When he does that, a succession under the Act stands excluded and thepropertypasses to the testamentary heirs. Hence, when a male Hindu executes a will bequeathing the properties, the legatees take it subject to the terms of the will unless of course, any stipulation therein is found invalid. Therefore, there is nothing in the Act which affects the right of a male Hindu to dispose of hispropertyby providing only alifeestateor limitedestatefor his widow. The Act does not stand in the way of his separate properties being dealt with by him as he deems fit. His will hence could not be challenged as being hit by the Act.14. When he thus validly disposes of hispropertyby providing for a limitedestateto his heir, the wife, the wife or widow has to take it as theestatefalls. This restriction on her right so provided, is really respected by the Act. It provides inSection 14(2)of the Act, that in such a case, the widow is bound by the limitation on her right and she cannot claim any higher right by invoking Section 14(1) of the Act.Thus the first attempt must be to reconcile all the clauses in the will and give effect to all of them. When we make that attempt in the context of what this Court had indicated in the decision quoted above, we find that the apparent absoluteestategiven to his wife by the testator is sought to be cut down by the stipulations that thepropertymust go to his nephews after the death of the wife, that the wife cannot testamentarily dispose of thepropertyin favour of anyone else and the further interdict in the note that the wife during her lifetime would not be entitled to mortgage or sell the properties. Thus on reconciling the various clauses in the will and the destination for the properties that the testator had in mind, we have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the apparent absoluteestatein favour of Isher Kaur has to be cut down to alifeestateso as to accommodate theestateconferred on the nephews.Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the Indian judiciary is also endowed with the inherent authority to set aside a judgement or order that was gained by fraudulent means in court. Recall requests of orders are typically only maintainable under certain circumstances, such as where the order is without jurisdiction and the party against whom the order was issued has not received notice of the recall proceedings. Courts may review and recall their own rulings as part of their inherent authority under the Civil Procedure Code (CPC). This is why the scope of recall and review has been determined time and time again by the Honourable Supreme Court. The Supreme Court's ruling in the case of Asit Kumar Kar v. State of West Bengal & Ors may be relied upon in this regard. The court stated that in the case of a recall petition, \"the court does not go into merit but simply recalls the order which was passed without giving due opportunity of hearing to the affected party,\" and in the case of a review petition, the court considers \"the merit that the judgement has an error apparent on the face of the record.\"Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Unregistered documents",
    "answer": "Dear Client,A partition suit is a legal process that divides property among co-owners. In India, the partition of property is governed by theHindu Succession Act, 1956, and the Indian Partition Act, 1893. Any or all of the co-owners of a property can file a partition suit. The co-owners can be legal heirs also if it is a family property. Anyone having a share in the property which is intended to be partitioned can file the suit. In a recent ruling, the  Supreme Court ruled that each interested person is considered a plaintiff in a lawsuit seeking the division of joint property. This implies that no co-sharer may restrict another co-sharer from bringing a partition suit; rather, each co-sharer has the right to start and prosecute one. The Supreme Court is the last court to be approached if the decisions of all lower courts, including the Taluk, District, and High courts, are not to one's satisfaction. As for the fees involved, it can vary, and it's advisable to consult with a legal professionalAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This can frequently assist in providing objectivity and oversight for your issues because your line manager or the concerned personnel might have to provide an explanation for their choice. Make sure you have a complete record of all the problems you've had, including pictures of any poor-quality work, emails you've had with Asian Paints, and any proof of the calibre of the materials used. Examine the contract you signed with Asian Paints carefully to make sure you understand your rights and responsibilities, as well as any provisions pertaining to warranties, guarantees, or dispute resolution. If you're not happy with Asian Paints' response, you might want to try hiring a third-party expert to review the work done and provide you a fair evaluation of the painting job's quality and thoroughness. You might need to look into your legal options if Asian Paints won't listen to you or offer a satisfactory settlement. Some of these include registering a complaint with consumer protection organizations, going through mediation or arbitration, or bringing a lawsuit for negligence or contract breach. You can bargain for a lower total cost if Asian Paints agrees to redo some of the house in order to make up for the inconvenience and possible loss of revenue from having to take more time off work.

    "question": "Payment in lieu of notice period",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Try to reach a mutually agreeable agreement with your present employment. If it's not clearly mentioned in the contract, ask them to explain the precise grounds for their refusal to take payment in lieu of notice. It seems that the extract you have provided does not indicate that you are misreading the contract. It lays out exactly how payments can be made in lieu of notice. Keep reaching out to your employer, stressing that you are willing to abide by the terms stated in the contract. Legal timetables might change depending on the court's availability, the jurisdiction, and the case's complexity. In the worst-case situation, your employer may file a lawsuit for breach of contract if you turn in office supplies and fail to show up for work after a set date. They might take legal action to recover damages you might have caused them by not giving them enough warning. Additionally, if you fail to adhere to your notice period duties, the corporation may withhold your relieving letter in certain circumstances. If you begin working for another company without giving notice, you may face legal repercussions, including accusations of breach of contract from your existing employer.

    "answer": "Inform the beneficiary bank.The sender can visit the receiver's bank branch, inform them, and give a written request to return the amount, showing proof that the money was transferred mistakenly to the beneficiary(screenshot of the transaction, bank account details, etc.).According to RBI, “Responsibility to provide correct inputs in the payment instructions, particularly the beneficiary account number information, rests with the remitter/originator. While the beneficiary’s name shall be compulsorily mentioned in the instruction request, and carried as part of the funds transfer message, reliance will be only on the account number for the purpose of affording credit. This is applicable both for transaction requests emanating at branches and those originated through the online/ internet delivery channel. The name field in the message formats will, however, be a parameter to be used by the destination bank based on risk perception and/or use for post-credit checking or otherwise.”If you have transferred the amount to the wrong account and the account details are invalid, your money will automatically return to your accountSo, if you accidentally transfer money to the wrong bank account, you can request a reimbursement from your bank by informing them of the RBI guideline from October 2010.

    "answer": "Dear Client,According to the Bank of Baroda website, “The first thing you need to do in case of an incorrect money transfer is to inform the bank. You can do this by quickly calling up the customer care number and providing them with all the details of the transaction. They will provide you with a request or complaint number. If the bank does not respond verbally, submit a written complaint to the bank's branch where you hold the account. Clearly state the details of the incorrect transaction and the steps you have taken to rectify the mistake. If the bank still does not address your issue, you can approach the Banking Ombudsman, an independent authority established by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to resolve banking-related complaints. Visit the RBI's official website to find the contact details and the procedure for filing a complaint with the Banking Ombudsman. If the issue persists, you can file a complaint with the consumer court. Ensure that you have all relevant documents, such as transaction details, communication with the bank, and proof of your efforts to resolve the matter. If you have evidence that the recipient is not cooperating in returning the funds, you may need to consider legal action against the individual. where the wrong recipient is unresponsive or unwilling to return the funds, your bank generally reverts with a 'recovery unsuccessful’ message. At this point, your next plausible step would be legal recourse.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If your grandfather acquired the property, it may be classified as self-acquired property. Even If the property was distributed among your father and his two brothers, it may still not be considered ancestral property unless it was specifically designated as such where this property is Self –Acquired property. If, in accordance with theHindu Succession Actof 1956, a grandfather's self-acquired property has been assigned to his father in a family partition in his role as a legal heir and not as a coparcener, the grandchild has no birthright in it. The property may be given to whoever the grandfather desires. The gift that your father made to you is now solely your  property if the transaction was legal, full, and valid.

(It guarantees every person the right to consult and be defended by any legal practitioner of their choice.)A litigant must be free to change their advocate in case they are not able to pay the fees.party to a litigation has an absolute right to appoint an advocate of his choice, to terminate his services, and to appoint a new advocate. Hence, a party cannot be compelled to obtain 'no objection' from the advocate already on record. Insisting for 'no objection' from the previous advocate will amount to putting a restriction on the right of a party to appoint an advocate of his choice.Recently Karnataka high court has observed and held that .if the Advocate feels that he has any genuine claim or grievance against his client, the appropriate course is to return the brief with endorsement of no objection and agitate such right in an appropriate forum, in accordance with law and not indulge in arm twisting methods by holding on to the brief.\"It was  also held that :There is nothing known as irrevocable vakalatnama. The right of a party to withdraw vakalatnama or authorization given to an advocate is absolute. Hence, a party may discharge his advocate any time, with or without cause by withdrawing his vakalatnama or authorization. On discharging the advocate, the party has the right to have the case file returned to him from the advocate, and any refusal by the advocate to return the fileamounts to misconduct under Section 35 of the Advocates Act, 1961. In any proceeding, including civil and criminal, a party has an absolute right to appoint a new Advocate. Under no circumstance, a party can be denied of his right to appoint a new advocate of his choice. Therefore, it follows that any rule or law imposing restriction on the said right can't be construed as mandatory. Accordingly, Courts, Tribunals or otherauthorities shall not ask for 'no objection' of the advocate already on record, to accept the vakalatnama filed by a new advocate.under no circumstance, a party can be denied of his right to appoint a new advocate of his choice hence you can proceed through a new advocate.You can demand at least half of the huge fee paid by you, if he or she is refusing you may give a complaint against the advocate in the bar council of Karnataka.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Refund of fees and NOC from advocate",
    "answer": "Dear client,If your lawyer has not acted according to your expectations, you have the right to seek a change of lawyer. The NOC is not a necessary document to change your lawyer. You can change your lawyer at any point in time by giving a written notice to your existing lawyer. However, it is advisable to obtain a NOC from the lawyer to avoid any future disputes.Regarding the refund of fees, you should first check the terms of the agreement that you signed with the lawyer. If the agreement provides for a refund of fees in case the lawyer fails to perform his duties, then you can demand a refund of fees. If there is no such clause in the agreement, you can negotiate with the lawyer and try to settle the matter amicably. If the lawyer still refuses to refund your fees, you can file a complaint with the Bar Council of Karnataka.It is important to note that the delay in correcting the scrutiny defects by your lawyer could have affected the outcome of your case. Therefore, it is important to find a good and reliable lawyer who can handle your case efficiently. You can search for a lawyer in Karnataka who specializes in criminal law and has a good track record. You can also seek recommendations from your friends and family members who have had similar legal issues.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "It's good that you have received the NOC from your previous advocate. With regards to the trial court asking for the bond and sureties again, it is possible that they require a fresh bond and sureties as the previous ones were furnished at the police station and may not be valid for the trial court proceedings.As for finding sureties, you may try reaching out to friends or family members who reside in Bangalore and who may be willing to stand as sureties for you. Alternatively, you may also try contacting a bail bondsman or surety agency in Bangalore to help you with this.If you are unable to find sureties in Bangalore or are facing difficulty in arranging for them, you may also request the court for an exemption from the requirement of sureties or ask for a relaxation in the amount of bond and sureties required. However, it is important to note that such exemptions or relaxations are subject to the discretion of the court and may not always be granted.In case you decide to bring sureties from Gujarat, you may have to request the court for permission to do so and provide valid reasons for the same. The court may also require additional documents and information to verify the identity and credibility of the sureties.It is advisable to consult with your lawyer and follow their advice on how best to proceed in this matter.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Such a suit is intended to get a formal legal ruling or determination from a court concerning a specific matter or query.

    "answer": "Dear Client,You might choose to bring up the issue with a higher-ranking official if you have voiced your concerns to your line manager or an equivalent and they have either disregarded you or denied any misconduct. This can frequently assist in providing objectivity and oversight for your issues because your line manager or the concerned personnel might have to provide an explanation for their choice. Make sure you have a complete record of all the problems you've had, including pictures of any poor-quality work, emails you've had with Asian Paints, and any proof of the calibre of the materials used. Examine the contract you signed with Asian Paints carefully to make sure you understand your rights and responsibilities, as well as any provisions pertaining to warranties, guarantees, or dispute resolution. If you're not happy with Asian Paints' response, you might want to try hiring a third-party expert to review the work done and provide you a fair evaluation of the painting job's quality and thoroughness. You might need to look into your legal options if Asian Paints won't listen to you or offer a satisfactory settlement. Some of these include registering a complaint with consumer protection organizations, going through mediation or arbitration, or bringing a lawsuit for negligence or contract breach. You can bargain for a lower total cost if Asian Paints agrees to redo some of the house in order to make up for the inconvenience and possible loss of revenue from having to take more time off work. Ensure that any agreement is recorded in writing.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If, in accordance with theHindu Succession Actof 1956, a grandfather's self-acquired property has been assigned to his father in a family partition in his role as a legal heir and not as a coparcener, the grandchild has no birthright in it. The property may be given to whoever the grandfather desires. The gift that your father made to you is now solely your  property if the transaction was legal, full, and valid.

    "question": "Can X write a will saying property should go to Y and then on the death of Y to go to Z?",
    "answer": "Sadhu Singh v. Gurdwara Sahib Narike And OthersSupreme Court Of IndiaSep 8, 2006An owner ofpropertyhas normally the right to deal with thatpropertyincluding the right to devise or bequeath theproperty. He could thus dispose it of by a testament. Section 30 of the Act, not only does not curtail or affect this right, it actually reaffirms that right. Thus, a Hindu male could testamentarily dispose of hisproperty. When he does that, a succession under the Act stands excluded and thepropertypasses to the testamentary heirs. Hence, when a male Hindu executes a will bequeathing the properties, the legatees take it subject to the terms of the will unless of course, any stipulation therein is found invalid. Therefore, there is nothing in the Act which affects the right of a male Hindu to dispose of hispropertyby providing only alifeestateor limitedestatefor his widow. The Act does not stand in the way of his separate properties being dealt with by him as he deems fit. His will hence could not be challenged as being hit by the Act.14. When he thus validly disposes of hispropertyby providing for a limitedestateto his heir, the wife, the wife or widow has to take it as theestatefalls. This restriction on her right so provided, is really respected by the Act. It provides inSection 14(2)of the Act, that in such a case, the widow is bound by the limitation on her right and she cannot claim any higher right by invoking Section 14(1) of the Act.Thus the first attempt must be to reconcile all the clauses in the will and give effect to all of them. When we make that attempt in the context of what this Court had indicated in the decision quoted above, we find that the apparent absoluteestategiven to his wife by the testator is sought to be cut down by the stipulations that thepropertymust go to his nephews after the death of the wife, that the wife cannot testamentarily dispose of thepropertyin favour of anyone else and the further interdict in the note that the wife during her lifetime would not be entitled to mortgage or sell the properties. Thus on reconciling the various clauses in the will and the destination for the properties that the testator had in mind, we have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the apparent absoluteestatein favour of Isher Kaur has to be cut down to alifeestateso as to accommodate theestateconferred on the nephews.Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "question": "Unregistered documents",
    "answer": "Dear Client,A partition suit is a legal process that divides property among co-owners. In India, the partition of property is governed by theHindu Succession Act, 1956, and the Indian Partition Act, 1893. Any or all of the co-owners of a property can file a partition suit. The co-owners can be legal heirs also if it is a family property. Anyone having a share in the property which is intended to be partitioned can file the suit. In a recent ruling, the  Supreme Court ruled that each interested person is considered a plaintiff in a lawsuit seeking the division of joint property. This implies that no co-sharer may restrict another co-sharer from bringing a partition suit; rather, each co-sharer has the right to start and prosecute one. The Supreme Court is the last court to be approached if the decisions of all lower courts, including the Taluk, District, and High courts, are not to one's satisfaction. As for the fees involved, it can vary, and it's advisable to consult with a legal professionalAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Adverse possession- what is meant by a blood relative",
    "answer": "Dear Client,According to the doctrine of adverse possession, a person acquires legal ownership of land after holding it without interruption for more than 12 years, regardless of who else owns the property. A person who held property but subsequently abandoned it without taking any action is seen as having forfeited their claim to the land or property. In the case of Ravindra Kaur Grewal v. Manjeet Kaur (2019), it had been held by the Court that the person who has the possession of any immovable property for more than 12 years has the right to acquire its ownership. The Karnataka Board of Wakf v. Government of India (2004) case established a precedent wherein an individual who claims ownership of property held by another takes possession of it. Despite this, ownership is transferred to the possessor right away if the landlord with legitimate ownership doesn't pursue legal action for a period of 12 years or more. The guidelines established in this instance support the adverse possession theory even moreAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This can frequently assist in providing objectivity and oversight for your issues because your line manager or the concerned personnel might have to provide an explanation for their choice. Make sure you have a complete record of all the problems you've had, including pictures of any poor-quality work, emails you've had with Asian Paints, and any proof of the calibre of the materials used. Examine the contract you signed with Asian Paints carefully to make sure you understand your rights and responsibilities, as well as any provisions pertaining to warranties, guarantees, or dispute resolution. If you're not happy with Asian Paints' response, you might want to try hiring a third-party expert to review the work done and provide you a fair evaluation of the painting job's quality and thoroughness. You might need to look into your legal options if Asian Paints won't listen to you or offer a satisfactory settlement. Some of these include registering a complaint with consumer protection organizations, going through mediation or arbitration, or bringing a lawsuit for negligence or contract breach. You can bargain for a lower total cost if Asian Paints agrees to redo some of the house in order to make up for the inconvenience and possible loss of revenue from having to take more time off work.

Gather any evidence that supports your claim of being present on the two hearing dates where the court marked you as absent.

    "answer": "Dear Client,An individual may file an application in a Canadian province where they have been \"habitually resident\" for a minimum of one year before to the start of the divorce proceedings, as per the Divorce Act of Canada. This is true independent of the location of the other spouse's residence or the place of marriage. The Canadian Court issues an ex-parte divorce certificate. A marriage that is solemnized in India must be dissolved in India, according Indian law. Such documents can only be attested by the Consulate if both parties are citizens of Canada. According to Indian law, a divorce granted by a foreign court in front of both parties is enforceable in India. It indicates that a divorce granted based on a joint petition filed by both parties and on amicable reasons is lawful in India.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Unregistered documents",
    "answer": "Dear Client,A partition suit is a legal process that divides property among co-owners. In India, the partition of property is governed by theHindu Succession Act, 1956, and the Indian Partition Act, 1893. Any or all of the co-owners of a property can file a partition suit. The co-owners can be legal heirs also if it is a family property. Anyone having a share in the property which is intended to be partitioned can file the suit. In a recent ruling, the  Supreme Court ruled that each interested person is considered a plaintiff in a lawsuit seeking the division of joint property. This implies that no co-sharer may restrict another co-sharer from bringing a partition suit; rather, each co-sharer has the right to start and prosecute one. The Supreme Court is the last court to be approached if the decisions of all lower courts, including the Taluk, District, and High courts, are not to one's satisfaction. As for the fees involved, it can vary, and it's advisable to consult with a legal professionalAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear clientFor Mr. A:Regardless of any contempt of court issues, the bank may still pursue legal action under the Negotiable Instruments Act (NI Act) if Mr. A's checks bounce. Additionally, Mr. A may file a case for contempt of court against the bank for violating the Supreme Court order, as long as he does so within the applicable statute of limitations. The statute of limitations for bringing a contempt of court lawsuit varies based on the particulars and the relevant jurisdiction. Mr. A should speak with an attorney to find out when the statute of limitations will apply to his case. The bank may still take legal action under the NI Act for the returned checks, but the exact statute of limitations would rely on the nature of the loan agreement and the applicable legislation in the particular jurisdiction.For Mr. B:Yes, in the event that Mr. B's checks bounce, the bank may file a lawsuit under the NI Act, just like in Mr. A's case. Yes, if Mr. B files a lawsuit for contempt of court within the relevant statute of limitations, the bank will be held liable for disobeying the Supreme Court's ruling. Regardless of any potential contempt of court difficulties, both Mr. A and Mr. B are still legally required to repay the loan in accordance with the terms of their agreements with the bank.

    "question": "Can my father write WILL on Partitioned/inherited agricultural land in Karnataka",
    "answer": "Dear Client,An undivided property that belongs to four generations of a single family is known as an ancestral property. An ancestral property would cease to be an ancestral property once it was divided among the stakeholders and became a self-acquired property. The ancestral character of a property that has been divided or partitioned through a partition deed, family arrangement, etc., is lost. The condition for an ancestral property to be considered valid is that it should never have been split up or partitioned by family members. This is because each coparcener's share of the divided ancestral property becomes their own property. Following division, a coparcener's share of the ancestral property that remains after partition belongs to his male offspring. The Supreme Court held in this case as well that \"if an ancestral property is divided and is held by a single person, it must be treated as separate property. This person is then entitled to dispose of the coparcenary property, treating it as his separate property, but the alienation made prior to the birth cannot be questioned if a son is subsequently born.\" However, the property turns into a coparcenary asset the moment a son is born, and he will then gain a stake in it and become a coparcener. An ancestral property no longer qualifies as such once it has been divided among the family members. It is up to a father whether or not to leave his son his own property. This, however, does not apply to ancestral properties.With respect to ancestral property, the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 grants daughters the position of coparcener, granting them equal rights with their son. Before the 1956 modification, only male family members were coparceners, the originalHindu Succession Act's Section 6 had not mentioned a daughter's claim in a coparcenary property.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In theCriminal Procedure Codeof 1973, Section 173(8), came to be introduced, which statutorily accoutered the police to undertake further investigation after submission of the final report under Section 173(2) of the Cr.P.C. Conspicuously, it still did not confer such powers on the Magistrate to direct further and/or fresh investigation after submission of the final report by the Police. The police or prosecuting authorities may have the ability to request the court to stay proceedings temporarily. This is often done to allow for further investigation or to address issues that may affect the case and, if the police are unable to gather sufficient evidence to proceed with the case, they may submit a discharge application. This is a request to the court to discharge the accused, effectively ending the legal proceedings against them. The grounds for discharge may include the lack of evidence, new facts emerging, or a determination that the alleged actions do not constitute a criminal offense. The court will evaluate the discharge application and may grant it if it finds that there is insufficient evidence to proceed or if there are other valid reasons.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Inform the beneficiary bank.The sender can visit the receiver's bank branch, inform them, and give a written request to return the amount, showing proof that the money was transferred mistakenly to the beneficiary(screenshot of the transaction, bank account details, etc.).According to RBI, “Responsibility to provide correct inputs in the payment instructions, particularly the beneficiary account number information, rests with the remitter/originator. While the beneficiary’s name shall be compulsorily mentioned in the instruction request, and carried as part of the funds transfer message, reliance will be only on the account number for the purpose of affording credit. This is applicable both for transaction requests emanating at branches and those originated through the online/ internet delivery channel. The name field in the message formats will, however, be a parameter to be used by the destination bank based on risk perception and/or use for post-credit checking or otherwise.”If you have transferred the amount to the wrong account and the account details are invalid, your money will automatically return to your accountSo, if you accidentally transfer money to the wrong bank account, you can request a reimbursement from your bank by informing them of the RBI guideline from October 2010.

    "answer": "Dear Client,According to the Bank of Baroda website, “The first thing you need to do in case of an incorrect money transfer is to inform the bank. You can do this by quickly calling up the customer care number and providing them with all the details of the transaction. They will provide you with a request or complaint number. If the bank does not respond verbally, submit a written complaint to the bank's branch where you hold the account. Clearly state the details of the incorrect transaction and the steps you have taken to rectify the mistake. If the bank still does not address your issue, you can approach the Banking Ombudsman, an independent authority established by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to resolve banking-related complaints. Visit the RBI's official website to find the contact details and the procedure for filing a complaint with the Banking Ombudsman. If the issue persists, you can file a complaint with the consumer court. Ensure that you have all relevant documents, such as transaction details, communication with the bank, and proof of your efforts to resolve the matter. If you have evidence that the recipient is not cooperating in returning the funds, you may need to consider legal action against the individual. where the wrong recipient is unresponsive or unwilling to return the funds, your bank generally reverts with a 'recovery unsuccessful’ message. At this point, your next plausible step would be legal recourse.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can X write a will saying property should go to Y and then on the death of Y to go to Z?",
    "answer": "Sadhu Singh v. Gurdwara Sahib Narike And OthersSupreme Court Of IndiaSep 8, 2006An owner ofpropertyhas normally the right to deal with thatpropertyincluding the right to devise or bequeath theproperty. He could thus dispose it of by a testament. Section 30 of the Act, not only does not curtail or affect this right, it actually reaffirms that right. Thus, a Hindu male could testamentarily dispose of hisproperty. When he does that, a succession under the Act stands excluded and thepropertypasses to the testamentary heirs. Hence, when a male Hindu executes a will bequeathing the properties, the legatees take it subject to the terms of the will unless of course, any stipulation therein is found invalid. Therefore, there is nothing in the Act which affects the right of a male Hindu to dispose of hispropertyby providing only alifeestateor limitedestatefor his widow. The Act does not stand in the way of his separate properties being dealt with by him as he deems fit. His will hence could not be challenged as being hit by the Act.14. When he thus validly disposes of hispropertyby providing for a limitedestateto his heir, the wife, the wife or widow has to take it as theestatefalls. This restriction on her right so provided, is really respected by the Act. It provides inSection 14(2)of the Act, that in such a case, the widow is bound by the limitation on her right and she cannot claim any higher right by invoking Section 14(1) of the Act.Thus the first attempt must be to reconcile all the clauses in the will and give effect to all of them. When we make that attempt in the context of what this Court had indicated in the decision quoted above, we find that the apparent absoluteestategiven to his wife by the testator is sought to be cut down by the stipulations that thepropertymust go to his nephews after the death of the wife, that the wife cannot testamentarily dispose of thepropertyin favour of anyone else and the further interdict in the note that the wife during her lifetime would not be entitled to mortgage or sell the properties. Thus on reconciling the various clauses in the will and the destination for the properties that the testator had in mind, we have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the apparent absoluteestatein favour of Isher Kaur has to be cut down to alifeestateso as to accommodate theestateconferred on the nephews.Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

Accordingly using any Using offensive language, physical aggression, refusal to cooperate with lawful orders, or any actions that hinder the police in carrying out their duties could be considered misbehavior. But in your case Both points mentioned may not necessarily amount to misbehavior. Police officers generally have the authority to detain individuals for questioning if they believe a crime has been committed. However, the use of force should be proportionate, and individuals have the right to know the reasons for their detention. And Petty cases are usually filed for minor offenses. Any behavior that violates local laws or regulations, even if it's a minor offense, could lead to the filing of a petty case. In this case where the conduct of police officer is found inappropriate you can go to a Police Station to Complain Against a Police Officer and always take a lawyer with you.

    "question": "Can X write a will saying property should go to Y and then on the death of Y to go to Z?",
    "answer": "Sadhu Singh v. Gurdwara Sahib Narike And OthersSupreme Court Of IndiaSep 8, 2006An owner ofpropertyhas normally the right to deal with thatpropertyincluding the right to devise or bequeath theproperty. He could thus dispose it of by a testament. Section 30 of the Act, not only does not curtail or affect this right, it actually reaffirms that right. Thus, a Hindu male could testamentarily dispose of hisproperty. When he does that, a succession under the Act stands excluded and thepropertypasses to the testamentary heirs. Hence, when a male Hindu executes a will bequeathing the properties, the legatees take it subject to the terms of the will unless of course, any stipulation therein is found invalid. Therefore, there is nothing in the Act which affects the right of a male Hindu to dispose of hispropertyby providing only alifeestateor limitedestatefor his widow. The Act does not stand in the way of his separate properties being dealt with by him as he deems fit. His will hence could not be challenged as being hit by the Act.14. When he thus validly disposes of hispropertyby providing for a limitedestateto his heir, the wife, the wife or widow has to take it as theestatefalls. This restriction on her right so provided, is really respected by the Act. It provides inSection 14(2)of the Act, that in such a case, the widow is bound by the limitation on her right and she cannot claim any higher right by invoking Section 14(1) of the Act.Thus the first attempt must be to reconcile all the clauses in the will and give effect to all of them. When we make that attempt in the context of what this Court had indicated in the decision quoted above, we find that the apparent absoluteestategiven to his wife by the testator is sought to be cut down by the stipulations that thepropertymust go to his nephews after the death of the wife, that the wife cannot testamentarily dispose of thepropertyin favour of anyone else and the further interdict in the note that the wife during her lifetime would not be entitled to mortgage or sell the properties. Thus on reconciling the various clauses in the will and the destination for the properties that the testator had in mind, we have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the apparent absoluteestatein favour of Isher Kaur has to be cut down to alifeestateso as to accommodate theestateconferred on the nephews.Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

In India, the partition of property is governed by theHindu Succession Act, 1956, and the Indian Partition Act, 1893. Any or all of the co-owners of a property can file a partition suit. The co-owners can be legal heirs also if it is a family property. Anyone having a share in the property which is intended to be partitioned can file the suit. In a recent ruling, the  Supreme Court ruled that each interested person is considered a plaintiff in a lawsuit seeking the division of joint property. This implies that no co-sharer may restrict another co-sharer from bringing a partition suit; rather, each co-sharer has the right to start and prosecute one. The Supreme Court is the last court to be approached if the decisions of all lower courts, including the Taluk, District, and High courts, are not to one's satisfaction.

    "question": "Adverse possession- what is meant by a blood relative",
    "answer": "Dear Client,According to the doctrine of adverse possession, a person acquires legal ownership of land after holding it without interruption for more than 12 years, regardless of who else owns the property. A person who held property but subsequently abandoned it without taking any action is seen as having forfeited their claim to the land or property. In the case of Ravindra Kaur Grewal v. Manjeet Kaur (2019), it had been held by the Court that the person who has the possession of any immovable property for more than 12 years has the right to acquire its ownership. The Karnataka Board of Wakf v. Government of India (2004) case established a precedent wherein an individual who claims ownership of property held by another takes possession of it. Despite this, ownership is transferred to the possessor right away if the landlord with legitimate ownership doesn't pursue legal action for a period of 12 years or more. The guidelines established in this instance support the adverse possession theory even moreAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Under Indian law, owners have a number of legal rights; These rights encompass a variety of topics, such as equitable treatment, security of tenure, deposits, rent, upkeep, repairs, and lease agreement termination. The majority of maintenance fees go towards providing security services, such as CCTV, and maintaining common areas and utilities. Elevators, a club house and generators are examples of shared amenities. The purchaser should be aware of this and ensure that developers do not inflate maintenance fees to cover overhead and administrative costs. According to this you, are on fair side of our demand related to issue-1 requesting to move their stuff and not paying the maintenance until the issue is resolved, and apartment association is responsible.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Encroachment of common area by one member cannot give right to the other members from stopping the payment towards monthly maintenance amount. There's no justification in it. You can take legal action against him but you cannot punish the association by refraining from making the monthly maintenance amount.3. The association bylaws have answer to your issues.4.

    "question": "Payment in lieu of notice period",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Try to reach a mutually agreeable agreement with your present employment. If it's not clearly mentioned in the contract, ask them to explain the precise grounds for their refusal to take payment in lieu of notice. It seems that the extract you have provided does not indicate that you are misreading the contract. It lays out exactly how payments can be made in lieu of notice. Keep reaching out to your employer, stressing that you are willing to abide by the terms stated in the contract. Legal timetables might change depending on the court's availability, the jurisdiction, and the case's complexity. In the worst-case situation, your employer may file a lawsuit for breach of contract if you turn in office supplies and fail to show up for work after a set date. They might take legal action to recover damages you might have caused them by not giving them enough warning. Additionally, if you fail to adhere to your notice period duties, the corporation may withhold your relieving letter in certain circumstances. If you begin working for another company without giving notice, you may face legal repercussions, including accusations of breach of contract from your existing employer. It can also affect your future employment opportunities and professional reputation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"
