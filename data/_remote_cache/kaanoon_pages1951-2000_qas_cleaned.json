    "question": "Leave and license agreement instead of lease agreement",
    "answer": "Dear sir,A lease creates an interest in the property unlike a leave and license agreement.     Leave and license agreement.    gives only a right to use the property in a particular way or under certain terms, while it remains in the posession and control of the owner thereof, it will be a license. Basically, no interest in the property is transferred to the tenant.  “Te legal possession, thereof, continues to be with the owner of the property but the licensee is permitted to make use of the premises for a particular purpose.  It does not create in his favour any estate or interest in the property.A lease grants a tenant with exclusive possession while a leave and licence agreement only grants permission to occupy the property.  Licences are revocable; leases are not.  Leases are transferable while licences are not. A lease creates inheritable rights unlike licences.Once there is a lease agreement there exist no use of executing a leave and licence agreement. Go for leave and licence agreement and cancel the lease agreement.  Thank youAjeesh Kalathil GopiAdvocate, New Delhi11 AnswersTalk to Advocate Ajeesh Kalathil Gopi"

    "question": "Buying property mortgaged with bank",
    "answer": "Buying a property that is mortgaged with a bank requires careful due diligence to ensure a smooth and secure transaction. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how you can proceed with such a purchase and the precautions you should take:Verify the Seller's Claims: Request the seller to provide you with all relevant documents related to the property, including the sale deed, encumbrance certificate, and documents related to the bank loan. Cross-check the details in these documents with the physical property and with the relevant government authorities.Obtain Encumbrance Certificate: Obtain an encumbrance certificate from the appropriate authority to verify if there are any existing encumbrances on the property, such as mortgages, liens, or pending legal claims. This certificate will give you a clear picture of the property's current status.Tripartite Agreement: In some cases, there might be a tripartite agreement executed between the bank, the seller, and the buyer. This agreement confirms the amount due against the property, the bank's hold on the original title documents, and the process of releasing the documents once the payment is made.Obtain No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Bank: Request the seller to obtain a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the bank, stating that they have no objection to the property being sold and that they will release the original title documents upon payment of the outstanding loan amount.Inspect Original Documents: As part of your due diligence, you or your lawyer may inspect the original title documents that are with the bank to ensure their authenticity and that they correspond to the property you are planning to buy.Verify Outstanding Loan Amount: Ensure that you are aware of the exact outstanding loan amount against the property. This will help you determine the total cost of the property, including the repayment of the loan.Register the Sale Deed: Once you have verified all the necessary documents and completed the payment process, register the sale deed at the Sub Registrar's office. The sale deed will transfer ownership of the property from the seller to you. The bank will also provide a release deed, confirming that the property is free from the mortgage.Title Search: Conduct a thorough title search with the help of a lawyer to ensure there are no pending legal disputes or claims against the property.Title Insurance: Consider obtaining title insurance to protect yourself from any unforeseen claims or disputes related to the property's title in the future.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

Basically, no interest in the property is transferred to the tenant.  “Te legal possession, thereof, continues to be with the owner of the property but the licensee is permitted to make use of the premises for a particular purpose.  It does not create in his favour any estate or interest in the property.A lease grants a tenant with exclusive possession while a leave and licence agreement only grants permission to occupy the property.  Licences are revocable; leases are not.  Leases are transferable while licences are not. A lease creates inheritable rights unlike licences.Once there is a lease agreement there exist no use of executing a leave and licence agreement.

A caveat petition serves as a precautionary step taken by individuals who hold concerns about potential legal actions that may be initiated against them. Essentially, it acts as a formal notice, ensuring that the caveator is informed before any legal action is undertaken.The primary purpose behind filing a caveat petition is to safeguard one's interests in a judgment and to apprise the court that no decision should be made without providing proper notice to the concerned party. By doing so, the caveator seeks to prevent any decisions from being taken in their absence, ensuring that they have an opportunity to be heard and participate in the legal proceedings.

    "context": "Asked 2 years ago in Civil Law",
    "question": "Can an AS (Appeal Suit) be filed even if caveat is filed?",
    "answer": "A caveat is a legal notice filed by a party with the court to inform the court that they have an interest in a particular matter, and they request to be notified before any orders or judgments are passed in that matter. The purpose of a caveat is to prevent the court from passing any orders or judgments without hearing from the party who filed the caveat.Now, let's address your specific questions:Q1: If a Caveat would have been filed & renewed upon expiry, could the other party have still registered the Appeal suit without any issue at all?Yes, even if a caveat was filed and renewed, the other party could still have registered an appeal suit. Filing a caveat does not prevent the other party from initiating an appeal. However, the caveat serves as a warning to the court that before passing any orders on an appeal or application related to the original matter, the court must give prior notice to the party who filed the caveat. This ensures that the party filing the caveat is given an opportunity to be heard before any decision is made by the court.Q2: If yes, then what is the actual purpose of a caveat & where exactly does a caveat help in such cases?As mentioned earlier, the purpose of a caveat is to prevent ex parte orders, which are orders passed without hearing from all concerned parties. By filing a caveat, a party seeks to safeguard their interests and ensure that they have the opportunity to present their side of the case before any orders are passed.In your case, if the caveat was filed, the court would have been required to inform you before passing any orders on the appeal filed by the other party. This would have given you an opportunity to respond to the appeal and present your arguments to the court, thus preventing any ex parte orders against you.Q3: If No, please elaborate on what all could/would have been saved by filing a caveat.Even though filing a caveat does not prevent the other party from initiating an appeal, it provides some benefits:Early Notice: By filing a caveat, you would have received early notice of the appeal filed by the other party. This would have given you more time to prepare and respond to the appeal effectively.Preventing Ex Parte Orders: The caveat would have ensured that the court does not pass any orders on the appeal without hearing your side of the case. This means that the court would have given you a chance to present your arguments and evidence before making any decisions.Negotiation: As you mentioned, filing a caveat could have provided an opportunity for both parties to discuss and potentially resolve the matter out of court, knowing that the court will not pass any orders without hearing from both sides.While filing a caveat does not prevent an appeal from being registered, it serves as a protective measure to ensure that you are not caught off guard by ex parte orders and that you have the opportunity to present your case effectively before the court.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

Basically, no interest in the property is transferred to the tenant.  “Te legal possession, thereof, continues to be with the owner of the property but the licensee is permitted to make use of the premises for a particular purpose.  It does not create in his favour any estate or interest in the property.A lease grants a tenant with exclusive possession while a leave and licence agreement only grants permission to occupy the property.  Licences are revocable; leases are not.  Leases are transferable while licences are not. A lease creates inheritable rights unlike licences.Once there is a lease agreement there exist no use of executing a leave and licence agreement.

    "question": "Making Building for commercial purpose by breaking the wall in the property which has a civil suit",
    "answer": ".Dear Sir,As per your query,  the land is clearly demarcated by the government survey records and boundary is marked by stone. Besides each land has two separate sale deeds.Further, as per your statement it reveals that the property in question is a self acquired property then what you mean by you have made a settlement agreement with respect to your property for your son.  What made you to make a settlement deed and that too among whom you made the settlement deed?  Once it is a self acquired property and title deed is in your name, then it is your prerogative that to whom you want to give said property?Anyway, now you say that your son is the registered owner of the land which was in your name then who stops you to do the mutation in his name?  Get the mutation done and ask him to apply to conduct survey of his registered property and get demarcate your total 25 cents for which he is paying the land tax so that the encroached area by your step daughter may be recovered by some other portion of her. Visit Tahsildar’s office and ask for an application form (it must be form No.10 ) and submit it to the respective office along with the documents required. After receiving your application, a Tehsildar will check it for further approval and all the properties around your property will be measured and demarcated for you.  In that case definitely the property of your step daughter will be more  and further the wall will have to demolished. Amicable settlement will be the efficacious remedy for both of you otherwise it will lead to prolonged civil suit.  It applicable to her also.  So proceed with your remedies so that she is compeled her for settlement.Now the question is about the approaching way? Whether the way is mentioned in the titled deed for both the properties?As per your query you are currently not staying there. If there is a gate at the entrance of your property then offload two lorry cow dung inside the compound and infront of the gate by JCB on Sunday for the time being.  Do it swiftly. who stops you.  While doing this your son should not be in the city. Do it yourself. It is your property. Rainy season is best for it. You can also adopt the same measures which she adopts. You also keep a voracious dog to avoid tress pass by anyone in your property?  For time being Don’t tell anywhere that your step daughter was using the way over a period of 30 years.Since it is a civil matter police has no role in this case.For nuisance by the dogs of your step daughter file a criminal complaint u/s 425 and 289 IPC.Install CCTV at your premises as there exist every chance that she may file false criminal case against you and your son.Further you said that the house is registered in your name and in your step daughter name? What does it mean?  Ask for your share by selling it hence it cannot be divided in metes and bounds.  Your query needs more clarification then only can answer it properly.

    "question": "Partition of property",
    "answer": "Partition of property involves dividing the property among co-owners, and it can be done amicably through a partition deed. If all stakeholders are willing to mutually agree on the partition and their respective shares, a partition deed can be executed without the need for a court case.It seems unusual that your lawyer is advising you to falsely accuse one another to initiate a dispute case for partition. This approach is not typical or ethical, and it is not the only legal way to file a case for partitioning property.Here are the steps you can consider for an amicable partition of the property:Mutual Agreement: If all the co-owners, including yourself, your sister, and your sister-in-law, are willing to partition the property amicably, you can execute a partition deed. This deed will clearly define the shares of each co-owner and the respective parts of the property allotted to them.Consult with a Mediator: If there are any disputes or disagreements among the co-owners regarding the partition, you may consider consulting with a mediator or arbitrator. A mediator can help facilitate discussions and reach an agreement without the need for litigation.Partition Suit: In the event that an amicable agreement cannot be reached, any co-owner can file a partition suit in court, requesting the court to divide the property among the co-owners as per their respective shares. However, filing a partition suit should not involve falsely accusing one another; rather, it should be based on legitimate claims and arguments.Seek Legal Advice: Given the complexities of property law and inheritance, it's essential to seek advice from a qualified property lawyer in your area, who can guide you through the legal process, ensure your rights are protected, and advise you on the most appropriate course of action based on the specifics of your case.If all stakeholders are in agreement regarding the partition of the property, executing a partition deed is a common and legally acceptable way to formalize the partition. If disputes arise, a mediator can be considered to facilitate negotiations. Resorting to false accusations or filing a baseless dispute case is not a standard or recommended legal approach for partitioning property. Seeking advice from a qualified lawyer is essential to proceed appropriately.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Partition of property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Filing a case to accuse each other is unnecessary. Instead, the legal heirs should strive to reach a mutual understanding for partitioning their deceased Father's house and land. This can be achieved by executing a Partition Deed at the jurisdictional Sub Registrar's Office, clearly specifying each individual's share of the property. The partitioning can be done either by defining precise boundaries (metes and bounds) or through amicable negotiations.To handle the partitioning process and any subsequent sale of your sister's share in the property, a Power of Attorney (POA) would suffice. However, it is crucial that the POA includes explicit clauses that clearly define the scope of authority for dealing with the partitioning and selling of the property. By following these steps, the process can be conducted smoothly and without the need for legal disputes.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the face of pressure tactics, there is no need to succumb or bow down. Stand firm and assert your rights. If someone attempts to exploit you financially, inform them that they have the freedom to file a case if they so wish. Such behavior can be seen as a form of money extortion, resembling a racket. Be cautious, as once you give in and pay, they may continue to demand more money over time. It is crucial to recognize that exchanging your body for material benefits is not an acceptable or ethical practice. If any such actions were taken, ensure they were done voluntarily and without coercion. However, it is vital to affirm that no offense has been committed and maintain a strong stance against any form of manipulation or exploitation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "The authority to request a freeze on bank accounts is reserved forregulatory bodies like the Reserve Bank of India, Securities and Exchange Board of India, income-tax officials, or courts. A bank has the right to halt operations or freeze a bank account in certain situations.Banks often follow account holders’ instructions when making payments. The functioning of a bank account, however, may occasionally be suspended or frozen if the account holder’s instructions are refused.In reality, it will take a lot of time and effort to get the account in order once it has been legitimately frozen. Now, in order to define an unlawful transaction, you must consult the applicable rules or the bank.You may issue a legal notice to the bank to unfreeze the bank account failing which you can approach court with a suit or a writ petition against the bank for this act or even can approach CBI to issue instructions to bank to make the account in order if the case has been disposed or if your father has not been implicated in the ongoing criminal caseT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88760 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

However, this will depend on various factors, including the terms of the court's interim order and any past agreements or understandings between you and your stepdaughter. Whether the court will accept a claim for rent for the last 30 years would depend on the evidence and arguments presented in court.Breaking the Wall and Construction:Given the active case and the interim order, any actions your son takes on the property should be done with careful consideration of the legal implications. Breaking the wall and constructing on his portion of the land while a case is ongoing could be seen as a violation of the interim order or potentially interfere with the ongoing dispute.

    "answer": ".Dear Sir,As per your query,  the land is clearly demarcated by the government survey records and boundary is marked by stone. Besides each land has two separate sale deeds.Further, as per your statement it reveals that the property in question is a self acquired property then what you mean by you have made a settlement agreement with respect to your property for your son.  What made you to make a settlement deed and that too among whom you made the settlement deed?  Once it is a self acquired property and title deed is in your name, then it is your prerogative that to whom you want to give said property?Anyway, now you say that your son is the registered owner of the land which was in your name then who stops you to do the mutation in his name?  Get the mutation done and ask him to apply to conduct survey of his registered property and get demarcate your total 25 cents for which he is paying the land tax so that the encroached area by your step daughter may be recovered by some other portion of her. Visit Tahsildar’s office and ask for an application form (it must be form No.10 ) and submit it to the respective office along with the documents required. After receiving your application, a Tehsildar will check it for further approval and all the properties around your property will be measured and demarcated for you.  In that case definitely the property of your step daughter will be more  and further the wall will have to demolished. Amicable settlement will be the efficacious remedy for both of you otherwise it will lead to prolonged civil suit.  It applicable to her also.  So proceed with your remedies so that she is compeled her for settlement.Now the question is about the approaching way? Whether the way is mentioned in the titled deed for both the properties?As per your query you are currently not staying there. If there is a gate at the entrance of your property then offload two lorry cow dung inside the compound and infront of the gate by JCB on Sunday for the time being.  Do it swiftly. who stops you.  While doing this your son should not be in the city. Do it yourself. It is your property. Rainy season is best for it. You can also adopt the same measures which she adopts. You also keep a voracious dog to avoid tress pass by anyone in your property?  For time being Don’t tell anywhere that your step daughter was using the way over a period of 30 years.Since it is a civil matter police has no role in this case.For nuisance by the dogs of your step daughter file a criminal complaint u/s 425 and 289 IPC.Install CCTV at your premises as there exist every chance that she may file false criminal case against you and your son.Further you said that the house is registered in your name and in your step daughter name? What does it mean?  Ask for your share by selling it hence it cannot be divided in metes and bounds.  Your query needs more clarification then only can answer it properly.

    "question": "Partition of property",
    "answer": "Partition of property involves dividing the property among co-owners, and it can be done amicably through a partition deed. If all stakeholders are willing to mutually agree on the partition and their respective shares, a partition deed can be executed without the need for a court case.It seems unusual that your lawyer is advising you to falsely accuse one another to initiate a dispute case for partition. This approach is not typical or ethical, and it is not the only legal way to file a case for partitioning property.Here are the steps you can consider for an amicable partition of the property:Mutual Agreement: If all the co-owners, including yourself, your sister, and your sister-in-law, are willing to partition the property amicably, you can execute a partition deed. This deed will clearly define the shares of each co-owner and the respective parts of the property allotted to them.Consult with a Mediator: If there are any disputes or disagreements among the co-owners regarding the partition, you may consider consulting with a mediator or arbitrator. A mediator can help facilitate discussions and reach an agreement without the need for litigation.Partition Suit: In the event that an amicable agreement cannot be reached, any co-owner can file a partition suit in court, requesting the court to divide the property among the co-owners as per their respective shares. However, filing a partition suit should not involve falsely accusing one another; rather, it should be based on legitimate claims and arguments.Seek Legal Advice: Given the complexities of property law and inheritance, it's essential to seek advice from a qualified property lawyer in your area, who can guide you through the legal process, ensure your rights are protected, and advise you on the most appropriate course of action based on the specifics of your case.If all stakeholders are in agreement regarding the partition of the property, executing a partition deed is a common and legally acceptable way to formalize the partition. If disputes arise, a mediator can be considered to facilitate negotiations. Resorting to false accusations or filing a baseless dispute case is not a standard or recommended legal approach for partitioning property. Seeking advice from a qualified lawyer is essential to proceed appropriately.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

The partitioning can be done either by defining precise boundaries (metes and bounds) or through amicable negotiations.To handle the partitioning process and any subsequent sale of your sister's share in the property, a Power of Attorney (POA) would suffice.

Servant and he is purely a private employee, and no rules and procedures like a govt. school is applied in such school.- However, if the offer letter signed by you having such restrictions , then it will applied in your case , and if not mentioned then the school cannot dictate you for the NOC , and hence you should reply to the said notice that no such restriction was mentioned in the offer letter and hence it is not mandatory to take NOC before travelling abroad.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Partition of property",
    "answer": "Partition of property involves dividing the property among co-owners, and it can be done amicably through a partition deed. If all stakeholders are willing to mutually agree on the partition and their respective shares, a partition deed can be executed without the need for a court case.It seems unusual that your lawyer is advising you to falsely accuse one another to initiate a dispute case for partition. This approach is not typical or ethical, and it is not the only legal way to file a case for partitioning property.Here are the steps you can consider for an amicable partition of the property:Mutual Agreement: If all the co-owners, including yourself, your sister, and your sister-in-law, are willing to partition the property amicably, you can execute a partition deed. This deed will clearly define the shares of each co-owner and the respective parts of the property allotted to them.Consult with a Mediator: If there are any disputes or disagreements among the co-owners regarding the partition, you may consider consulting with a mediator or arbitrator. A mediator can help facilitate discussions and reach an agreement without the need for litigation.Partition Suit: In the event that an amicable agreement cannot be reached, any co-owner can file a partition suit in court, requesting the court to divide the property among the co-owners as per their respective shares. However, filing a partition suit should not involve falsely accusing one another; rather, it should be based on legitimate claims and arguments.Seek Legal Advice: Given the complexities of property law and inheritance, it's essential to seek advice from a qualified property lawyer in your area, who can guide you through the legal process, ensure your rights are protected, and advise you on the most appropriate course of action based on the specifics of your case.If all stakeholders are in agreement regarding the partition of the property, executing a partition deed is a common and legally acceptable way to formalize the partition. If disputes arise, a mediator can be considered to facilitate negotiations. Resorting to false accusations or filing a baseless dispute case is not a standard or recommended legal approach for partitioning property. Seeking advice from a qualified lawyer is essential to proceed appropriately.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Partition of property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Filing a case to accuse each other is unnecessary. Instead, the legal heirs should strive to reach a mutual understanding for partitioning their deceased Father's house and land. This can be achieved by executing a Partition Deed at the jurisdictional Sub Registrar's Office, clearly specifying each individual's share of the property. The partitioning can be done either by defining precise boundaries (metes and bounds) or through amicable negotiations.To handle the partitioning process and any subsequent sale of your sister's share in the property, a Power of Attorney (POA) would suffice. However, it is crucial that the POA includes explicit clauses that clearly define the scope of authority for dealing with the partitioning and selling of the property. By following these steps, the process can be conducted smoothly and without the need for legal disputes.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Besides each land has two separate sale deeds.Further, as per your statement it reveals that the property in question is a self acquired property then what you mean by you have made a settlement agreement with respect to your property for your son.  What made you to make a settlement deed and that too among whom you made the settlement deed?  Once it is a self acquired property and title deed is in your name, then it is your prerogative that to whom you want to give said property?Anyway, now you say that your son is the registered owner of the land which was in your name then who stops you to do the mutation in his name?  Get the mutation done and ask him to apply to conduct survey of his registered property and get demarcate your total 25 cents for which he is paying the land tax so that the encroached area by your step daughter may be recovered by some other portion of her. Visit Tahsildar’s office and ask for an application form (it must be form No.10 ) and submit it to the respective office along with the documents required. After receiving your application, a Tehsildar will check it for further approval and all the properties around your property will be measured and demarcated for you.  In that case definitely the property of your step daughter will be more  and further the wall will have to demolished. Amicable settlement will be the efficacious remedy for both of you otherwise it will lead to prolonged civil suit.  It applicable to her also.  So proceed with your remedies so that she is compeled her for settlement.Now the question is about the approaching way? Whether the way is mentioned in the titled deed for both the properties?As per your query you are currently not staying there. If there is a gate at the entrance of your property then offload two lorry cow dung inside the compound and infront of the gate by JCB on Sunday for the time being.  Do it swiftly. who stops you.  While doing this your son should not be in the city. Do it yourself. It is your property. Rainy season is best for it. You can also adopt the same measures which she adopts. You also keep a voracious dog to avoid tress pass by anyone in your property?  For time being Don’t tell anywhere that your step daughter was using the way over a period of 30 years.Since it is a civil matter police has no role in this case.For nuisance by the dogs of your step daughter file a criminal complaint u/s 425 and 289 IPC.Install CCTV at your premises as there exist every chance that she may file false criminal case against you and your son.Further you said that the house is registered in your name and in your step daughter name? What does it mean?  Ask for your share by selling it hence it cannot be divided in metes and bounds.  Your query needs more clarification then only can answer it properly.

    "answer": "The authority to request a freeze on bank accounts is reserved forregulatory bodies like the Reserve Bank of India, Securities and Exchange Board of India, income-tax officials, or courts. A bank has the right to halt operations or freeze a bank account in certain situations.Banks often follow account holders’ instructions when making payments. The functioning of a bank account, however, may occasionally be suspended or frozen if the account holder’s instructions are refused.In reality, it will take a lot of time and effort to get the account in order once it has been legitimately frozen. Now, in order to define an unlawful transaction, you must consult the applicable rules or the bank.You may issue a legal notice to the bank to unfreeze the bank account failing which you can approach court with a suit or a writ petition against the bank for this act or even can approach CBI to issue instructions to bank to make the account in order if the case has been disposed or if your father has not been implicated in the ongoing criminal caseT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88760 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

A caveat petition serves as a precautionary step taken by individuals who hold concerns about potential legal actions that may be initiated against them. Essentially, it acts as a formal notice, ensuring that the caveator is informed before any legal action is undertaken.The primary purpose behind filing a caveat petition is to safeguard one's interests in a judgment and to apprise the court that no decision should be made without providing proper notice to the concerned party. By doing so, the caveator seeks to prevent any decisions from being taken in their absence, ensuring that they have an opportunity to be heard and participate in the legal proceedings.

    "question": "Can an AS (Appeal Suit) be filed even if caveat is filed?",
    "answer": "A caveat is a legal notice filed by a party with the court to inform the court that they have an interest in a particular matter, and they request to be notified before any orders or judgments are passed in that matter. The purpose of a caveat is to prevent the court from passing any orders or judgments without hearing from the party who filed the caveat.Now, let's address your specific questions:Q1: If a Caveat would have been filed & renewed upon expiry, could the other party have still registered the Appeal suit without any issue at all?Yes, even if a caveat was filed and renewed, the other party could still have registered an appeal suit. Filing a caveat does not prevent the other party from initiating an appeal. However, the caveat serves as a warning to the court that before passing any orders on an appeal or application related to the original matter, the court must give prior notice to the party who filed the caveat. This ensures that the party filing the caveat is given an opportunity to be heard before any decision is made by the court.Q2: If yes, then what is the actual purpose of a caveat & where exactly does a caveat help in such cases?As mentioned earlier, the purpose of a caveat is to prevent ex parte orders, which are orders passed without hearing from all concerned parties. By filing a caveat, a party seeks to safeguard their interests and ensure that they have the opportunity to present their side of the case before any orders are passed.In your case, if the caveat was filed, the court would have been required to inform you before passing any orders on the appeal filed by the other party. This would have given you an opportunity to respond to the appeal and present your arguments to the court, thus preventing any ex parte orders against you.Q3: If No, please elaborate on what all could/would have been saved by filing a caveat.Even though filing a caveat does not prevent the other party from initiating an appeal, it provides some benefits:Early Notice: By filing a caveat, you would have received early notice of the appeal filed by the other party. This would have given you more time to prepare and respond to the appeal effectively.Preventing Ex Parte Orders: The caveat would have ensured that the court does not pass any orders on the appeal without hearing your side of the case. This means that the court would have given you a chance to present your arguments and evidence before making any decisions.Negotiation: As you mentioned, filing a caveat could have provided an opportunity for both parties to discuss and potentially resolve the matter out of court, knowing that the court will not pass any orders without hearing from both sides.While filing a caveat does not prevent an appeal from being registered, it serves as a protective measure to ensure that you are not caught off guard by ex parte orders and that you have the opportunity to present your case effectively before the court.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

Now, in order to define an unlawful transaction, you must consult the applicable rules or the bank.You may issue a legal notice to the bank to unfreeze the bank account failing which you can approach court with a suit or a writ petition against the bank for this act or even can approach CBI to issue instructions to bank to make the account in order if the case has been disposed or if your father has not been implicated in the ongoing criminal caseT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88760 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The authority to seize a bank account lies with the Investigating Officer, particularly in cases involving the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The freezing of accounts should adhere strictly to the procedures outlined in theCriminal Procedure Code(Cr.P.C.); any deviation from these procedures would render the action legally unsustainable.If a request to freeze an account is initially denied by the court where the trial is ongoing, the next course of action would be to approach the High Court for further consideration.

A caveat petition serves as a precautionary step taken by individuals who hold concerns about potential legal actions that may be initiated against them. Essentially, it acts as a formal notice, ensuring that the caveator is informed before any legal action is undertaken.The primary purpose behind filing a caveat petition is to safeguard one's interests in a judgment and to apprise the court that no decision should be made without providing proper notice to the concerned party. By doing so, the caveator seeks to prevent any decisions from being taken in their absence, ensuring that they have an opportunity to be heard and participate in the legal proceedings.

    "question": "Can an AS (Appeal Suit) be filed even if caveat is filed?",
    "answer": "A caveat is a legal notice filed by a party with the court to inform the court that they have an interest in a particular matter, and they request to be notified before any orders or judgments are passed in that matter. The purpose of a caveat is to prevent the court from passing any orders or judgments without hearing from the party who filed the caveat.Now, let's address your specific questions:Q1: If a Caveat would have been filed & renewed upon expiry, could the other party have still registered the Appeal suit without any issue at all?Yes, even if a caveat was filed and renewed, the other party could still have registered an appeal suit. Filing a caveat does not prevent the other party from initiating an appeal. However, the caveat serves as a warning to the court that before passing any orders on an appeal or application related to the original matter, the court must give prior notice to the party who filed the caveat. This ensures that the party filing the caveat is given an opportunity to be heard before any decision is made by the court.Q2: If yes, then what is the actual purpose of a caveat & where exactly does a caveat help in such cases?As mentioned earlier, the purpose of a caveat is to prevent ex parte orders, which are orders passed without hearing from all concerned parties. By filing a caveat, a party seeks to safeguard their interests and ensure that they have the opportunity to present their side of the case before any orders are passed.In your case, if the caveat was filed, the court would have been required to inform you before passing any orders on the appeal filed by the other party. This would have given you an opportunity to respond to the appeal and present your arguments to the court, thus preventing any ex parte orders against you.Q3: If No, please elaborate on what all could/would have been saved by filing a caveat.Even though filing a caveat does not prevent the other party from initiating an appeal, it provides some benefits:Early Notice: By filing a caveat, you would have received early notice of the appeal filed by the other party. This would have given you more time to prepare and respond to the appeal effectively.Preventing Ex Parte Orders: The caveat would have ensured that the court does not pass any orders on the appeal without hearing your side of the case. This means that the court would have given you a chance to present your arguments and evidence before making any decisions.Negotiation: As you mentioned, filing a caveat could have provided an opportunity for both parties to discuss and potentially resolve the matter out of court, knowing that the court will not pass any orders without hearing from both sides.While filing a caveat does not prevent an appeal from being registered, it serves as a protective measure to ensure that you are not caught off guard by ex parte orders and that you have the opportunity to present your case effectively before the court.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": ".Dear Sir,As per your query,  the land is clearly demarcated by the government survey records and boundary is marked by stone. Besides each land has two separate sale deeds.Further, as per your statement it reveals that the property in question is a self acquired property then what you mean by you have made a settlement agreement with respect to your property for your son.  What made you to make a settlement deed and that too among whom you made the settlement deed?  Once it is a self acquired property and title deed is in your name, then it is your prerogative that to whom you want to give said property?Anyway, now you say that your son is the registered owner of the land which was in your name then who stops you to do the mutation in his name?  Get the mutation done and ask him to apply to conduct survey of his registered property and get demarcate your total 25 cents for which he is paying the land tax so that the encroached area by your step daughter may be recovered by some other portion of her. Visit Tahsildar’s office and ask for an application form (it must be form No.10 ) and submit it to the respective office along with the documents required. After receiving your application, a Tehsildar will check it for further approval and all the properties around your property will be measured and demarcated for you.  In that case definitely the property of your step daughter will be more  and further the wall will have to demolished. Amicable settlement will be the efficacious remedy for both of you otherwise it will lead to prolonged civil suit.  It applicable to her also.  So proceed with your remedies so that she is compeled her for settlement.Now the question is about the approaching way? Whether the way is mentioned in the titled deed for both the properties?As per your query you are currently not staying there. If there is a gate at the entrance of your property then offload two lorry cow dung inside the compound and infront of the gate by JCB on Sunday for the time being.  Do it swiftly. who stops you.  While doing this your son should not be in the city. Do it yourself. It is your property. Rainy season is best for it. You can also adopt the same measures which she adopts. You also keep a voracious dog to avoid tress pass by anyone in your property?  For time being Don’t tell anywhere that your step daughter was using the way over a period of 30 years.Since it is a civil matter police has no role in this case.For nuisance by the dogs of your step daughter file a criminal complaint u/s 425 and 289 IPC.Install CCTV at your premises as there exist every chance that she may file false criminal case against you and your son.Further you said that the house is registered in your name and in your step daughter name? What does it mean?  Ask for your share by selling it hence it cannot be divided in metes and bounds.  Your query needs more clarification then only can answer it properly.

    "answer": "Dear Client,As part of the property purchasing process, you have the right to request the seller to provide an inspection of the original documents of title to ensure the property's legitimacy and ownership details. Once you express interest in the property, the seller will approach their bank to facilitate this inspection. Additionally, the seller must obtain a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the bank, which confirms the bank's agreement to the property sale, on the condition that the proceeds from the sale will be used for the repayment of any outstanding loans on the property.In case you require financial assistance for the purchase, you have the option to approach the same bank that holds the seller's loan. By doing so, you can potentially transfer the existing loan from the seller to yourself, streamlining the process and enabling you to take advantage of the terms already established with the bank. This approach ensures a smoother transaction and provides a clearer understanding of the property's financial aspects for all parties involved.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Buying property mortgaged with bank",
    "answer": "Buying a property that is mortgaged with a bank requires careful due diligence to ensure a smooth and secure transaction. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how you can proceed with such a purchase and the precautions you should take:Verify the Seller's Claims: Request the seller to provide you with all relevant documents related to the property, including the sale deed, encumbrance certificate, and documents related to the bank loan. Cross-check the details in these documents with the physical property and with the relevant government authorities.Obtain Encumbrance Certificate: Obtain an encumbrance certificate from the appropriate authority to verify if there are any existing encumbrances on the property, such as mortgages, liens, or pending legal claims. This certificate will give you a clear picture of the property's current status.Tripartite Agreement: In some cases, there might be a tripartite agreement executed between the bank, the seller, and the buyer. This agreement confirms the amount due against the property, the bank's hold on the original title documents, and the process of releasing the documents once the payment is made.Obtain No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Bank: Request the seller to obtain a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the bank, stating that they have no objection to the property being sold and that they will release the original title documents upon payment of the outstanding loan amount.Inspect Original Documents: As part of your due diligence, you or your lawyer may inspect the original title documents that are with the bank to ensure their authenticity and that they correspond to the property you are planning to buy.Verify Outstanding Loan Amount: Ensure that you are aware of the exact outstanding loan amount against the property. This will help you determine the total cost of the property, including the repayment of the loan.Register the Sale Deed: Once you have verified all the necessary documents and completed the payment process, register the sale deed at the Sub Registrar's office. The sale deed will transfer ownership of the property from the seller to you. The bank will also provide a release deed, confirming that the property is free from the mortgage.Title Search: Conduct a thorough title search with the help of a lawyer to ensure there are no pending legal disputes or claims against the property.Title Insurance: Consider obtaining title insurance to protect yourself from any unforeseen claims or disputes related to the property's title in the future.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "generally the bank does not allow release of its lien on any property given as security. However, the seller can get a particular property released by offering any other property of same value to the bank. Normally, the bank gets its lien  or mortgage recorded on revenue records and in that case it cannot be registered by the Sub Registrar.

A bank has the right to halt operations or freeze a bank account in certain situations.Banks often follow account holders’ instructions when making payments. The functioning of a bank account, however, may occasionally be suspended or frozen if the account holder’s instructions are refused.In reality, it will take a lot of time and effort to get the account in order once it has been legitimately frozen. Now, in order to define an unlawful transaction, you must consult the applicable rules or the bank.You may issue a legal notice to the bank to unfreeze the bank account failing which you can approach court with a suit or a writ petition against the bank for this act or even can approach CBI to issue instructions to bank to make the account in order if the case has been disposed or if your father has not been implicated in the ongoing criminal caseT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88760 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Sale Agreement Resolutions",
    "answer": "The buyer is correct in his assessment that he will not get extra space for the balcony and terrace areas if your agreement does not mention them. This is because the balcony and terrace areas are not considered as part of the carpet area in RERA agreements. Therefore, if the agreement does not specifically mention them, they will not be included in the calculation of the new flat's area in the event of redevelopment.The builder's argument that he made the agreement as per RERA laws is not entirely correct. While it is true that RERA does not require balcony and terrace areas to be included in the carpet area, it does require them to be disclosed in the agreement. If the agreement does not mention them, then the buyer is not bound by them.In your case, it is clear that the buyer is not willing to buy the flat without a guarantee that he will get the balcony and terrace areas in the new flat. Therefore, you will need to either amend the agreement to include them, or find another buyer who is willing to accept the agreement as it is.As for the different types of agreements that the builder has drafted, it is clear that he has not been consistent in his approach. This is likely to cause confusion and problems for the buyers, and it is something that you should be aware of if you are thinking of selling your flat.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Essentially, it acts as a formal notice, ensuring that the caveator is informed before any legal action is undertaken.The primary purpose behind filing a caveat petition is to safeguard one's interests in a judgment and to apprise the court that no decision should be made without providing proper notice to the concerned party. By doing so, the caveator seeks to prevent any decisions from being taken in their absence, ensuring that they have an opportunity to be heard and participate in the legal proceedings. The caveat petition thus acts as a proactive measure to protect one's rights and interests in legal matters.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can an AS (Appeal Suit) be filed even if caveat is filed?",
    "answer": "A caveat is a legal notice filed by a party with the court to inform the court that they have an interest in a particular matter, and they request to be notified before any orders or judgments are passed in that matter. The purpose of a caveat is to prevent the court from passing any orders or judgments without hearing from the party who filed the caveat.Now, let's address your specific questions:Q1: If a Caveat would have been filed & renewed upon expiry, could the other party have still registered the Appeal suit without any issue at all?Yes, even if a caveat was filed and renewed, the other party could still have registered an appeal suit. Filing a caveat does not prevent the other party from initiating an appeal. However, the caveat serves as a warning to the court that before passing any orders on an appeal or application related to the original matter, the court must give prior notice to the party who filed the caveat. This ensures that the party filing the caveat is given an opportunity to be heard before any decision is made by the court.Q2: If yes, then what is the actual purpose of a caveat & where exactly does a caveat help in such cases?As mentioned earlier, the purpose of a caveat is to prevent ex parte orders, which are orders passed without hearing from all concerned parties. By filing a caveat, a party seeks to safeguard their interests and ensure that they have the opportunity to present their side of the case before any orders are passed.In your case, if the caveat was filed, the court would have been required to inform you before passing any orders on the appeal filed by the other party. This would have given you an opportunity to respond to the appeal and present your arguments to the court, thus preventing any ex parte orders against you.Q3: If No, please elaborate on what all could/would have been saved by filing a caveat.Even though filing a caveat does not prevent the other party from initiating an appeal, it provides some benefits:Early Notice: By filing a caveat, you would have received early notice of the appeal filed by the other party. This would have given you more time to prepare and respond to the appeal effectively.Preventing Ex Parte Orders: The caveat would have ensured that the court does not pass any orders on the appeal without hearing your side of the case. This means that the court would have given you a chance to present your arguments and evidence before making any decisions.Negotiation: As you mentioned, filing a caveat could have provided an opportunity for both parties to discuss and potentially resolve the matter out of court, knowing that the court will not pass any orders without hearing from both sides.While filing a caveat does not prevent an appeal from being registered, it serves as a protective measure to ensure that you are not caught off guard by ex parte orders and that you have the opportunity to present your case effectively before the court.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "The opinion of your advocate is correct. Caveat is merely filed to protect the interest by not letting the appeal if filed by other party be unheard and court should give notice to caveator before passing any interim order or disposal of appeal as case may be.

    "answer": "Dear Client,As part of the property purchasing process, you have the right to request the seller to provide an inspection of the original documents of title to ensure the property's legitimacy and ownership details. Once you express interest in the property, the seller will approach their bank to facilitate this inspection. Additionally, the seller must obtain a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the bank, which confirms the bank's agreement to the property sale, on the condition that the proceeds from the sale will be used for the repayment of any outstanding loans on the property.In case you require financial assistance for the purchase, you have the option to approach the same bank that holds the seller's loan. By doing so, you can potentially transfer the existing loan from the seller to yourself, streamlining the process and enabling you to take advantage of the terms already established with the bank.

    "question": "Buying property mortgaged with bank",
    "answer": "Buying a property that is mortgaged with a bank requires careful due diligence to ensure a smooth and secure transaction. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how you can proceed with such a purchase and the precautions you should take:Verify the Seller's Claims: Request the seller to provide you with all relevant documents related to the property, including the sale deed, encumbrance certificate, and documents related to the bank loan. Cross-check the details in these documents with the physical property and with the relevant government authorities.Obtain Encumbrance Certificate: Obtain an encumbrance certificate from the appropriate authority to verify if there are any existing encumbrances on the property, such as mortgages, liens, or pending legal claims. This certificate will give you a clear picture of the property's current status.Tripartite Agreement: In some cases, there might be a tripartite agreement executed between the bank, the seller, and the buyer. This agreement confirms the amount due against the property, the bank's hold on the original title documents, and the process of releasing the documents once the payment is made.Obtain No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Bank: Request the seller to obtain a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the bank, stating that they have no objection to the property being sold and that they will release the original title documents upon payment of the outstanding loan amount.Inspect Original Documents: As part of your due diligence, you or your lawyer may inspect the original title documents that are with the bank to ensure their authenticity and that they correspond to the property you are planning to buy.Verify Outstanding Loan Amount: Ensure that you are aware of the exact outstanding loan amount against the property. This will help you determine the total cost of the property, including the repayment of the loan.Register the Sale Deed: Once you have verified all the necessary documents and completed the payment process, register the sale deed at the Sub Registrar's office. The sale deed will transfer ownership of the property from the seller to you. The bank will also provide a release deed, confirming that the property is free from the mortgage.Title Search: Conduct a thorough title search with the help of a lawyer to ensure there are no pending legal disputes or claims against the property.Title Insurance: Consider obtaining title insurance to protect yourself from any unforeseen claims or disputes related to the property's title in the future.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Making Building for commercial purpose by breaking the wall in the property which has a civil suit",
    "answer": ".Dear Sir,As per your query,  the land is clearly demarcated by the government survey records and boundary is marked by stone. Besides each land has two separate sale deeds.Further, as per your statement it reveals that the property in question is a self acquired property then what you mean by you have made a settlement agreement with respect to your property for your son.  What made you to make a settlement deed and that too among whom you made the settlement deed?  Once it is a self acquired property and title deed is in your name, then it is your prerogative that to whom you want to give said property?Anyway, now you say that your son is the registered owner of the land which was in your name then who stops you to do the mutation in his name?  Get the mutation done and ask him to apply to conduct survey of his registered property and get demarcate your total 25 cents for which he is paying the land tax so that the encroached area by your step daughter may be recovered by some other portion of her. Visit Tahsildar’s office and ask for an application form (it must be form No.10 ) and submit it to the respective office along with the documents required. After receiving your application, a Tehsildar will check it for further approval and all the properties around your property will be measured and demarcated for you.  In that case definitely the property of your step daughter will be more  and further the wall will have to demolished. Amicable settlement will be the efficacious remedy for both of you otherwise it will lead to prolonged civil suit.  It applicable to her also.  So proceed with your remedies so that she is compeled her for settlement.Now the question is about the approaching way? Whether the way is mentioned in the titled deed for both the properties?As per your query you are currently not staying there. If there is a gate at the entrance of your property then offload two lorry cow dung inside the compound and infront of the gate by JCB on Sunday for the time being.  Do it swiftly. who stops you.  While doing this your son should not be in the city. Do it yourself. It is your property. Rainy season is best for it. You can also adopt the same measures which she adopts. You also keep a voracious dog to avoid tress pass by anyone in your property?  For time being Don’t tell anywhere that your step daughter was using the way over a period of 30 years.Since it is a civil matter police has no role in this case.For nuisance by the dogs of your step daughter file a criminal complaint u/s 425 and 289 IPC.Install CCTV at your premises as there exist every chance that she may file false criminal case against you and your son.Further you said that the house is registered in your name and in your step daughter name? What does it mean?  Ask for your share by selling it hence it cannot be divided in metes and bounds.  Your query needs more clarification then only can answer it properly.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In legal proceedings, it is important to note that the opponent party retains the right to file an appeal, regardless of whether a caveat is currently in effect or not. A caveat petition serves as a precautionary step taken by individuals who hold concerns about potential legal actions that may be initiated against them. Essentially, it acts as a formal notice, ensuring that the caveator is informed before any legal action is undertaken.The primary purpose behind filing a caveat petition is to safeguard one's interests in a judgment and to apprise the court that no decision should be made without providing proper notice to the concerned party. By doing so, the caveator seeks to prevent any decisions from being taken in their absence, ensuring that they have an opportunity to be heard and participate in the legal proceedings. The caveat petition thus acts as a proactive measure to protect one's rights and interests in legal matters.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can an AS (Appeal Suit) be filed even if caveat is filed?",
    "answer": "A caveat is a legal notice filed by a party with the court to inform the court that they have an interest in a particular matter, and they request to be notified before any orders or judgments are passed in that matter. The purpose of a caveat is to prevent the court from passing any orders or judgments without hearing from the party who filed the caveat.Now, let's address your specific questions:Q1: If a Caveat would have been filed & renewed upon expiry, could the other party have still registered the Appeal suit without any issue at all?Yes, even if a caveat was filed and renewed, the other party could still have registered an appeal suit. Filing a caveat does not prevent the other party from initiating an appeal. However, the caveat serves as a warning to the court that before passing any orders on an appeal or application related to the original matter, the court must give prior notice to the party who filed the caveat. This ensures that the party filing the caveat is given an opportunity to be heard before any decision is made by the court.Q2: If yes, then what is the actual purpose of a caveat & where exactly does a caveat help in such cases?As mentioned earlier, the purpose of a caveat is to prevent ex parte orders, which are orders passed without hearing from all concerned parties. By filing a caveat, a party seeks to safeguard their interests and ensure that they have the opportunity to present their side of the case before any orders are passed.In your case, if the caveat was filed, the court would have been required to inform you before passing any orders on the appeal filed by the other party. This would have given you an opportunity to respond to the appeal and present your arguments to the court, thus preventing any ex parte orders against you.Q3: If No, please elaborate on what all could/would have been saved by filing a caveat.Even though filing a caveat does not prevent the other party from initiating an appeal, it provides some benefits:Early Notice: By filing a caveat, you would have received early notice of the appeal filed by the other party. This would have given you more time to prepare and respond to the appeal effectively.Preventing Ex Parte Orders: The caveat would have ensured that the court does not pass any orders on the appeal without hearing your side of the case. This means that the court would have given you a chance to present your arguments and evidence before making any decisions.Negotiation: As you mentioned, filing a caveat could have provided an opportunity for both parties to discuss and potentially resolve the matter out of court, knowing that the court will not pass any orders without hearing from both sides.While filing a caveat does not prevent an appeal from being registered, it serves as a protective measure to ensure that you are not caught off guard by ex parte orders and that you have the opportunity to present your case effectively before the court.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "The opinion of your advocate is correct.

However, this will depend on various factors, including the terms of the court's interim order and any past agreements or understandings between you and your stepdaughter. Whether the court will accept a claim for rent for the last 30 years would depend on the evidence and arguments presented in court.Breaking the Wall and Construction:Given the active case and the interim order, any actions your son takes on the property should be done with careful consideration of the legal implications. Breaking the wall and constructing on his portion of the land while a case is ongoing could be seen as a violation of the interim order or potentially interfere with the ongoing dispute.

    "question": "Making Building for commercial purpose by breaking the wall in the property which has a civil suit",
    "answer": ".Dear Sir,As per your query,  the land is clearly demarcated by the government survey records and boundary is marked by stone. Besides each land has two separate sale deeds.Further, as per your statement it reveals that the property in question is a self acquired property then what you mean by you have made a settlement agreement with respect to your property for your son.  What made you to make a settlement deed and that too among whom you made the settlement deed?  Once it is a self acquired property and title deed is in your name, then it is your prerogative that to whom you want to give said property?Anyway, now you say that your son is the registered owner of the land which was in your name then who stops you to do the mutation in his name?  Get the mutation done and ask him to apply to conduct survey of his registered property and get demarcate your total 25 cents for which he is paying the land tax so that the encroached area by your step daughter may be recovered by some other portion of her. Visit Tahsildar’s office and ask for an application form (it must be form No.10 ) and submit it to the respective office along with the documents required. After receiving your application, a Tehsildar will check it for further approval and all the properties around your property will be measured and demarcated for you.  In that case definitely the property of your step daughter will be more  and further the wall will have to demolished. Amicable settlement will be the efficacious remedy for both of you otherwise it will lead to prolonged civil suit.  It applicable to her also.  So proceed with your remedies so that she is compeled her for settlement.Now the question is about the approaching way? Whether the way is mentioned in the titled deed for both the properties?As per your query you are currently not staying there. If there is a gate at the entrance of your property then offload two lorry cow dung inside the compound and infront of the gate by JCB on Sunday for the time being.  Do it swiftly. who stops you.  While doing this your son should not be in the city. Do it yourself. It is your property. Rainy season is best for it. You can also adopt the same measures which she adopts. You also keep a voracious dog to avoid tress pass by anyone in your property?  For time being Don’t tell anywhere that your step daughter was using the way over a period of 30 years.Since it is a civil matter police has no role in this case.For nuisance by the dogs of your step daughter file a criminal complaint u/s 425 and 289 IPC.Install CCTV at your premises as there exist every chance that she may file false criminal case against you and your son.Further you said that the house is registered in your name and in your step daughter name? What does it mean?  Ask for your share by selling it hence it cannot be divided in metes and bounds.  Your query needs more clarification then only can answer it properly.

Once you express interest in the property, the seller will approach their bank to facilitate this inspection. Additionally, the seller must obtain a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the bank, which confirms the bank's agreement to the property sale, on the condition that the proceeds from the sale will be used for the repayment of any outstanding loans on the property.In case you require financial assistance for the purchase, you have the option to approach the same bank that holds the seller's loan. By doing so, you can potentially transfer the existing loan from the seller to yourself, streamlining the process and enabling you to take advantage of the terms already established with the bank.

    "answer": "Buying a property that is mortgaged with a bank requires careful due diligence to ensure a smooth and secure transaction. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how you can proceed with such a purchase and the precautions you should take:Verify the Seller's Claims: Request the seller to provide you with all relevant documents related to the property, including the sale deed, encumbrance certificate, and documents related to the bank loan. Cross-check the details in these documents with the physical property and with the relevant government authorities.Obtain Encumbrance Certificate: Obtain an encumbrance certificate from the appropriate authority to verify if there are any existing encumbrances on the property, such as mortgages, liens, or pending legal claims. This certificate will give you a clear picture of the property's current status.Tripartite Agreement: In some cases, there might be a tripartite agreement executed between the bank, the seller, and the buyer. This agreement confirms the amount due against the property, the bank's hold on the original title documents, and the process of releasing the documents once the payment is made.Obtain No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Bank: Request the seller to obtain a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the bank, stating that they have no objection to the property being sold and that they will release the original title documents upon payment of the outstanding loan amount.Inspect Original Documents: As part of your due diligence, you or your lawyer may inspect the original title documents that are with the bank to ensure their authenticity and that they correspond to the property you are planning to buy.Verify Outstanding Loan Amount: Ensure that you are aware of the exact outstanding loan amount against the property. This will help you determine the total cost of the property, including the repayment of the loan.Register the Sale Deed: Once you have verified all the necessary documents and completed the payment process, register the sale deed at the Sub Registrar's office. The sale deed will transfer ownership of the property from the seller to you. The bank will also provide a release deed, confirming that the property is free from the mortgage.Title Search: Conduct a thorough title search with the help of a lawyer to ensure there are no pending legal disputes or claims against the property.Title Insurance: Consider obtaining title insurance to protect yourself from any unforeseen claims or disputes related to the property's title in the future.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

It is not an absolute right of a neglected wife to get maintenance nor it is an absolute liability of husband to support her in all the circumstances.- No Interim/Maintenance for Capable, Working Women , as per judgment passed by Madhya Pradesh High Court.,- Wife is not entitled to get maintenance, if she lies ---- SUPREME COURT OF INDIA, Civil Appeal No. 5239 of 2002, Decided On: 03.12.2009. Appellants: Dalip Singh Vs. Respondent: State of U.P. and Ors. Hon’ble Judges: G.S. Singhvi and Asok Kumar Ganguly, JJ.- Since, your salary is Rs. 70,000/- then 8000 maintenance order is not very much high ,and this cannot be reduced at any ground by the appellate court.- Hence, you should challenge the said order of maintenance on the ground of her education and job , instead of reduction of the maintenance amount.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Sale Agreement Resolutions",
    "answer": "The buyer is correct in his assessment that he will not get extra space for the balcony and terrace areas if your agreement does not mention them. This is because the balcony and terrace areas are not considered as part of the carpet area in RERA agreements. Therefore, if the agreement does not specifically mention them, they will not be included in the calculation of the new flat's area in the event of redevelopment.The builder's argument that he made the agreement as per RERA laws is not entirely correct. While it is true that RERA does not require balcony and terrace areas to be included in the carpet area, it does require them to be disclosed in the agreement. If the agreement does not mention them, then the buyer is not bound by them.In your case, it is clear that the buyer is not willing to buy the flat without a guarantee that he will get the balcony and terrace areas in the new flat. Therefore, you will need to either amend the agreement to include them, or find another buyer who is willing to accept the agreement as it is.As for the different types of agreements that the builder has drafted, it is clear that he has not been consistent in his approach. This is likely to cause confusion and problems for the buyers, and it is something that you should be aware of if you are thinking of selling your flat.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "The share certificate is not a title document to confirm the ownership of the proeprty to the owner.The share certificate is just recognise the owner as a member of the RWA.There is no such bylaw forbidding the new owner to become a member with an application for membership without the signature of the seller.The sellers might have sold the property and absconded to avoid payment of transfer fee to the society.The registrar has not insisted on NOC from the society to register the sale deed in favor of the buyer to purchase the property.All these indicate that these are not mandatory requirement  as per law, hence the society can use its discretion as an conceptional case to issue the transfer certificate in favor of the buyer without the signature of the seller.If the previous original share certificate has been reported to have been lost, then the formalities like a  police complaint, a public notice in a local newspaper and an indemnity bond from the member may be obtained to protect the future  the interests of the society.It is discretionary and not mandatory, hence you can take a decision after a meeting with the MC members about this  in case you feel that your individual decision may put you in trouble at a later stage.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88760 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Transfer of flat whose seller is not traceable and share certificate lost",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Sure, here are the rewritten sentences:First flat:If the sale and purchase documents are intact and duly executed and registered, then the fact that the seller's signature is missing from the society's internal transfer document is not a valid reason to refuse to transfer the share in the name of the purchaser. The transfer document is an internal document of the society, and it is not legally binding.The sale and purchase documents are the legally binding documents, and they are sufficient to prove that the purchaser is the rightful owner of the share. The society should not refuse to transfer the share based on the incomplete transfer document.Second flat:If the original share certificate is lost, then a police complaint must be filed to report the loss of the original. A public notice must also be published before a duplicate certificate can be issued. An affidavit to this effect should also be taken.The police complaint and public notice are necessary to ensure that the original share certificate is not being used by someone else. The affidavit is necessary to confirm that the purchaser is the rightful owner of the share.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Transfer of flat whose seller is not traceable and share certificate lost",
    "answer": "The share certificate serves as recognition of the owner as a member of the RWA and does not act as a title document confirming property ownership. As there are no bylaws prohibiting a new owner from becoming a member without the seller's signature, the absence of the sellers may be due to their intention to evade transfer fees. The Registrar did not insist on an NOC from the society for the sale deed registration, suggesting that these requirements are not mandatory as per the law. Thus, the society may exercise its discretion to issue the transfer certificate to the buyer without the seller's signature. If the original share certificate is reported lost, the society can follow formalities like filing a police complaint, publishing a public notice, and obtaining an indemnity bond from the member to safeguard the society's interests. This decision can be taken collectively by the MC members during a meeting to avoid potential future complications."

    "question": "Sale Agreement Resolutions",
    "answer": "The buyer is correct in his assessment that he will not get extra space for the balcony and terrace areas if your agreement does not mention them. This is because the balcony and terrace areas are not considered as part of the carpet area in RERA agreements. Therefore, if the agreement does not specifically mention them, they will not be included in the calculation of the new flat's area in the event of redevelopment.The builder's argument that he made the agreement as per RERA laws is not entirely correct. While it is true that RERA does not require balcony and terrace areas to be included in the carpet area, it does require them to be disclosed in the agreement. If the agreement does not mention them, then the buyer is not bound by them.In your case, it is clear that the buyer is not willing to buy the flat without a guarantee that he will get the balcony and terrace areas in the new flat. Therefore, you will need to either amend the agreement to include them, or find another buyer who is willing to accept the agreement as it is.As for the different types of agreements that the builder has drafted, it is clear that he has not been consistent in his approach. This is likely to cause confusion and problems for the buyers, and it is something that you should be aware of if you are thinking of selling your flat.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "When married Daughters ask for parents properties equal share are they liable for the father debts?",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard.Please note thatHindu Succession Actwas amended in 2005 and it gave equal rights to the daughter in terms of property. Prior to the Hindu Succession Amendment Act 2005, sons enjoyed rights over the deceased father’s property, whereas daughters could do so only till she was unmarried. It was understood that after marriage, a woman attaches herself to the husband’s family and therefore, has rights in another Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) altogether.Now, married and unmarried daughters have the same rights on their father’s property as their brothers. They are also entitled to equal duties and liabilities as their brothers. In 2005, it was also ruled that a daughter has the same rights, provided that both, father and daughter, were alive on September 9, 2005. In 2018, the Hon'ble Supreme Court stated that a daughter can inherit her deceased father’s property no matter whether the father was alive on this date or not.Hereon, women were also accepted as coparceners. They can demand a share in the father’s property.Therefore, following is my prima facie view/opinion for your concern:1. The debts which has been repaid by you can be adjusted mutually or whenever the case is filed and it would be considered for dividing. You can place on record the copies of the Housing loan contributions from your end during and post your father's death. Court would consider it.2. She is even liable to share the expenses of the mother.3. For your sister's marriage, your father had sold his properties. It would be considered for dividing.4. For the second property which you have built on your own, requires detailed discussion with complete property documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the event of the existence of a WILL, the property shall devolve according to its terms. However, in the absence of a WILL, as a class-1 legal heir, your sister is entitled to an equal share in the properties of both your mother and father. This means she will inherit an equal portion of the property left behind by both parents.Correct, according to the law, the duty of performing the rituals of parents is legally cast upon the son.No, you cannot intervene in this matter. The gift made by your father to your sister from his own property was voluntary, and you do not have any right to claim authority over it.The current market value of the inherited property shall be assessed, and your sister's 50% share shall be calculated accordingly. She will receive her share in monetary terms based on the assessed value.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "1. you have to inform court about your plight due to the inflation  and seek justice on that basis.Court will not take any decision on its own without you praying for the relief supported by documentary evidences to the reliefs sought.2. If the said expenses are pertaining to the family then the same may be brought to the notice of the court with supporting documents to prove the expenses incurred by you at the time of necessary.3.  The expenses for the daughter's marriage cannot be considered as a share in the property while the father's property is being distributed to the legal heirs after the intestate death of the father.4. If your mother is not willing to avail a share in the assets of the deceased then she cannot be held liable for a share in the debts of the deceased also.5. Both are different subjects.  Partition means to divide the properties equally or on the mutually agreed conditions among the legal heirs and the release deed means one or the other legal heirs/cosharers decide to relinquish their rights in the property by executing a registered release deed6.

    "question": "When married Daughters ask for parents properties equal share are they liable for the father debts?",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the court proceedings, the contribution of Rs 30 lakhs made by you will be taken into consideration. It is essential to provide all relevant documentation, including bills for legal expenses incurred and proof of payment made, as well as bills for any renovation work done and evidence of payment for hospital bills. However, it's important to note that your marriage and education expenses will not be factored into the calculations.In the matter of debts, they will be divided equally among the legal heirs, limited to the extent of their inheritance. This means that each heir will bear an equal share of the debts based on their rightful portion of the inheritance.It's crucial to remember that the sister's daughter will not have any share in the property as per the legal provisions.Furthermore, the share of inheritance will not be influenced by the individual's health condition. Whether one's health is good or poor, their share in the property will remain the same and will be determined solely by the applicable legal guidelines.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Transfer of flat whose seller is not traceable and share certificate lost",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Sure, here are the rewritten sentences:First flat:If the sale and purchase documents are intact and duly executed and registered, then the fact that the seller's signature is missing from the society's internal transfer document is not a valid reason to refuse to transfer the share in the name of the purchaser. The transfer document is an internal document of the society, and it is not legally binding.The sale and purchase documents are the legally binding documents, and they are sufficient to prove that the purchaser is the rightful owner of the share. The society should not refuse to transfer the share based on the incomplete transfer document.Second flat:If the original share certificate is lost, then a police complaint must be filed to report the loss of the original. A public notice must also be published before a duplicate certificate can be issued. An affidavit to this effect should also be taken.The police complaint and public notice are necessary to ensure that the original share certificate is not being used by someone else.

    "question": "Transfer of flat whose seller is not traceable and share certificate lost",
    "answer": "The share certificate serves as recognition of the owner as a member of the RWA and does not act as a title document confirming property ownership. As there are no bylaws prohibiting a new owner from becoming a member without the seller's signature, the absence of the sellers may be due to their intention to evade transfer fees. The Registrar did not insist on an NOC from the society for the sale deed registration, suggesting that these requirements are not mandatory as per the law. Thus, the society may exercise its discretion to issue the transfer certificate to the buyer without the seller's signature. If the original share certificate is reported lost, the society can follow formalities like filing a police complaint, publishing a public notice, and obtaining an indemnity bond from the member to safeguard the society's interests. This decision can be taken collectively by the MC members during a meeting to avoid potential future complications."

    "question": "When married Daughters ask for parents properties equal share are they liable for the father debts?",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard.Please note thatHindu Succession Actwas amended in 2005 and it gave equal rights to the daughter in terms of property. Prior to the Hindu Succession Amendment Act 2005, sons enjoyed rights over the deceased father’s property, whereas daughters could do so only till she was unmarried. It was understood that after marriage, a woman attaches herself to the husband’s family and therefore, has rights in another Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) altogether.Now, married and unmarried daughters have the same rights on their father’s property as their brothers. They are also entitled to equal duties and liabilities as their brothers. In 2005, it was also ruled that a daughter has the same rights, provided that both, father and daughter, were alive on September 9, 2005. In 2018, the Hon'ble Supreme Court stated that a daughter can inherit her deceased father’s property no matter whether the father was alive on this date or not.Hereon, women were also accepted as coparceners. They can demand a share in the father’s property.Therefore, following is my prima facie view/opinion for your concern:1. The debts which has been repaid by you can be adjusted mutually or whenever the case is filed and it would be considered for dividing. You can place on record the copies of the Housing loan contributions from your end during and post your father's death. Court would consider it.2. She is even liable to share the expenses of the mother.3. For your sister's marriage, your father had sold his properties. It would be considered for dividing.4. For the second property which you have built on your own, requires detailed discussion with complete property documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

However, in the absence of a WILL, as a class-1 legal heir, your sister is entitled to an equal share in the properties of both your mother and father.

The gift made by your father to your sister from his own property was voluntary, and you do not have any right to claim authority over it.The current market value of the inherited property shall be assessed, and your sister's 50% share shall be calculated accordingly.

If the said expenses are pertaining to the family then the same may be brought to the notice of the court with supporting documents to prove the expenses incurred by you at the time of necessary.3.  The expenses for the daughter's marriage cannot be considered as a share in the property while the father's property is being distributed to the legal heirs after the intestate death of the father.4.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the court proceedings, the contribution of Rs 30 lakhs made by you will be taken into consideration. It is essential to provide all relevant documentation, including bills for legal expenses incurred and proof of payment made, as well as bills for any renovation work done and evidence of payment for hospital bills. However, it's important to note that your marriage and education expenses will not be factored into the calculations.In the matter of debts, they will be divided equally among the legal heirs, limited to the extent of their inheritance. This means that each heir will bear an equal share of the debts based on their rightful portion of the inheritance.It's crucial to remember that the sister's daughter will not have any share in the property as per the legal provisions.Furthermore, the share of inheritance will not be influenced by the individual's health condition. Whether one's health is good or poor, their share in the property will remain the same and will be determined solely by the applicable legal guidelines.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "The share certificate is not a title document to confirm the ownership of the proeprty to the owner.The share certificate is just recognise the owner as a member of the RWA.There is no such bylaw forbidding the new owner to become a member with an application for membership without the signature of the seller.The sellers might have sold the property and absconded to avoid payment of transfer fee to the society.The registrar has not insisted on NOC from the society to register the sale deed in favor of the buyer to purchase the property.All these indicate that these are not mandatory requirement  as per law, hence the society can use its discretion as an conceptional case to issue the transfer certificate in favor of the buyer without the signature of the seller.If the previous original share certificate has been reported to have been lost, then the formalities like a  police complaint, a public notice in a local newspaper and an indemnity bond from the member may be obtained to protect the future  the interests of the society.It is discretionary and not mandatory, hence you can take a decision after a meeting with the MC members about this  in case you feel that your individual decision may put you in trouble at a later stage.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88760 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Transfer of flat whose seller is not traceable and share certificate lost",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Sure, here are the rewritten sentences:First flat:If the sale and purchase documents are intact and duly executed and registered, then the fact that the seller's signature is missing from the society's internal transfer document is not a valid reason to refuse to transfer the share in the name of the purchaser. The transfer document is an internal document of the society, and it is not legally binding.The sale and purchase documents are the legally binding documents, and they are sufficient to prove that the purchaser is the rightful owner of the share. The society should not refuse to transfer the share based on the incomplete transfer document.Second flat:If the original share certificate is lost, then a police complaint must be filed to report the loss of the original. A public notice must also be published before a duplicate certificate can be issued. An affidavit to this effect should also be taken.The police complaint and public notice are necessary to ensure that the original share certificate is not being used by someone else. The affidavit is necessary to confirm that the purchaser is the rightful owner of the share.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "context": "Asked 2 years ago in Property Law Religion: Christian",
    "question": "Transfer of flat whose seller is not traceable and share certificate lost",
    "answer": "The share certificate serves as recognition of the owner as a member of the RWA and does not act as a title document confirming property ownership. As there are no bylaws prohibiting a new owner from becoming a member without the seller's signature, the absence of the sellers may be due to their intention to evade transfer fees. The Registrar did not insist on an NOC from the society for the sale deed registration, suggesting that these requirements are not mandatory as per the law. Thus, the society may exercise its discretion to issue the transfer certificate to the buyer without the seller's signature. If the original share certificate is reported lost, the society can follow formalities like filing a police complaint, publishing a public notice, and obtaining an indemnity bond from the member to safeguard the society's interests. This decision can be taken collectively by the MC members during a meeting to avoid potential future complications."

    "question": "When married Daughters ask for parents properties equal share are they liable for the father debts?",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard.Please note thatHindu Succession Actwas amended in 2005 and it gave equal rights to the daughter in terms of property. Prior to the Hindu Succession Amendment Act 2005, sons enjoyed rights over the deceased father’s property, whereas daughters could do so only till she was unmarried. It was understood that after marriage, a woman attaches herself to the husband’s family and therefore, has rights in another Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) altogether.Now, married and unmarried daughters have the same rights on their father’s property as their brothers. They are also entitled to equal duties and liabilities as their brothers. In 2005, it was also ruled that a daughter has the same rights, provided that both, father and daughter, were alive on September 9, 2005. In 2018, the Hon'ble Supreme Court stated that a daughter can inherit her deceased father’s property no matter whether the father was alive on this date or not.Hereon, women were also accepted as coparceners. They can demand a share in the father’s property.Therefore, following is my prima facie view/opinion for your concern:1. The debts which has been repaid by you can be adjusted mutually or whenever the case is filed and it would be considered for dividing. You can place on record the copies of the Housing loan contributions from your end during and post your father's death. Court would consider it.2. She is even liable to share the expenses of the mother.3. For your sister's marriage, your father had sold his properties. It would be considered for dividing.4. For the second property which you have built on your own, requires detailed discussion with complete property documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

It is essential to provide all relevant documentation, including bills for legal expenses incurred and proof of payment made, as well as bills for any renovation work done and evidence of payment for hospital bills. However, it's important to note that your marriage and education expenses will not be factored into the calculations.In the matter of debts, they will be divided equally among the legal heirs, limited to the extent of their inheritance. This means that each heir will bear an equal share of the debts based on their rightful portion of the inheritance.It's crucial to remember that the sister's daughter will not have any share in the property as per the legal provisions.Furthermore, the share of inheritance will not be influenced by the individual's health condition.

But so is thunder and lightening. At times, despite our best efforts, life takes a turn for the worst. We may have wanted different things from life, but life’s got its own plan as well. A bad marriage is something which nobody hopes for, but at times, that’s exactly what we are given and forced to face head on. Marriages are hard. Divorces…even harder. Nobody enters a marriage thinking about a divorce in the end. If some are unable to cope with the harsh realities of marriage, the only viable option in front of them is to approach the Court and seek legal separation by way ofmutual consent divorce. There is a bitterness in her relationship now.Your sister can take her lawyer into confidence and convince him. He can accompany her.For divorce she has two options:1.Mutual Consent Divorce2. Contested DivorceTheHindu Marriage Act, 1955 enshrines the right to divorce by way of mutual consent under Section 13B. The spouses can jointly file a petition seeking divorce under Section 13B before the family court, which possesses the jurisdiction to pass such a decree of divorce under Section 13B. Please note thatmutual consent divorcecan only be filed if both the husband and wife consent for it.In case, the husband does not agree formutual consent divorce, then she can apply for contested divorce. In case of a contested divorce, there are specific grounds on which a petition for divorce can be made before court. While it is generally more time consuming and than a mutual divorce, if there exist satisfactory grounds for granting of divorce, it could be fairly straightforward.The broad grounds under which a contested divorce is granted by court are listed below:CrueltyCruelty could be either in the nature of physical or mental cruelty. As per the Hindu family laws, if one of the spouses has a reasonable and well founded fear that the conduct of the other spouse is likely to be harmful, then there is sufficient grounds for obtaining divorce due to cruelty.AdulteryA man that commits adultery (i.e. has consensual sexual intercourse outside of hismarriage) is liable to be charged with a criminal offence. The wife may, of course, still file for divorce as a civil remedy. If, on the other hand, a wife commits adultery, she may not be liable to be charged with a criminal offence, although the husband may seek prosecution of the adulterous male for adultery."

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard.Please note thatHindu Succession Actwas amended in 2005 and it gave equal rights to the daughter in terms of property. Prior to the Hindu Succession Amendment Act 2005, sons enjoyed rights over the deceased father’s property, whereas daughters could do so only till she was unmarried. It was understood that after marriage, a woman attaches herself to the husband’s family and therefore, has rights in another Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) altogether.Now, married and unmarried daughters have the same rights on their father’s property as their brothers. They are also entitled to equal duties and liabilities as their brothers. In 2005, it was also ruled that a daughter has the same rights, provided that both, father and daughter, were alive on September 9, 2005. In 2018, the Hon'ble Supreme Court stated that a daughter can inherit her deceased father’s property no matter whether the father was alive on this date or not.Hereon, women were also accepted as coparceners. They can demand a share in the father’s property.Therefore, following is my prima facie view/opinion for your concern:1. The debts which has been repaid by you can be adjusted mutually or whenever the case is filed and it would be considered for dividing. You can place on record the copies of the Housing loan contributions from your end during and post your father's death. Court would consider it.2.

The gift made by your father to your sister from his own property was voluntary, and you do not have any right to claim authority over it.The current market value of the inherited property shall be assessed, and your sister's 50% share shall be calculated accordingly. She will receive her share in monetary terms based on the assessed value.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "1. you have to inform court about your plight due to the inflation  and seek justice on that basis.Court will not take any decision on its own without you praying for the relief supported by documentary evidences to the reliefs sought.2. If the said expenses are pertaining to the family then the same may be brought to the notice of the court with supporting documents to prove the expenses incurred by you at the time of necessary.3.  The expenses for the daughter's marriage cannot be considered as a share in the property while the father's property is being distributed to the legal heirs after the intestate death of the father.4. If your mother is not willing to avail a share in the assets of the deceased then she cannot be held liable for a share in the debts of the deceased also.5.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the court proceedings, the contribution of Rs 30 lakhs made by you will be taken into consideration. It is essential to provide all relevant documentation, including bills for legal expenses incurred and proof of payment made, as well as bills for any renovation work done and evidence of payment for hospital bills. However, it's important to note that your marriage and education expenses will not be factored into the calculations.In the matter of debts, they will be divided equally among the legal heirs, limited to the extent of their inheritance. This means that each heir will bear an equal share of the debts based on their rightful portion of the inheritance.It's crucial to remember that the sister's daughter will not have any share in the property as per the legal provisions.Furthermore, the share of inheritance will not be influenced by the individual's health condition. Whether one's health is good or poor, their share in the property will remain the same and will be determined solely by the applicable legal guidelines.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Divorce and lawyer related query",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can really understand your problem. They say marriages are made in heaven. But so is thunder and lightening. At times, despite our best efforts, life takes a turn for the worst. We may have wanted different things from life, but life’s got its own plan as well. A bad marriage is something which nobody hopes for, but at times, that’s exactly what we are given and forced to face head on. Marriages are hard. Divorces…even harder. Nobody enters a marriage thinking about a divorce in the end. If some are unable to cope with the harsh realities of marriage, the only viable option in front of them is to approach the Court and seek legal separation by way ofmutual consent divorce. There is a bitterness in her relationship now.Your sister can take her lawyer into confidence and convince him. He can accompany her.For divorce she has two options:1.Mutual Consent Divorce2. Contested DivorceTheHindu Marriage Act, 1955 enshrines the right to divorce by way of mutual consent under Section 13B. The spouses can jointly file a petition seeking divorce under Section 13B before the family court, which possesses the jurisdiction to pass such a decree of divorce under Section 13B. Please note thatmutual consent divorcecan only be filed if both the husband and wife consent for it.In case, the husband does not agree formutual consent divorce, then she can apply for contested divorce. In case of a contested divorce, there are specific grounds on which a petition for divorce can be made before court. While it is generally more time consuming and than a mutual divorce, if there exist satisfactory grounds for granting of divorce, it could be fairly straightforward.The broad grounds under which a contested divorce is granted by court are listed below:CrueltyCruelty could be either in the nature of physical or mental cruelty. As per the Hindu family laws, if one of the spouses has a reasonable and well founded fear that the conduct of the other spouse is likely to be harmful, then there is sufficient grounds for obtaining divorce due to cruelty.AdulteryA man that commits adultery (i.e. has consensual sexual intercourse outside of hismarriage) is liable to be charged with a criminal offence. The wife may, of course, still file for divorce as a civil remedy. If, on the other hand, a wife commits adultery, she may not be liable to be charged with a criminal offence, although the husband may seek prosecution of the adulterous male for adultery."

    "question": "Recovery of money paid through bank to a company",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. Legal Notice through Advocate can be sent to the Company in Bangalore, Karnataka on your behalf. Copy is agreement and cheque is sufficient. A legal notice is, therefore, a formal communication to a person or an entity, informing the other party of your intention to undertake legal proceedings against them. This notice, when sent, conveys your intention before the legal proceedings and thus, makes the party aware of your grievance. Many times, a legal notice served will bring the other party to heel, and the problem is often resolved out of court, well before it goes to trial, with fruitful discussions on both sides.However, if the other party is still unheeding the grievance, one can always start the court proceedings after the prescribed interval as stated by law. The bottom line is that legal notice can serve as a point of reference to embark upon negotiations between two parties and save both the time, effort, and money that is usually spent in court cases.Also, note that for the Legal Notice for Money Recovery matters, you have to understand there is a timeline. As per the provision of the Limitation Act, the limitation term for the recovery of money is 3 years.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Mr. Gopal VermaAdvocate on Record & Amicus CuriaeSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "question": "Divorce and lawyer related query",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can really understand your problem. They say marriages are made in heaven. But so is thunder and lightening. At times, despite our best efforts, life takes a turn for the worst. We may have wanted different things from life, but life’s got its own plan as well. A bad marriage is something which nobody hopes for, but at times, that’s exactly what we are given and forced to face head on. Marriages are hard. Divorces…even harder. Nobody enters a marriage thinking about a divorce in the end. If some are unable to cope with the harsh realities of marriage, the only viable option in front of them is to approach the Court and seek legal separation by way ofmutual consent divorce. There is a bitterness in her relationship now.Your sister can take her lawyer into confidence and convince him. He can accompany her.For divorce she has two options:1.Mutual Consent Divorce2. Contested DivorceTheHindu Marriage Act, 1955 enshrines the right to divorce by way of mutual consent under Section 13B. The spouses can jointly file a petition seeking divorce under Section 13B before the family court, which possesses the jurisdiction to pass such a decree of divorce under Section 13B. Please note thatmutual consent divorcecan only be filed if both the husband and wife consent for it.In case, the husband does not agree formutual consent divorce, then she can apply for contested divorce. In case of a contested divorce, there are specific grounds on which a petition for divorce can be made before court. While it is generally more time consuming and than a mutual divorce, if there exist satisfactory grounds for granting of divorce, it could be fairly straightforward.The broad grounds under which a contested divorce is granted by court are listed below:CrueltyCruelty could be either in the nature of physical or mental cruelty. As per the Hindu family laws, if one of the spouses has a reasonable and well founded fear that the conduct of the other spouse is likely to be harmful, then there is sufficient grounds for obtaining divorce due to cruelty.AdulteryA man that commits adultery (i.e. has consensual sexual intercourse outside of hismarriage) is liable to be charged with a criminal offence. The wife may, of course, still file for divorce as a civil remedy. If, on the other hand, a wife commits adultery, she may not be liable to be charged with a criminal offence, although the husband may seek prosecution of the adulterous male for adultery."

    "question": "Divorce and lawyer related query",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can really understand your problem. They say marriages are made in heaven. But so is thunder and lightening. At times, despite our best efforts, life takes a turn for the worst. We may have wanted different things from life, but life’s got its own plan as well. A bad marriage is something which nobody hopes for, but at times, that’s exactly what we are given and forced to face head on. Marriages are hard. Divorces…even harder. Nobody enters a marriage thinking about a divorce in the end. If some are unable to cope with the harsh realities of marriage, the only viable option in front of them is to approach the Court and seek legal separation by way ofmutual consent divorce. There is a bitterness in her relationship now.Your sister can take her lawyer into confidence and convince him. He can accompany her.For divorce she has two options:1.Mutual Consent Divorce2. Contested DivorceTheHindu Marriage Act, 1955 enshrines the right to divorce by way of mutual consent under Section 13B. The spouses can jointly file a petition seeking divorce under Section 13B before the family court, which possesses the jurisdiction to pass such a decree of divorce under Section 13B. Please note thatmutual consent divorcecan only be filed if both the husband and wife consent for it.In case, the husband does not agree formutual consent divorce, then she can apply for contested divorce. In case of a contested divorce, there are specific grounds on which a petition for divorce can be made before court. While it is generally more time consuming and than a mutual divorce, if there exist satisfactory grounds for granting of divorce, it could be fairly straightforward.The broad grounds under which a contested divorce is granted by court are listed below:CrueltyCruelty could be either in the nature of physical or mental cruelty. As per the Hindu family laws, if one of the spouses has a reasonable and well founded fear that the conduct of the other spouse is likely to be harmful, then there is sufficient grounds for obtaining divorce due to cruelty.AdulteryA man that commits adultery (i.e. has consensual sexual intercourse outside of hismarriage) is liable to be charged with a criminal offence. The wife may, of course, still file for divorce as a civil remedy. If, on the other hand, a wife commits adultery, she may not be liable to be charged with a criminal offence, although the husband may seek prosecution of the adulterous male for adultery."

    "answer": "Dear Client,In this situation, it is important to note that you are not responsible for any past defaults regarding the payment of stamp duty. However, to establish a clear and marketable title to the property, it is crucial to possess the original chain of documents. Unfortunately, without the registered sale deed, obtaining certified copies of these documents becomes challenging.To safeguard your interests, it is advisable to request the seller to issue a public notice about the loss of the original documents and also file a police complaint in this regard. Additionally, when proceeding with the sale, it is crucial to include an indemnity clause in the sale deed. This clause will protect you from potential third-party claims that may arise.However, it is essential to be aware that the absence of the original chain of documents and the unavailability of a registered sale deed may impact the market price of the property in the future.

    "answer": "- As per Supreme Court judgment, wife is expected to move in with the relatives of their husbands, follow the rules and customs of their home, and ideally, blend in seamlessly as a new daughter.- Further, the court granted divorce to a man on the grounds of “cruelty” after his wife refused to share a home with her in-laws.- Further, If wife is not supporting her husband for the enjoyment of life and denying relation, then the husband can get divorce after filing a divorce petition before the court on this ground.- Further, if she had concealed the material facts of her earlier relationship etc. from her husband at the time of marriage , then the said marriage can be declared as null and void.-  Since, she is not living in the matrimonial home and run away , then this can be a ground for divorce- The husband can file a declaration suit before the court for getting divorce , and if she will not appear before the court , then the court may pass ex-parte divorce in favour of husband- Further, as she is not residing in the parental home , then the Talaq by sending notice may be not valid.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Want to give talaq to my friends wife who have run away from home her native place is Vijaywada",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The method of pronouncing talaq by talaq e Hasan or talaq ahsan is recognized as a valid form of dissolution of marriage. Following this form of talaq, the male can subsequently approach the court with a suit for declaration to affirm the validity of the dissolution of marriage. It is important to handle this matter with sensitivity, considering its delicate nature. The communication of this decision can be done through various means such as a registered letter, email, WhatsApp, or any other social media platform. However, it is crucial to refrain from discussing issues beyond the scope of the topic at hand. Additionally, it is essential to clarify that there is no evidence to suggest that the entire state is boycotting Islamic law, and such statements should be avoided as they may lack factual basis.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Recovery of money paid through bank to a company",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. Legal Notice through Advocate can be sent to the Company in Bangalore, Karnataka on your behalf. Copy is agreement and cheque is sufficient. A legal notice is, therefore, a formal communication to a person or an entity, informing the other party of your intention to undertake legal proceedings against them. This notice, when sent, conveys your intention before the legal proceedings and thus, makes the party aware of your grievance. Many times, a legal notice served will bring the other party to heel, and the problem is often resolved out of court, well before it goes to trial, with fruitful discussions on both sides.However, if the other party is still unheeding the grievance, one can always start the court proceedings after the prescribed interval as stated by law. The bottom line is that legal notice can serve as a point of reference to embark upon negotiations between two parties and save both the time, effort, and money that is usually spent in court cases.Also, note that for the Legal Notice for Money Recovery matters, you have to understand there is a timeline. As per the provision of the Limitation Act, the limitation term for the recovery of money is 3 years.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Mr. Gopal VermaAdvocate on Record & Amicus CuriaeSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

However, a moral duty is cast upon the residents in such multi-dwellings that they take proper care of their pets so that they are not a nuisance or threat to fellow residents. Also, it is their moral duty to clear the pet droppings in the common areas themselves, as in done in the USA and other Western countries, from the point of view of hygiene and healthy ambience inside the residential complex.Swaminathan NeelakantanAdvocate, Coimbatore3023 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Swaminathan Neelakantan"

    "question": "Rule with respect to pets by Apartment Association",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the absence of specific central or state laws mandating pet owners to clean up after their pets, housing associations do not possess the authority to impose any rules, regulations, or by-laws that make it mandatory for pet owners to clean up pet excreta. However, the association does have the right to request pet owners to responsibly clean up after their pets for the well-being and cleanliness of the community.Furthermore, housing associations do not have the power to restrict the timing of when pet owners can take their pets for walks in the common areas of the society. Pet owners should be allowed to use these spaces responsibly and at their convenience, as long as they clean up after their pets.Additionally, it is unlawful for a housing society to prohibit pets from utilizing common facilities such as lifts and parks or impose fines or special charges for pet owners using these amenities with their pets. Discrimination against pet owners in this manner goes against their rights to access the same facilities as other residents.If the association attempts to impose fines on pet owners whose pets are found relieving themselves within the campus, the affected individuals have the right to issue a legal notice to the association. Such fines are not enforceable without proper legal backing or relevant legislation. Pet owners are encouraged to be responsible for their pets and clean up after them, but the imposition of fines without legal grounds is unacceptable.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, to establish a clear and marketable title to the property, it is crucial to possess the original chain of documents. Unfortunately, without the registered sale deed, obtaining certified copies of these documents becomes challenging.To safeguard your interests, it is advisable to request the seller to issue a public notice about the loss of the original documents and also file a police complaint in this regard. Additionally, when proceeding with the sale, it is crucial to include an indemnity clause in the sale deed. This clause will protect you from potential third-party claims that may arise.However, it is essential to be aware that the absence of the original chain of documents and the unavailability of a registered sale deed may impact the market price of the property in the future.

    "answer": "- As per the Employment Act, employees have the right to resign at any time, by serving notice or by compensating the employer with salary in lieu. It is an offence for employers to disallow employees to leave their job.- Further, as per the Supreme Court , Resignation is a right of an employee who cannot be forced to serve in case he is not willing until and unless there is some stipulation in the rules or in the terms of appointment or disciplinary proceedings is pending or contemplated which is sought to be avoided by resigning from the service.-Further, the employment bond with the negative covenant is valid and legally enforceable, if the parties agree with their free consent i.e. without force, coercion, undue influence, misrepresentation and mistake, but it is not enforceable, if it is either one sided, unconscionable or unreasonable.- Hence, your wife can send a notice to the said department after narrating the valid reason of resignation and request to issue to a Relieving letter to her .Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

However, to establish a clear and marketable title to the property, it is crucial to possess the original chain of documents. Unfortunately, without the registered sale deed, obtaining certified copies of these documents becomes challenging.To safeguard your interests, it is advisable to request the seller to issue a public notice about the loss of the original documents and also file a police complaint in this regard. Additionally, when proceeding with the sale, it is crucial to include an indemnity clause in the sale deed. This clause will protect you from potential third-party claims that may arise.However, it is essential to be aware that the absence of the original chain of documents and the unavailability of a registered sale deed may impact the market price of the property in the future.

Following this form of talaq, the male can subsequently approach the court with a suit for declaration to affirm the validity of the dissolution of marriage. It is important to handle this matter with sensitivity, considering its delicate nature. The communication of this decision can be done through various means such as a registered letter, email, WhatsApp, or any other social media platform. However, it is crucial to refrain from discussing issues beyond the scope of the topic at hand. Additionally, it is essential to clarify that there is no evidence to suggest that the entire state is boycotting Islamic law, and such statements should be avoided as they may lack factual basis.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, to establish a clear and marketable title to the property, it is crucial to possess the original chain of documents. Unfortunately, without the registered sale deed, obtaining certified copies of these documents becomes challenging.To safeguard your interests, it is advisable to request the seller to issue a public notice about the loss of the original documents and also file a police complaint in this regard. Additionally, when proceeding with the sale, it is crucial to include an indemnity clause in the sale deed. This clause will protect you from potential third-party claims that may arise.However, it is essential to be aware that the absence of the original chain of documents and the unavailability of a registered sale deed may impact the market price of the property in the future.

    "question": "Recovery of money paid through bank to a company",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. Legal Notice through Advocate can be sent to the Company in Bangalore, Karnataka on your behalf. Copy is agreement and cheque is sufficient. A legal notice is, therefore, a formal communication to a person or an entity, informing the other party of your intention to undertake legal proceedings against them. This notice, when sent, conveys your intention before the legal proceedings and thus, makes the party aware of your grievance. Many times, a legal notice served will bring the other party to heel, and the problem is often resolved out of court, well before it goes to trial, with fruitful discussions on both sides.However, if the other party is still unheeding the grievance, one can always start the court proceedings after the prescribed interval as stated by law. The bottom line is that legal notice can serve as a point of reference to embark upon negotiations between two parties and save both the time, effort, and money that is usually spent in court cases.Also, note that for the Legal Notice for Money Recovery matters, you have to understand there is a timeline. As per the provision of the Limitation Act, the limitation term for the recovery of money is 3 years.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Mr. Gopal VermaAdvocate on Record & Amicus CuriaeSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "question": "Recovery of money paid through bank to a company",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. Legal Notice through Advocate can be sent to the Company in Bangalore, Karnataka on your behalf. Copy is agreement and cheque is sufficient. A legal notice is, therefore, a formal communication to a person or an entity, informing the other party of your intention to undertake legal proceedings against them. This notice, when sent, conveys your intention before the legal proceedings and thus, makes the party aware of your grievance. Many times, a legal notice served will bring the other party to heel, and the problem is often resolved out of court, well before it goes to trial, with fruitful discussions on both sides.However, if the other party is still unheeding the grievance, one can always start the court proceedings after the prescribed interval as stated by law. The bottom line is that legal notice can serve as a point of reference to embark upon negotiations between two parties and save both the time, effort, and money that is usually spent in court cases.Also, note that for the Legal Notice for Money Recovery matters, you have to understand there is a timeline. As per the provision of the Limitation Act, the limitation term for the recovery of money is 3 years.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Mr. Gopal VermaAdvocate on Record & Amicus CuriaeSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In this situation, it is important to note that you are not responsible for any past defaults regarding the payment of stamp duty. However, to establish a clear and marketable title to the property, it is crucial to possess the original chain of documents. Unfortunately, without the registered sale deed, obtaining certified copies of these documents becomes challenging.To safeguard your interests, it is advisable to request the seller to issue a public notice about the loss of the original documents and also file a police complaint in this regard. Additionally, when proceeding with the sale, it is crucial to include an indemnity clause in the sale deed. This clause will protect you from potential third-party claims that may arise.However, it is essential to be aware that the absence of the original chain of documents and the unavailability of a registered sale deed may impact the market price of the property in the future. Ensuring all necessary steps are taken to minimize potential risks becomes essential in such circumstances.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. Legal Notice through Advocate can be sent to the Company in Bangalore, Karnataka on your behalf. Copy is agreement and cheque is sufficient. A legal notice is, therefore, a formal communication to a person or an entity, informing the other party of your intention to undertake legal proceedings against them. This notice, when sent, conveys your intention before the legal proceedings and thus, makes the party aware of your grievance. Many times, a legal notice served will bring the other party to heel, and the problem is often resolved out of court, well before it goes to trial, with fruitful discussions on both sides.However, if the other party is still unheeding the grievance, one can always start the court proceedings after the prescribed interval as stated by law. The bottom line is that legal notice can serve as a point of reference to embark upon negotiations between two parties and save both the time, effort, and money that is usually spent in court cases.Also, note that for the Legal Notice for Money Recovery matters, you have to understand there is a timeline.

    "question": "Section 14, 34 & 41 of the Specific Relief Act 1963",
    "answer": "- As per law, an employer can terminate its employee , if found guilty of willful insubordination or disobedience; theft, fraud, or dishonesty; willful damage to or loss of employer’s goods; partaking of bribes or any illegal gratification; absence without leave for more than 10 days; habitual late attendance; disorderly behavior during working hours; or habitual negligence of work.- Further, an employer cannot terminate an employee without giving the employee at least 30 days of notice or a salary in lieu of such notice.- Further, as per the Industrial Disputes Act, any such employee who has been employed for greater than a year can only be terminated after permission is granted by a suitable government office. Additionally, an employer must provide valid reason for termination and pay a severance amount that is equivalent to 15 days’ average salary for each year of uninterrupted employment.- Hence, if the company has terminated him without a valid reason , then he can approach the Labor Tribunal under the Industrial disputes Act.- However, as he has already filed a civil suit for restoration of the employment , then he should wait for the outcome of that civil suit and then do the needful if not get relief.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The nature of the filed case is currently unknown. However, it appears that the individual is seeking reinstatement of their employment and associated employment benefits. To pursue this matter, there are specific legal avenues available based on their employment category.If the individual falls under the labor category, they should approach the labor court for redressal. Alternatively, they have the option to approach the high court with a writ petition to seek the required reliefs.It's important to note that the civil court cannot issue orders under the Specific Relief Act in matters pertaining to labor law. Hence, filing a suit for a mandatory injunction to have the termination order set aside and to be reinstated, or to reach a full and final settlement amount, would be appropriate in this situation.Since the case is currently pending final arguments, the individual will need to wait for the judgment to be pronounced before deciding on any further course of action. Patience is required until the court reaches a decision in the matter.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "1. I'm going to file a contested divorce case now. I wanted to understand how can I claim alimony & maintenance in my divorce petition. Can it be added in the prayer of the divorce petition itself or do I need to file separate applications for it?Ans:  You have to specifically ask for alimony in the prayer portion of your divorce petition. Unless you ask for it, court is not going to grant any alimony.You can also file for maintenance application within the Divorce proceedings.2. My jewellery & belongings are still with in-laws, how can I get them back? Moreover, can I claim the dowry amount & marriage expenses too in the divorce petition?Ans:  DVC is the fit case for this purpose. You can claim return of property including Stri-Dhan, any articles, gold etc., and also claim compensation for various abuses.3. Local advocate says we can't claim maintenance as I'm working. But my job is temporary in nature.Ans: Yes, he is right in saying so. However, having employment is not alone the criteria for not being able to get maintenance. If you can establish that your lifestyle has drastically fallen and you are surviving with a meager income and on the contrary the husband is having enough means to afford the same lifestyle as earlier, you may have a fair chance to get maintenance to some extent.But keep in mind, every case is different - please don't insist your lawyer to fight your case based on my comment.

    "question": "Maintenance & Alimony in Divorce",
    "answer": "Dear Client,A legal course of action can be pursued against the husband in response to his act of bigamy, which is prohibited under Section 494 of theIndian Penal Code(IPC) as it involves marrying again during the existence of a prior marriage. To address this issue, a formal complaint can be lodged with the appropriate authorities, bringing attention to the husband's remarriage while his earlier marriage was still valid.Furthermore, it is advisable for the aggrieved party (the wife) to file for divorce, seeking the dissolution of the marriage. Alongside the divorce petition, it is essential to request interim maintenance and alimony, considering the potential disparity in income between the husband and wife. This maintenance is vital to ensure financial support during the divorce proceedings and to meet the necessary expenses for the wife's well-being.Moreover, as the husband has refused to return the wife's stridhan, which is her rightful property, it is possible to take legal action against him underSection 406of the IPC, which deals with criminal breach of trust. This section holds individuals accountable for dishonestly withholding or misappropriating property entrusted to them.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,A legal course of action can be pursued against the husband in response to his act of bigamy, which is prohibited under Section 494 of theIndian Penal Code(IPC) as it involves marrying again during the existence of a prior marriage. To address this issue, a formal complaint can be lodged with the appropriate authorities, bringing attention to the husband's remarriage while his earlier marriage was still valid.Furthermore, it is advisable for the aggrieved party (the wife) to file for divorce, seeking the dissolution of the marriage. Alongside the divorce petition, it is essential to request interim maintenance and alimony, considering the potential disparity in income between the husband and wife. This maintenance is vital to ensure financial support during the divorce proceedings and to meet the necessary expenses for the wife's well-being.Moreover, as the husband has refused to return the wife's stridhan, which is her rightful property, it is possible to take legal action against him underSection 406of the IPC, which deals with criminal breach of trust.

Hence, filing a suit for a mandatory injunction to have the termination order set aside and to be reinstated, or to reach a full and final settlement amount, would be appropriate in this situation.Since the case is currently pending final arguments, the individual will need to wait for the judgment to be pronounced before deciding on any further course of action. Patience is required until the court reaches a decision in the matter.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Can it be added in the prayer of the divorce petition itself or do I need to file separate applications for it?Ans:  You have to specifically ask for alimony in the prayer portion of your divorce petition. Unless you ask for it, court is not going to grant any alimony.You can also file for maintenance application within the Divorce proceedings.2. My jewellery & belongings are still with in-laws, how can I get them back? Moreover, can I claim the dowry amount & marriage expenses too in the divorce petition?Ans:  DVC is the fit case for this purpose. You can claim return of property including Stri-Dhan, any articles, gold etc., and also claim compensation for various abuses.3. Local advocate says we can't claim maintenance as I'm working. But my job is temporary in nature.Ans: Yes, he is right in saying so. However, having employment is not alone the criteria for not being able to get maintenance. If you can establish that your lifestyle has drastically fallen and you are surviving with a meager income and on the contrary the husband is having enough means to afford the same lifestyle as earlier, you may have a fair chance to get maintenance to some extent.But keep in mind, every case is different - please don't insist your lawyer to fight your case based on my comment.

    "answer": "Dear Client,A legal course of action can be pursued against the husband in response to his act of bigamy, which is prohibited under Section 494 of theIndian Penal Code(IPC) as it involves marrying again during the existence of a prior marriage. To address this issue, a formal complaint can be lodged with the appropriate authorities, bringing attention to the husband's remarriage while his earlier marriage was still valid.Furthermore, it is advisable for the aggrieved party (the wife) to file for divorce, seeking the dissolution of the marriage. Alongside the divorce petition, it is essential to request interim maintenance and alimony, considering the potential disparity in income between the husband and wife. This maintenance is vital to ensure financial support during the divorce proceedings and to meet the necessary expenses for the wife's well-being.Moreover, as the husband has refused to return the wife's stridhan, which is her rightful property, it is possible to take legal action against him underSection 406of the IPC, which deals with criminal breach of trust.

    "context": "Asked 2 years ago in Family Law Religion: Muslim",
    "question": "Husband wife alimony dispute",
    "answer": "Dear client,1. Demand for Mother's Property: Under Indian law, generally, property owned by a mother or any individual cannot be claimed in divorce proceedings unless it was acquired jointly during the marriage. If the property is solely in your mother's name and was acquired before or independently of the marriage, it usually wouldn't be subject to division in divorce proceedings.2. Alimony and Brother's Income: In determining alimony, the court considers various factors, including the earning capacity of both spouses, assets, liabilities, financial needs, and standard of living. If your brother's income from the stationary shop is low due to it being a new venture, the court might take this into account. They may also consider family support or other available resources, including the mother's savings or siblings' contributions, while determining alimony.3. Court Proceedings Duration: The duration of court proceedings can vary significantly. Divorce cases in India can take several months to years to reach a conclusion. Factors such as the complexity of the case, backlog in the court, and willingness of both parties to negotiate can affect the duration.4. Favorability of Laws: The perception that laws are not favorable to husbands in divorce cases in India is common. However, the laws are meant to ensure fair treatment for both parties based on the specific circumstances of the case. It's not advisable for anyone to give up without seeking legal advice and exploring available options. Sometimes, out-of-court settlements through mediation or negotiation might be more beneficial for both parties.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,It is not mandatory to go through mediation again in Bhubaneshwar court if you are not interested. However, the court may still order mediation if it feels that it would be helpful. If you choose not to go to mediation, the court may proceed with the divorce case without your consent.The court will also consider the fact that mediation has already failed in the Supreme Court. This may make it more likely that the court will order mediation in Bhubaneshwar. However, the final decision will be up to the judge.If you choose to fight the case, the court will likely hear arguments from both sides and then make a decision about whether to grant the divorce. The court will consider all of the relevant factors, including the reasons for the divorce, the evidence presented by both sides.It is important to speak to your lawyer about your options and to get their advice on how to proceed. he will be able to help you understand the law and the court's likely decision.Here are some of the possible consequences of choosing not to go to mediation in Bhubaneshwar:The court may order mediation anyway.The court may take longer to reach a decision.The court may be less likely to grant the divorce.It is important to weigh the pros and cons of mediation before making a decision.

Hence, there is no requirement for the signatures of B or C on the gift deed. It should be noted that the property owned by A is not ancestral, making D's claim unsustainable. The claim made by D lacks validity, as the gift deed does not necessitate D's signature, and thus, D cannot assert any share in the property.

    "question": "Married in India divorced in USA",
    "answer": "In India, if a husband has been served with a summons for divorce proceedings and fails to appear in court, the court can proceed with an \"ex parte divorce\" order. An ex parte divorce decree is considered valid in India and effectively breaks the marital tie between the couple, rendering them legally competent to remarry. This legal effect is no different from a decree obtained through contested divorce proceedings.According to a ruling by the Delhi High Court, even in cases where the divorce is granted ex parte, meaning one party was absent during the proceedings, the remarriage of either party is lawful if no appeal is filed against the decree within the stipulated time. In other words, as long as there is no appeal lodged within the period of limitation, the ex parte divorce decree allows either party to the marriage to remarry without any legal hindrance.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, a moral duty is cast upon the residents in such multi-dwellings that they take proper care of their pets so that they are not a nuisance or threat to fellow residents. Also, it is their moral duty to clear the pet droppings in the common areas themselves, as in done in the USA and other Western countries, from the point of view of hygiene and healthy ambience inside the residential complex.Swaminathan NeelakantanAdvocate, Coimbatore3023 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Swaminathan Neelakantan"

    "question": "Rule with respect to pets by Apartment Association",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the absence of specific central or state laws mandating pet owners to clean up after their pets, housing associations do not possess the authority to impose any rules, regulations, or by-laws that make it mandatory for pet owners to clean up pet excreta. However, the association does have the right to request pet owners to responsibly clean up after their pets for the well-being and cleanliness of the community.Furthermore, housing associations do not have the power to restrict the timing of when pet owners can take their pets for walks in the common areas of the society. Pet owners should be allowed to use these spaces responsibly and at their convenience, as long as they clean up after their pets.Additionally, it is unlawful for a housing society to prohibit pets from utilizing common facilities such as lifts and parks or impose fines or special charges for pet owners using these amenities with their pets. Discrimination against pet owners in this manner goes against their rights to access the same facilities as other residents.If the association attempts to impose fines on pet owners whose pets are found relieving themselves within the campus, the affected individuals have the right to issue a legal notice to the association. Such fines are not enforceable without proper legal backing or relevant legislation. Pet owners are encouraged to be responsible for their pets and clean up after them, but the imposition of fines without legal grounds is unacceptable.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "In the given scenario, it appears that Ravi's mother, Ravi's son, and Ravi's daughter are the legal heirs of Ravi's estate, each with a 33% share. Since Ravi's properties are still in his name and have not been divided among the legal heirs, the following situations could arise:Ravi's Mother Writing a Will/Gift Deed: Ravi's mother, being one of the legal heirs, can potentially write a will or gift deed to transfer her 33% share of Ravi's properties to someone else. However, if the properties are not yet divided among the legal heirs, she can only bequeath or gift her share in those undivided properties. The rights of the other legal heirs (Ravi's son and daughter) to their respective 33% shares will remain intact.Ravi's Mother's Share Dissolving Among All Legal Heirs: If Ravi's mother passes away without leaving a will or gift deed, her 33% share in Ravi's properties would typically devolve according to the laws of intestate succession. In the case of Hindu family, if a person dies intestate (without a will), the distribution of their estate is governed by theHindu Succession Act, 1956.According to theHindu Succession Act, in the absence of a will or other testamentary disposition, Ravi's mother's 33% share would be divided equally among all her Class I legal heirs, which include her sons (Ravi and his brothers), and the distribution would be as follows:Ravi's Son (Ravi's grandson): 33% (initially his own 33% share) + 33% (1/4th of Ravi's mother's 33% share) = 66% or 33% each (assuming no other grandchildren)Ravi's Daughter (Ravi's granddaughter): 33% (initially her own 33% share) + 33% (1/4th of Ravi's mother's 33% share) = 66% or 33% eachRavi's Brothers: Each would receive 33% (1/4th of Ravi's mother's 33% share) = 33% eachRavi's Mother's Share Dissolving Only Among Ravi's Son and Daughter: If Ravi's mother's share dissolves only among Ravi's son and daughter, and she does not have any other children apart from Ravi, then her 33% share would be divided equally between Ravi's son and daughter, resulting in each receiving 16.5% (33%/2) of Ravi's properties.Please note that the actual distribution of the estate would depend on the specific laws of intestate succession applicable in the relevant jurisdiction.Sanjeev GuptaAdvocate, Delhi118 Answers1 ConsultationTalk to Advocate Sanjeev Gupta"

    "question": "Property got as legal heir",
    "answer": "Dear Client,If the settlement was a gift made by Ravi's father to Ravi in 2011, it's crucial to examine the terms of the settlement deed. The deed may specify whether the gifted properties are solely for Ravi's benefit or if they are intended to benefit the entire family including his mother. In India, inheritance laws for Hindus are governed by various acts such as theHindu Succession Act, 1956, and amendments thereto. These laws provide rights to family members in the event of intestate succession (i.e., when there is no will). Under these laws, Ravi's mother would typically have a share in his properties, including the settlement properties, along with his wife, son, and daughter. If the settlement deed explicitly mentions that the properties are solely for Ravi's benefit and do not include his mother or any other family members, it could affect the rights of his mother to those specific properties. Courts may interpret the settlement deed and relevant laws to determine the rights of Ravi's mother. They may consider factors such as the intention of the parties involved in the settlement and the overall family arrangement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Therefore, the share of each person depends on the number of heirs.- Per strip distribution method is used in the Shia law, and according to this method, the property gets distributed among the heirs according to the strip they belong to, and hence the quantum of their inheritance also depends upon the branch and the number of persons that belong to the branch.-Further, there is no distinction between the right of men and women; each has right over the said property.- However, a female will get half of the male share , and hence your mother has right over the property being one of the legal heir- Hence, they cannot sell the property without her consent , and if they are doing so then your mother can file an Injunction suit before the court for restraining them from selling the property.- Further, your mother can send them a legal notice for the partition of the property- You can enquire from the office of the sub-registrar to trace the details of the property in the name of your grandfather.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "DV case and divorce",
    "answer": "Dear Client,If you get a divorce, the DV case hearings will not automatically end. The court will need to decide whether the DV allegations are true, and whether the wife is entitled to any relief under theDomestic ViolenceAct. If the court finds that the wife has been subjected todomestic violence, it may order you to pay compensation, provide maintenance, or grant her a residence order.Yes, you can file a defamation and mental cruelty case against your wife for filing a false DV case against you. Defamation is the act of making false statements about someone that damage their reputation. Mental cruelty is the intentional infliction of emotional distress on someone. If you can prove that your wife filed the DV case against you knowing that it was false, and that she did so in order to harm you, you may be able to win a defamation and mental cruelty case against her.The length of time it takes to get a divorce varies depending on the facts of the case. If there are no children or property to divide, and the parties are in agreement about the terms of the divorce, it may be possible to get a divorce in a few months. However, if there are children or property involved, or if the parties are not in agreement about the terms of the divorce, it may take several years to get a divorce.Yes, you will need to attend the hearings for both the divorce case and the DV case until they are both concluded.

However, the association does have the right to request pet owners to responsibly clean up after their pets for the well-being and cleanliness of the community.Furthermore, housing associations do not have the power to restrict the timing of when pet owners can take their pets for walks in the common areas of the society. Pet owners should be allowed to use these spaces responsibly and at their convenience, as long as they clean up after their pets.Additionally, it is unlawful for a housing society to prohibit pets from utilizing common facilities such as lifts and parks or impose fines or special charges for pet owners using these amenities with their pets. Discrimination against pet owners in this manner goes against their rights to access the same facilities as other residents.If the association attempts to impose fines on pet owners whose pets are found relieving themselves within the campus, the affected individuals have the right to issue a legal notice to the association. Such fines are not enforceable without proper legal backing or relevant legislation. Pet owners are encouraged to be responsible for their pets and clean up after them, but the imposition of fines without legal grounds is unacceptable.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Married in India divorced in USA",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The validity of an ex-parte divorce decree in India is contingent upon the husband's participation in the divorce proceedings. Therefore, if the husband has not taken part in the divorce proceedings, the ex-parte divorce decree is considered invalid in India. Consequently, even if you are legally divorced in the United States, your marital status may still be recognized in India. To obtain a divorce recognized by Indian law, you can file for divorce in India based on any of the grounds recognized by theHindu Marriage Act(HMA). It is important to note that obtaining an ex-parte divorce decree in India would be sufficient to remove your husband's name from your passport, enabling you to renew it. However, it is not possible to apply for a divorce online in India, and a no-fault divorce obtained abroad would not be recognized in India. To proceed with a divorce in India, you would need to personally come to the country to apply for the divorce.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Married in India divorced in USA",
    "answer": "In India, if a husband has been served with a summons for divorce proceedings and fails to appear in court, the court can proceed with an \"ex parte divorce\" order. An ex parte divorce decree is considered valid in India and effectively breaks the marital tie between the couple, rendering them legally competent to remarry. This legal effect is no different from a decree obtained through contested divorce proceedings.According to a ruling by the Delhi High Court, even in cases where the divorce is granted ex parte, meaning one party was absent during the proceedings, the remarriage of either party is lawful if no appeal is filed against the decree within the stipulated time. In other words, as long as there is no appeal lodged within the period of limitation, the ex parte divorce decree allows either party to the marriage to remarry without any legal hindrance.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Rule with respect to pets by Apartment Association",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the absence of specific central or state laws mandating pet owners to clean up after their pets, housing associations do not possess the authority to impose any rules, regulations, or by-laws that make it mandatory for pet owners to clean up pet excreta. However, the association does have the right to request pet owners to responsibly clean up after their pets for the well-being and cleanliness of the community.Furthermore, housing associations do not have the power to restrict the timing of when pet owners can take their pets for walks in the common areas of the society. Pet owners should be allowed to use these spaces responsibly and at their convenience, as long as they clean up after their pets.Additionally, it is unlawful for a housing society to prohibit pets from utilizing common facilities such as lifts and parks or impose fines or special charges for pet owners using these amenities with their pets. Discrimination against pet owners in this manner goes against their rights to access the same facilities as other residents.If the association attempts to impose fines on pet owners whose pets are found relieving themselves within the campus, the affected individuals have the right to issue a legal notice to the association. Such fines are not enforceable without proper legal backing or relevant legislation. Pet owners are encouraged to be responsible for their pets and clean up after them, but the imposition of fines without legal grounds is unacceptable.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Will validity",
    "answer": "Intestate Succession: Since your father passed away without leaving a will, his properties, including the ancestral house and the shop, would be inherited by his legal heirs as per theHindu Succession Act, 1956. The legal heirs in the case of a Hindu male dying intestate are his widow (your mother) and children (you and your brothers). The properties would be divided equally among the widow and the children.Ancestral Property: Ancestral property has a specific definition under Hindu law. It refers to property that is inherited up to four generations of male lineage, and all male descendants in those generations have an equal right to it. If the second house is genuinely ancestral property, your father would have been a co-owner with his brothers, and upon his passing, his share would devolve upon his legal heirs, including his widow and children.Will and Partition: If your mother made a will where she purportedly transferred all the properties solely to one of your brothers, this action could potentially be challenged in court. The legality of the will and its validity would be subject to examination. Under Hindu law, a person has the right to bequeath their self-acquired property through a will, but the same principles do not apply to ancestral property. Ancestral property devolves through intestate succession and not through a will.Challenging the Will: To challenge the validity of the will, you may need to present evidence or raise objections on various grounds, such as the authenticity of the will, the mental capacity of your mother when making the will, coercion, undue influence, or fraud. Additionally, if the properties are indeed ancestral, the will's claim to transfer them exclusively to one brother may be legally untenable.Sanjeev GuptaAdvocate, Delhi118 Answers1 ConsultationTalk to Advocate Sanjeev Gupta"

    "answer": "In India, if a husband has been served with a summons for divorce proceedings and fails to appear in court, the court can proceed with an \"ex parte divorce\" order. An ex parte divorce decree is considered valid in India and effectively breaks the marital tie between the couple, rendering them legally competent to remarry. This legal effect is no different from a decree obtained through contested divorce proceedings.According to a ruling by the Delhi High Court, even in cases where the divorce is granted ex parte, meaning one party was absent during the proceedings, the remarriage of either party is lawful if no appeal is filed against the decree within the stipulated time. In other words, as long as there is no appeal lodged within the period of limitation, the ex parte divorce decree allows either party to the marriage to remarry without any legal hindrance.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The court will need to decide whether the DV allegations are true, and whether the wife is entitled to any relief under theDomestic ViolenceAct. If the court finds that the wife has been subjected todomestic violence, it may order you to pay compensation, provide maintenance, or grant her a residence order.Yes, you can file a defamation and mental cruelty case against your wife for filing a false DV case against you. Defamation is the act of making false statements about someone that damage their reputation. Mental cruelty is the intentional infliction of emotional distress on someone. If you can prove that your wife filed the DV case against you knowing that it was false, and that she did so in order to harm you, you may be able to win a defamation and mental cruelty case against her.The length of time it takes to get a divorce varies depending on the facts of the case. If there are no children or property to divide, and the parties are in agreement about the terms of the divorce, it may be possible to get a divorce in a few months.

    "question": "Divorce under mutual consent",
    "answer": "According to the law, adivorce by mutual consentis considered final and binding, leaving no room for either party to challenge it in any court. This type of divorce is based on the agreement and consent of both parties, meaning they cannot go back on their decision or breach the terms they have agreed upon. Therefore, the Decree issued as a result of mutual consent and the agreed-upon settlement is considered definitive and cannot be contested by your wife. Any attempt by her to violate the agreement and decisions made would be regarded as Contempt of Court, which is a serious offense. Furthermore, if custody of any children was granted to you as part of the mutual divorce agreement, she would not be able to request a change in custody at a later time. It is important to note that human rights considerations do not typically come into play when the court has already issued its order.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Discrimination against pet owners in this manner goes against their rights to access the same facilities as other residents.If the association attempts to impose fines on pet owners whose pets are found relieving themselves within the campus, the affected individuals have the right to issue a legal notice to the association. Such fines are not enforceable without proper legal backing or relevant legislation.

    "question": "Married in India divorced in USA",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The validity of an ex-parte divorce decree in India is contingent upon the husband's participation in the divorce proceedings. Therefore, if the husband has not taken part in the divorce proceedings, the ex-parte divorce decree is considered invalid in India. Consequently, even if you are legally divorced in the United States, your marital status may still be recognized in India. To obtain a divorce recognized by Indian law, you can file for divorce in India based on any of the grounds recognized by theHindu Marriage Act(HMA). It is important to note that obtaining an ex-parte divorce decree in India would be sufficient to remove your husband's name from your passport, enabling you to renew it. However, it is not possible to apply for a divorce online in India, and a no-fault divorce obtained abroad would not be recognized in India. To proceed with a divorce in India, you would need to personally come to the country to apply for the divorce.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Married in India divorced in USA",
    "answer": "In India, if a husband has been served with a summons for divorce proceedings and fails to appear in court, the court can proceed with an \"ex parte divorce\" order. An ex parte divorce decree is considered valid in India and effectively breaks the marital tie between the couple, rendering them legally competent to remarry. This legal effect is no different from a decree obtained through contested divorce proceedings.According to a ruling by the Delhi High Court, even in cases where the divorce is granted ex parte, meaning one party was absent during the proceedings, the remarriage of either party is lawful if no appeal is filed against the decree within the stipulated time. In other words, as long as there is no appeal lodged within the period of limitation, the ex parte divorce decree allows either party to the marriage to remarry without any legal hindrance.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Therefore, the Decree issued as a result of mutual consent and the agreed-upon settlement is considered definitive and cannot be contested by your wife. Any attempt by her to violate the agreement and decisions made would be regarded as Contempt of Court, which is a serious offense. Furthermore, if custody of any children was granted to you as part of the mutual divorce agreement, she would not be able to request a change in custody at a later time.

    "answer": "Dear Client,The validity of an ex-parte divorce decree in India is contingent upon the husband's participation in the divorce proceedings. Therefore, if the husband has not taken part in the divorce proceedings, the ex-parte divorce decree is considered invalid in India. Consequently, even if you are legally divorced in the United States, your marital status may still be recognized in India. To obtain a divorce recognized by Indian law, you can file for divorce in India based on any of the grounds recognized by theHindu Marriage Act(HMA). It is important to note that obtaining an ex-parte divorce decree in India would be sufficient to remove your husband's name from your passport, enabling you to renew it. However, it is not possible to apply for a divorce online in India, and a no-fault divorce obtained abroad would not be recognized in India.

    "question": "Married in India divorced in USA",
    "answer": "In India, if a husband has been served with a summons for divorce proceedings and fails to appear in court, the court can proceed with an \"ex parte divorce\" order. An ex parte divorce decree is considered valid in India and effectively breaks the marital tie between the couple, rendering them legally competent to remarry. This legal effect is no different from a decree obtained through contested divorce proceedings.According to a ruling by the Delhi High Court, even in cases where the divorce is granted ex parte, meaning one party was absent during the proceedings, the remarriage of either party is lawful if no appeal is filed against the decree within the stipulated time. In other words, as long as there is no appeal lodged within the period of limitation, the ex parte divorce decree allows either party to the marriage to remarry without any legal hindrance.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,If you get a divorce, the DV case hearings will not automatically end. The court will need to decide whether the DV allegations are true, and whether the wife is entitled to any relief under theDomestic ViolenceAct. If the court finds that the wife has been subjected todomestic violence, it may order you to pay compensation, provide maintenance, or grant her a residence order.Yes, you can file a defamation and mental cruelty case against your wife for filing a false DV case against you. Defamation is the act of making false statements about someone that damage their reputation. Mental cruelty is the intentional infliction of emotional distress on someone. If you can prove that your wife filed the DV case against you knowing that it was false, and that she did so in order to harm you, you may be able to win a defamation and mental cruelty case against her.The length of time it takes to get a divorce varies depending on the facts of the case. If there are no children or property to divide, and the parties are in agreement about the terms of the divorce, it may be possible to get a divorce in a few months. However, if there are children or property involved, or if the parties are not in agreement about the terms of the divorce, it may take several years to get a divorce.Yes, you will need to attend the hearings for both the divorce case and the DV case until they are both concluded.

    "answer": "Dear Client,The validity of an ex-parte divorce decree in India is contingent upon the husband's participation in the divorce proceedings. Therefore, if the husband has not taken part in the divorce proceedings, the ex-parte divorce decree is considered invalid in India. Consequently, even if you are legally divorced in the United States, your marital status may still be recognized in India. To obtain a divorce recognized by Indian law, you can file for divorce in India based on any of the grounds recognized by theHindu Marriage Act(HMA). It is important to note that obtaining an ex-parte divorce decree in India would be sufficient to remove your husband's name from your passport, enabling you to renew it. However, it is not possible to apply for a divorce online in India, and a no-fault divorce obtained abroad would not be recognized in India.

    "question": "Married in India divorced in USA",
    "answer": "In India, if a husband has been served with a summons for divorce proceedings and fails to appear in court, the court can proceed with an \"ex parte divorce\" order. An ex parte divorce decree is considered valid in India and effectively breaks the marital tie between the couple, rendering them legally competent to remarry. This legal effect is no different from a decree obtained through contested divorce proceedings.According to a ruling by the Delhi High Court, even in cases where the divorce is granted ex parte, meaning one party was absent during the proceedings, the remarriage of either party is lawful if no appeal is filed against the decree within the stipulated time. In other words, as long as there is no appeal lodged within the period of limitation, the ex parte divorce decree allows either party to the marriage to remarry without any legal hindrance.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Divorce under mutual consent",
    "answer": "According to the law, adivorce by mutual consentis considered final and binding, leaving no room for either party to challenge it in any court. This type of divorce is based on the agreement and consent of both parties, meaning they cannot go back on their decision or breach the terms they have agreed upon. Therefore, the Decree issued as a result of mutual consent and the agreed-upon settlement is considered definitive and cannot be contested by your wife. Any attempt by her to violate the agreement and decisions made would be regarded as Contempt of Court, which is a serious offense. Furthermore, if custody of any children was granted to you as part of the mutual divorce agreement, she would not be able to request a change in custody at a later time. It is important to note that human rights considerations do not typically come into play when the court has already issued its order.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "In India, if a husband has been served with a summons for divorce proceedings and fails to appear in court, the court can proceed with an \"ex parte divorce\" order. An ex parte divorce decree is considered valid in India and effectively breaks the marital tie between the couple, rendering them legally competent to remarry. This legal effect is no different from a decree obtained through contested divorce proceedings.According to a ruling by the Delhi High Court, even in cases where the divorce is granted ex parte, meaning one party was absent during the proceedings, the remarriage of either party is lawful if no appeal is filed against the decree within the stipulated time. In other words, as long as there is no appeal lodged within the period of limitation, the ex parte divorce decree allows either party to the marriage to remarry without any legal hindrance.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Divorce under mutual consent",
    "answer": "According to the law, adivorce by mutual consentis considered final and binding, leaving no room for either party to challenge it in any court. This type of divorce is based on the agreement and consent of both parties, meaning they cannot go back on their decision or breach the terms they have agreed upon. Therefore, the Decree issued as a result of mutual consent and the agreed-upon settlement is considered definitive and cannot be contested by your wife. Any attempt by her to violate the agreement and decisions made would be regarded as Contempt of Court, which is a serious offense. Furthermore, if custody of any children was granted to you as part of the mutual divorce agreement, she would not be able to request a change in custody at a later time.

    "answer": "Dear Client,The validity of an ex-parte divorce decree in India is contingent upon the husband's participation in the divorce proceedings. Therefore, if the husband has not taken part in the divorce proceedings, the ex-parte divorce decree is considered invalid in India. Consequently, even if you are legally divorced in the United States, your marital status may still be recognized in India. To obtain a divorce recognized by Indian law, you can file for divorce in India based on any of the grounds recognized by theHindu Marriage Act(HMA). It is important to note that obtaining an ex-parte divorce decree in India would be sufficient to remove your husband's name from your passport, enabling you to renew it. However, it is not possible to apply for a divorce online in India, and a no-fault divorce obtained abroad would not be recognized in India.

    "question": "Married in India divorced in USA",
    "answer": "In India, if a husband has been served with a summons for divorce proceedings and fails to appear in court, the court can proceed with an \"ex parte divorce\" order. An ex parte divorce decree is considered valid in India and effectively breaks the marital tie between the couple, rendering them legally competent to remarry. This legal effect is no different from a decree obtained through contested divorce proceedings.According to a ruling by the Delhi High Court, even in cases where the divorce is granted ex parte, meaning one party was absent during the proceedings, the remarriage of either party is lawful if no appeal is filed against the decree within the stipulated time. In other words, as long as there is no appeal lodged within the period of limitation, the ex parte divorce decree allows either party to the marriage to remarry without any legal hindrance.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,If you get a divorce, the DV case hearings will not automatically end. The court will need to decide whether the DV allegations are true, and whether the wife is entitled to any relief under theDomestic ViolenceAct. If the court finds that the wife has been subjected todomestic violence, it may order you to pay compensation, provide maintenance, or grant her a residence order.Yes, you can file a defamation and mental cruelty case against your wife for filing a false DV case against you. Defamation is the act of making false statements about someone that damage their reputation. Mental cruelty is the intentional infliction of emotional distress on someone. If you can prove that your wife filed the DV case against you knowing that it was false, and that she did so in order to harm you, you may be able to win a defamation and mental cruelty case against her.The length of time it takes to get a divorce varies depending on the facts of the case. If there are no children or property to divide, and the parties are in agreement about the terms of the divorce, it may be possible to get a divorce in a few months. However, if there are children or property involved, or if the parties are not in agreement about the terms of the divorce, it may take several years to get a divorce.Yes, you will need to attend the hearings for both the divorce case and the DV case until they are both concluded.

    "question": "Divorce under mutual consent",
    "answer": "According to the law, adivorce by mutual consentis considered final and binding, leaving no room for either party to challenge it in any court. This type of divorce is based on the agreement and consent of both parties, meaning they cannot go back on their decision or breach the terms they have agreed upon. Therefore, the Decree issued as a result of mutual consent and the agreed-upon settlement is considered definitive and cannot be contested by your wife. Any attempt by her to violate the agreement and decisions made would be regarded as Contempt of Court, which is a serious offense. Furthermore, if custody of any children was granted to you as part of the mutual divorce agreement, she would not be able to request a change in custody at a later time. It is important to note that human rights considerations do not typically come into play when the court has already issued its order.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Therefore, if the husband has not taken part in the divorce proceedings, the ex-parte divorce decree is considered invalid in India. Consequently, even if you are legally divorced in the United States, your marital status may still be recognized in India.

It is important to note that obtaining an ex-parte divorce decree in India would be sufficient to remove your husband's name from your passport, enabling you to renew it. However, it is not possible to apply for a divorce online in India, and a no-fault divorce obtained abroad would not be recognized in India.

    "question": "Married in India divorced in USA",
    "answer": "In India, if a husband has been served with a summons for divorce proceedings and fails to appear in court, the court can proceed with an \"ex parte divorce\" order. An ex parte divorce decree is considered valid in India and effectively breaks the marital tie between the couple, rendering them legally competent to remarry. This legal effect is no different from a decree obtained through contested divorce proceedings.According to a ruling by the Delhi High Court, even in cases where the divorce is granted ex parte, meaning one party was absent during the proceedings, the remarriage of either party is lawful if no appeal is filed against the decree within the stipulated time. In other words, as long as there is no appeal lodged within the period of limitation, the ex parte divorce decree allows either party to the marriage to remarry without any legal hindrance.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Even an exparte decree obtained in the USA is valid in India except a decree or proceedings of a foreign court are vexatious or oppressive! Even if a divorce is obtained for an 'irretrievable breakdown of marriage\", the same is valid in India though such ground is not available in Indian laws.

    "answer": "Dear Client,If you get a divorce, the DV case hearings will not automatically end.

If the court finds that the wife has been subjected todomestic violence, it may order you to pay compensation, provide maintenance, or grant her a residence order.Yes, you can file a defamation and mental cruelty case against your wife for filing a false DV case against you. Defamation is the act of making false statements about someone that damage their reputation. Mental cruelty is the intentional infliction of emotional distress on someone.

If there are no children or property to divide, and the parties are in agreement about the terms of the divorce, it may be possible to get a divorce in a few months.

This type of divorce is based on the agreement and consent of both parties, meaning they cannot go back on their decision or breach the terms they have agreed upon. Therefore, the Decree issued as a result of mutual consent and the agreed-upon settlement is considered definitive and cannot be contested by your wife. Any attempt by her to violate the agreement and decisions made would be regarded as Contempt of Court, which is a serious offense. Furthermore, if custody of any children was granted to you as part of the mutual divorce agreement, she would not be able to request a change in custody at a later time.

    "answer": "The share certificate is not a title document to confirm the ownership of the proeprty to the owner.The share certificate is just recognise the owner as a member of the RWA.There is no such bylaw forbidding the new owner to become a member with an application for membership without the signature of the seller.The sellers might have sold the property and absconded to avoid payment of transfer fee to the society.The registrar has not insisted on NOC from the society to register the sale deed in favor of the buyer to purchase the property.All these indicate that these are not mandatory requirement  as per law, hence the society can use its discretion as an conceptional case to issue the transfer certificate in favor of the buyer without the signature of the seller.If the previous original share certificate has been reported to have been lost, then the formalities like a  police complaint, a public notice in a local newspaper and an indemnity bond from the member may be obtained to protect the future  the interests of the society.It is discretionary and not mandatory, hence you can take a decision after a meeting with the MC members about this  in case you feel that your individual decision may put you in trouble at a later stage.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88763 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Transfer of flat whose seller is not traceable and share certificate lost",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Sure, here are the rewritten sentences:First flat:If the sale and purchase documents are intact and duly executed and registered, then the fact that the seller's signature is missing from the society's internal transfer document is not a valid reason to refuse to transfer the share in the name of the purchaser. The transfer document is an internal document of the society, and it is not legally binding.The sale and purchase documents are the legally binding documents, and they are sufficient to prove that the purchaser is the rightful owner of the share. The society should not refuse to transfer the share based on the incomplete transfer document.Second flat:If the original share certificate is lost, then a police complaint must be filed to report the loss of the original. A public notice must also be published before a duplicate certificate can be issued. An affidavit to this effect should also be taken.The police complaint and public notice are necessary to ensure that the original share certificate is not being used by someone else.

    "context": "Asked 2 years ago in Property Law Religion: Christian",
    "question": "Transfer of flat whose seller is not traceable and share certificate lost",
    "answer": "The share certificate serves as recognition of the owner as a member of the RWA and does not act as a title document confirming property ownership. As there are no bylaws prohibiting a new owner from becoming a member without the seller's signature, the absence of the sellers may be due to their intention to evade transfer fees. The Registrar did not insist on an NOC from the society for the sale deed registration, suggesting that these requirements are not mandatory as per the law. Thus, the society may exercise its discretion to issue the transfer certificate to the buyer without the seller's signature. If the original share certificate is reported lost, the society can follow formalities like filing a police complaint, publishing a public notice, and obtaining an indemnity bond from the member to safeguard the society's interests. This decision can be taken collectively by the MC members during a meeting to avoid potential future complications."

If either parent is a direct Class 1 servant, their children are not eligible for NCL status, but if the parent is promoted to Class 1, the children become eligible. Similarly, if the father was initially recruited to Class 2 and later promoted to Class 1 before turning 40, NCL status will not apply.

    "answer": "- As per Muslim Law, the right of inheritance of property comes only after the death of a person.-  Further,  under Muslim Law, there is no distinction between the self acquired or ancestral property.- Further, distribution of property can be made in two ways, firstly per capita or per strip distribution.- Per – Capita distribution method is used in the Sunni law, and according to this method, the estate left over by the ancestors gets equally distributed among the heirs. Therefore, the share of each person depends on the number of heirs.- Per strip distribution method is used in the Shia law, and according to this method, the property gets distributed among the heirs according to the strip they belong to, and hence the quantum of their inheritance also depends upon the branch and the number of persons that belong to the branch.-Further, there is no distinction between the right of men and women; each has right over the said property.- However, a female will get half of the male share , and hence your mother has right over the property being one of the legal heir- Hence, they cannot sell the property without her consent , and if they are doing so then your mother can file an Injunction suit before the court for restraining them from selling the property.- Further, your mother can send them a legal notice for the partition of the property- You can enquire from the office of the sub-registrar to trace the details of the property in the name of your grandfather.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "In the given scenario, it appears that Ravi's mother, Ravi's son, and Ravi's daughter are the legal heirs of Ravi's estate, each with a 33% share. Since Ravi's properties are still in his name and have not been divided among the legal heirs, the following situations could arise:Ravi's Mother Writing a Will/Gift Deed: Ravi's mother, being one of the legal heirs, can potentially write a will or gift deed to transfer her 33% share of Ravi's properties to someone else. However, if the properties are not yet divided among the legal heirs, she can only bequeath or gift her share in those undivided properties. The rights of the other legal heirs (Ravi's son and daughter) to their respective 33% shares will remain intact.Ravi's Mother's Share Dissolving Among All Legal Heirs: If Ravi's mother passes away without leaving a will or gift deed, her 33% share in Ravi's properties would typically devolve according to the laws of intestate succession. In the case of Hindu family, if a person dies intestate (without a will), the distribution of their estate is governed by theHindu Succession Act, 1956.According to theHindu Succession Act, in the absence of a will or other testamentary disposition, Ravi's mother's 33% share would be divided equally among all her Class I legal heirs, which include her sons (Ravi and his brothers), and the distribution would be as follows:Ravi's Son (Ravi's grandson): 33% (initially his own 33% share) + 33% (1/4th of Ravi's mother's 33% share) = 66% or 33% each (assuming no other grandchildren)Ravi's Daughter (Ravi's granddaughter): 33% (initially her own 33% share) + 33% (1/4th of Ravi's mother's 33% share) = 66% or 33% eachRavi's Brothers: Each would receive 33% (1/4th of Ravi's mother's 33% share) = 33% eachRavi's Mother's Share Dissolving Only Among Ravi's Son and Daughter: If Ravi's mother's share dissolves only among Ravi's son and daughter, and she does not have any other children apart from Ravi, then her 33% share would be divided equally between Ravi's son and daughter, resulting in each receiving 16.5% (33%/2) of Ravi's properties.Please note that the actual distribution of the estate would depend on the specific laws of intestate succession applicable in the relevant jurisdiction.Sanjeev GuptaAdvocate, Delhi118 Answers1 ConsultationTalk to Advocate Sanjeev Gupta"

    "question": "Property got as legal heir",
    "answer": "Dear Client,If the settlement was a gift made by Ravi's father to Ravi in 2011, it's crucial to examine the terms of the settlement deed. The deed may specify whether the gifted properties are solely for Ravi's benefit or if they are intended to benefit the entire family including his mother. In India, inheritance laws for Hindus are governed by various acts such as theHindu Succession Act, 1956, and amendments thereto. These laws provide rights to family members in the event of intestate succession (i.e., when there is no will). Under these laws, Ravi's mother would typically have a share in his properties, including the settlement properties, along with his wife, son, and daughter. If the settlement deed explicitly mentions that the properties are solely for Ravi's benefit and do not include his mother or any other family members, it could affect the rights of his mother to those specific properties. Courts may interpret the settlement deed and relevant laws to determine the rights of Ravi's mother. They may consider factors such as the intention of the parties involved in the settlement and the overall family arrangement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Will validity",
    "answer": "Intestate Succession: Since your father passed away without leaving a will, his properties, including the ancestral house and the shop, would be inherited by his legal heirs as per theHindu Succession Act, 1956. The legal heirs in the case of a Hindu male dying intestate are his widow (your mother) and children (you and your brothers). The properties would be divided equally among the widow and the children.Ancestral Property: Ancestral property has a specific definition under Hindu law. It refers to property that is inherited up to four generations of male lineage, and all male descendants in those generations have an equal right to it. If the second house is genuinely ancestral property, your father would have been a co-owner with his brothers, and upon his passing, his share would devolve upon his legal heirs, including his widow and children.Will and Partition: If your mother made a will where she purportedly transferred all the properties solely to one of your brothers, this action could potentially be challenged in court. The legality of the will and its validity would be subject to examination. Under Hindu law, a person has the right to bequeath their self-acquired property through a will, but the same principles do not apply to ancestral property. Ancestral property devolves through intestate succession and not through a will.Challenging the Will: To challenge the validity of the will, you may need to present evidence or raise objections on various grounds, such as the authenticity of the will, the mental capacity of your mother when making the will, coercion, undue influence, or fraud. Additionally, if the properties are indeed ancestral, the will's claim to transfer them exclusively to one brother may be legally untenable.Sanjeev GuptaAdvocate, Delhi118 Answers1 ConsultationTalk to Advocate Sanjeev Gupta"

These documents will provide evidence of ownership and help in establishing her rightful claim.To obtain certified copies of the property documents, your mother can approach the sub-registrar office. They will have the necessary records and can provide the requested certified copies.If her siblings refuse to give her the share she is entitled to, your mother has the option to file a suit for partition. This legal action will seek the division of the property by metes and bounds, ensuring that each heir receives their rightful portion.During the legal proceedings, it is crucial for your mother to seek an injunction restraining the sale of the property by her siblings. This injunction will prevent any unauthorized or forced sale of the property until the matter is resolved through the partition suit.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "It is possible to take out property papers with just the grandfather's name and the address and the property tax receipt. However, it is important to note that the process may be more difficult without the registry copy. The property tax receipt is evidence that the property is in your family's possession, but it is not a definitive proof of ownership. The registry copy is the most important document when it comes to proving ownership of a property.You can send out a legal notice to the other brother without having the registry copy with you. However, it is important to note that the legal notice will not be as strong if you do not have the registry copy.

    "question": "Ancestral property",
    "answer": "- As per Muslim Law, the right of inheritance of property comes only after the death of a person.-  Further,  under Muslim Law, there is no distinction between the self acquired or ancestral property.- Further, distribution of property can be made in two ways, firstly per capita or per strip distribution.- Per – Capita distribution method is used in the Sunni law, and according to this method, the estate left over by the ancestors gets equally distributed among the heirs. Therefore, the share of each person depends on the number of heirs.- Per strip distribution method is used in the Shia law, and according to this method, the property gets distributed among the heirs according to the strip they belong to, and hence the quantum of their inheritance also depends upon the branch and the number of persons that belong to the branch.-Further, there is no distinction between the right of men and women; each has right over the said property.- However, a female will get half of the male share , and hence your mother has right over the property being one of the legal heir- Hence, they cannot sell the property without her consent , and if they are doing so then your mother can file an Injunction suit before the court for restraining them from selling the property.- Further, your mother can send them a legal notice for the partition of the property- You can enquire from the office of the sub-registrar to trace the details of the property in the name of your grandfather.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"
