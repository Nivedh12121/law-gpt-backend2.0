    "answer": "Dear client,In India, state-specific laws frequently regulate matters pertaining to property. You have legal options to make corrections if your ancestral property has been mistakenly labeled as private forest land. First, compile all pertinent data, such as the town planning zone certificate from 1997, the 7/12 and \"pher phar\" records, and any other proof that the land is still agricultural. Make contact with the District Collector, presenting this documentation and elucidating the disparity in the land's classification. As a public servant, the District Collector is qualified to examine and correct such mistakes. Should the problem continue, you can think about bringing a writ suit against the incorrect designation in the High Court under Article 226 of theIndian Constitution. Though it could take some time, this procedure is legal remedy to seek justice.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Reinventing Capital Gain tax",
    "answer": "Dear client,If the proceeds from the sale of one property are reinvested in another residential property, the individual may be free from capital gains tax under Indian tax regulations, specifically under Section 54 of the Income Tax Act. But the most important requirement is that the property in which the reinvestment is made must belong to the taxpayer. It could be difficult to claim complete capital gains tax exemption in the scenario you described if the daughter-in-law and the father-in-law are listed as joint owners on the selling deed and all of the sale's proceeds are invested in the new property. This is due to the possibility that the daughter-in-law may not be eligible for the Section 54 exemption because she is not the original property owner. It is best to have the father-in-law, who is the property's legitimate owner, included as the first name on the selling deed in order to optimize tax benefits. This guarantees that the capital gains exemption is clearer and complies with Section 54's requirements.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Inheritance from someone with no blood relation",
    "answer": "Dear client,Adherence to assets such as bank accounts and shares necessitates adherence to legal and tax requirements. Even though you've taken action to move the assets into your name, it's imperative to make sure that the paperwork is in order to prevent problems down the road. The transfer of shares into your name with regard to the demat account is a good step. To confirm the transfer, you must, however, update the records with the depository participant and supply the required paperwork. It's also a good idea to save all pertinent documents for later use. It is imperative that you update the savings accounts and FDs in your name with the banks and remove your uncle's name from them. To expedite this process, make sure you turn in the death certificate as soon as possible. In terms of taxes, inheritance is typically not subject to taxation in India. All income derived from the inherited assets, including interest from foreign funds and dividends from shares, will be subject to taxation based on the relevant income tax slabs. Make careful to track this revenue and appropriately declare it on your income tax filings.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Although the consultant is liable for any losses that arise, the agreement may not necessarily be void if they fail to uphold their end of the bargain. The wording, nonetheless, might be improved to more precisely state the repercussions of non-fulfillment without suggesting that the agreement is immediately nullified. Contracts in India are governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1872. The Act's Section 73 provides damages in the event of a violation, while Section 74 addresses penalties for breach of contract.

    "answer": "Dear client,Transferring property ownership in India without a registered sale deed presents some difficulties, however there may be ways around them. In order to prove your ownership, you should execute a gift deed in accordance with Section 122 of theTransfer of Property Act, 1882. Your father may receive the property as a gift from the original landowner's wife without having to pay for it.Gift Deed: Write a Gift Deed that expresses your intention to give the property away for free. The deed must be signed by the two parties and two witnesses.Stamp Duty and Registration: Register the Gift Deed at the sub-registrar office and pay the required stamp duty based on the value of the property. This confirms the transfer in accordance with Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908.Affidavit: Enclose an affidavit attesting to the voluntary nature of the transaction with the Gift Deed, written by the original landowner's wife.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Even though the seller is confident that they will get a new Index II in your name, you should proceed with care. It is advised that you postpone paying stamp duty and other formalities until you obtain the entire set of paperwork, including the Index II. Ignoring this crucial paperwork could result in future legal issues. Before completing the real estate purchase, demand to see the entire set of paperwork to safeguard your interests.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,It is imperative that you highlight the equal opportunity and non-discrimination principles outlined in Article 16 of theIndian Constitutionin the context of your case. Rule 11(5)'s wide interpretation of the term \"acquiring\" should include people who earned doctorate degrees prior to enlisting in the military. It is possible to bring up the constitutional requirement for equal treatment, highlighting the fact that it is against the spirit of meritocracy and equal opportunity to exclude people based only on when they obtained their degree. Furthermore, Section 14 of the Limitation Act may be used to argue that the length of time between the advertisement and appointment should not disfavor candidates with advanced qualifications and that the recruiting process's delay was due to circumstances beyond of your control. You could make a stronger case by citing pertinent case laws that read identical terms generously and in favor of employees who want to promote based on better qualifications.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,If the proceeds from the sale of one property are reinvested in another residential property, the individual may be free from capital gains tax under Indian tax regulations, specifically under Section 54 of the Income Tax Act. But the most important requirement is that the property in which the reinvestment is made must belong to the taxpayer. It could be difficult to claim complete capital gains tax exemption in the scenario you described if the daughter-in-law and the father-in-law are listed as joint owners on the selling deed and all of the sale's proceeds are invested in the new property. This is due to the possibility that the daughter-in-law may not be eligible for the Section 54 exemption because she is not the original property owner. It is best to have the father-in-law, who is the property's legitimate owner, included as the first name on the selling deed in order to optimize tax benefits. This guarantees that the capital gains exemption is clearer and complies with Section 54's requirements.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If there are no children, the surviving spouse, siblings (such as your father), and their offspring make up the Class I heirs. Self-acquired property is typically considered differently from ancestral property when it comes to the residence purchased with earnings from ancestral property. Since the money from the sale of the ancestral property were used to purchase the house, it's possible that the property was self-acquired, which would disqualify you as a legitimate heir. If your uncle and his wife die without a will, any surviving Class I heirs, such as your father's siblings, may receive their properties.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Even though you've taken action to move the assets into your name, it's imperative to make sure that the paperwork is in order to prevent problems down the road. The transfer of shares into your name with regard to the demat account is a good step. To confirm the transfer, you must, however, update the records with the depository participant and supply the required paperwork. It's also a good idea to save all pertinent documents for later use. It is imperative that you update the savings accounts and FDs in your name with the banks and remove your uncle's name from them. To expedite this process, make sure you turn in the death certificate as soon as possible. In terms of taxes, inheritance is typically not subject to taxation in India. All income derived from the inherited assets, including interest from foreign funds and dividends from shares, will be subject to taxation based on the relevant income tax slabs.

    "question": "Maintenance for divorce",
    "answer": "Dear client,The length of the marriage, the style of living, and unique circumstances are some of the variables that can affect the amount and duration of alimony. Alimony can be awarded in India for a respectable amount of time, usually half the length of the marriage.The standard of living, possessions, and income of the spouse all play a role in determining how much alimony is granted. It's possible that your respective incomes and savings will be taken into account when calculating alimony.Sometimes parties will agree on lump sum settlements, but in order to guard against future claims, it's imperative to have a legally enforceable agreement in place.Transferring assets to escape alimony responsibilities might not be a legally sound move in terms of property transfers. When deciding alimony, courts may take these actions into account.Since laws can differ, it is best to speak with an attorney to understand how infidelity may affect the divorce process. Remember that using audio recordings as evidence could have legal ramifications as well, so it's best to speak with a legal professional about these.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Maintenance for divorce",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, alimony or maintenance payments are made in lump sums rather than being strictly based on a husband's net worth percentage. To calculate a fair and just sum, the court takes into account a number of variables, including the husband's income, assets, and way of life. According to the wife's necessities and the husband's financial situation, the court may grant maintenance under Section 25 of theHindu Marriage Actand Section 125 of theCode of Criminal Procedure. Usually, to determine your net worth, you deduct your liabilities from your assets. Since you stated that you make 3 lakhs a month and have 2 crores in savings, your net worth would be the sum of your savings less any obligations or liabilities. It's crucial to remember that courts take into account a variety of criteria when making maintenance judgments, so the amount of alimony given may not necessarily match the results of this net worth assessment.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Ofcourse the society will be within its right to charge separately to the member for making good such damage by his tenant.

Housing societies in India usually formulate its regulations in accordance with the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960. The Act does not specifically govern the distinction between self-occupied and rented apartments, but it does provide organizations the power to impose maintenance fees. Any discriminatory action, therefore, must abide by the equality principles outlined in Article 14 of theIndian Constitution. The bylaws of the society may be legally enforceable if they expressly declare these requirements. The ₹500 monthly penalty and 21% annual interest rate, however, may be examined for reasonableness.

    "answer": "Dear client,If the proceeds from the sale of one property are reinvested in another residential property, the individual may be free from capital gains tax under Indian tax regulations, specifically under Section 54 of the Income Tax Act. But the most important requirement is that the property in which the reinvestment is made must belong to the taxpayer. It could be difficult to claim complete capital gains tax exemption in the scenario you described if the daughter-in-law and the father-in-law are listed as joint owners on the selling deed and all of the sale's proceeds are invested in the new property. This is due to the possibility that the daughter-in-law may not be eligible for the Section 54 exemption because she is not the original property owner. It is best to have the father-in-law, who is the property's legitimate owner, included as the first name on the selling deed in order to optimize tax benefits. This guarantees that the capital gains exemption is clearer and complies with Section 54's requirements.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,As a holder of a New Zealand passport, you are able to keep ownership of your ancestral property in India while applying for an OCI card. You are entitled to inherit and own immovable property, including ancestral land, if you have an OCI card. The Citizenship Act of 1955 and the OCI rules comprise the pertinent legal framework. But it's important to abide by state regulations that are unique to inheritance of property, such the Himachal Pradesh Tenancy and Land Reforms Act in the Shimla district's case. It is not a threat to your property rights to have an OCI card; however, a smooth transfer of ownership depends on following local laws and due process.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Equal Fee for All, but it is common in the association , where all the villas are of same sized.2. The most commonly used method is Area Wise maintenance charge, A rate is fixed for one square feet and then multiplied by the total square feet area of the Villa in this method. It means that if you have a larger home, you will end up paying more.- Further, the common areas are divided equally using a fixed rate while flats are calculated depending on the size of the villa .3. Partially Equal Fee i.e. particular amount of money is charged on the area up to a predetermined square feet value, and beyond that, any increment in area is charged according to a unit decided by the association.4.Hybrid Charges , i.e. Splitting the charges into two with the first part including all the common expenses incurred on security staff salary, stationary, property taxes, conveyance, audit fees, meeting charges, common electricity etc. , and the second part includes the area based charges that are specific to the association such as water charge and electricity usage.- Further , if you don't want to create problem for the owner who has constructed the additional rooms , then the association can charge extra amount from them after passing a resolution in GBM for the same.- However, the association has right to take legal action against them .Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "Dear client,For your trading endeavor in India, you might think about setting up a Private Limited Company or a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP). By segregating personal assets from corporate responsibilities, both alternatives offer minimal responsibility. Small firms often choose an LLP because it offers flexibility and fewer regulatory requirements. On the other hand, a Private Limited Company offers a more formal structure that facilitates funding and business growth. The Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008 governs LLPs in India, whereas the Companies Act, 2013 regulates private limited companies.

Relevant portions of the Karnataka Municipalities Act, 1976, may be applicable.Without the necessary clearances, it may be difficult to obtain a sanctioned plan for alterations, which could impair compliance with the Karnataka Municipal Corporation Act, 1976.Since no permissions were obtained for the original development, the property may be categorized as B Khata.

If there are no children, the surviving spouse, siblings (such as your father), and their offspring make up the Class I heirs. Self-acquired property is typically considered differently from ancestral property when it comes to the residence purchased with earnings from ancestral property. Since the money from the sale of the ancestral property were used to purchase the house, it's possible that the property was self-acquired, which would disqualify you as a legitimate heir. If your uncle and his wife die without a will, any surviving Class I heirs, such as your father's siblings, may receive their properties.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Notarized rental agreements are recognized as legitimate in India, but registration offers further legal protection and enforceability. The rent agreement in your instance, however, might not have the same legal standing as a registered agreement because it is not registered. The immediate problem might be resolved by drafting a new rent agreement with all four names, but it's important to take society's rules and regulations into consideration. The rental agreement may not be the means by which the organization enforces its own occupancy regulations. It is advisable to speak with the social association about the matter and work toward a cooperative resolution that complies with their policies. It's crucial to discuss the problem with your agent in order to guarantee improved communication going forward.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Maintenance for divorce",
    "answer": "Dear client,The length of the marriage, the style of living, and unique circumstances are some of the variables that can affect the amount and duration of alimony. Alimony can be awarded in India for a respectable amount of time, usually half the length of the marriage.The standard of living, possessions, and income of the spouse all play a role in determining how much alimony is granted. It's possible that your respective incomes and savings will be taken into account when calculating alimony.Sometimes parties will agree on lump sum settlements, but in order to guard against future claims, it's imperative to have a legally enforceable agreement in place.Transferring assets to escape alimony responsibilities might not be a legally sound move in terms of property transfers. When deciding alimony, courts may take these actions into account.Since laws can differ, it is best to speak with an attorney to understand how infidelity may affect the divorce process. Remember that using audio recordings as evidence could have legal ramifications as well, so it's best to speak with a legal professional about these.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Maintenance for divorce",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, alimony or maintenance payments are made in lump sums rather than being strictly based on a husband's net worth percentage. To calculate a fair and just sum, the court takes into account a number of variables, including the husband's income, assets, and way of life. According to the wife's necessities and the husband's financial situation, the court may grant maintenance under Section 25 of theHindu Marriage Actand Section 125 of theCode of Criminal Procedure. Usually, to determine your net worth, you deduct your liabilities from your assets. Since you stated that you make 3 lakhs a month and have 2 crores in savings, your net worth would be the sum of your savings less any obligations or liabilities. It's crucial to remember that courts take into account a variety of criteria when making maintenance judgments, so the amount of alimony given may not necessarily match the results of this net worth assessment.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Quarterly advance maintenance charges demanding by society from owners of the flats",
    "answer": "Dear client,The regulations of the society govern the validity of the penalty and interest assessed, the distinctions made between self-occupied and rented apartments, and the quarterly advance maintenance fees. Housing societies in India usually formulate its regulations in accordance with the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960. The Act does not specifically govern the distinction between self-occupied and rented apartments, but it does provide organizations the power to impose maintenance fees. Any discriminatory action, therefore, must abide by the equality principles outlined in Article 14 of theIndian Constitution. The bylaws of the society may be legally enforceable if they expressly declare these requirements. The ₹500 monthly penalty and 21% annual interest rate, however, may be examined for reasonableness. The 2019Consumer Protection Actmay also be applicable in situations where there are unfair trade practices taking place.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The Karnataka Town and Country Planning Act, 1961, governs this.In the future, BIAPPA approvals and betterment charge payments may be required in order to regularize the property. Relevant portions of the Karnataka Municipalities Act, 1976, may be applicable.Without the necessary clearances, it may be difficult to obtain a sanctioned plan for alterations, which could impair compliance with the Karnataka Municipal Corporation Act, 1976.Since no permissions were obtained for the original development, the property may be categorized as B Khata. The Karnataka Municipal Corporations (Second Amendment) Act, 2013 has an impact on this.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Both parties must agree and the properties involved must be transferable for the transaction to be considered legitimate. As Party \"A\" is trading two properties for one from Party \"B,\" it is essential to guarantee that the assets are valued equally to prevent any disagreements. It is imperative to draft a legally-binding agreement that specifies the parameters of the trade. This agreement should specify the kind of transfer, consideration, and property specifics. It is necessary to register the exchange deed with the local registrar's office, even though all three properties are owned by the same tehsil. This conforms to Registration Act of 1908, Section 17.

    "question": "Maintenance for divorce",
    "answer": "Dear client,The length of the marriage, the style of living, and unique circumstances are some of the variables that can affect the amount and duration of alimony. Alimony can be awarded in India for a respectable amount of time, usually half the length of the marriage.The standard of living, possessions, and income of the spouse all play a role in determining how much alimony is granted. It's possible that your respective incomes and savings will be taken into account when calculating alimony.Sometimes parties will agree on lump sum settlements, but in order to guard against future claims, it's imperative to have a legally enforceable agreement in place.Transferring assets to escape alimony responsibilities might not be a legally sound move in terms of property transfers. When deciding alimony, courts may take these actions into account.Since laws can differ, it is best to speak with an attorney to understand how infidelity may affect the divorce process. Remember that using audio recordings as evidence could have legal ramifications as well, so it's best to speak with a legal professional about these.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Maintenance for divorce",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, alimony or maintenance payments are made in lump sums rather than being strictly based on a husband's net worth percentage. To calculate a fair and just sum, the court takes into account a number of variables, including the husband's income, assets, and way of life. According to the wife's necessities and the husband's financial situation, the court may grant maintenance under Section 25 of theHindu Marriage Actand Section 125 of theCode of Criminal Procedure. Usually, to determine your net worth, you deduct your liabilities from your assets. Since you stated that you make 3 lakhs a month and have 2 crores in savings, your net worth would be the sum of your savings less any obligations or liabilities. It's crucial to remember that courts take into account a variety of criteria when making maintenance judgments, so the amount of alimony given may not necessarily match the results of this net worth assessment.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear cleint,Even with DC conversion and Gram Panchayat clearances, purchasing real estate in Bangalore without BIAPPA approval carries some risk.The property could be considered unlawful due to the lack of BIAPPA approval, which could result in government intervention and possible demolition. The Karnataka Town and Country Planning Act, 1961, governs this.In the future, BIAPPA approvals and betterment charge payments may be required in order to regularize the property. Relevant portions of the Karnataka Municipalities Act, 1976, may be applicable.Without the necessary clearances, it may be difficult to obtain a sanctioned plan for alterations, which could impair compliance with the Karnataka Municipal Corporation Act, 1976.Since no permissions were obtained for the original development, the property may be categorized as B Khata. The Karnataka Municipal Corporations (Second Amendment) Act, 2013 has an impact on this.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Your marriage and your departure for Colombia happened in Kolkata, so it might not be proper to file in Dhanbad. To ascertain the appropriate jurisdiction, take into account variables such as the location of marriage, your present residence, or the residence of your spouse, and speak with a lawyer. Regarding her assertions, it is important to provide evidence to support claims under Indian divorce law, which is based on theHindu Marriage Actand permits divorce on a number of grounds. While cruelty is one of the grounds for divorce listed in Section 13(1), Section 13B permitsdivorce by mutual consent.

If there are no children, the surviving spouse, siblings (such as your father), and their offspring make up the Class I heirs. Self-acquired property is typically considered differently from ancestral property when it comes to the residence purchased with earnings from ancestral property. Since the money from the sale of the ancestral property were used to purchase the house, it's possible that the property was self-acquired, which would disqualify you as a legitimate heir. If your uncle and his wife die without a will, any surviving Class I heirs, such as your father's siblings, may receive their properties.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,The length of the marriage, the style of living, and unique circumstances are some of the variables that can affect the amount and duration of alimony. Alimony can be awarded in India for a respectable amount of time, usually half the length of the marriage.The standard of living, possessions, and income of the spouse all play a role in determining how much alimony is granted. It's possible that your respective incomes and savings will be taken into account when calculating alimony.Sometimes parties will agree on lump sum settlements, but in order to guard against future claims, it's imperative to have a legally enforceable agreement in place.Transferring assets to escape alimony responsibilities might not be a legally sound move in terms of property transfers. When deciding alimony, courts may take these actions into account.Since laws can differ, it is best to speak with an attorney to understand how infidelity may affect the divorce process. Remember that using audio recordings as evidence could have legal ramifications as well, so it's best to speak with a legal professional about these.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Maintenance for divorce",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, alimony or maintenance payments are made in lump sums rather than being strictly based on a husband's net worth percentage. To calculate a fair and just sum, the court takes into account a number of variables, including the husband's income, assets, and way of life. According to the wife's necessities and the husband's financial situation, the court may grant maintenance under Section 25 of theHindu Marriage Actand Section 125 of theCode of Criminal Procedure. Usually, to determine your net worth, you deduct your liabilities from your assets. Since you stated that you make 3 lakhs a month and have 2 crores in savings, your net worth would be the sum of your savings less any obligations or liabilities. It's crucial to remember that courts take into account a variety of criteria when making maintenance judgments, so the amount of alimony given may not necessarily match the results of this net worth assessment.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "What options available to trade in stock market",
    "answer": "Dear client,For your trading endeavor in India, you might think about setting up a Private Limited Company or a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP). By segregating personal assets from corporate responsibilities, both alternatives offer minimal responsibility. Small firms often choose an LLP because it offers flexibility and fewer regulatory requirements. On the other hand, a Private Limited Company offers a more formal structure that facilitates funding and business growth. The Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008 governs LLPs in India, whereas the Companies Act, 2013 regulates private limited companies. Following the guidelines set forth by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is necessary in order to open a trading account in the name of the organization.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Quarterly advance maintenance charges demanding by society from owners of the flats",
    "answer": "there appears to be some rationale behind such impositionfirstly the member who has given his flat on rent is not before the society at all timeswhereas the members using their flats for self occupation are within the society premises onlyso compared to a member who lives in the society and defaults in payment of maintenance AND a member who does not live in the society and has given his flat on rent, it will be difficult for the society to go behind the member of the latter class than the former classthis appears to me to be the reason why the society has come up with such a ruleif the rationale of the society is as above then it is a reasonable restriction and hence legalthe advance maintenance would also be charged to ensure that if in case the member's tenant does something which causes any damage to the society's property or its common areas then in absence of the member, the society can use the advance maintenance to make good the said damage. Ofcourse the society will be within its right to charge separately to the member for making good such damage by his tenant. The advance only gives an immediate fund in the hands of the society to meet such contingenciesconsidering the above i dont see any illegality in the society's decisionyou can very well make the payment of the advance at one go from one month's rental that your tenant would pay youYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Quarterly advance maintenance charges demanding by society from owners of the flats",
    "answer": "Dear client,The regulations of the society govern the validity of the penalty and interest assessed, the distinctions made between self-occupied and rented apartments, and the quarterly advance maintenance fees. Housing societies in India usually formulate its regulations in accordance with the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960. The Act does not specifically govern the distinction between self-occupied and rented apartments, but it does provide organizations the power to impose maintenance fees. Any discriminatory action, therefore, must abide by the equality principles outlined in Article 14 of theIndian Constitution. The bylaws of the society may be legally enforceable if they expressly declare these requirements. The ₹500 monthly penalty and 21% annual interest rate, however, may be examined for reasonableness. The 2019Consumer Protection Actmay also be applicable in situations where there are unfair trade practices taking place.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Both parties must agree and the properties involved must be transferable for the transaction to be considered legitimate. As Party \"A\" is trading two properties for one from Party \"B,\" it is essential to guarantee that the assets are valued equally to prevent any disagreements. It is imperative to draft a legally-binding agreement that specifies the parameters of the trade. This agreement should specify the kind of transfer, consideration, and property specifics. It is necessary to register the exchange deed with the local registrar's office, even though all three properties are owned by the same tehsil. This conforms to Registration Act of 1908, Section 17.

    "question": "We have a house on rent and now 2 unmarried couples living together in it",
    "answer": "Dear client,Notarized rental agreements are recognized as legitimate in India, but registration offers further legal protection and enforceability. The rent agreement in your instance, however, might not have the same legal standing as a registered agreement because it is not registered. The immediate problem might be resolved by drafting a new rent agreement with all four names, but it's important to take society's rules and regulations into consideration. The rental agreement may not be the means by which the organization enforces its own occupancy regulations. It is advisable to speak with the social association about the matter and work toward a cooperative resolution that complies with their policies. It's crucial to discuss the problem with your agent in order to guarantee improved communication going forward.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can A GPA Holder Sell the Property to himself?",
    "answer": "Dear client,In a number of rulings, the Indian Supreme Court has addressed the subject of self-transfer via General Power of Attorney (GPA). The court determined that a registered sale document is the only method of transferring immovable property—a GPA cannot be used in the 2012 case of Suraj Lamp & Industries Pvt. Ltd. v. State of Haryana. This ruling highlights that in order to transfer property, a document must be registered. Furthermore, the court in Om Prakash v. Rattan Lal (2014) reaffirmed that a GPA for immovable property does not transfer ownership and cannot be regarded as an instrument of title. The Registration Act, namely Section 17(1A), reaffirms that registering the sale deed is necessary in order to transfer property. Together, these rulings show that a GPA by itself is insufficient to complete a property transfer, and self-transfer by such methods is illegal.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Ofcourse the society will be within its right to charge separately to the member for making good such damage by his tenant.

Housing societies in India usually formulate its regulations in accordance with the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960. The Act does not specifically govern the distinction between self-occupied and rented apartments, but it does provide organizations the power to impose maintenance fees. Any discriminatory action, therefore, must abide by the equality principles outlined in Article 14 of theIndian Constitution. The bylaws of the society may be legally enforceable if they expressly declare these requirements. The ₹500 monthly penalty and 21% annual interest rate, however, may be examined for reasonableness.

In this mode, the owner voluntarily transfers ownership of the property to another person without any monetary consideration.A legally binding exchange deed is a document that certifies the exchange of personal or real property between two parties.

    "answer": "Dear client,TheTransfer of Property Act, 1882 governs property exchange in India. Both parties must agree and the properties involved must be transferable for the transaction to be considered legitimate. As Party \"A\" is trading two properties for one from Party \"B,\" it is essential to guarantee that the assets are valued equally to prevent any disagreements. It is imperative to draft a legally-binding agreement that specifies the parameters of the trade. This agreement should specify the kind of transfer, consideration, and property specifics. It is necessary to register the exchange deed with the local registrar's office, even though all three properties are owned by the same tehsil. This conforms to Registration Act of 1908, Section 17. Parties should also follow stamp duty laws, confirm property titles, and get a no-objection certificate from relevant authorities.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If there are no children, the surviving spouse, siblings (such as your father), and their offspring make up the Class I heirs. Self-acquired property is typically considered differently from ancestral property when it comes to the residence purchased with earnings from ancestral property. Since the money from the sale of the ancestral property were used to purchase the house, it's possible that the property was self-acquired, which would disqualify you as a legitimate heir.

    "question": "Maintenance for divorce",
    "answer": "Dear client,The length of the marriage, the style of living, and unique circumstances are some of the variables that can affect the amount and duration of alimony. Alimony can be awarded in India for a respectable amount of time, usually half the length of the marriage.The standard of living, possessions, and income of the spouse all play a role in determining how much alimony is granted. It's possible that your respective incomes and savings will be taken into account when calculating alimony.Sometimes parties will agree on lump sum settlements, but in order to guard against future claims, it's imperative to have a legally enforceable agreement in place.Transferring assets to escape alimony responsibilities might not be a legally sound move in terms of property transfers. When deciding alimony, courts may take these actions into account.Since laws can differ, it is best to speak with an attorney to understand how infidelity may affect the divorce process. Remember that using audio recordings as evidence could have legal ramifications as well, so it's best to speak with a legal professional about these.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Maintenance for divorce",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, alimony or maintenance payments are made in lump sums rather than being strictly based on a husband's net worth percentage. To calculate a fair and just sum, the court takes into account a number of variables, including the husband's income, assets, and way of life. According to the wife's necessities and the husband's financial situation, the court may grant maintenance under Section 25 of theHindu Marriage Actand Section 125 of theCode of Criminal Procedure. Usually, to determine your net worth, you deduct your liabilities from your assets. Since you stated that you make 3 lakhs a month and have 2 crores in savings, your net worth would be the sum of your savings less any obligations or liabilities. It's crucial to remember that courts take into account a variety of criteria when making maintenance judgments, so the amount of alimony given may not necessarily match the results of this net worth assessment.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Quarterly advance maintenance charges demanding by society from owners of the flats",
    "answer": "there appears to be some rationale behind such impositionfirstly the member who has given his flat on rent is not before the society at all timeswhereas the members using their flats for self occupation are within the society premises onlyso compared to a member who lives in the society and defaults in payment of maintenance AND a member who does not live in the society and has given his flat on rent, it will be difficult for the society to go behind the member of the latter class than the former classthis appears to me to be the reason why the society has come up with such a ruleif the rationale of the society is as above then it is a reasonable restriction and hence legalthe advance maintenance would also be charged to ensure that if in case the member's tenant does something which causes any damage to the society's property or its common areas then in absence of the member, the society can use the advance maintenance to make good the said damage. Ofcourse the society will be within its right to charge separately to the member for making good such damage by his tenant. The advance only gives an immediate fund in the hands of the society to meet such contingenciesconsidering the above i dont see any illegality in the society's decisionyou can very well make the payment of the advance at one go from one month's rental that your tenant would pay youYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Quarterly advance maintenance charges demanding by society from owners of the flats",
    "answer": "Dear client,The regulations of the society govern the validity of the penalty and interest assessed, the distinctions made between self-occupied and rented apartments, and the quarterly advance maintenance fees. Housing societies in India usually formulate its regulations in accordance with the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960. The Act does not specifically govern the distinction between self-occupied and rented apartments, but it does provide organizations the power to impose maintenance fees. Any discriminatory action, therefore, must abide by the equality principles outlined in Article 14 of theIndian Constitution. The bylaws of the society may be legally enforceable if they expressly declare these requirements. The ₹500 monthly penalty and 21% annual interest rate, however, may be examined for reasonableness. The 2019Consumer Protection Actmay also be applicable in situations where there are unfair trade practices taking place.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Maintenance for divorce",
    "answer": "Dear client,The length of the marriage, the style of living, and unique circumstances are some of the variables that can affect the amount and duration of alimony. Alimony can be awarded in India for a respectable amount of time, usually half the length of the marriage.The standard of living, possessions, and income of the spouse all play a role in determining how much alimony is granted. It's possible that your respective incomes and savings will be taken into account when calculating alimony.Sometimes parties will agree on lump sum settlements, but in order to guard against future claims, it's imperative to have a legally enforceable agreement in place.Transferring assets to escape alimony responsibilities might not be a legally sound move in terms of property transfers. When deciding alimony, courts may take these actions into account.Since laws can differ, it is best to speak with an attorney to understand how infidelity may affect the divorce process. Remember that using audio recordings as evidence could have legal ramifications as well, so it's best to speak with a legal professional about these.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Maintenance for divorce",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, alimony or maintenance payments are made in lump sums rather than being strictly based on a husband's net worth percentage. To calculate a fair and just sum, the court takes into account a number of variables, including the husband's income, assets, and way of life. According to the wife's necessities and the husband's financial situation, the court may grant maintenance under Section 25 of theHindu Marriage Actand Section 125 of theCode of Criminal Procedure. Usually, to determine your net worth, you deduct your liabilities from your assets. Since you stated that you make 3 lakhs a month and have 2 crores in savings, your net worth would be the sum of your savings less any obligations or liabilities. It's crucial to remember that courts take into account a variety of criteria when making maintenance judgments, so the amount of alimony given may not necessarily match the results of this net worth assessment.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The rent agreement in your instance, however, might not have the same legal standing as a registered agreement because it is not registered. The immediate problem might be resolved by drafting a new rent agreement with all four names, but it's important to take society's rules and regulations into consideration. The rental agreement may not be the means by which the organization enforces its own occupancy regulations. It is advisable to speak with the social association about the matter and work toward a cooperative resolution that complies with their policies. It's crucial to discuss the problem with your agent in order to guarantee improved communication going forward.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "- If she is not giving much attention towards the daughter , then you can claim full custody after filing a suit before the family court.- As per the Supreme Court, for the custody of the minor, the only consideration is the welfare of the minor.- Under Hindu law, A mother usually gets custody of the minor child, under the age of 5 and fathers get custody of older boys, but it is not a strict rule and is primarily decided based on the child’s interests.- The choice of a child above the age of nine is considered, and further a mother who is proven to neglect or ill-treat the child is not given custody.- Further, to win sole physical and legal custody, you should show, the court that awarding you custody is in the best interests of your child due to factors such as your existing relationship with the child, stability of the home life you provide, inability of the mother to meet the child's needs; mother's lack of involvement in day to day need of a baby child.- Further, if they are creating trouble then you can file a complaint against her family members for the offence of intervention in married life- Further, your mother can also file a complaint under the provision of DV Act against her daughter-in-law for her harassment.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "Dear client,In a number of rulings, the Indian Supreme Court has addressed the subject of self-transfer via General Power of Attorney (GPA). The court determined that a registered sale document is the only method of transferring immovable property—a GPA cannot be used in the 2012 case of Suraj Lamp & Industries Pvt. Ltd. v. State of Haryana. This ruling highlights that in order to transfer property, a document must be registered. Furthermore, the court in Om Prakash v. Rattan Lal (2014) reaffirmed that a GPA for immovable property does not transfer ownership and cannot be regarded as an instrument of title. The Registration Act, namely Section 17(1A), reaffirms that registering the sale deed is necessary in order to transfer property. Together, these rulings show that a GPA by itself is insufficient to complete a property transfer, and self-transfer by such methods is illegal.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,It is important to use caution when purchasing real estate in Bangalore close to a stormwater drain (SWD). The National Green Tribunal Act restricts development to a set distance away from stormwater drains in order to protect the environment. Make sure the property complies with the requirements of the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, which stipulates that setbacks from drains must be observed. The building may have complied with standards at the time because it was 14 years old, but you should confirm its current state. Furthermore, it could be difficult to obtain a loan for a property of this type because banks frequently won't finance houses that are close to bodies of water. Consider the potential impact on resale value and future developments in the neighborhood. A well-informed decision must weigh the advantages and disadvantages of the long term against the affordability of the option now.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,One typical method of allocating liability for violations of representations, guarantees, commitments, and covenants in a contract is through the indemnity provision that you gave. Although the consultant is liable for any losses that arise, the agreement may not necessarily be void if they fail to uphold their end of the bargain. The wording, nonetheless, might be improved to more precisely state the repercussions of non-fulfillment without suggesting that the agreement is immediately nullified. Contracts in India are governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1872. The Act's Section 73 provides damages in the event of a violation, while Section 74 addresses penalties for breach of contract. It's vital to ensure that the indemnity clause conforms with Indian contract law principles to be enforceable.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Transferring property ownership in India without a registered sale deed presents some difficulties, however there may be ways around them. In order to prove your ownership, you should execute a gift deed in accordance with Section 122 of theTransfer of Property Act, 1882. Your father may receive the property as a gift from the original landowner's wife without having to pay for it.Gift Deed: Write a Gift Deed that expresses your intention to give the property away for free. The deed must be signed by the two parties and two witnesses.Stamp Duty and Registration: Register the Gift Deed at the sub-registrar office and pay the required stamp duty based on the value of the property. This confirms the transfer in accordance with Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908.Affidavit: Enclose an affidavit attesting to the voluntary nature of the transaction with the Gift Deed, written by the original landowner's wife.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,In a number of rulings, the Indian Supreme Court has addressed the subject of self-transfer via General Power of Attorney (GPA). The court determined that a registered sale document is the only method of transferring immovable property—a GPA cannot be used in the 2012 case of Suraj Lamp & Industries Pvt. Ltd. v. State of Haryana. This ruling highlights that in order to transfer property, a document must be registered. Furthermore, the court in Om Prakash v. Rattan Lal (2014) reaffirmed that a GPA for immovable property does not transfer ownership and cannot be regarded as an instrument of title. The Registration Act, namely Section 17(1A), reaffirms that registering the sale deed is necessary in order to transfer property. Together, these rulings show that a GPA by itself is insufficient to complete a property transfer, and self-transfer by such methods is illegal.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,It is important to use caution when purchasing real estate in Bangalore close to a stormwater drain (SWD). The National Green Tribunal Act restricts development to a set distance away from stormwater drains in order to protect the environment. Make sure the property complies with the requirements of the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, which stipulates that setbacks from drains must be observed. The building may have complied with standards at the time because it was 14 years old, but you should confirm its current state. Furthermore, it could be difficult to obtain a loan for a property of this type because banks frequently won't finance houses that are close to bodies of water. Consider the potential impact on resale value and future developments in the neighborhood. A well-informed decision must weigh the advantages and disadvantages of the long term against the affordability of the option now.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "The comment or review expressed in the google media are the facts experienced, whether good or bad, hence it will not constitute to any act of defamation.The Madras High Court has observed that expressing adverse views on platforms like Google Review for the services received by a personwould not amount to defamation of the service provider, as it is covered under the freedom of speech and expression in Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.Internet is a free platform, and it is an important means of expression and communication… mere expressing views in Google Review about the services that were received in my opinion, does not amount to defamation,” said Justice V Sivagnanam.In principle, anyone can write reviews about products or services. The right to free speech is enormously broad and cannot be restricted. Websites like google or trust pilot may allow users to write negative reviews about companies, their products or services. In principle, the posting of reviews by these users themselves also falls under the right to free speech.You can issue a reply notice through your lawyer denying the allegations and challenge their proposed actions on this.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Threat of legal action from builder on Google review comment",
    "answer": "Dear client,Defamation rules in India stipulate that a false statement must cause harm to the injured party's reputation. TheIndian Penal Code's Sections 499 and 500 apply to defamation. Your Google review might be protected as a reasonable comment if it is based on your actual experiences and opinions, especially if you can show proof of the problems you had. Legal outcomes, however, might be intricate and contingent upon particular facts. The builder has the option to pursue a lawsuit, but they would have to provide evidence that your review is untrue and has damaged their brand. Given the circumstances you mentioned, where your statements seem to be based on your experience, it may be tough for them to demonstrate defamation.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The court determined that a registered sale document is the only method of transferring immovable property—a GPA cannot be used in the 2012 case of Suraj Lamp & Industries Pvt. Ltd. v. State of Haryana. This ruling highlights that in order to transfer property, a document must be registered. Furthermore, the court in Om Prakash v. Rattan Lal (2014) reaffirmed that a GPA for immovable property does not transfer ownership and cannot be regarded as an instrument of title. The Registration Act, namely Section 17(1A), reaffirms that registering the sale deed is necessary in order to transfer property. Together, these rulings show that a GPA by itself is insufficient to complete a property transfer, and self-transfer by such methods is illegal.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Your father may receive the property as a gift from the original landowner's wife without having to pay for it.Gift Deed: Write a Gift Deed that expresses your intention to give the property away for free. The deed must be signed by the two parties and two witnesses.Stamp Duty and Registration: Register the Gift Deed at the sub-registrar office and pay the required stamp duty based on the value of the property. This confirms the transfer in accordance with Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908.Affidavit: Enclose an affidavit attesting to the voluntary nature of the transaction with the Gift Deed, written by the original landowner's wife.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It is possible to bring up the constitutional requirement for equal treatment, highlighting the fact that it is against the spirit of meritocracy and equal opportunity to exclude people based only on when they obtained their degree. Furthermore, Section 14 of the Limitation Act may be used to argue that the length of time between the advertisement and appointment should not disfavor candidates with advanced qualifications and that the recruiting process's delay was due to circumstances beyond of your control.

    "question": "Questions about Pent House.",
    "answer": "Dear client,The conditions of the first ownership transfer in 2016 and any further agreements will determine whether or not the builder's registration of the penthouse without association notice was lawful. Under the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, you have the legal right to file accusations against the builder and investigate.The penthouse owner's payment of maintenance costs does not always indicate that they are acknowledged as a legal stakeholder. The qualifications for ownership and stakeholder status would be made clear by the association's bylaws and legal documents.Due to the incomplete notification and the unfinished Building Regularization Scheme, the association may take legal action to contest the registration. Additionally, you could file charges in accordance with the Registration Act of 1908 and theTransfer of Property Actof 1882. It's critical to compile information and comprehend the ramifications of the court order acquired via mandamus writ the association's rights.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Although the consultant is liable for any losses that arise, the agreement may not necessarily be void if they fail to uphold their end of the bargain. The wording, nonetheless, might be improved to more precisely state the repercussions of non-fulfillment without suggesting that the agreement is immediately nullified. Contracts in India are governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1872. The Act's Section 73 provides damages in the event of a violation, while Section 74 addresses penalties for breach of contract.

    "answer": "Dear client,One typical method of allocating liability for violations of representations, guarantees, commitments, and covenants in a contract is through the indemnity provision that you gave. Although the consultant is liable for any losses that arise, the agreement may not necessarily be void if they fail to uphold their end of the bargain. The wording, nonetheless, might be improved to more precisely state the repercussions of non-fulfillment without suggesting that the agreement is immediately nullified. Contracts in India are governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1872. The Act's Section 73 provides damages in the event of a violation, while Section 74 addresses penalties for breach of contract. It's vital to ensure that the indemnity clause conforms with Indian contract law principles to be enforceable.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Make quick contact with the court, offering accurate details and outlining the circumstances. In the instance of the contractor, Section 10 of the Indian Contract Act stipulates that agreements must be freely consented to and entered into without coercion. It is cause for concern if your contractor is requesting payment without the appropriate paperwork to support the transaction.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Sorry to hear about your situation. It's imperative that you take immediate action if the Bengaluru Urban District Legal Service Authority sent you a registered letter with the wrong name. The signature on the acknowledgment card may, under Indian law, indicate that you accept the notice. That's a legitimate worry, though, given that you emphasized the name discrepancy without signing. Make quick contact with the court, offering accurate details and outlining the circumstances. In the instance of the contractor, Section 10 of the Indian Contract Act stipulates that agreements must be freely consented to and entered into without coercion. It is cause for concern if your contractor is requesting payment without the appropriate paperwork to support the transaction.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

But all legal heirs must give their agreement for the procedure to proceed.

    "question": "Regarding section 11 of Res judicata and other issues",
    "answer": "1. No, it will not be affected by the doctrine of Res judicata2. The Judgment in OS 1 is totally different to that of your claim in OS 2.  Your father after making the settlement of family property among the legal heirs, he withheld his own share in the property and has clearly mentioned that the 5 acres of landed property retained by him shall pass on to his four sons  after his death, hence the court passed a judgment cancelling the Will written by mother and the gift deed in favor of the grandson as null and void because your mother was not having any rights in the property that belonged  to your father except life interest.  Therefore the partition suit filed by the four sons would be maintainable and of course the daughters' claim for a share in it may not be maintainable..3 See the above answer.4. When you don't have a share at all in that 5 acres of land, where is the question of execution of your 1/7th share in it, besides that case is still going on and not decided yet.5.

  {
    "context": "Asked 1 year ago in Property Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Regarding section 11 of Res judicata and other issues",
    "answer": "First of all, you should know that the doctrine of res judicata is a legal principle that prevents the same matter from being re-litigated once it has been finally decided by a competent court. It is based on the need of giving finality to judicial decisions and saving time and harassment to parties. The doctrine of res judicata is embodied in section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in India. It applies to civil as well as administrative law.According to section 11, no court shall try any suit or issue in which the matter directly and substantially in issue has been directly and substantially in issue in a former suit between the same parties, or between parties under whom they or any of them claim, litigating under the same title, in a court competent to try such subsequent suit or the suit in which such issue has been subsequently raised, and has been heard and finally decided by such court.The conditions for applying res judicata are as follows.The matter directly and substantially in issue in the subsequent suit or issue must be the same matter which was directly and substantially in issue in the former suit or issue.The former suit or issue must have been a suit or an issue between the same parties or between parties under whom they or any of them claim.The parties must have been litigating under the same title in the former suit or issue.The court which decided the former suit or issue must have been a court competent to try the subsequent suit or the suit in which such issue is subsequently raised.The matter directly and substantially in issue in the subsequent suit must have been heard and finally decided by the court in the former suit.The doctrine of res judicata also includes constructive res judicata, which means that if a plea could have been taken by a party in a proceeding between him and his opponent, he should not be permitted to take that plea against the same party in a subsequent proceeding with reference to the same subject-matter.Now, coming to your questions:Given the court’s ruling in O.S (1), which declared the gift deed null and void, do we need to proceed with the trial in O.S (2), or does this situation fall under the doctrine of Res Judicata?It depends on whether the conditions for applying res judicata are satisfied or not. If the matter directly and substantially in issue in O.S (2) is the same as that in O.S (1), and if the parties are the same or claiming under the same title, and if the court which decided O.S (1) was competent to try O.S (2), and if the matter was heard and finally decided by that court, then res judicata would apply and O.S (2) would not be maintainable. However, if any of these conditions are not fulfilled, then res judicata would not apply and O.S (2) would have to be proceeded with.Can we submit the order copy of O.S (1) to the O.S (2) court as evidence and request that they dismiss the case based on the orders already passed? Furthermore, can we request the court to order an equal share for the four sons and three daughters as per the O.S (1) court’s ruling?You can submit the order copy of O.S (1) to the O.S (2) court as evidence, but it is up to the court to decide whether to dismiss the case based on res judicata or not. You can also request the court to order an equal share for the four sons and three daughters as per O.S (1), but again it is up to the court to decide whether to grant your request or not. The court may consider various factors such as whether O.S (1) was decided on merits or ex parte, whether there was any fraud or collusion involved, whether there was any change of law or circumstances, etc.Since the O.S (1) court order was ex parte, will the O.S (2) court provide an opportunity for my four brothers and Mr. C to present their case and arguments regarding their 1/4th share of the property?An ex parte order is one that is passed without hearing one party. Such an order may not be conclusive or binding on that party unless it is confirmed after giving him an opportunity of being heard. Therefore, if your four brothers and Mr. C were not heard by O.S (1) court before passing its order, they may have a chance to present their case and arguments before O.S (2) court regarding their 1/4th share of the property.Can I file execution case for my 1/7th share in 5 acres of land based on orders passed in my daughter case of O.S (1)?An execution case is one that is filed to enforce the decree or order of a court. If you have obtained a decree or order in your favour from O.S (1) court, you can file an execution case for your 1/7th share in 5 acres of land based on that decree or order. However, you should also ensure that the decree or order is not stayed or challenged by any higher court or authority.Filing application under order rule 7 and section 11 before O.S (2) court is required to dismiss the suit or just filing Memo with O.S (1) court order copy is sufficient to dismiss the suit.Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 provides that the plaint shall be rejected where it does not disclose a cause of action, or where the relief claimed is undervalued, or where the plaint is insufficiently stamped, or where it is barred by any law. Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 provides for res judicata as discussed above. If you want to dismiss the suit on any of these grounds, you have to file an application before O.S (2) court and prove your case. Merely filing a memo with O.S (1) court order copy may not be sufficient to dismiss the suit.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Regarding section 11 of Res judicata and other issues",
    "answer": "Dear ClientRes Judicata:The doctrine of Res Judicata essentially means that a matter that has already been adjudicated by a competent court cannot be re-litigated between the same parties. In your case, the court in O.S (1) has already issued a judgment declaring the gift deed null and void and establishing the ownership pattern of the property. This ruling may have a binding effect on the matter related to the property's ownership.Submitting the O.S (1) Order as Evidence:You can certainly submit the order copy of O.S (1) as evidence in O.S (2). This can help support your claim that the property's ownership has already been decided by the court in O.S (1). However, whether O.S (2) will be dismissed based solely on this evidence or whether the court will order an equal share for the four sons and three daughters as per O.S (1) depends on the discretion of the O.S (2) court. It's advisable to consult with your legal counsel on how to present this evidence effectively.Opportunity for Brothers and Mr. C:In O.S (2), if your brothers and Mr. C were not parties to O.S (1) and the order in O.S (1) was ex parte, they should have the opportunity to present their case and arguments regarding their 1/4th share of the property. The O.S (2) court may consider their claims and evidence before making a final determination.Execution Case for Your Share:If the O.S (1) court has issued an order declaring your daughter's share and the gift deed as null and void, you may be able to file an execution case to enforce this order and claim your 1/7th share in the 5 acres of land. Consult with your legal counsel to initiate this process correctly.Filing Application under Order Rule 7 and Section 11:Filing an application under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure can be used to seek the rejection of a plaint in a suit. This can be done if you believe that the suit is barred by the principles of Res Judicata due to the O.S (1) court's order. Consulting with your legal counsel on the specific procedure and arguments to be used in this application is essential to ensure its success.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Regarding section 11 of Res judicata and other issues",
    "answer": "Dear client,According to theTransfer of Property Actin India, a gift of immovable property can be made through a registered deed. However, there are conditions, including the donor's free consent and the donee's acceptance. If the gift was made by your grandmother under duress, coercion, or without her free consent, it could potentially be considered invalid. The court's ruling on the first Will and subsequent Gift Deed declared both null and void. If the court found that the Gift Deed was made without your grandmother's free consent or was a result of taking advantage of her old age, this could be a strong point in your favor. However, legal advice specific to the case and its documentation would be crucial in determining the validity of these documents. Based on the facts provided, it seems there might be grounds for filing a complaint or a separate case against the illegal transfer of the immovable property to Mr. C's name. The alleged misuse of power of attorney (GPA) and illegal acquisition of the property could potentially be challenged in court. Consulting a lawyer well-versed in property and succession laws in India would be advisable to understand the specifics and the most appropriate legal steps to take. Regarding your involvement in the ongoing lawsuit (O.S (2)) filed by your brothers, being impleaded as a defendant might afford you the opportunity to present your side of the case and protect your rights to the property shares allotted to you through the family settlement deed.

His own daughter and son’s daughter and the descendants of daughters have been excluded for this purpose3)A married daughter has been completely excluded. If no male descendant is there, the rights of the deceased would come to be inherited even by his brothers or other male relatives but not by his own daughter. In categorical terms, the Act has preferred the brother of a deceased to a married daughter of the deceased for inheritance in tenure holding. Thus, even in a nuclear family where there is no male survivor, the married daughter cannot inherit the rights, rather her uncle has been found by our legislature in its wisdom, to be a suitable heir to inherit the tenure holding.Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "question": "Uttar Pradesh ancestral agriculture property for married daughter",
    "answer": "Dear client,In Uttar Pradesh, the UPZLR Act does indeed have provisions that govern the succession of agricultural land. Regarding the UPZLR Act, it's essential to understand its provisions regarding the succession of agricultural land, especially when dealing with ancestral property. While the Act may prioritize certain heirs, recent judgments from the Supreme Court may have provided more equitable interpretations of inheritance rights, especially for married daughters.Verify the property's ancestral status and its classification under the relevant laws. Understanding the specific legal nuances regarding ancestral property can be crucial in determining your entitlement. You can send a legal notice to your brother asserting your rights and intentions to claim a fair share of the ancestral property. This can sometimes prompt negotiations or discussions for an amicable resolution. If negotiations fail, the lawyer may advise filing a lawsuit or petition in the appropriate court, presenting your case based on interpretations of recent Supreme Court judgments, arguing for the fair inheritance rights of married daughters in ancestral agricultural property. Providing evidence to establish your entitlement to the property through documentation and evidence of lineage and family history could strengthen your case.If the initial court ruling is unfavorable, you might have the option to appeal to higher courts, citing relevant laws, precedents, and constitutional provisions that support your claim. Sometimes, courts encourage mediation or alternative dispute resolution methods to resolve family property disputes without protracted legal battles.

To ascertain the nature of the property, it is essential to examine the legal papers and obtain legal counsel.A thorough analysis of the relevant legal documentation and acquisition circumstances would also be necessary to determine whether the property meets the requirements for absolute property under Section 14(1).Generally speaking, adverse possession entails having sole possession for a set amount of time without the owner's consent. It's possible that paying taxes on their own does not constitute adverse possession.In most cases, an appeal against the session court's decision must be filed with the High Court.If you think that the distribution of the 10 acres of divided property was unfair, you can serve them with a legal notice.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "How to rectify the mismatch of the measurement in sale deed and actual measurement",
    "answer": "Dear client,1. Ankana Measurement: \"Ankana\" isn’t a standardized unit of measurement. It seems your grandfather might have used it informally. In some places, 1 Ankana might equate to 100 square feet or 10 feet x 10 feet, but it's essential to verify this through any local land records or regional measurement standards.2. Proof of Ownership: Your possession of the land for 70 years and consistent tax payments significantly strengthen your claim. This, coupled with the sale deed, suggests ownership. However, it's wise to gather additional historical documents, like old tax receipts, family records, or any other deeds or agreements that might indicate your family's possession.3. Extra Land: There might be provisions for regularization of extra land with municipal authorities through a process known as regularization or rectification. This could involve paying a fee or penalty for the additional area.4. Adverse Possession: Adverse possession laws in India require continuous, open, and notorious possession of land for a statutory period, which is typically 12 years. Your family's 70-year possession could, in theory, be argued as adverse possession.5. Adjacent Sites: Consistency in dimensions among neighboring properties can be compelling evidence. Reviewing their revenue records and getting in touch with the owners might provide insights or support for rectification.6. Correcting Measurements: Rectifying measurements would involve legal processes like filing for correction in land records, updating or amending the sale deed, or conducting a fresh survey. This typically requires legal representation and documentation.7. Options for Rectification: Request a re-survey or rectification based on evidence and discussions with neighbors. Seek legal recourse through a civil suit for correction of land records or title deeds. Consider mediation or negotiation with the neighbors to reach a mutual agreement.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "- As per Supreme court Judgment, provisions on adverse possession are made under the Limitation Act, 1963. In case an owner does not stake his claim over his property for 12 years, a squatter can acquire legal rights over the property.  The prescribed period in case of for government-owned properties is 30 years.- Further, to claim his ownership, this squatter has to prove that his occupancy of the property has been uninterrupted for the entire period. You cannot break the period into halves.- Further, he will also have to prove that he has been the sole occupant of the property. There cannot be under the provisions of the law multiple claimants.- Since, your family is in the possession of the remaining land for the last 70 years long period , then you can file a declaration suit before the court for declaring the owner on the ground of adverse possession- Tax payment is not a proof of ownership , however it can be considered as proof of occupation before the court.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "Dear client,1. Jurisdiction for Filing Complaint: The jurisdiction for filing a complaint depends on the value of consideration at the time of the agreement. Since the consideration mentioned in the registered agreement was Rs.50 lacs, you may initially file a complaint in the district consumer forum. However, considering the value of the property and the discrepancies in the agreement value versus the valuation report from IGR (Registrar's office), there might be a discrepancy in deciding the jurisdiction.2. Filing for Injunction and Claiming Damages: Yes, you can file for an injunction to compel the builder to deliver the flats as promised and claim damages for the delay. The delay in delivering the flats constitutes a breach of the agreement, allowing you to claim damages based on the terms mentioned in the agreement or under consumer protection laws.3. National Forum Consideration: The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) deals with cases involving a higher value of consideration. Considering the discrepancies in the valuation, you may consider filing directly in the NCDRC if the jurisdictional value exceeds the threshold for the district forum.4. Consumer Forum Jurisdiction: There have been cases where landowners have filed complaints in consumer forums, especially when the agreement involves services or a deficiency in services promised. Consumer forums have entertained cases involving landowners if the dispute pertains to services promised by a builder/developer.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Calculation of Society Maintenance charges",
    "answer": "1. the costs of amenities and services which are shared in common by all the unit holders regardless of their unit area, have to be shared equally and not on basis of the unit area. The taxes like property tax is computed on basis of unit area and water charges are computed based on consumption or total number of water inlets provided in the flat. Except for the property tax and water charges, all other charges are to be borne equally by all the flat holders regardless of flat size. It is absurd that a flat holder owning a bigger flat is made to pay higher charges than that charged to the flat holder of a smaller flat, since both the flat holders would be using the common amenities and services equally. It is not that the bigger flat owner would use more security or more common electricity. So the reason given by your society that the charges are as mentioned in the bye-laws, does not seem to be a proper reason. Ask the society to produce the said bye-laws for your perusal. If there is indeed any such bye-law then that needs to be challenged legally as such a bye-law would certainly not stand the scrutiny of the law being unreasonable, onerous and arbitrary.2. there are no so called approved methods in Mumbai. Different societies follow different computations. Some are reasonable and some are completely absurd.3. if the MC does not relent you will have to take the matter legally. Begin by writing a complaint to the Dy. Registrar of Societies4. your last query is irrelevant. That query is not for a lawyer to answer. You will have to engage a valuer for the same who can do comparative analysis of maintenance charges charged by different societies in the same vicinity and having almost the same amenities as your societyYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

For information on acceptable practices, consult the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960 and the society's rules.Relating to the Committee's Refusal to Modify: You might think about taking the following actions if the managing committee won't change the costing in spite of legitimate concerns: a)Ask the committee to explain their thinking in a conversation. b)Get the assistance of other residents who are also concerned if the problem continues. c)Under the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, think about submitting a complaint to the Registrar of Cooperative Societies.Estimated Maintenance Cost: Depending on the location, size, and amenities of the unit, the approximate maintenance cost may change. Comparing with other local societies that are comparable is a good idea. The Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act is another resource you can consult for any rules pertaining to maintenance fees.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Settlement deed done and registered on 1-Jun-2010. Same got cancelled and registered on 20-Jun-2010",
    "answer": "Dear client,In Indian law, the cancellation of a settlement deed needs to be legally valid and should be done in accordance with the law. If the settlement deed cancellation by the father was executed properly, it might be considered legally valid. However, the lack of a reason mentioned for the cancellation might raise questions. The subsequent actions, such as the transfer of property and sale by the son after the cancellation of the settlement deed, could also be subject to scrutiny. If the properties were sold based on the canceled settlement deed and there are subsequent buyers (like yourself) involved, the legality of these transactions may be affected if the cancellation of the settlement deed is found to be invalid or illegal.Regarding your situation as the fourth buyer of one of the properties, the Sub-Registrar's requirement for a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from all successors of the father indicates that they want confirmation from all individuals who could potentially claim rights or interests in the property.To resolve this matter, you might need to:1. Confirm the legality of the settlement deed cancellation with a lawyer.2. Check if the subsequent transactions, including the transfer of property and sale, were conducted legally and if the cancellation affected their validity.3. Obtain the necessary NOCs or take legal action to address any disputes over the property.Your chances of getting a positive order from the court would depend on various factors, including the validity of the cancellation, the subsequent transactions, and any legal claims made by other successors or stakeholders in the property.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Every legal heir normally owns a portion of the property, and any legal transactions involving the property frequently need their approval.  Clear title transfer to the buyer may be complicated if one legal heir fails to produce a NOC. The legal heir who is not providing the NOC may have rights to challenge the transaction or claim their share in the property at a later date. If you have obtained NOCs from the majority of legal heirs, you might be able to proceed with the sale of the property you obtained from them.

The taxes like property tax is computed on basis of unit area and water charges are computed based on consumption or total number of water inlets provided in the flat. Except for the property tax and water charges, all other charges are to be borne equally by all the flat holders regardless of flat size. It is absurd that a flat holder owning a bigger flat is made to pay higher charges than that charged to the flat holder of a smaller flat, since both the flat holders would be using the common amenities and services equally. It is not that the bigger flat owner would use more security or more common electricity. So the reason given by your society that the charges are as mentioned in the bye-laws, does not seem to be a proper reason. Ask the society to produce the said bye-laws for your perusal. If there is indeed any such bye-law then that needs to be challenged legally as such a bye-law would certainly not stand the scrutiny of the law being unreasonable, onerous and arbitrary.2. there are no so called approved methods in Mumbai.

    "question": "Consumer complaint by landowner",
    "answer": "Dear client,1. Jurisdiction for Filing Complaint: The jurisdiction for filing a complaint depends on the value of consideration at the time of the agreement. Since the consideration mentioned in the registered agreement was Rs.50 lacs, you may initially file a complaint in the district consumer forum. However, considering the value of the property and the discrepancies in the agreement value versus the valuation report from IGR (Registrar's office), there might be a discrepancy in deciding the jurisdiction.2. Filing for Injunction and Claiming Damages: Yes, you can file for an injunction to compel the builder to deliver the flats as promised and claim damages for the delay. The delay in delivering the flats constitutes a breach of the agreement, allowing you to claim damages based on the terms mentioned in the agreement or under consumer protection laws.3. National Forum Consideration: The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) deals with cases involving a higher value of consideration. Considering the discrepancies in the valuation, you may consider filing directly in the NCDRC if the jurisdictional value exceeds the threshold for the district forum.4. Consumer Forum Jurisdiction: There have been cases where landowners have filed complaints in consumer forums, especially when the agreement involves services or a deficiency in services promised. Consumer forums have entertained cases involving landowners if the dispute pertains to services promised by a builder/developer.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Consumer complaint by landowner",
    "answer": "Dear client,1. Jurisdiction for Filing Complaint: The jurisdiction for filing a complaint depends on the value of consideration at the time of the agreement. Since the consideration mentioned in the registered agreement was Rs.50 lacs, you may initially file a complaint in the district consumer forum. However, considering the value of the property and the discrepancies in the agreement value versus the valuation report from IGR (Registrar's office), there might be a discrepancy in deciding the jurisdiction.2. Filing for Injunction and Claiming Damages: Yes, you can file for an injunction to compel the builder to deliver the flats as promised and claim damages for the delay. The delay in delivering the flats constitutes a breach of the agreement, allowing you to claim damages based on the terms mentioned in the agreement or under consumer protection laws.3. National Forum Consideration: The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) deals with cases involving a higher value of consideration. Considering the discrepancies in the valuation, you may consider filing directly in the NCDRC if the jurisdictional value exceeds the threshold for the district forum.4. Consumer Forum Jurisdiction: There have been cases where landowners have filed complaints in consumer forums, especially when the agreement involves services or a deficiency in services promised. Consumer forums have entertained cases involving landowners if the dispute pertains to services promised by a builder/developer.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Purchase of redeveloped Flat",
    "answer": "1. you first need to check whether or not this property is subject to the provisions of the Public Premises Act since originally the building was meant for occupation by the staff of SBI2. ideally on the demise of the original shareholder, the society ought to have requisitioned an heirship certificate or a letters of administration to be produced by the widow of the deceased shareholder, before transferring the shares to her name3. however such an application as above cannot be made now since the widow is no more. the aforesaid would have ensured that apart from the widow there are no other claimants claiming any right over the flat4. the widow died testate by leaving behind a registered Will5. the Will ought to be probated. even though there has been no claim since after the widow's demise, a probated Will would ensure that the widow really intended her flat to go to her sister and BIL, as a probate grant is a certificate by the Court that the Will is genuine and is made as per law6. please note that just because the Will is a registered one, that alone would not support its authenticity and genuineness. even a registered Will has to pass the muster of the law just like a non-registered Will7. it does not matter that the shares are already transferred to the beneficiaries of the Will. In absence of a probate grant, such transfer still remains questionable and is amenable to be set aside in future8. so it would be in your interest that you tell the seller to first have the Will duly probated and only thereafter it would be safe to proceed with the transaction9. the probate grant is also necessary from the future's perspective since any buyer of yours would obviously ask for probate10. as regards the earlier transfer in favour of the widow, you will have to issue a public notice and invite objections and claims11. to repeat, do first also check how this property became a private property owned by a co-operative housing society when originally it was owned [i assume] by the government, as the old premises were allotted to the SBI staffYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

What if the Will is made up or concocted?It is settled law that mere transfer of shares to the nominees does not make them the owner of the flat. The nominees merely hold the property as trustees for the actual claimants or legal heirs of the deceased member.4 - as informed the transfer of shares from husband to wife was required to be preceded by an heirship certificate or letter of administration obtained by the widow from the High Court. That was not done. That is why the suggestion to give public notice in newspapers to invite objections and claims, if any.the widow made a Will by which she made a bequest of her flat to her younger sister and the latter's husband. So it does not matter whether these two persons are class 1 heirs or belong to any other class. The succession to the flat will take place by testamentary succession and NOT intestate succession, provided the Will is proved as genuine and probate obtained5. give in FPJ [English] and Navshakti [Marathi].

    "question": "Purchase of redeveloped Flat",
    "answer": "Dear client,1. Probate Requirement: In India, obtaining a probate for a will is not mandatory, but it can be beneficial to establish the authenticity of the will. However, the absence of a probate may lead to challenges or disputes regarding the property title. In some cases, the society or authorities might insist on a probate to verify the legitimacy of the will.2. Legal Safeguards in Agreement: Ensure that the sale agreement includes clauses that protect you in case of any future disputes or claims arising from the property's title. You may consider indemnity clauses that protect you against losses due to any third-party claims regarding the property's ownership.3. Resale Concerns: When selling the property in the future, potential buyers may indeed inquire about the chain of ownership and the legitimacy of the title. Having a clear and documented history, including the share certificates and legal endorsements, could help establish the legitimacy of your ownership.4. Transfer of Title: The transfer of shares and chain of agreements between the original owner, the widow, and her nominated sister and brother-in-law seems legally sound, given the absence of other legal heirs. However, this can vary based on specific nuances of Indian property law and individual case circumstances.5. Publication for Claims: Advertising in newspapers to invite any potential claims on the property's title is a good proactive step. If no claims arise within the specified period, it can provide some reassurance regarding the absence of competing claims. However, it might not entirely eliminate potential future legal challenges.6. Documentation for Reselling: Showing the transfer of share certificates and appropriate endorsements to prospective buyers during a resale is a reasonable practice. This helps establish the legitimacy of the ownership transfer.7. Property Background: Understanding the property's origin as an SBI Officers' quarters, though not directly related to the legal aspects, can be important for transparency and providing a complete picture to potential buyers in the future.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,It seems you're dealing with a complex legal situation regarding ancestral property and a series of legal proceedings in India.1. Notice of Plaintiff's Death: Your advocate should bring the death of the plaintiff to the attention of the appeal court. Usually, the LRs (Legal Representatives) of the deceased plaintiff would need to be impleaded in the appeal suit.2. Challenge to Condonation of Delay and Revocation Order: Yes, the LRs of the deceased plaintiff can challenge the condonation of delay and the exparte revocation order in the appeal court (District Court). They can argue that proper notice wasn't served due to the change in your address and the plaintiff's death.3. Filing an Appeal: The LRs of the deceased plaintiff can file an appeal in the same court (District Court) against the orders obtained by hiding the plaintiff's death. If they believe there was a lack of due process due to the plaintiff's death not being acknowledged, they can address this in the appeal.4. Effect of Release Deed: The fact that the deceased plaintiff and their LRs released their share in the property through a registered Release Deed might limit their rights to challenge certain aspects. However, it doesn’t necessarily preclude them from contesting procedural irregularities or lack of due process in subsequent legal proceedings.5. LRs Contesting the Appeal Suit: The LRs of the deceased plaintiff can contest the appeal suit and also aim to set aside the exparte orders. They have the opportunity to present their case and argue that they were not duly informed or involved in the proceedings due to the plaintiff's death.Under Indian law, the process can vary based on specific circumstances, and the court will generally aim to provide fair opportunities for all parties involved. It’s crucial to gather all relevant documents, evidence of communication attempts regarding address changes, and any legal documents (such as the Release Deed) to support your case.

    "question": "Is  appeal suit valid after release deed with one of the coparcener?",
    "answer": "Dear client,1. Effect of Release Deed: The Release Deed can act as a form of estoppel, especially if it clearly states that the lands being released are ancestral property and acknowledges the plaintiff's entitlement to a 1/5th share. This document might limit the appellants' arguments regarding the plaintiff's share if presented properly before the court.2. Plaintiff Not Included in Release Deed: The legal reasons for not including the plaintiff as a releasor in the deed could vary. It's possible that the plaintiff might not have been included due to his willingness to relinquish his share and might not have considered himself a party to the deed. However, this would need careful legal scrutiny based on the specific circumstances surrounding the creation of the Release Deed.3. Legal Capacity of Plaintiff's Legal Heirs to Sign the Release Deed: Generally, the legal heirs of a living person may not have the authority or capacity to release a share in ancestral property without the involvement or consent of the person who holds that share, i.e., the plaintiff. If the plaintiff was alive and mentally competent, their direct involvement or consent in the release would typically be required.4. Recording the Release Deed in Court: To amend shares and pass a fresh preliminary decree, especially considering the changes brought about by the Release Deed, it would be prudent to present the Release Deed before the court. This document can be used as evidence to petition for an amendment to the preliminary decree, specifying the changes in ownership as per the deed.In essence, the Release Deed holds weight as a legal document, especially if it clearly outlines the relinquishment of the plaintiff's share in the ancestral property. However, the circumstances surrounding its creation and the absence of the plaintiff's inclusion might need further examination by a legal expert. Bringing this document to the attention of the court during the appeal proceedings could significantly impact the case's outcome.

    "answer": "Dear client,In Indian law, the cancellation of a settlement deed needs to be legally valid and should be done in accordance with the law. If the settlement deed cancellation by the father was executed properly, it might be considered legally valid. However, the lack of a reason mentioned for the cancellation might raise questions. The subsequent actions, such as the transfer of property and sale by the son after the cancellation of the settlement deed, could also be subject to scrutiny. If the properties were sold based on the canceled settlement deed and there are subsequent buyers (like yourself) involved, the legality of these transactions may be affected if the cancellation of the settlement deed is found to be invalid or illegal.Regarding your situation as the fourth buyer of one of the properties, the Sub-Registrar's requirement for a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from all successors of the father indicates that they want confirmation from all individuals who could potentially claim rights or interests in the property.To resolve this matter, you might need to:1. Confirm the legality of the settlement deed cancellation with a lawyer.2. Check if the subsequent transactions, including the transfer of property and sale, were conducted legally and if the cancellation affected their validity.3. Obtain the necessary NOCs or take legal action to address any disputes over the property.Your chances of getting a positive order from the court would depend on various factors, including the validity of the cancellation, the subsequent transactions, and any legal claims made by other successors or stakeholders in the property.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Obtaining NOCs from the majority of legal heirs may be sufficient for certain transactions. Every legal heir normally owns a portion of the property, and any legal transactions involving the property frequently need their approval.  Clear title transfer to the buyer may be complicated if one legal heir fails to produce a NOC. The legal heir who is not providing the NOC may have rights to challenge the transaction or claim their share in the property at a later date. If you have obtained NOCs from the majority of legal heirs, you might be able to proceed with the sale of the property you obtained from them. However, the property with the non-consenting heir's share may be challenging to sell without their cooperation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This shift might have legal implications regarding ownership and rights associated with the land.2. Ancestral Property and Inheritance: The concept of ancestral property is crucial in determining the rights of heirs. Ancestral property is generally understood as property inherited up to four generations of male lineage without any division or disposition.3. Ownership and 7/12 Extract: The 7/12 extract reflects the land's record of rights, indicating the person who has the title and rights over the land. While it currently shows your father-in-law's name, this might not necessarily be the sole determinant of ownership, especially concerning ancestral property rights.4. Widow's Rights: Widows in India often have rights to their husband's property, depending on various factors, including the nature of the property and the presence of surviving heirs.5. Verification and Legal Counsel: To verify the details and understand the legal implications accurately, consulting a property lawyer in Maharashtra who specializes in inheritance and property laws is crucial.

Even testimonies from individuals aware of the correct birth year could be helpful. While it might be challenging without concrete evidence, there are legal processes to correct the birth year on official documents. Your lawyer can help navigate this process, but it typically involves submitting a petition with supporting evidence to the appropriate authorities.If necessary, consider establishing paternity through DNA testing to confirm your father's relationship with your grandfather. This might strengthen your claim to inheritance. Attempt mediation to settle the dispute amicably if possible. If not, legal action might be necessary to establish your father's rights as a legal heir. Your father might face legal repercussions for discrepancies in his official documents.

    "question": "How to rectify the mismatch of the measurement in sale deed and actual measurement",
    "answer": "Dear client,1. Ankana Measurement: \"Ankana\" isn’t a standardized unit of measurement. It seems your grandfather might have used it informally. In some places, 1 Ankana might equate to 100 square feet or 10 feet x 10 feet, but it's essential to verify this through any local land records or regional measurement standards.2. Proof of Ownership: Your possession of the land for 70 years and consistent tax payments significantly strengthen your claim. This, coupled with the sale deed, suggests ownership. However, it's wise to gather additional historical documents, like old tax receipts, family records, or any other deeds or agreements that might indicate your family's possession.3. Extra Land: There might be provisions for regularization of extra land with municipal authorities through a process known as regularization or rectification. This could involve paying a fee or penalty for the additional area.4. Adverse Possession: Adverse possession laws in India require continuous, open, and notorious possession of land for a statutory period, which is typically 12 years. Your family's 70-year possession could, in theory, be argued as adverse possession.5. Adjacent Sites: Consistency in dimensions among neighboring properties can be compelling evidence. Reviewing their revenue records and getting in touch with the owners might provide insights or support for rectification.6. Correcting Measurements: Rectifying measurements would involve legal processes like filing for correction in land records, updating or amending the sale deed, or conducting a fresh survey. This typically requires legal representation and documentation.7. Options for Rectification: Request a re-survey or rectification based on evidence and discussions with neighbors. Seek legal recourse through a civil suit for correction of land records or title deeds. Consider mediation or negotiation with the neighbors to reach a mutual agreement.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "- As per Supreme court Judgment, provisions on adverse possession are made under the Limitation Act, 1963. In case an owner does not stake his claim over his property for 12 years, a squatter can acquire legal rights over the property.  The prescribed period in case of for government-owned properties is 30 years.- Further, to claim his ownership, this squatter has to prove that his occupancy of the property has been uninterrupted for the entire period. You cannot break the period into halves.- Further, he will also have to prove that he has been the sole occupant of the property. There cannot be under the provisions of the law multiple claimants.- Since, your family is in the possession of the remaining land for the last 70 years long period , then you can file a declaration suit before the court for declaring the owner on the ground of adverse possession- Tax payment is not a proof of ownership , however it can be considered as proof of occupation before the court.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "Dear client,It could be a wise move to file a declaration suit to establish your sole ownership of the house, especially if you can provide evidence such as detailed bank statements showing that you solely financed the purchase and construction. However, it's crucial to consult with a qualified lawyer specialized in property and divorce law in India to assess the specifics of your situation. In some cases, filing such a suit during divorce proceedings might complicate matters, so legal advice tailored to your circumstances is vital.The declaration suit and the divorce case might have an impact on each other, potentially causing delays or complications. For instance, the court handling the divorce might decide to wait for the outcome of the declaration suit before making a decision on property division. Conversely, progress in the divorce case might influence how the court handles the declaration suit. These interrelations could vary based on the judge, court procedures, and the specific facts of your case.In Indian law, property acquired during marriage can be subject to division during divorce proceedings, regardless of whose name is on the property documents. However, if you can substantiate that the property was acquired solely with your funds and there's evidence to support this, it might strengthen your case for sole ownership.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "-  As per Section 90 of the IPC , When the accused gives promise to the victim to marry her, never had any intention to marry and the victim gave the consent for sexual intercourse on such an assurance by the accused that he would marry her, such a consent can be said to be a consent obtained on a misconception of fact and, in such a case, an offender can be said to have committed the rape as defined under Section 375 of IPC , and can be convicted for the offence under Section 376 of the IPC.- Hence, the consent for physical relation obtained by the said guy giving false promise of marriage is amounts to rape, and a complaint can be filed by you against him- There is no another way to force him for marriage except to file a complaint . However if he agrees for the marriage then the complaint can be withdrawn by you.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

These pieces of evidence can be presented during the trial of the dowry complaint to establish the truth regarding the alleged snatching of jewelry.2. The sections that could potentially be invoked against the wife depend on the specifics of the allegations and evidence presented. They might include sections related to fraud, defamation (if false accusations are proven), and potentially perjury or filing false complaints if her claims are found baseless and intentionally misleading.3. The evidence of the wife's contradictory behavior and communication, like the WhatsApp messages where she's kissing the husband and seeking help for her friend's marriage, can be used to challenge her claims of forced actions or distress, potentially undermining her credibility in court.4. The call detail records, especially those indicating odd-hour communications before and after marriage, can be used as circumstantial evidence to support claims of ongoing relationships or activities. The court may consider these records to establish patterns or relationships relevant to the case.5. The gift declaration signed by witnesses, if contested as forced, might require these witnesses to testify or provide further evidence to establish its authenticity.

    "question": "Wrong date of birth in my father's documents",
    "answer": "Dear client,Gather any evidence supporting your father's actual birth year being 1973. This could include old school records, hospital records, or any other documents from that time. Even testimonies from individuals aware of the correct birth year could be helpful. While it might be challenging without concrete evidence, there are legal processes to correct the birth year on official documents. Your lawyer can help navigate this process, but it typically involves submitting a petition with supporting evidence to the appropriate authorities.If necessary, consider establishing paternity through DNA testing to confirm your father's relationship with your grandfather. This might strengthen your claim to inheritance. Attempt mediation to settle the dispute amicably if possible. If not, legal action might be necessary to establish your father's rights as a legal heir. Your father might face legal repercussions for discrepancies in his official documents. However, if there's a valid reason for the mistake (such as lack of documentation from that time), and he's willing to rectify it through the proper legal channels, it might mitigate any potential legal issues.

    "answer": "Dear client,The credit note of 31 lakhs from the previous builder, as well as the payment receipt issued by Migsun for the same amount, signify an agreement to transfer the credit. However, it appears there's a dispute about the materialization of the credit note deal between Ansal and Migsun. These clauses seem to indicate that if the deal between Ansal and Migsun regarding the credit note doesn't materialize, Migsun can demand the amount from you as the allottee. It's essential to understand the exact wording and implications of these clauses in the legal context of your agreement.In real estate transactions, the Allotment Letter is a preliminary agreement that precedes the Builder-Buyer Agreement (BBA). However, the legal validity of an Allotment Letter as a BBA might vary from state to state. Specifically for UP RERA, you might need to consult a legal expert or check the regulations. The legality of clauses and agreements, as well as the interpretation of these documents, falls under legal jurisdiction. The UP RERA or Indian laws regarding real estate contracts, consumer rights, and dispute resolution might influence the validity of these clauses and agreements.If needed, you can approach UP RERA for guidance or resolution regarding the dispute, especially if it involves non-compliance with regulations. You may draft and send a legal notice to Migsun outlining your grievances and the desired resolution. If the issue remains unresolved, you might need to file a complaint with UP RERA. They handle disputes between buyers and builders and can provide resolution through their prescribed procedures. Maintain copies of all communications, agreements, payment receipts, and legal correspondence for your records and as evidence if the case goes to legal proceedings.

In India, the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA) governs property registration and modifications to the original plan. Without the association's and the affected parties' permission, the developer may no longer make changes to the registered plans after turning over management to the association. Any changes must adhere to the legal procedure specified in RERA. RERA regulations may have been broken if the empty area in front of your parking lot was altered after handover without the required paperwork or association approval.

    "answer": "Dear client,It seems you're dealing with a complex legal situation regarding ancestral property and a series of legal proceedings in India.1. Notice of Plaintiff's Death: Your advocate should bring the death of the plaintiff to the attention of the appeal court. Usually, the LRs (Legal Representatives) of the deceased plaintiff would need to be impleaded in the appeal suit.2. Challenge to Condonation of Delay and Revocation Order: Yes, the LRs of the deceased plaintiff can challenge the condonation of delay and the exparte revocation order in the appeal court (District Court). They can argue that proper notice wasn't served due to the change in your address and the plaintiff's death.3. Filing an Appeal: The LRs of the deceased plaintiff can file an appeal in the same court (District Court) against the orders obtained by hiding the plaintiff's death. If they believe there was a lack of due process due to the plaintiff's death not being acknowledged, they can address this in the appeal.4. Effect of Release Deed: The fact that the deceased plaintiff and their LRs released their share in the property through a registered Release Deed might limit their rights to challenge certain aspects. However, it doesn’t necessarily preclude them from contesting procedural irregularities or lack of due process in subsequent legal proceedings.5. LRs Contesting the Appeal Suit: The LRs of the deceased plaintiff can contest the appeal suit and also aim to set aside the exparte orders. They have the opportunity to present their case and argue that they were not duly informed or involved in the proceedings due to the plaintiff's death.Under Indian law, the process can vary based on specific circumstances, and the court will generally aim to provide fair opportunities for all parties involved. It’s crucial to gather all relevant documents, evidence of communication attempts regarding address changes, and any legal documents (such as the Release Deed) to support your case.

    "question": "Is  appeal suit valid after release deed with one of the coparcener?",
    "answer": "Dear client,1. Effect of Release Deed: The Release Deed can act as a form of estoppel, especially if it clearly states that the lands being released are ancestral property and acknowledges the plaintiff's entitlement to a 1/5th share. This document might limit the appellants' arguments regarding the plaintiff's share if presented properly before the court.2. Plaintiff Not Included in Release Deed: The legal reasons for not including the plaintiff as a releasor in the deed could vary. It's possible that the plaintiff might not have been included due to his willingness to relinquish his share and might not have considered himself a party to the deed. However, this would need careful legal scrutiny based on the specific circumstances surrounding the creation of the Release Deed.3. Legal Capacity of Plaintiff's Legal Heirs to Sign the Release Deed: Generally, the legal heirs of a living person may not have the authority or capacity to release a share in ancestral property without the involvement or consent of the person who holds that share, i.e., the plaintiff. If the plaintiff was alive and mentally competent, their direct involvement or consent in the release would typically be required.4. Recording the Release Deed in Court: To amend shares and pass a fresh preliminary decree, especially considering the changes brought about by the Release Deed, it would be prudent to present the Release Deed before the court. This document can be used as evidence to petition for an amendment to the preliminary decree, specifying the changes in ownership as per the deed.In essence, the Release Deed holds weight as a legal document, especially if it clearly outlines the relinquishment of the plaintiff's share in the ancestral property. However, the circumstances surrounding its creation and the absence of the plaintiff's inclusion might need further examination by a legal expert. Bringing this document to the attention of the court during the appeal proceedings could significantly impact the case's outcome.

However, it's crucial to consult with a qualified lawyer specialized in property and divorce law in India to assess the specifics of your situation. In some cases, filing such a suit during divorce proceedings might complicate matters, so legal advice tailored to your circumstances is vital.The declaration suit and the divorce case might have an impact on each other, potentially causing delays or complications. For instance, the court handling the divorce might decide to wait for the outcome of the declaration suit before making a decision on property division. Conversely, progress in the divorce case might influence how the court handles the declaration suit. These interrelations could vary based on the judge, court procedures, and the specific facts of your case.In Indian law, property acquired during marriage can be subject to division during divorce proceedings, regardless of whose name is on the property documents. However, if you can substantiate that the property was acquired solely with your funds and there's evidence to support this, it might strengthen your case for sole ownership.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "it applies to all agricultural properties2)Section 171 of the Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms, 1950 Act clearly lays down that in case a male tenure holder dies then his son or his male descendants will come to inherit his rights in the holding of land. His own daughter and son’s daughter and the descendants of daughters have been excluded for this purpose3)A married daughter has been completely excluded. If no male descendant is there, the rights of the deceased would come to be inherited even by his brothers or other male relatives but not by his own daughter. In categorical terms, the Act has preferred the brother of a deceased to a married daughter of the deceased for inheritance in tenure holding. Thus, even in a nuclear family where there is no male survivor, the married daughter cannot inherit the rights, rather her uncle has been found by our legislature in its wisdom, to be a suitable heir to inherit the tenure holding.Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "question": "Uttar Pradesh ancestral agriculture property for married daughter",
    "answer": "Dear client,In Uttar Pradesh, the UPZLR Act does indeed have provisions that govern the succession of agricultural land. Regarding the UPZLR Act, it's essential to understand its provisions regarding the succession of agricultural land, especially when dealing with ancestral property. While the Act may prioritize certain heirs, recent judgments from the Supreme Court may have provided more equitable interpretations of inheritance rights, especially for married daughters.Verify the property's ancestral status and its classification under the relevant laws. Understanding the specific legal nuances regarding ancestral property can be crucial in determining your entitlement. You can send a legal notice to your brother asserting your rights and intentions to claim a fair share of the ancestral property. This can sometimes prompt negotiations or discussions for an amicable resolution. If negotiations fail, the lawyer may advise filing a lawsuit or petition in the appropriate court, presenting your case based on interpretations of recent Supreme Court judgments, arguing for the fair inheritance rights of married daughters in ancestral agricultural property. Providing evidence to establish your entitlement to the property through documentation and evidence of lineage and family history could strengthen your case.If the initial court ruling is unfavorable, you might have the option to appeal to higher courts, citing relevant laws, precedents, and constitutional provisions that support your claim. Sometimes, courts encourage mediation or alternative dispute resolution methods to resolve family property disputes without protracted legal battles.

These pieces of evidence can be presented during the trial of the dowry complaint to establish the truth regarding the alleged snatching of jewelry.2. The sections that could potentially be invoked against the wife depend on the specifics of the allegations and evidence presented.

The evidence of the wife's contradictory behavior and communication, like the WhatsApp messages where she's kissing the husband and seeking help for her friend's marriage, can be used to challenge her claims of forced actions or distress, potentially undermining her credibility in court.4. The call detail records, especially those indicating odd-hour communications before and after marriage, can be used as circumstantial evidence to support claims of ongoing relationships or activities. The court may consider these records to establish patterns or relationships relevant to the case.5. The gift declaration signed by witnesses, if contested as forced, might require these witnesses to testify or provide further evidence to establish its authenticity.

    "question": "25 Transfer of Property Act conditional transfers is made subject to a condition satements are made",
    "answer": "Dear client,It seems like the sale deed you've shared has some elements that raise concerns about the transfer of absolute ownership. Your deed does seem to have certain conditional elements. For instance, the clause \"subject to the actual measurement\" could imply that the final sale is contingent upon a measurement that hasn't been conducted yet. Rectification might involve an addendum or amendment to the deed clarifying this condition or conducting the agreed-upon measurement. This clause introduces uncertainty about the property's precise size or boundaries. It's advisable to rectify this by conducting the measurement as agreed upon or by modifying the deed to remove this condition.As per the deed, the sellers seem to transfer ownership upon receiving the full payment. However, the clauses related to the Khatha transfer and signing documents to perfect the title hint that there might be some steps pending for full transfer. It's essential to clarify these points for complete ownership transfer. The clause indicates the seller's commitment to facilitating the transfer of title after the registration. It doesn't necessarily mean the title hasn't transferred but implies an assurance that any additional steps required for a clean title will be completed post-registration.The absence of explicit language regarding title transfer in the deed could lead to confusion or disputes. Ensure that the deed explicitly states the transfer of title from the seller to the purchaser to avoid any future complications. If you suspect that the drafted deed might cause legal issues or isn't in your best interest, it's crucial to seek legal advice from a trusted lawyer specializing in property transactions. They can review the deed thoroughly and provide guidance on necessary amendments or actions to safeguard your interests.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "25 Transfer of Property Act conditional transfers is made subject to a condition satements are made",
    "answer": "Dear client,Let's break down your concerns:The discrepancy in the measured size might cause issues later. If the deed explicitly mentions that the sale is subject to the actual measurement, and the measured area exceeds what was initially agreed upon, it might affect the terms of the sale. Failure to rectify the difference in measurement could potentially lead to disputes or legal issues in the future, especially if the discrepancy becomes a point of contention between you and the sellers. It's essential to try and resolve this matter even if the sellers are currently abroad. If the deed specifies the sale as subject to actual measurement, a change in the measured area might affect the sale consideration. Depending on the agreed-upon price per square foot, the difference in area could impact the total sale amount. Rectification becomes crucial to ensure that the sale deed accurately reflects the property's dimensions and terms agreed upon by both parties. However, rectification might not be mandatory if both parties agree to the new dimensions and are willing to proceed without altering the deed.Regarding the statement: \"The SELLERS hereby grants/transfers... as normally be conveyed under the sale\":This phrase typically refers to the standard transfer of ownership rights and interests that occur in a property sale, subject to the conditions agreed upon in the sale deed. It means the transfer of ownership is in line with the usual procedures of a property sale, subject to the conditions mentioned in the sale deed. If any conditions outlined in the deed aren't met, it might impact the completeness or legality of the transfer. The sale might not become invalid per se, but discrepancies or unfulfilled conditions could create complications in proving absolute ownership or defending against potential disputes in the future. As per the deed's language, it seems that ownership is intended to transfer to you upon meeting all the conditions outlined in the deed. However, the discrepancies in measurements and other conditions might affect the completeness of this transfer.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Temple construction in a gated community",
    "answer": "Dear client,1. If the General Body, with a majority vote, approves the construction of a temple using donations, the Management Committee usually has the authority to proceed with the construction within the framework of the approved budget and guidelines.2. Permissions required typically involve:- Local municipal authority's approval for construction.- Land-use permissions.- Environmental clearances, if applicable.- Compliance with building codes and regulations.- Permissions from relevant authorities for any religious or spiritual structure.3. The construction of a temple might affect the Undivided Share (UDS) of a flat owner if it involves common areas where the temple is built. If the temple construction utilizes shared spaces or affects the UDS in any way, it might need a consensus or a specific agreement to ensure fairness among the flat owners.4. Generally, decisions made by a majority vote in the General Body meeting hold weight unless the governing documents (like bylaws or regulations) of the association specify that unanimous consent is required for certain decisions.5. The ownership of land in the name of a deity or association depends on various factors including legal structuring and religious practices. In some cases, the society might hold the land in trust for the deity or religious purpose.In India, several legal provisions govern the construction of religious structures, management of housing societies, and building regulations. Here are a few acts and provisions relevant to these matters:1. The Societies Registration Act, 1860: This act governs the registration of societies. Housing societies are usually registered under this act, and it provides guidelines for their functioning, including decision-making processes and rules for the management committee.2. Apartment Ownership Act: Different states in India have their own Apartment Ownership Acts (like Maharashtra Apartment Ownership Act, 1970) that regulate the ownership and management of apartment buildings and housing societies.3. The Municipal Laws: Each city or municipality has its own building bylaws and regulations that dictate the rules for construction, including permissions needed for any construction work, adherence to safety norms, and land usage.4. Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments Acts: Each state might have its specific laws governing religious institutions and their properties. These laws often dictate how religious properties can be managed, used, and the permissions needed for any construction or alterations.5. Cooperative Housing Society Bylaws: Housing societies typically have their own bylaws that outline rules and regulations regarding construction, alterations, and usage of common areas. These bylaws are often formulated in line with the state's cooperative society laws.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,1. Bhogwata Varg 2 to Bhogwata Varg 1 Conversion: The transition of the land from Bhogwata Varg 2 to Bhogwata Varg 1 signifies a change in the classification or category of the land. This shift might have legal implications regarding ownership and rights associated with the land.2. Ancestral Property and Inheritance: The concept of ancestral property is crucial in determining the rights of heirs. Ancestral property is generally understood as property inherited up to four generations of male lineage without any division or disposition.3. Ownership and 7/12 Extract: The 7/12 extract reflects the land's record of rights, indicating the person who has the title and rights over the land. While it currently shows your father-in-law's name, this might not necessarily be the sole determinant of ownership, especially concerning ancestral property rights.4. Widow's Rights: Widows in India often have rights to their husband's property, depending on various factors, including the nature of the property and the presence of surviving heirs.5. Verification and Legal Counsel: To verify the details and understand the legal implications accurately, consulting a property lawyer in Maharashtra who specializes in inheritance and property laws is crucial. They can review the documents, including the 7/12 extract, assess the transition from Bhogwata Varg 2 to Varg 1, and provide guidance on your sister's rights and any required NOCs or documents for property transactions.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "It is imperative to obtain the status quo order on the HUDA file, since this could have a substantial impact on the property dispute. The Code of Civil Procedure (CPC), in particular, gives the court the authority to make orders that are required to further the goals of justice (Section 94). Any attempts by the owner to sell or begin development in defiance of the court order could result in legal ramifications due to the status quo order on the HUDA file. The order that is currently on file supports your position and could result in the permits that were issued in violation of the initial order being rejected. Furthermore, the Specific Relief Act, which aims to stop actions that disobey court orders, may address the demolition and reconstruction without permission.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Status Quo Order - Effect of",
    "answer": "If a court orders maintain the status quo on the property it means that two components of the property that comes under the purview of status quo one is the possession and other is the title. When status quo is ordered when a suit is instituted then the person who is holding the possession and title shall retain such possession and title until the suit is disposed of. Basically status quo is ordered to prevent the third party interests in the property that is with respect to leasing, selling, mortgaging, gifting, willing or any acts which is done to transfer the interest in the property under theTransfer of property act.Therefore it would be better to maintain the same status till the status quo order is vacated to avoid for being booked for contempt of courtT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Status Quo Order - Effect of",
    "answer": "Dear client,The court order you mentioned, directing the parties to maintain the status quo regarding the alienation of the suit property, typically means that none of the involved parties should alter the state of the property or its ownership while the case is ongoing. Violation of this order could constitute contempt of court.Regarding the benefits of having the application and Status Quo order on the HUDA file:Having the court order on the HUDA file means that any further actions or permissions sought regarding the property should be considered in light of the court's directive to maintain the status quo. This could potentially prevent the issuance of further permits or certificates until the legal case is resolved.Regarding the owner's actions:Demolishing the original building might be seen as a violation of the court order to maintain the status quo if the order specifically mentioned preserving the property in its existing state. However, this might also depend on the exact wording of the court order and its interpretation by the court. If the court order prohibited any alteration to the property, obtaining permission from HUDA to construct a larger property might also be seen as a violation of the court order. The completion of the new house might pose a challenge in terms of enforcing the court order. However, having the court order on the HUDA file could prevent the owner from obtaining necessary certificates or paperwork related to the new construction until the legal matter is resolved.Regarding Contempt of Court:Whether the owner or HUDA is in contempt of the court order would depend on the specific language and scope of the court order and the actions taken. Violating a court order can be considered contempt, but it would ultimately be determined by the court. You may want to bring this to the attention of the court by filing a contempt petition if you believe that the owner's actions or HUDA's involvement are in violation of the court order.

    "question": "Status Quo Order - Effect of",
    "answer": "In law, the phrase \"status quo\" describes the current state of affairs.To prevent any of the parties to a dispute from acting while the matter is still being adjudicated, a judge may issue a status quo order.Under Property Law, Status quo refers to upholding the status or condition of the thing/property in question. You cannot sell, sublet, lease, or do anything with the property if a property lawsuit has resulted in an order to maintain the status quo. The property must remain in the same condition as it did on the day the order was passed.However as per The doctrine of Lis Pendence, envisioned under Section 52 of theTransfer of Property Act, will, however, automatically govern actions related to selling, buying, or transferring title in the property if a lawsuit is pending against it. Status quo does not bar any of the rights of the property holder; only the right to transfer the property gets put on hold while the matter is pending. The person who is currently enjoying the property would continue to do so, and if he encounters any interference with this right, he or she may sue the person who is causing dispute.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Status Quo Order - Effect of",
    "answer": "Dear client,Based on the specific wording of the court order you provided, which instructs the parties to maintain the status quo \"qua alienation of the suit property,\" it appears to primarily address the aspect of transferring or disposing of the property rather than construction per se. Your advocate's interpretation seems aligned with this wording, suggesting that the order restricts actions related to selling, mortgaging, or leasing the property but does not explicitly prohibit construction.Regarding the owner's construction activities and their interaction with HUDA:The owner's construction activities might not directly violate the court order, as long as they aren't attempting to alienate (sell, lease, mortgage, etc.) the property. Therefore, the completion of the construction itself might not cause immediate legal problems for the owner based on the court order.Having the court order on the HUDA file means that any paperwork or certificates related to the property, particularly those that might involve the transfer or change of ownership rights, could face scrutiny or possible delay due to the existence of the court order. This could hinder the owner's attempts to finalize paperwork or certificates related to the property until the legal matter is resolved.It's essential to monitor the situation closely, especially as the construction nears completion, to see if the owner attempts any actions that could be interpreted as an attempt to alienate the property.

    "answer": "Dear client,Sorry to hear about your situation. Will is generally valid as long as it is properly executed and meets the requirements of Indian Succession Act, 1925. Creating, attesting, and guaranteeing legal conformity are all part of carrying out a will. Start by creating a precise and unambiguous will, and if necessary, seek legal counsel. The testator's signature and the signatures of at least two witnesses are required for the will, as per Section 63 of the Indian Succession Act. Although not required, registration enhances legitimacy (Section 18). Keep the original will safe, and if necessary, take Section 213 probate into consideration for validation.

However, it's crucial to consult with a qualified lawyer specialized in property and divorce law in India to assess the specifics of your situation. In some cases, filing such a suit during divorce proceedings might complicate matters, so legal advice tailored to your circumstances is vital.The declaration suit and the divorce case might have an impact on each other, potentially causing delays or complications. For instance, the court handling the divorce might decide to wait for the outcome of the declaration suit before making a decision on property division. Conversely, progress in the divorce case might influence how the court handles the declaration suit. These interrelations could vary based on the judge, court procedures, and the specific facts of your case.In Indian law, property acquired during marriage can be subject to division during divorce proceedings, regardless of whose name is on the property documents. However, if you can substantiate that the property was acquired solely with your funds and there's evidence to support this, it might strengthen your case for sole ownership.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Uttar Pradesh ancestral agriculture property for married daughter",
    "answer": "Dear client,In Uttar Pradesh, the UPZLR Act does indeed have provisions that govern the succession of agricultural land. Regarding the UPZLR Act, it's essential to understand its provisions regarding the succession of agricultural land, especially when dealing with ancestral property. While the Act may prioritize certain heirs, recent judgments from the Supreme Court may have provided more equitable interpretations of inheritance rights, especially for married daughters.Verify the property's ancestral status and its classification under the relevant laws. Understanding the specific legal nuances regarding ancestral property can be crucial in determining your entitlement. You can send a legal notice to your brother asserting your rights and intentions to claim a fair share of the ancestral property. This can sometimes prompt negotiations or discussions for an amicable resolution. If negotiations fail, the lawyer may advise filing a lawsuit or petition in the appropriate court, presenting your case based on interpretations of recent Supreme Court judgments, arguing for the fair inheritance rights of married daughters in ancestral agricultural property. Providing evidence to establish your entitlement to the property through documentation and evidence of lineage and family history could strengthen your case.If the initial court ruling is unfavorable, you might have the option to appeal to higher courts, citing relevant laws, precedents, and constitutional provisions that support your claim. Sometimes, courts encourage mediation or alternative dispute resolution methods to resolve family property disputes without protracted legal battles.

    "answer": "Dear client,The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is frequently applicable in matters involving international child custody. But it's crucial to speak with a lawyer with experience in both American and Indian legal systems and a focus on family law. In India, religiously-based personal laws usually regulate custody disputes. When deciding custody, the Guardian and Wards Act of 1890 also applies. It is essential that you speak with an Indian lawyer to comprehend the particular laws and procedures that apply to your situation. Keep records of any financial transactions, abuse evidence, and your husband's approval to go, as these could be important information in future court cases.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "1. No, it will not be affected by the doctrine of Res judicata2. The Judgment in OS 1 is totally different to that of your claim in OS 2.  Your father after making the settlement of family property among the legal heirs, he withheld his own share in the property and has clearly mentioned that the 5 acres of landed property retained by him shall pass on to his four sons  after his death, hence the court passed a judgment cancelling the Will written by mother and the gift deed in favor of the grandson as null and void because your mother was not having any rights in the property that belonged  to your father except life interest.  Therefore the partition suit filed by the four sons would be maintainable and of course the daughters' claim for a share in it may not be maintainable..3 See the above answer.4. When you don't have a share at all in that 5 acres of land, where is the question of execution of your 1/7th share in it, besides that case is still going on and not decided yet.5.

  {
    "context": "Asked 1 year ago in Property Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Regarding section 11 of Res judicata and other issues",
    "answer": "First of all, you should know that the doctrine of res judicata is a legal principle that prevents the same matter from being re-litigated once it has been finally decided by a competent court. It is based on the need of giving finality to judicial decisions and saving time and harassment to parties. The doctrine of res judicata is embodied in section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in India. It applies to civil as well as administrative law.According to section 11, no court shall try any suit or issue in which the matter directly and substantially in issue has been directly and substantially in issue in a former suit between the same parties, or between parties under whom they or any of them claim, litigating under the same title, in a court competent to try such subsequent suit or the suit in which such issue has been subsequently raised, and has been heard and finally decided by such court.The conditions for applying res judicata are as follows.The matter directly and substantially in issue in the subsequent suit or issue must be the same matter which was directly and substantially in issue in the former suit or issue.The former suit or issue must have been a suit or an issue between the same parties or between parties under whom they or any of them claim.The parties must have been litigating under the same title in the former suit or issue.The court which decided the former suit or issue must have been a court competent to try the subsequent suit or the suit in which such issue is subsequently raised.The matter directly and substantially in issue in the subsequent suit must have been heard and finally decided by the court in the former suit.The doctrine of res judicata also includes constructive res judicata, which means that if a plea could have been taken by a party in a proceeding between him and his opponent, he should not be permitted to take that plea against the same party in a subsequent proceeding with reference to the same subject-matter.Now, coming to your questions:Given the court’s ruling in O.S (1), which declared the gift deed null and void, do we need to proceed with the trial in O.S (2), or does this situation fall under the doctrine of Res Judicata?It depends on whether the conditions for applying res judicata are satisfied or not. If the matter directly and substantially in issue in O.S (2) is the same as that in O.S (1), and if the parties are the same or claiming under the same title, and if the court which decided O.S (1) was competent to try O.S (2), and if the matter was heard and finally decided by that court, then res judicata would apply and O.S (2) would not be maintainable. However, if any of these conditions are not fulfilled, then res judicata would not apply and O.S (2) would have to be proceeded with.Can we submit the order copy of O.S (1) to the O.S (2) court as evidence and request that they dismiss the case based on the orders already passed? Furthermore, can we request the court to order an equal share for the four sons and three daughters as per the O.S (1) court’s ruling?You can submit the order copy of O.S (1) to the O.S (2) court as evidence, but it is up to the court to decide whether to dismiss the case based on res judicata or not. You can also request the court to order an equal share for the four sons and three daughters as per O.S (1), but again it is up to the court to decide whether to grant your request or not. The court may consider various factors such as whether O.S (1) was decided on merits or ex parte, whether there was any fraud or collusion involved, whether there was any change of law or circumstances, etc.Since the O.S (1) court order was ex parte, will the O.S (2) court provide an opportunity for my four brothers and Mr. C to present their case and arguments regarding their 1/4th share of the property?An ex parte order is one that is passed without hearing one party. Such an order may not be conclusive or binding on that party unless it is confirmed after giving him an opportunity of being heard. Therefore, if your four brothers and Mr. C were not heard by O.S (1) court before passing its order, they may have a chance to present their case and arguments before O.S (2) court regarding their 1/4th share of the property.Can I file execution case for my 1/7th share in 5 acres of land based on orders passed in my daughter case of O.S (1)?An execution case is one that is filed to enforce the decree or order of a court. If you have obtained a decree or order in your favour from O.S (1) court, you can file an execution case for your 1/7th share in 5 acres of land based on that decree or order. However, you should also ensure that the decree or order is not stayed or challenged by any higher court or authority.Filing application under order rule 7 and section 11 before O.S (2) court is required to dismiss the suit or just filing Memo with O.S (1) court order copy is sufficient to dismiss the suit.Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 provides that the plaint shall be rejected where it does not disclose a cause of action, or where the relief claimed is undervalued, or where the plaint is insufficiently stamped, or where it is barred by any law. Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 provides for res judicata as discussed above. If you want to dismiss the suit on any of these grounds, you have to file an application before O.S (2) court and prove your case. Merely filing a memo with O.S (1) court order copy may not be sufficient to dismiss the suit.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Regarding section 11 of Res judicata and other issues",
    "answer": "Dear ClientRes Judicata:The doctrine of Res Judicata essentially means that a matter that has already been adjudicated by a competent court cannot be re-litigated between the same parties. In your case, the court in O.S (1) has already issued a judgment declaring the gift deed null and void and establishing the ownership pattern of the property. This ruling may have a binding effect on the matter related to the property's ownership.Submitting the O.S (1) Order as Evidence:You can certainly submit the order copy of O.S (1) as evidence in O.S (2). This can help support your claim that the property's ownership has already been decided by the court in O.S (1). However, whether O.S (2) will be dismissed based solely on this evidence or whether the court will order an equal share for the four sons and three daughters as per O.S (1) depends on the discretion of the O.S (2) court. It's advisable to consult with your legal counsel on how to present this evidence effectively.Opportunity for Brothers and Mr. C:In O.S (2), if your brothers and Mr. C were not parties to O.S (1) and the order in O.S (1) was ex parte, they should have the opportunity to present their case and arguments regarding their 1/4th share of the property. The O.S (2) court may consider their claims and evidence before making a final determination.Execution Case for Your Share:If the O.S (1) court has issued an order declaring your daughter's share and the gift deed as null and void, you may be able to file an execution case to enforce this order and claim your 1/7th share in the 5 acres of land. Consult with your legal counsel to initiate this process correctly.Filing Application under Order Rule 7 and Section 11:Filing an application under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure can be used to seek the rejection of a plaint in a suit. This can be done if you believe that the suit is barred by the principles of Res Judicata due to the O.S (1) court's order. Consulting with your legal counsel on the specific procedure and arguments to be used in this application is essential to ensure its success.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,According to theTransfer of Property Actin India, a gift of immovable property can be made through a registered deed. However, there are conditions, including the donor's free consent and the donee's acceptance. If the gift was made by your grandmother under duress, coercion, or without her free consent, it could potentially be considered invalid. The court's ruling on the first Will and subsequent Gift Deed declared both null and void. If the court found that the Gift Deed was made without your grandmother's free consent or was a result of taking advantage of her old age, this could be a strong point in your favor. However, legal advice specific to the case and its documentation would be crucial in determining the validity of these documents. Based on the facts provided, it seems there might be grounds for filing a complaint or a separate case against the illegal transfer of the immovable property to Mr. C's name. The alleged misuse of power of attorney (GPA) and illegal acquisition of the property could potentially be challenged in court. Consulting a lawyer well-versed in property and succession laws in India would be advisable to understand the specifics and the most appropriate legal steps to take.

If no male descendant is there, the rights of the deceased would come to be inherited even by his brothers or other male relatives but not by his own daughter. In categorical terms, the Act has preferred the brother of a deceased to a married daughter of the deceased for inheritance in tenure holding. Thus, even in a nuclear family where there is no male survivor, the married daughter cannot inherit the rights, rather her uncle has been found by our legislature in its wisdom, to be a suitable heir to inherit the tenure holding.Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "question": "Uttar Pradesh ancestral agriculture property for married daughter",
    "answer": "Dear client,In Uttar Pradesh, the UPZLR Act does indeed have provisions that govern the succession of agricultural land. Regarding the UPZLR Act, it's essential to understand its provisions regarding the succession of agricultural land, especially when dealing with ancestral property. While the Act may prioritize certain heirs, recent judgments from the Supreme Court may have provided more equitable interpretations of inheritance rights, especially for married daughters.Verify the property's ancestral status and its classification under the relevant laws. Understanding the specific legal nuances regarding ancestral property can be crucial in determining your entitlement. You can send a legal notice to your brother asserting your rights and intentions to claim a fair share of the ancestral property. This can sometimes prompt negotiations or discussions for an amicable resolution. If negotiations fail, the lawyer may advise filing a lawsuit or petition in the appropriate court, presenting your case based on interpretations of recent Supreme Court judgments, arguing for the fair inheritance rights of married daughters in ancestral agricultural property. Providing evidence to establish your entitlement to the property through documentation and evidence of lineage and family history could strengthen your case.If the initial court ruling is unfavorable, you might have the option to appeal to higher courts, citing relevant laws, precedents, and constitutional provisions that support your claim. Sometimes, courts encourage mediation or alternative dispute resolution methods to resolve family property disputes without protracted legal battles.

However, it's crucial to consult with a qualified lawyer specialized in property and divorce law in India to assess the specifics of your situation. In some cases, filing such a suit during divorce proceedings might complicate matters, so legal advice tailored to your circumstances is vital.The declaration suit and the divorce case might have an impact on each other, potentially causing delays or complications. For instance, the court handling the divorce might decide to wait for the outcome of the declaration suit before making a decision on property division. Conversely, progress in the divorce case might influence how the court handles the declaration suit. These interrelations could vary based on the judge, court procedures, and the specific facts of your case.In Indian law, property acquired during marriage can be subject to division during divorce proceedings, regardless of whose name is on the property documents. However, if you can substantiate that the property was acquired solely with your funds and there's evidence to support this, it might strengthen your case for sole ownership.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Unit of measure by ankana is used in border districts of A.P. and Karnataka. According on ankana is equal to 72 feet in Nellore and 36 feet in Tirupati.As the property with excess is in your possession since time immemorial, you have acquired  perfect title over excess land by adverse possession, even the  excess does not originally belonged to you.Claim that excess belongs to you, there is only error of dimensions in title deed. As the land belongs to you, it cannot be purchased from anyone, there is no need to seek any regularization by any authority.Unless your neighbour initiates any legal action, you need not file any suit as your possession is open and known to all.Any action by will be taken as you have doubts about the possession and title over the  excess which  will work against you.Ravi ShindeAdvocate, Hyderabad4923 Answers42 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ravi Shinde"

    "question": "How to rectify the mismatch of the measurement in sale deed and actual measurement",
    "answer": "Dear client,1. Ankana Measurement: \"Ankana\" isn’t a standardized unit of measurement. It seems your grandfather might have used it informally. In some places, 1 Ankana might equate to 100 square feet or 10 feet x 10 feet, but it's essential to verify this through any local land records or regional measurement standards.2. Proof of Ownership: Your possession of the land for 70 years and consistent tax payments significantly strengthen your claim. This, coupled with the sale deed, suggests ownership. However, it's wise to gather additional historical documents, like old tax receipts, family records, or any other deeds or agreements that might indicate your family's possession.3. Extra Land: There might be provisions for regularization of extra land with municipal authorities through a process known as regularization or rectification. This could involve paying a fee or penalty for the additional area.4. Adverse Possession: Adverse possession laws in India require continuous, open, and notorious possession of land for a statutory period, which is typically 12 years. Your family's 70-year possession could, in theory, be argued as adverse possession.5. Adjacent Sites: Consistency in dimensions among neighboring properties can be compelling evidence. Reviewing their revenue records and getting in touch with the owners might provide insights or support for rectification.6. Correcting Measurements: Rectifying measurements would involve legal processes like filing for correction in land records, updating or amending the sale deed, or conducting a fresh survey. This typically requires legal representation and documentation.7. Options for Rectification: Request a re-survey or rectification based on evidence and discussions with neighbors. Seek legal recourse through a civil suit for correction of land records or title deeds. Consider mediation or negotiation with the neighbors to reach a mutual agreement.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "- As per Supreme court Judgment, provisions on adverse possession are made under the Limitation Act, 1963. In case an owner does not stake his claim over his property for 12 years, a squatter can acquire legal rights over the property.  The prescribed period in case of for government-owned properties is 30 years.- Further, to claim his ownership, this squatter has to prove that his occupancy of the property has been uninterrupted for the entire period. You cannot break the period into halves.- Further, he will also have to prove that he has been the sole occupant of the property. There cannot be under the provisions of the law multiple claimants.- Since, your family is in the possession of the remaining land for the last 70 years long period , then you can file a declaration suit before the court for declaring the owner on the ground of adverse possession- Tax payment is not a proof of ownership , however it can be considered as proof of occupation before the court.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "it applies to all agricultural properties2)Section 171 of the Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms, 1950 Act clearly lays down that in case a male tenure holder dies then his son or his male descendants will come to inherit his rights in the holding of land. His own daughter and son’s daughter and the descendants of daughters have been excluded for this purpose3)A married daughter has been completely excluded. If no male descendant is there, the rights of the deceased would come to be inherited even by his brothers or other male relatives but not by his own daughter. In categorical terms, the Act has preferred the brother of a deceased to a married daughter of the deceased for inheritance in tenure holding. Thus, even in a nuclear family where there is no male survivor, the married daughter cannot inherit the rights, rather her uncle has been found by our legislature in its wisdom, to be a suitable heir to inherit the tenure holding.Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "question": "Uttar Pradesh ancestral agriculture property for married daughter",
    "answer": "Dear client,In Uttar Pradesh, the UPZLR Act does indeed have provisions that govern the succession of agricultural land. Regarding the UPZLR Act, it's essential to understand its provisions regarding the succession of agricultural land, especially when dealing with ancestral property. While the Act may prioritize certain heirs, recent judgments from the Supreme Court may have provided more equitable interpretations of inheritance rights, especially for married daughters.Verify the property's ancestral status and its classification under the relevant laws. Understanding the specific legal nuances regarding ancestral property can be crucial in determining your entitlement. You can send a legal notice to your brother asserting your rights and intentions to claim a fair share of the ancestral property. This can sometimes prompt negotiations or discussions for an amicable resolution. If negotiations fail, the lawyer may advise filing a lawsuit or petition in the appropriate court, presenting your case based on interpretations of recent Supreme Court judgments, arguing for the fair inheritance rights of married daughters in ancestral agricultural property. Providing evidence to establish your entitlement to the property through documentation and evidence of lineage and family history could strengthen your case.If the initial court ruling is unfavorable, you might have the option to appeal to higher courts, citing relevant laws, precedents, and constitutional provisions that support your claim. Sometimes, courts encourage mediation or alternative dispute resolution methods to resolve family property disputes without protracted legal battles.

    "answer": "1. No, it will not be affected by the doctrine of Res judicata2. The Judgment in OS 1 is totally different to that of your claim in OS 2.  Your father after making the settlement of family property among the legal heirs, he withheld his own share in the property and has clearly mentioned that the 5 acres of landed property retained by him shall pass on to his four sons  after his death, hence the court passed a judgment cancelling the Will written by mother and the gift deed in favor of the grandson as null and void because your mother was not having any rights in the property that belonged  to your father except life interest.  Therefore the partition suit filed by the four sons would be maintainable and of course the daughters' claim for a share in it may not be maintainable..3 See the above answer.4. When you don't have a share at all in that 5 acres of land, where is the question of execution of your 1/7th share in it, besides that case is still going on and not decided yet.5.

  {
    "context": "Asked 1 year ago in Property Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Regarding section 11 of Res judicata and other issues",
    "answer": "First of all, you should know that the doctrine of res judicata is a legal principle that prevents the same matter from being re-litigated once it has been finally decided by a competent court. It is based on the need of giving finality to judicial decisions and saving time and harassment to parties. The doctrine of res judicata is embodied in section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in India. It applies to civil as well as administrative law.According to section 11, no court shall try any suit or issue in which the matter directly and substantially in issue has been directly and substantially in issue in a former suit between the same parties, or between parties under whom they or any of them claim, litigating under the same title, in a court competent to try such subsequent suit or the suit in which such issue has been subsequently raised, and has been heard and finally decided by such court.The conditions for applying res judicata are as follows.The matter directly and substantially in issue in the subsequent suit or issue must be the same matter which was directly and substantially in issue in the former suit or issue.The former suit or issue must have been a suit or an issue between the same parties or between parties under whom they or any of them claim.The parties must have been litigating under the same title in the former suit or issue.The court which decided the former suit or issue must have been a court competent to try the subsequent suit or the suit in which such issue is subsequently raised.The matter directly and substantially in issue in the subsequent suit must have been heard and finally decided by the court in the former suit.The doctrine of res judicata also includes constructive res judicata, which means that if a plea could have been taken by a party in a proceeding between him and his opponent, he should not be permitted to take that plea against the same party in a subsequent proceeding with reference to the same subject-matter.Now, coming to your questions:Given the court’s ruling in O.S (1), which declared the gift deed null and void, do we need to proceed with the trial in O.S (2), or does this situation fall under the doctrine of Res Judicata?It depends on whether the conditions for applying res judicata are satisfied or not. If the matter directly and substantially in issue in O.S (2) is the same as that in O.S (1), and if the parties are the same or claiming under the same title, and if the court which decided O.S (1) was competent to try O.S (2), and if the matter was heard and finally decided by that court, then res judicata would apply and O.S (2) would not be maintainable. However, if any of these conditions are not fulfilled, then res judicata would not apply and O.S (2) would have to be proceeded with.Can we submit the order copy of O.S (1) to the O.S (2) court as evidence and request that they dismiss the case based on the orders already passed? Furthermore, can we request the court to order an equal share for the four sons and three daughters as per the O.S (1) court’s ruling?You can submit the order copy of O.S (1) to the O.S (2) court as evidence, but it is up to the court to decide whether to dismiss the case based on res judicata or not. You can also request the court to order an equal share for the four sons and three daughters as per O.S (1), but again it is up to the court to decide whether to grant your request or not. The court may consider various factors such as whether O.S (1) was decided on merits or ex parte, whether there was any fraud or collusion involved, whether there was any change of law or circumstances, etc.Since the O.S (1) court order was ex parte, will the O.S (2) court provide an opportunity for my four brothers and Mr. C to present their case and arguments regarding their 1/4th share of the property?An ex parte order is one that is passed without hearing one party. Such an order may not be conclusive or binding on that party unless it is confirmed after giving him an opportunity of being heard. Therefore, if your four brothers and Mr. C were not heard by O.S (1) court before passing its order, they may have a chance to present their case and arguments before O.S (2) court regarding their 1/4th share of the property.Can I file execution case for my 1/7th share in 5 acres of land based on orders passed in my daughter case of O.S (1)?An execution case is one that is filed to enforce the decree or order of a court. If you have obtained a decree or order in your favour from O.S (1) court, you can file an execution case for your 1/7th share in 5 acres of land based on that decree or order. However, you should also ensure that the decree or order is not stayed or challenged by any higher court or authority.Filing application under order rule 7 and section 11 before O.S (2) court is required to dismiss the suit or just filing Memo with O.S (1) court order copy is sufficient to dismiss the suit.Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 provides that the plaint shall be rejected where it does not disclose a cause of action, or where the relief claimed is undervalued, or where the plaint is insufficiently stamped, or where it is barred by any law. Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 provides for res judicata as discussed above. If you want to dismiss the suit on any of these grounds, you have to file an application before O.S (2) court and prove your case. Merely filing a memo with O.S (1) court order copy may not be sufficient to dismiss the suit.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Regarding section 11 of Res judicata and other issues",
    "answer": "Dear ClientRes Judicata:The doctrine of Res Judicata essentially means that a matter that has already been adjudicated by a competent court cannot be re-litigated between the same parties. In your case, the court in O.S (1) has already issued a judgment declaring the gift deed null and void and establishing the ownership pattern of the property. This ruling may have a binding effect on the matter related to the property's ownership.Submitting the O.S (1) Order as Evidence:You can certainly submit the order copy of O.S (1) as evidence in O.S (2). This can help support your claim that the property's ownership has already been decided by the court in O.S (1). However, whether O.S (2) will be dismissed based solely on this evidence or whether the court will order an equal share for the four sons and three daughters as per O.S (1) depends on the discretion of the O.S (2) court. It's advisable to consult with your legal counsel on how to present this evidence effectively.Opportunity for Brothers and Mr. C:In O.S (2), if your brothers and Mr. C were not parties to O.S (1) and the order in O.S (1) was ex parte, they should have the opportunity to present their case and arguments regarding their 1/4th share of the property. The O.S (2) court may consider their claims and evidence before making a final determination.Execution Case for Your Share:If the O.S (1) court has issued an order declaring your daughter's share and the gift deed as null and void, you may be able to file an execution case to enforce this order and claim your 1/7th share in the 5 acres of land. Consult with your legal counsel to initiate this process correctly.Filing Application under Order Rule 7 and Section 11:Filing an application under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure can be used to seek the rejection of a plaint in a suit. This can be done if you believe that the suit is barred by the principles of Res Judicata due to the O.S (1) court's order.

However, there are conditions, including the donor's free consent and the donee's acceptance. If the gift was made by your grandmother under duress, coercion, or without her free consent, it could potentially be considered invalid. The court's ruling on the first Will and subsequent Gift Deed declared both null and void. If the court found that the Gift Deed was made without your grandmother's free consent or was a result of taking advantage of her old age, this could be a strong point in your favor. However, legal advice specific to the case and its documentation would be crucial in determining the validity of these documents. Based on the facts provided, it seems there might be grounds for filing a complaint or a separate case against the illegal transfer of the immovable property to Mr. C's name.

    "answer": "Dear client,In India, correcting the name on a marriage certificate can be a complex process and might vary depending on the specific circumstances and local regulations. Generally, it is possible to rectify errors or update names on official documents, including a marriage certificate, by following the legal procedures set by the government.Gather all the necessary documents that support your name change, such as your corrected ID proofs, educational certificates, and any other relevant documents. In some cases, if the registrar refuses to make the correction, you might need to approach a court to get an order to rectify the name on the marriage certificate. This process typically involves filing a petition and presenting your case to the court. In certain states, it might be necessary to publish a notice in local newspapers regarding the name change. This step aims to inform the public about the change and can be a legal requirement in some jurisdictions.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Provide proof of payment and communication in the form of WhatsApp conversations and online transaction records. Furthermore, if the attorney's bill seems excessive, you can petition to the court under Section 35 of the Act for an order to tax it. The court can determine whether the fees were fair in light of the absence of receipts. At the same time, report to the court that your attorney is impeding the legal process by refusing to provide the certified copy of your affidavit.

    "answer": "-  As per Section 90 of the IPC , When the accused gives promise to the victim to marry her, never had any intention to marry and the victim gave the consent for sexual intercourse on such an assurance by the accused that he would marry her, such a consent can be said to be a consent obtained on a misconception of fact and, in such a case, an offender can be said to have committed the rape as defined under Section 375 of IPC , and can be convicted for the offence under Section 376 of the IPC.- Hence, the consent for physical relation obtained by the said guy giving false promise of marriage is amounts to rape, and a complaint can be filed by you against him- There is no another way to force him for marriage except to file a complaint . However if he agrees for the marriage then the complaint can be withdrawn by you.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

The evidence of the wife's contradictory behavior and communication, like the WhatsApp messages where she's kissing the husband and seeking help for her friend's marriage, can be used to challenge her claims of forced actions or distress, potentially undermining her credibility in court.4. The call detail records, especially those indicating odd-hour communications before and after marriage, can be used as circumstantial evidence to support claims of ongoing relationships or activities. The court may consider these records to establish patterns or relationships relevant to the case.5. The gift declaration signed by witnesses, if contested as forced, might require these witnesses to testify or provide further evidence to establish its authenticity.

In absence of a probate grant, such transfer still remains questionable and is amenable to be set aside in future8. so it would be in your interest that you tell the seller to first have the Will duly probated and only thereafter it would be safe to proceed with the transaction9. the probate grant is also necessary from the future's perspective since any buyer of yours would obviously ask for probate10. as regards the earlier transfer in favour of the widow, you will have to issue a public notice and invite objections and claims11. to repeat, do first also check how this property became a private property owned by a co-operative housing society when originally it was owned [i assume] by the government, as the old premises were allotted to the SBI staffYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Purchase of redeveloped Flat",
    "answer": "Dear client,1. Probate Requirement: In India, obtaining a probate for a will is not mandatory, but it can be beneficial to establish the authenticity of the will. However, the absence of a probate may lead to challenges or disputes regarding the property title. In some cases, the society or authorities might insist on a probate to verify the legitimacy of the will.2. Legal Safeguards in Agreement: Ensure that the sale agreement includes clauses that protect you in case of any future disputes or claims arising from the property's title. You may consider indemnity clauses that protect you against losses due to any third-party claims regarding the property's ownership.3. Resale Concerns: When selling the property in the future, potential buyers may indeed inquire about the chain of ownership and the legitimacy of the title. Having a clear and documented history, including the share certificates and legal endorsements, could help establish the legitimacy of your ownership.4. Transfer of Title: The transfer of shares and chain of agreements between the original owner, the widow, and her nominated sister and brother-in-law seems legally sound, given the absence of other legal heirs. However, this can vary based on specific nuances of Indian property law and individual case circumstances.5. Publication for Claims: Advertising in newspapers to invite any potential claims on the property's title is a good proactive step. If no claims arise within the specified period, it can provide some reassurance regarding the absence of competing claims. However, it might not entirely eliminate potential future legal challenges.6. Documentation for Reselling: Showing the transfer of share certificates and appropriate endorsements to prospective buyers during a resale is a reasonable practice. This helps establish the legitimacy of the ownership transfer.7. Property Background: Understanding the property's origin as an SBI Officers' quarters, though not directly related to the legal aspects, can be important for transparency and providing a complete picture to potential buyers in the future.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In India, the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA) governs property registration and modifications to the original plan. Without the association's and the affected parties' permission, the developer may no longer make changes to the registered plans after turning over management to the association.

    "answer": "Dear client,Sorry to hear about your situation. Will is generally valid as long as it is properly executed and meets the requirements of Indian Succession Act, 1925. Creating, attesting, and guaranteeing legal conformity are all part of carrying out a will. Start by creating a precise and unambiguous will, and if necessary, seek legal counsel. The testator's signature and the signatures of at least two witnesses are required for the will, as per Section 63 of the Indian Succession Act. Although not required, registration enhances legitimacy (Section 18). Keep the original will safe, and if necessary, take Section 213 probate into consideration for validation. In the will, name an executor who will supervise the division of assets. After the testator's death, the executor may, pursuant to Section 301, begin the distribution procedure in line with the testator's wishes.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Does having name in Jamabandi as Kashatkaar means ownership of the property?",
    "answer": "Dear client,In Indian land records, the term \"Kashatkaar\" typically refers to a cultivator or someone who cultivates the land. However, being listed as a cultivator in Jamabandi records doesn’t necessarily confer ownership rights to the land. The Supreme Court of India has addressed the issue of rights based on land records in several cases, but it's essential to note that court rulings can vary based on specific circumstances and regional laws. Generally, ownership of land is determined by various factors, including sale deeds, inheritance, possession, and title documents, rather than solely relying on being listed as a cultivator in records.The Jamabandi records can serve as evidence of possession or cultivation, which may strengthen one's claim of ownership, especially if there's a long history of such cultivation. However, mere mention as a cultivator may not guarantee ownership rights, especially if there are conflicting claims or if the nature of the land has changed, such as from 'mumkin' (cultivable) to 'gairmumkin' (uncultivable). The process of claiming ownership based on Jamabandi records might involve legal procedures like adverse possession or claiming rights through continuous and undisturbed possession for a statutory period. Each case is unique, and it's advisable to consult a lawyer specialized in property and land laws in India for specific guidance.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In absence of a probate grant, such transfer still remains questionable and is amenable to be set aside in future8. so it would be in your interest that you tell the seller to first have the Will duly probated and only thereafter it would be safe to proceed with the transaction9. the probate grant is also necessary from the future's perspective since any buyer of yours would obviously ask for probate10. as regards the earlier transfer in favour of the widow, you will have to issue a public notice and invite objections and claims11. to repeat, do first also check how this property became a private property owned by a co-operative housing society when originally it was owned [i assume] by the government, as the old premises were allotted to the SBI staffYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Purchase of redeveloped Flat",
    "answer": "Dear client,1. Probate Requirement: In India, obtaining a probate for a will is not mandatory, but it can be beneficial to establish the authenticity of the will. However, the absence of a probate may lead to challenges or disputes regarding the property title. In some cases, the society or authorities might insist on a probate to verify the legitimacy of the will.2. Legal Safeguards in Agreement: Ensure that the sale agreement includes clauses that protect you in case of any future disputes or claims arising from the property's title. You may consider indemnity clauses that protect you against losses due to any third-party claims regarding the property's ownership.3. Resale Concerns: When selling the property in the future, potential buyers may indeed inquire about the chain of ownership and the legitimacy of the title. Having a clear and documented history, including the share certificates and legal endorsements, could help establish the legitimacy of your ownership.4. Transfer of Title: The transfer of shares and chain of agreements between the original owner, the widow, and her nominated sister and brother-in-law seems legally sound, given the absence of other legal heirs. However, this can vary based on specific nuances of Indian property law and individual case circumstances.5. Publication for Claims: Advertising in newspapers to invite any potential claims on the property's title is a good proactive step. If no claims arise within the specified period, it can provide some reassurance regarding the absence of competing claims. However, it might not entirely eliminate potential future legal challenges.6. Documentation for Reselling: Showing the transfer of share certificates and appropriate endorsements to prospective buyers during a resale is a reasonable practice. This helps establish the legitimacy of the ownership transfer.7. Property Background: Understanding the property's origin as an SBI Officers' quarters, though not directly related to the legal aspects, can be important for transparency and providing a complete picture to potential buyers in the future.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Alimony",
    "answer": "Dear client,1) In cases of divorce, the division of property can depend on various factors, including the type of property (inherited or acquired during the marriage), contributions made by both parties, and local laws. In some instances, inherited properties may be considered separate assets and not subject to division in a divorce, but this can vary based on the circumstances and the laws of the specific region.2) The determination of alimony or maintenance can depend on several factors, including the income disparity between the spouses, their respective financial situations, earning potential, duration of marriage, and individual needs. Courts may consider the financial independence of the spouses before awarding alimony. There might not be a fixed percentage (such as 25% of the husband's salary) universally applicable in all cases.3) When deciding alimony or maintenance, courts typically consider the financial obligations of both parties, including any new family responsibilities the husband might have. However, the primary consideration is usually the financial situation and needs of the divorced spouse rather than the husband's new family.Regarding property ownership, the inclusion of a spouse's name on a property document may not necessarily entitle them to an equal share in the property. Courts might consider various factors such as financial contributions, intentions behind adding the spouse's name, and other circumstances when determining property division. Courts usually aim for equitable distribution rather than equal division, taking into account the specific circumstances of each case.

    "answer": "Dear client,Sorry to hear about your situation.Children's ignorance about the value of education is the primary cause of their lack of interest in studying. It is the duty of educators and parents to help kids realize the value of education in one's life. Youngsters who do not understand the value of education frequently approach their studies with a very casual attitude. You must first comprehend why my child is not interested in studying in order to be able to assist them.When it comes to studying, the environment is crucial. And this could be the cause of your kids' lack of enthusiasm in learning. One of the main causes of your child's lack of interest in studying is their environment; perhaps there are many distractions occurring at home that keep your child's attention from their studies. Therefore, it is your duty as a responsible parent to give your kids a suitable atmosphere.To pique your child's curiosity about learning. It's important that you pay attention to their hobbies. Individuals have different conceptions of learning. It's possible that your youngster is struggling with learning rather than learning itself. It is uninteresting or unsettling to him/her. Thus, you ought to make an effort to identify a passion. For instance, if your youngster enjoys animals or stories well, this is an example. After that, you ought to begin connecting things to their area of interest. This will support your child in maintaining concentration and attention while studying. And it won't be dull and uncomfortable for them anymore.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "1. No, it will not be affected by the doctrine of Res judicata2. The Judgment in OS 1 is totally different to that of your claim in OS 2.  Your father after making the settlement of family property among the legal heirs, he withheld his own share in the property and has clearly mentioned that the 5 acres of landed property retained by him shall pass on to his four sons  after his death, hence the court passed a judgment cancelling the Will written by mother and the gift deed in favor of the grandson as null and void because your mother was not having any rights in the property that belonged  to your father except life interest.  Therefore the partition suit filed by the four sons would be maintainable and of course the daughters' claim for a share in it may not be maintainable..3 See the above answer.4. When you don't have a share at all in that 5 acres of land, where is the question of execution of your 1/7th share in it, besides that case is still going on and not decided yet.5.

  {
    "context": "Asked 1 year ago in Property Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Regarding section 11 of Res judicata and other issues",
    "answer": "First of all, you should know that the doctrine of res judicata is a legal principle that prevents the same matter from being re-litigated once it has been finally decided by a competent court. It is based on the need of giving finality to judicial decisions and saving time and harassment to parties. The doctrine of res judicata is embodied in section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in India. It applies to civil as well as administrative law.According to section 11, no court shall try any suit or issue in which the matter directly and substantially in issue has been directly and substantially in issue in a former suit between the same parties, or between parties under whom they or any of them claim, litigating under the same title, in a court competent to try such subsequent suit or the suit in which such issue has been subsequently raised, and has been heard and finally decided by such court.The conditions for applying res judicata are as follows.The matter directly and substantially in issue in the subsequent suit or issue must be the same matter which was directly and substantially in issue in the former suit or issue.The former suit or issue must have been a suit or an issue between the same parties or between parties under whom they or any of them claim.The parties must have been litigating under the same title in the former suit or issue.The court which decided the former suit or issue must have been a court competent to try the subsequent suit or the suit in which such issue is subsequently raised.The matter directly and substantially in issue in the subsequent suit must have been heard and finally decided by the court in the former suit.The doctrine of res judicata also includes constructive res judicata, which means that if a plea could have been taken by a party in a proceeding between him and his opponent, he should not be permitted to take that plea against the same party in a subsequent proceeding with reference to the same subject-matter.Now, coming to your questions:Given the court’s ruling in O.S (1), which declared the gift deed null and void, do we need to proceed with the trial in O.S (2), or does this situation fall under the doctrine of Res Judicata?It depends on whether the conditions for applying res judicata are satisfied or not. If the matter directly and substantially in issue in O.S (2) is the same as that in O.S (1), and if the parties are the same or claiming under the same title, and if the court which decided O.S (1) was competent to try O.S (2), and if the matter was heard and finally decided by that court, then res judicata would apply and O.S (2) would not be maintainable. However, if any of these conditions are not fulfilled, then res judicata would not apply and O.S (2) would have to be proceeded with.Can we submit the order copy of O.S (1) to the O.S (2) court as evidence and request that they dismiss the case based on the orders already passed? Furthermore, can we request the court to order an equal share for the four sons and three daughters as per the O.S (1) court’s ruling?You can submit the order copy of O.S (1) to the O.S (2) court as evidence, but it is up to the court to decide whether to dismiss the case based on res judicata or not. You can also request the court to order an equal share for the four sons and three daughters as per O.S (1), but again it is up to the court to decide whether to grant your request or not. The court may consider various factors such as whether O.S (1) was decided on merits or ex parte, whether there was any fraud or collusion involved, whether there was any change of law or circumstances, etc.Since the O.S (1) court order was ex parte, will the O.S (2) court provide an opportunity for my four brothers and Mr. C to present their case and arguments regarding their 1/4th share of the property?An ex parte order is one that is passed without hearing one party. Such an order may not be conclusive or binding on that party unless it is confirmed after giving him an opportunity of being heard. Therefore, if your four brothers and Mr. C were not heard by O.S (1) court before passing its order, they may have a chance to present their case and arguments before O.S (2) court regarding their 1/4th share of the property.Can I file execution case for my 1/7th share in 5 acres of land based on orders passed in my daughter case of O.S (1)?An execution case is one that is filed to enforce the decree or order of a court. If you have obtained a decree or order in your favour from O.S (1) court, you can file an execution case for your 1/7th share in 5 acres of land based on that decree or order. However, you should also ensure that the decree or order is not stayed or challenged by any higher court or authority.Filing application under order rule 7 and section 11 before O.S (2) court is required to dismiss the suit or just filing Memo with O.S (1) court order copy is sufficient to dismiss the suit.Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 provides that the plaint shall be rejected where it does not disclose a cause of action, or where the relief claimed is undervalued, or where the plaint is insufficiently stamped, or where it is barred by any law. Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 provides for res judicata as discussed above. If you want to dismiss the suit on any of these grounds, you have to file an application before O.S (2) court and prove your case. Merely filing a memo with O.S (1) court order copy may not be sufficient to dismiss the suit.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Regarding section 11 of Res judicata and other issues",
    "answer": "Dear ClientRes Judicata:The doctrine of Res Judicata essentially means that a matter that has already been adjudicated by a competent court cannot be re-litigated between the same parties. In your case, the court in O.S (1) has already issued a judgment declaring the gift deed null and void and establishing the ownership pattern of the property. This ruling may have a binding effect on the matter related to the property's ownership.Submitting the O.S (1) Order as Evidence:You can certainly submit the order copy of O.S (1) as evidence in O.S (2). This can help support your claim that the property's ownership has already been decided by the court in O.S (1). However, whether O.S (2) will be dismissed based solely on this evidence or whether the court will order an equal share for the four sons and three daughters as per O.S (1) depends on the discretion of the O.S (2) court. It's advisable to consult with your legal counsel on how to present this evidence effectively.Opportunity for Brothers and Mr. C:In O.S (2), if your brothers and Mr. C were not parties to O.S (1) and the order in O.S (1) was ex parte, they should have the opportunity to present their case and arguments regarding their 1/4th share of the property. The O.S (2) court may consider their claims and evidence before making a final determination.Execution Case for Your Share:If the O.S (1) court has issued an order declaring your daughter's share and the gift deed as null and void, you may be able to file an execution case to enforce this order and claim your 1/7th share in the 5 acres of land. Consult with your legal counsel to initiate this process correctly.Filing Application under Order Rule 7 and Section 11:Filing an application under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure can be used to seek the rejection of a plaint in a suit. This can be done if you believe that the suit is barred by the principles of Res Judicata due to the O.S (1) court's order. Consulting with your legal counsel on the specific procedure and arguments to be used in this application is essential to ensure its success.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,According to theTransfer of Property Actin India, a gift of immovable property can be made through a registered deed. However, there are conditions, including the donor's free consent and the donee's acceptance. If the gift was made by your grandmother under duress, coercion, or without her free consent, it could potentially be considered invalid. The court's ruling on the first Will and subsequent Gift Deed declared both null and void. If the court found that the Gift Deed was made without your grandmother's free consent or was a result of taking advantage of her old age, this could be a strong point in your favor. However, legal advice specific to the case and its documentation would be crucial in determining the validity of these documents. Based on the facts provided, it seems there might be grounds for filing a complaint or a separate case against the illegal transfer of the immovable property to Mr. C's name. The alleged misuse of power of attorney (GPA) and illegal acquisition of the property could potentially be challenged in court. Consulting a lawyer well-versed in property and succession laws in India would be advisable to understand the specifics and the most appropriate legal steps to take.

    "answer": "1. you first need to check whether or not this property is subject to the provisions of the Public Premises Act since originally the building was meant for occupation by the staff of SBI2. ideally on the demise of the original shareholder, the society ought to have requisitioned an heirship certificate or a letters of administration to be produced by the widow of the deceased shareholder, before transferring the shares to her name3. however such an application as above cannot be made now since the widow is no more. the aforesaid would have ensured that apart from the widow there are no other claimants claiming any right over the flat4. the widow died testate by leaving behind a registered Will5. the Will ought to be probated. even though there has been no claim since after the widow's demise, a probated Will would ensure that the widow really intended her flat to go to her sister and BIL, as a probate grant is a certificate by the Court that the Will is genuine and is made as per law6. please note that just because the Will is a registered one, that alone would not support its authenticity and genuineness. even a registered Will has to pass the muster of the law just like a non-registered Will7. it does not matter that the shares are already transferred to the beneficiaries of the Will. In absence of a probate grant, such transfer still remains questionable and is amenable to be set aside in future8. so it would be in your interest that you tell the seller to first have the Will duly probated and only thereafter it would be safe to proceed with the transaction9. the probate grant is also necessary from the future's perspective since any buyer of yours would obviously ask for probate10. as regards the earlier transfer in favour of the widow, you will have to issue a public notice and invite objections and claims11. to repeat, do first also check how this property became a private property owned by a co-operative housing society when originally it was owned [i assume] by the government, as the old premises were allotted to the SBI staffYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Dear client,1. Probate Requirement: In India, obtaining a probate for a will is not mandatory, but it can be beneficial to establish the authenticity of the will. However, the absence of a probate may lead to challenges or disputes regarding the property title. In some cases, the society or authorities might insist on a probate to verify the legitimacy of the will.2. Legal Safeguards in Agreement: Ensure that the sale agreement includes clauses that protect you in case of any future disputes or claims arising from the property's title. You may consider indemnity clauses that protect you against losses due to any third-party claims regarding the property's ownership.3. Resale Concerns: When selling the property in the future, potential buyers may indeed inquire about the chain of ownership and the legitimacy of the title. Having a clear and documented history, including the share certificates and legal endorsements, could help establish the legitimacy of your ownership.4. Transfer of Title: The transfer of shares and chain of agreements between the original owner, the widow, and her nominated sister and brother-in-law seems legally sound, given the absence of other legal heirs. However, this can vary based on specific nuances of Indian property law and individual case circumstances.5. Publication for Claims: Advertising in newspapers to invite any potential claims on the property's title is a good proactive step. If no claims arise within the specified period, it can provide some reassurance regarding the absence of competing claims. However, it might not entirely eliminate potential future legal challenges.6. Documentation for Reselling: Showing the transfer of share certificates and appropriate endorsements to prospective buyers during a resale is a reasonable practice. This helps establish the legitimacy of the ownership transfer.7. Property Background: Understanding the property's origin as an SBI Officers' quarters, though not directly related to the legal aspects, can be important for transparency and providing a complete picture to potential buyers in the future.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Although a parking space allotment letter may have legal implications, it may not formally establish your ownership of the place. It's imperative to complete a valid parking spot selling deed and register it in accordance with the Indian Registration Act, 1908, in order to guarantee ownership.Having a separate parking space sale deed is an additional legal technique. Signed by both parties, this deed must be completed on non-judicial stamp paper and filed with the local sub-registrar's office. This guarantees a clean, legal title transfer, establishing you as the parking space's legitimate owner.

In absence of a probate grant, such transfer still remains questionable and is amenable to be set aside in future8. so it would be in your interest that you tell the seller to first have the Will duly probated and only thereafter it would be safe to proceed with the transaction9. the probate grant is also necessary from the future's perspective since any buyer of yours would obviously ask for probate10. as regards the earlier transfer in favour of the widow, you will have to issue a public notice and invite objections and claims11. to repeat, do first also check how this property became a private property owned by a co-operative housing society when originally it was owned [i assume] by the government, as the old premises were allotted to the SBI staffYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "1. The allotment letter issued by builder allotting the parking space is not a title document, the parking space belongs to the apartment owners association, hence at a later stage the association may even re-allot the space to any other member who is not having even a single space, at that stage you cannot fight or contest in the absence of a registered document2. If at all the builder is executing a registered sale deed to sell the parking space you can buy it  and claim the title legally.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Car Parking Allotment from builder",
    "answer": "Dear client,Although a parking space allotment letter may have legal implications, it may not formally establish your ownership of the place. It's imperative to complete a valid parking spot selling deed and register it in accordance with the Indian Registration Act, 1908, in order to guarantee ownership.Having a separate parking space sale deed is an additional legal technique. Signed by both parties, this deed must be completed on non-judicial stamp paper and filed with the local sub-registrar's office. This guarantees a clean, legal title transfer, establishing you as the parking space's legitimate owner. Verify adherence to all applicable municipal and Registration Act laws.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Temple construction in a gated community",
    "answer": "Dear client,1. If the General Body, with a majority vote, approves the construction of a temple using donations, the Management Committee usually has the authority to proceed with the construction within the framework of the approved budget and guidelines.2. Permissions required typically involve:- Local municipal authority's approval for construction.- Land-use permissions.- Environmental clearances, if applicable.- Compliance with building codes and regulations.- Permissions from relevant authorities for any religious or spiritual structure.3. The construction of a temple might affect the Undivided Share (UDS) of a flat owner if it involves common areas where the temple is built. If the temple construction utilizes shared spaces or affects the UDS in any way, it might need a consensus or a specific agreement to ensure fairness among the flat owners.4. Generally, decisions made by a majority vote in the General Body meeting hold weight unless the governing documents (like bylaws or regulations) of the association specify that unanimous consent is required for certain decisions.5. The ownership of land in the name of a deity or association depends on various factors including legal structuring and religious practices. In some cases, the society might hold the land in trust for the deity or religious purpose.In India, several legal provisions govern the construction of religious structures, management of housing societies, and building regulations. Here are a few acts and provisions relevant to these matters:1. The Societies Registration Act, 1860: This act governs the registration of societies. Housing societies are usually registered under this act, and it provides guidelines for their functioning, including decision-making processes and rules for the management committee.2. Apartment Ownership Act: Different states in India have their own Apartment Ownership Acts (like Maharashtra Apartment Ownership Act, 1970) that regulate the ownership and management of apartment buildings and housing societies.3. The Municipal Laws: Each city or municipality has its own building bylaws and regulations that dictate the rules for construction, including permissions needed for any construction work, adherence to safety norms, and land usage.4. Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments Acts: Each state might have its specific laws governing religious institutions and their properties. These laws often dictate how religious properties can be managed, used, and the permissions needed for any construction or alterations.5. Cooperative Housing Society Bylaws: Housing societies typically have their own bylaws that outline rules and regulations regarding construction, alterations, and usage of common areas. These bylaws are often formulated in line with the state's cooperative society laws.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Bank account for loan",
    "answer": "Dear client,Proving the utilization of the loan amount for the construction of a building, especially in a legal context, requires documentation and evidence.Documentation:Review the loan agreement or documents related to the loan. It should ideally specify the purpose of the loan. If it explicitly mentions the construction of the building, that serves as evidence. Gather bank statements showing the transactions involving the loan amount. These records should indicate withdrawals or transfers linked to the construction work, such as payments made to contractors, purchase of construction materials, etc. Any invoices, bills, or receipts related to the construction can serve as evidence. These documents should ideally match the timeline and amount of the loan disbursement. Any communication (emails, letters, etc.) between your father and relevant parties (builders, contractors, suppliers) discussing the utilization of the loan for construction purposes can be valuable. If there were individuals involved in the construction process who can attest to the fact that the loan was indeed used for building purposes, their statements can support your claim.Survey of Loan Amount:The \"survey of loan amount\" is not a standard legal term in Indian law. However, you might be referring to substantiating the utilization of the loan amount for the intended purpose, which involves providing evidence (as mentioned above) to showcase the correlation between the loan and the construction.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The Code of Civil Procedure (CPC), in particular, gives the court the authority to make orders that are required to further the goals of justice (Section 94). Any attempts by the owner to sell or begin development in defiance of the court order could result in legal ramifications due to the status quo order on the HUDA file. The order that is currently on file supports your position and could result in the permits that were issued in violation of the initial order being rejected. Furthermore, the Specific Relief Act, which aims to stop actions that disobey court orders, may address the demolition and reconstruction without permission.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Status Quo Order - Effect of",
    "answer": "If a court orders maintain the status quo on the property it means that two components of the property that comes under the purview of status quo one is the possession and other is the title. When status quo is ordered when a suit is instituted then the person who is holding the possession and title shall retain such possession and title until the suit is disposed of. Basically status quo is ordered to prevent the third party interests in the property that is with respect to leasing, selling, mortgaging, gifting, willing or any acts which is done to transfer the interest in the property under theTransfer of property act.Therefore it would be better to maintain the same status till the status quo order is vacated to avoid for being booked for contempt of courtT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Status Quo Order - Effect of",
    "answer": "Dear client,The court order you mentioned, directing the parties to maintain the status quo regarding the alienation of the suit property, typically means that none of the involved parties should alter the state of the property or its ownership while the case is ongoing. Violation of this order could constitute contempt of court.Regarding the benefits of having the application and Status Quo order on the HUDA file:Having the court order on the HUDA file means that any further actions or permissions sought regarding the property should be considered in light of the court's directive to maintain the status quo. This could potentially prevent the issuance of further permits or certificates until the legal case is resolved.Regarding the owner's actions:Demolishing the original building might be seen as a violation of the court order to maintain the status quo if the order specifically mentioned preserving the property in its existing state. However, this might also depend on the exact wording of the court order and its interpretation by the court. If the court order prohibited any alteration to the property, obtaining permission from HUDA to construct a larger property might also be seen as a violation of the court order. The completion of the new house might pose a challenge in terms of enforcing the court order. However, having the court order on the HUDA file could prevent the owner from obtaining necessary certificates or paperwork related to the new construction until the legal matter is resolved.Regarding Contempt of Court:Whether the owner or HUDA is in contempt of the court order would depend on the specific language and scope of the court order and the actions taken. Violating a court order can be considered contempt, but it would ultimately be determined by the court. You may want to bring this to the attention of the court by filing a contempt petition if you believe that the owner's actions or HUDA's involvement are in violation of the court order. Consult with your legal counsel to understand the best course of action and the specific steps to take under Indian laws.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Status Quo Order - Effect of",
    "answer": "In law, the phrase \"status quo\" describes the current state of affairs.To prevent any of the parties to a dispute from acting while the matter is still being adjudicated, a judge may issue a status quo order.Under Property Law, Status quo refers to upholding the status or condition of the thing/property in question. You cannot sell, sublet, lease, or do anything with the property if a property lawsuit has resulted in an order to maintain the status quo. The property must remain in the same condition as it did on the day the order was passed.However as per The doctrine of Lis Pendence, envisioned under Section 52 of theTransfer of Property Act, will, however, automatically govern actions related to selling, buying, or transferring title in the property if a lawsuit is pending against it. Status quo does not bar any of the rights of the property holder; only the right to transfer the property gets put on hold while the matter is pending. The person who is currently enjoying the property would continue to do so, and if he encounters any interference with this right, he or she may sue the person who is causing dispute.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Status Quo Order - Effect of",
    "answer": "Dear client,Based on the specific wording of the court order you provided, which instructs the parties to maintain the status quo \"qua alienation of the suit property,\" it appears to primarily address the aspect of transferring or disposing of the property rather than construction per se. Your advocate's interpretation seems aligned with this wording, suggesting that the order restricts actions related to selling, mortgaging, or leasing the property but does not explicitly prohibit construction.Regarding the owner's construction activities and their interaction with HUDA:The owner's construction activities might not directly violate the court order, as long as they aren't attempting to alienate (sell, lease, mortgage, etc.) the property. Therefore, the completion of the construction itself might not cause immediate legal problems for the owner based on the court order.Having the court order on the HUDA file means that any paperwork or certificates related to the property, particularly those that might involve the transfer or change of ownership rights, could face scrutiny or possible delay due to the existence of the court order. This could hinder the owner's attempts to finalize paperwork or certificates related to the property until the legal matter is resolved.It's essential to monitor the situation closely, especially as the construction nears completion, to see if the owner attempts any actions that could be interpreted as an attempt to alienate the property.

    "answer": "1. you first need to check whether or not this property is subject to the provisions of the Public Premises Act since originally the building was meant for occupation by the staff of SBI2. ideally on the demise of the original shareholder, the society ought to have requisitioned an heirship certificate or a letters of administration to be produced by the widow of the deceased shareholder, before transferring the shares to her name3. however such an application as above cannot be made now since the widow is no more. the aforesaid would have ensured that apart from the widow there are no other claimants claiming any right over the flat4. the widow died testate by leaving behind a registered Will5. the Will ought to be probated. even though there has been no claim since after the widow's demise, a probated Will would ensure that the widow really intended her flat to go to her sister and BIL, as a probate grant is a certificate by the Court that the Will is genuine and is made as per law6. please note that just because the Will is a registered one, that alone would not support its authenticity and genuineness. even a registered Will has to pass the muster of the law just like a non-registered Will7. it does not matter that the shares are already transferred to the beneficiaries of the Will. In absence of a probate grant, such transfer still remains questionable and is amenable to be set aside in future8. so it would be in your interest that you tell the seller to first have the Will duly probated and only thereafter it would be safe to proceed with the transaction9. the probate grant is also necessary from the future's perspective since any buyer of yours would obviously ask for probate10. as regards the earlier transfer in favour of the widow, you will have to issue a public notice and invite objections and claims11. to repeat, do first also check how this property became a private property owned by a co-operative housing society when originally it was owned [i assume] by the government, as the old premises were allotted to the SBI staffYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

What if the Will is made up or concocted?It is settled law that mere transfer of shares to the nominees does not make them the owner of the flat. The nominees merely hold the property as trustees for the actual claimants or legal heirs of the deceased member.4 - as informed the transfer of shares from husband to wife was required to be preceded by an heirship certificate or letter of administration obtained by the widow from the High Court. That was not done.

So it does not matter whether these two persons are class 1 heirs or belong to any other class. The succession to the flat will take place by testamentary succession and NOT intestate succession, provided the Will is proved as genuine and probate obtained5. give in FPJ [English] and Navshakti [Marathi].

    "answer": "Dear client,1. Probate Requirement: In India, obtaining a probate for a will is not mandatory, but it can be beneficial to establish the authenticity of the will. However, the absence of a probate may lead to challenges or disputes regarding the property title. In some cases, the society or authorities might insist on a probate to verify the legitimacy of the will.2. Legal Safeguards in Agreement: Ensure that the sale agreement includes clauses that protect you in case of any future disputes or claims arising from the property's title. You may consider indemnity clauses that protect you against losses due to any third-party claims regarding the property's ownership.3. Resale Concerns: When selling the property in the future, potential buyers may indeed inquire about the chain of ownership and the legitimacy of the title. Having a clear and documented history, including the share certificates and legal endorsements, could help establish the legitimacy of your ownership.4. Transfer of Title: The transfer of shares and chain of agreements between the original owner, the widow, and her nominated sister and brother-in-law seems legally sound, given the absence of other legal heirs. However, this can vary based on specific nuances of Indian property law and individual case circumstances.5. Publication for Claims: Advertising in newspapers to invite any potential claims on the property's title is a good proactive step. If no claims arise within the specified period, it can provide some reassurance regarding the absence of competing claims. However, it might not entirely eliminate potential future legal challenges.6. Documentation for Reselling: Showing the transfer of share certificates and appropriate endorsements to prospective buyers during a resale is a reasonable practice. This helps establish the legitimacy of the ownership transfer.7. Property Background: Understanding the property's origin as an SBI Officers' quarters, though not directly related to the legal aspects, can be important for transparency and providing a complete picture to potential buyers in the future.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,It seems you're dealing with a complex legal situation regarding ancestral property and a series of legal proceedings in India.1. Notice of Plaintiff's Death: Your advocate should bring the death of the plaintiff to the attention of the appeal court. Usually, the LRs (Legal Representatives) of the deceased plaintiff would need to be impleaded in the appeal suit.2. Challenge to Condonation of Delay and Revocation Order: Yes, the LRs of the deceased plaintiff can challenge the condonation of delay and the exparte revocation order in the appeal court (District Court). They can argue that proper notice wasn't served due to the change in your address and the plaintiff's death.3. Filing an Appeal: The LRs of the deceased plaintiff can file an appeal in the same court (District Court) against the orders obtained by hiding the plaintiff's death. If they believe there was a lack of due process due to the plaintiff's death not being acknowledged, they can address this in the appeal.4. Effect of Release Deed: The fact that the deceased plaintiff and their LRs released their share in the property through a registered Release Deed might limit their rights to challenge certain aspects. However, it doesn’t necessarily preclude them from contesting procedural irregularities or lack of due process in subsequent legal proceedings.5. LRs Contesting the Appeal Suit: The LRs of the deceased plaintiff can contest the appeal suit and also aim to set aside the exparte orders. They have the opportunity to present their case and argue that they were not duly informed or involved in the proceedings due to the plaintiff's death.Under Indian law, the process can vary based on specific circumstances, and the court will generally aim to provide fair opportunities for all parties involved. It’s crucial to gather all relevant documents, evidence of communication attempts regarding address changes, and any legal documents (such as the Release Deed) to support your case.

    "answer": "1. The LRs of the deceased can file a petition before the appellate court intimating the death of the plaintiff and to implead the LRs in the appeal suit.2. They first have to get themselves impleaded as parties to the appeal after which they can think about the maintainability of the proposed challenge to the exparte decision of the condone delay petition.3. When the plaintiff was reported to have died, his LRs were very well aware of the pending appeal suit, they could have intimated the court about the death at that time itself without waiting for the court to send summons to the LRs of deceased.The court is not aware of the death of the plaintiff hence it became the duty of the LRs to intimate about the death especially when they came to know about the pending restoration petition.4. If the appeal is against the interest of the LRs then they can very well get impleaded in the appeal.5. The court will implead the LRs but the challenge against the decision to condone the delay may not be entertained by court.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Is  appeal suit valid after release deed with one of the coparcener?",
    "answer": "Dear client,1. Effect of Release Deed: The Release Deed can act as a form of estoppel, especially if it clearly states that the lands being released are ancestral property and acknowledges the plaintiff's entitlement to a 1/5th share. This document might limit the appellants' arguments regarding the plaintiff's share if presented properly before the court.2. Plaintiff Not Included in Release Deed: The legal reasons for not including the plaintiff as a releasor in the deed could vary. It's possible that the plaintiff might not have been included due to his willingness to relinquish his share and might not have considered himself a party to the deed. However, this would need careful legal scrutiny based on the specific circumstances surrounding the creation of the Release Deed.3. Legal Capacity of Plaintiff's Legal Heirs to Sign the Release Deed: Generally, the legal heirs of a living person may not have the authority or capacity to release a share in ancestral property without the involvement or consent of the person who holds that share, i.e., the plaintiff. If the plaintiff was alive and mentally competent, their direct involvement or consent in the release would typically be required.4. Recording the Release Deed in Court: To amend shares and pass a fresh preliminary decree, especially considering the changes brought about by the Release Deed, it would be prudent to present the Release Deed before the court. This document can be used as evidence to petition for an amendment to the preliminary decree, specifying the changes in ownership as per the deed.In essence, the Release Deed holds weight as a legal document, especially if it clearly outlines the relinquishment of the plaintiff's share in the ancestral property. However, the circumstances surrounding its creation and the absence of the plaintiff's inclusion might need further examination by a legal expert. Bringing this document to the attention of the court during the appeal proceedings could significantly impact the case's outcome.

    "answer": "Dear client,The Release Deed appears to explicitly acknowledge and accept the preliminary decree issued by the court, confirming the entitlement of the plaintiff (XXX) to a 1/5th share of the ancestral property. It mentions the court's decision and explicitly states the intention of the releasors (the legal heirs of the plaintiff) to release their inherited share in favor of the releasees for a monetary consideration.Effect on the Appeal: The language used in the Release Deed seems to acknowledge the plaintiff's entitlement as per the preliminary decree. This document could significantly impact the appeal proceedings, potentially limiting the scope for the appellants to contest the plaintiff's share. It strengthens the acknowledgment of the plaintiff's entitlement to the 1/5th share as decreed by the court.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It is the duty of educators and parents to help kids realize the value of education in one's life. Youngsters who do not understand the value of education frequently approach their studies with a very casual attitude. You must first comprehend why my child is not interested in studying in order to be able to assist them.When it comes to studying, the environment is crucial. And this could be the cause of your kids' lack of enthusiasm in learning. One of the main causes of your child's lack of interest in studying is their environment; perhaps there are many distractions occurring at home that keep your child's attention from their studies. Therefore, it is your duty as a responsible parent to give your kids a suitable atmosphere.To pique your child's curiosity about learning. It's important that you pay attention to their hobbies. Individuals have different conceptions of learning. It's possible that your youngster is struggling with learning rather than learning itself. It is uninteresting or unsettling to him/her. Thus, you ought to make an effort to identify a passion. For instance, if your youngster enjoys animals or stories well, this is an example. After that, you ought to begin connecting things to their area of interest. This will support your child in maintaining concentration and attention while studying.

Anticipatory bail is a precautionary measure to secure your release if you anticipate arrest.2) Look Out Circular (LOC): To ascertain if an LOC has been issued against you, your lawyer or legal representative can make inquiries with the police or relevant authorities. They might communicate with the police department or use legal channels to obtain this information discreetly.3) Arrest of Family Members: Unless your brother is explicitly named or involved in the FIR, he might not face immediate arrest. However, if there's any suspicion or concern, your brother should consult with his lawyer to safeguard his legal rights. Regarding the illegal entry into his house, filing a complaint against the police officers involved might be an option.4) Legal Action for Defense: Your lawyer can explore several legal options for your defense:If there's evidence of harassment or false claims, your legal counsel might advise filing counter-complaints against your ex-wife and ex-girlfriend for defamation or false accusations. Gathering evidence to disprove the allegations made against you is crucial.

    "question": "Wakf Board Property",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, the process for selling or transferring a property with a lease involves several steps and considerations, especially when it comes to leasehold properties.Understanding Leasehold Property Transfer:Start by thoroughly reviewing the lease agreement to understand any clauses related to transfer or sale. Some leases might have restrictions or conditions regarding transfers. If the lease agreement requires it, seek consent from the lessor (the entity or individual who granted the lease) before transferring the lease or selling the property.Process for Transfer or Sale:Prepare all necessary documents including the original lease agreement, property documents, identification proofs, and any other required paperwork. If you’re selling the property, negotiate the terms of sale with the potential buyer. Ensure all terms are agreed upon and put in writing. Prepare a transfer deed or sale deed, depending on whether you’re transferring the lease or selling the property outright. This document should outline the details of the transaction. Execute the transfer deed and get it registered at the Sub-Registrar's office within the jurisdiction where the property is located. This step is crucial for legal validity. Once the documentation is in place, seek approval from the lessor or relevant authority if required by the lease terms.Tips:Conduct thorough due diligence on the property and lease terms before initiating the transfer or sale process. This includes checking for any outstanding dues, liabilities, or legal issues related to the property. Engage professionals like lawyers, real estate agents, or property consultants to guide you through the process. They can help ensure a smooth transaction and protect your interests. Maintain clear communication with all parties involved, including the buyer, lessor, legal representatives, and any other relevant stakeholders. Adhere to all legal and regulatory requirements throughout the process to avoid any complications or legal issues later on. If selling the property, hone your negotiation skills to secure a favorable deal while being fair and transparent.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Status Quo Order - Effect of",
    "answer": "It is imperative to obtain the status quo order on the HUDA file, since this could have a substantial impact on the property dispute. The Code of Civil Procedure (CPC), in particular, gives the court the authority to make orders that are required to further the goals of justice (Section 94). Any attempts by the owner to sell or begin development in defiance of the court order could result in legal ramifications due to the status quo order on the HUDA file. The order that is currently on file supports your position and could result in the permits that were issued in violation of the initial order being rejected. Furthermore, the Specific Relief Act, which aims to stop actions that disobey court orders, may address the demolition and reconstruction without permission.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Status Quo Order - Effect of",
    "answer": "If a court orders maintain the status quo on the property it means that two components of the property that comes under the purview of status quo one is the possession and other is the title. When status quo is ordered when a suit is instituted then the person who is holding the possession and title shall retain such possession and title until the suit is disposed of. Basically status quo is ordered to prevent the third party interests in the property that is with respect to leasing, selling, mortgaging, gifting, willing or any acts which is done to transfer the interest in the property under theTransfer of property act.Therefore it would be better to maintain the same status till the status quo order is vacated to avoid for being booked for contempt of courtT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Status Quo Order - Effect of",
    "answer": "Dear client,The court order you mentioned, directing the parties to maintain the status quo regarding the alienation of the suit property, typically means that none of the involved parties should alter the state of the property or its ownership while the case is ongoing. Violation of this order could constitute contempt of court.Regarding the benefits of having the application and Status Quo order on the HUDA file:Having the court order on the HUDA file means that any further actions or permissions sought regarding the property should be considered in light of the court's directive to maintain the status quo. This could potentially prevent the issuance of further permits or certificates until the legal case is resolved.Regarding the owner's actions:Demolishing the original building might be seen as a violation of the court order to maintain the status quo if the order specifically mentioned preserving the property in its existing state. However, this might also depend on the exact wording of the court order and its interpretation by the court. If the court order prohibited any alteration to the property, obtaining permission from HUDA to construct a larger property might also be seen as a violation of the court order. The completion of the new house might pose a challenge in terms of enforcing the court order. However, having the court order on the HUDA file could prevent the owner from obtaining necessary certificates or paperwork related to the new construction until the legal matter is resolved.Regarding Contempt of Court:Whether the owner or HUDA is in contempt of the court order would depend on the specific language and scope of the court order and the actions taken. Violating a court order can be considered contempt, but it would ultimately be determined by the court. You may want to bring this to the attention of the court by filing a contempt petition if you believe that the owner's actions or HUDA's involvement are in violation of the court order. Consult with your legal counsel to understand the best course of action and the specific steps to take under Indian laws.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Status Quo Order - Effect of",
    "answer": "In law, the phrase \"status quo\" describes the current state of affairs.To prevent any of the parties to a dispute from acting while the matter is still being adjudicated, a judge may issue a status quo order.Under Property Law, Status quo refers to upholding the status or condition of the thing/property in question. You cannot sell, sublet, lease, or do anything with the property if a property lawsuit has resulted in an order to maintain the status quo. The property must remain in the same condition as it did on the day the order was passed.However as per The doctrine of Lis Pendence, envisioned under Section 52 of theTransfer of Property Act, will, however, automatically govern actions related to selling, buying, or transferring title in the property if a lawsuit is pending against it. Status quo does not bar any of the rights of the property holder; only the right to transfer the property gets put on hold while the matter is pending. The person who is currently enjoying the property would continue to do so, and if he encounters any interference with this right, he or she may sue the person who is causing dispute.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Status Quo Order - Effect of",
    "answer": "Dear client,Based on the specific wording of the court order you provided, which instructs the parties to maintain the status quo \"qua alienation of the suit property,\" it appears to primarily address the aspect of transferring or disposing of the property rather than construction per se. Your advocate's interpretation seems aligned with this wording, suggesting that the order restricts actions related to selling, mortgaging, or leasing the property but does not explicitly prohibit construction.Regarding the owner's construction activities and their interaction with HUDA:The owner's construction activities might not directly violate the court order, as long as they aren't attempting to alienate (sell, lease, mortgage, etc.) the property. Therefore, the completion of the construction itself might not cause immediate legal problems for the owner based on the court order.Having the court order on the HUDA file means that any paperwork or certificates related to the property, particularly those that might involve the transfer or change of ownership rights, could face scrutiny or possible delay due to the existence of the court order. This could hinder the owner's attempts to finalize paperwork or certificates related to the property until the legal matter is resolved.It's essential to monitor the situation closely, especially as the construction nears completion, to see if the owner attempts any actions that could be interpreted as an attempt to alienate the property.

    "answer": "1. you first need to check whether or not this property is subject to the provisions of the Public Premises Act since originally the building was meant for occupation by the staff of SBI2. ideally on the demise of the original shareholder, the society ought to have requisitioned an heirship certificate or a letters of administration to be produced by the widow of the deceased shareholder, before transferring the shares to her name3. however such an application as above cannot be made now since the widow is no more. the aforesaid would have ensured that apart from the widow there are no other claimants claiming any right over the flat4. the widow died testate by leaving behind a registered Will5. the Will ought to be probated. even though there has been no claim since after the widow's demise, a probated Will would ensure that the widow really intended her flat to go to her sister and BIL, as a probate grant is a certificate by the Court that the Will is genuine and is made as per law6. please note that just because the Will is a registered one, that alone would not support its authenticity and genuineness. even a registered Will has to pass the muster of the law just like a non-registered Will7. it does not matter that the shares are already transferred to the beneficiaries of the Will. In absence of a probate grant, such transfer still remains questionable and is amenable to be set aside in future8. so it would be in your interest that you tell the seller to first have the Will duly probated and only thereafter it would be safe to proceed with the transaction9. the probate grant is also necessary from the future's perspective since any buyer of yours would obviously ask for probate10. as regards the earlier transfer in favour of the widow, you will have to issue a public notice and invite objections and claims11. to repeat, do first also check how this property became a private property owned by a co-operative housing society when originally it was owned [i assume] by the government, as the old premises were allotted to the SBI staffYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

What if the Will is made up or concocted?It is settled law that mere transfer of shares to the nominees does not make them the owner of the flat. The nominees merely hold the property as trustees for the actual claimants or legal heirs of the deceased member.4 - as informed the transfer of shares from husband to wife was required to be preceded by an heirship certificate or letter of administration obtained by the widow from the High Court. That was not done.

So it does not matter whether these two persons are class 1 heirs or belong to any other class.

    "answer": "Dear client,1. Probate Requirement: In India, obtaining a probate for a will is not mandatory, but it can be beneficial to establish the authenticity of the will. However, the absence of a probate may lead to challenges or disputes regarding the property title. In some cases, the society or authorities might insist on a probate to verify the legitimacy of the will.2. Legal Safeguards in Agreement: Ensure that the sale agreement includes clauses that protect you in case of any future disputes or claims arising from the property's title. You may consider indemnity clauses that protect you against losses due to any third-party claims regarding the property's ownership.3. Resale Concerns: When selling the property in the future, potential buyers may indeed inquire about the chain of ownership and the legitimacy of the title. Having a clear and documented history, including the share certificates and legal endorsements, could help establish the legitimacy of your ownership.4. Transfer of Title: The transfer of shares and chain of agreements between the original owner, the widow, and her nominated sister and brother-in-law seems legally sound, given the absence of other legal heirs. However, this can vary based on specific nuances of Indian property law and individual case circumstances.5. Publication for Claims: Advertising in newspapers to invite any potential claims on the property's title is a good proactive step. If no claims arise within the specified period, it can provide some reassurance regarding the absence of competing claims. However, it might not entirely eliminate potential future legal challenges.6. Documentation for Reselling: Showing the transfer of share certificates and appropriate endorsements to prospective buyers during a resale is a reasonable practice. This helps establish the legitimacy of the ownership transfer.7. Property Background: Understanding the property's origin as an SBI Officers' quarters, though not directly related to the legal aspects, can be important for transparency and providing a complete picture to potential buyers in the future.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Unregistered partnership firm",
    "answer": "Dear client,In general, the legal status of a partnership firm in India, whether registered or unregistered, can have implications on the resolution of disputes. Unregistered partnership firms may face limitations in enforcing their rights and claiming reliefs in court. In many cases, registered firms enjoy certain benefits and have a better legal standing. If one of the unregistered firms has subsequently registered itself before filing a suit, this registration might influence the legal proceedings. Registration may confer certain rights and benefits that unregistered firms may not have. The time of the dispute may be relevant in determining which laws and regulations apply. Changes in the legal status of the firms over time, such as registration, can impact the legal framework under which the dispute is resolved. The Partnership Act, 1932, governs the operation of partnership firms in India. However, the legal landscape may have evolved, and court decisions may influence the interpretation of the law.

    "question": "Adjudication process and lawyer need for POA",
    "answer": "Dear client,A Power of Attorney (PoA) must be registered and decided upon in India through a series of stages. First, the Indian Consulate outside needs to attest the PoA. It must be registered with the Sub-Registrar of Assurances in the jurisdiction where the property is located as soon as it arrives in India. The Registration Act of 1908, Section 32, requires that PoA be registered. The adjudication process includes figuring out how much stamp duty the document needs to pay in accordance with the Indian Stamp Act of 1899. The adjudicating officer at the District Registrar's Office often handles this. Although it is feasible to complete the process on your own, hiring a lawyer can guarantee that all legal requirements are met, particularly the computation of stamp duty, which is essential for legitimacy.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

To maintain the validity of the PoA, adherence to this deadline is essential. Adjudication is not necessarily hampered by the certified PoA's lack of a sealed envelope from the Indian Consulate. To allow for processing, submit the Power of Attorney to the District Registrar at least one day before the property sale. Make sure you have the required supporting documentation on hand.

    "answer": "Dear client,It seems you're dealing with a complex legal situation regarding ancestral property and a series of legal proceedings in India.1. Notice of Plaintiff's Death: Your advocate should bring the death of the plaintiff to the attention of the appeal court. Usually, the LRs (Legal Representatives) of the deceased plaintiff would need to be impleaded in the appeal suit.2. Challenge to Condonation of Delay and Revocation Order: Yes, the LRs of the deceased plaintiff can challenge the condonation of delay and the exparte revocation order in the appeal court (District Court). They can argue that proper notice wasn't served due to the change in your address and the plaintiff's death.3. Filing an Appeal: The LRs of the deceased plaintiff can file an appeal in the same court (District Court) against the orders obtained by hiding the plaintiff's death. If they believe there was a lack of due process due to the plaintiff's death not being acknowledged, they can address this in the appeal.4. Effect of Release Deed: The fact that the deceased plaintiff and their LRs released their share in the property through a registered Release Deed might limit their rights to challenge certain aspects. However, it doesn’t necessarily preclude them from contesting procedural irregularities or lack of due process in subsequent legal proceedings.5. LRs Contesting the Appeal Suit: The LRs of the deceased plaintiff can contest the appeal suit and also aim to set aside the exparte orders. They have the opportunity to present their case and argue that they were not duly informed or involved in the proceedings due to the plaintiff's death.Under Indian law, the process can vary based on specific circumstances, and the court will generally aim to provide fair opportunities for all parties involved. It’s crucial to gather all relevant documents, evidence of communication attempts regarding address changes, and any legal documents (such as the Release Deed) to support your case.

    "question": "Is  appeal suit valid after release deed with one of the coparcener?",
    "answer": "Dear client,1. Effect of Release Deed: The Release Deed can act as a form of estoppel, especially if it clearly states that the lands being released are ancestral property and acknowledges the plaintiff's entitlement to a 1/5th share. This document might limit the appellants' arguments regarding the plaintiff's share if presented properly before the court.2. Plaintiff Not Included in Release Deed: The legal reasons for not including the plaintiff as a releasor in the deed could vary. It's possible that the plaintiff might not have been included due to his willingness to relinquish his share and might not have considered himself a party to the deed. However, this would need careful legal scrutiny based on the specific circumstances surrounding the creation of the Release Deed.3. Legal Capacity of Plaintiff's Legal Heirs to Sign the Release Deed: Generally, the legal heirs of a living person may not have the authority or capacity to release a share in ancestral property without the involvement or consent of the person who holds that share, i.e., the plaintiff. If the plaintiff was alive and mentally competent, their direct involvement or consent in the release would typically be required.4. Recording the Release Deed in Court: To amend shares and pass a fresh preliminary decree, especially considering the changes brought about by the Release Deed, it would be prudent to present the Release Deed before the court. This document can be used as evidence to petition for an amendment to the preliminary decree, specifying the changes in ownership as per the deed.In essence, the Release Deed holds weight as a legal document, especially if it clearly outlines the relinquishment of the plaintiff's share in the ancestral property. However, the circumstances surrounding its creation and the absence of the plaintiff's inclusion might need further examination by a legal expert. Bringing this document to the attention of the court during the appeal proceedings could significantly impact the case's outcome.

    "question": "Is  appeal suit valid after release deed with one of the coparcener?",
    "answer": "Dear client,The Release Deed appears to explicitly acknowledge and accept the preliminary decree issued by the court, confirming the entitlement of the plaintiff (XXX) to a 1/5th share of the ancestral property. It mentions the court's decision and explicitly states the intention of the releasors (the legal heirs of the plaintiff) to release their inherited share in favor of the releasees for a monetary consideration.Effect on the Appeal: The language used in the Release Deed seems to acknowledge the plaintiff's entitlement as per the preliminary decree. This document could significantly impact the appeal proceedings, potentially limiting the scope for the appellants to contest the plaintiff's share. It strengthens the acknowledgment of the plaintiff's entitlement to the 1/5th share as decreed by the court.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Temple construction in a gated community",
    "answer": "Dear client,1. If the General Body, with a majority vote, approves the construction of a temple using donations, the Management Committee usually has the authority to proceed with the construction within the framework of the approved budget and guidelines.2. Permissions required typically involve:- Local municipal authority's approval for construction.- Land-use permissions.- Environmental clearances, if applicable.- Compliance with building codes and regulations.- Permissions from relevant authorities for any religious or spiritual structure.3. The construction of a temple might affect the Undivided Share (UDS) of a flat owner if it involves common areas where the temple is built. If the temple construction utilizes shared spaces or affects the UDS in any way, it might need a consensus or a specific agreement to ensure fairness among the flat owners.4. Generally, decisions made by a majority vote in the General Body meeting hold weight unless the governing documents (like bylaws or regulations) of the association specify that unanimous consent is required for certain decisions.5. The ownership of land in the name of a deity or association depends on various factors including legal structuring and religious practices. In some cases, the society might hold the land in trust for the deity or religious purpose.In India, several legal provisions govern the construction of religious structures, management of housing societies, and building regulations. Here are a few acts and provisions relevant to these matters:1. The Societies Registration Act, 1860: This act governs the registration of societies. Housing societies are usually registered under this act, and it provides guidelines for their functioning, including decision-making processes and rules for the management committee.2. Apartment Ownership Act: Different states in India have their own Apartment Ownership Acts (like Maharashtra Apartment Ownership Act, 1970) that regulate the ownership and management of apartment buildings and housing societies.3. The Municipal Laws: Each city or municipality has its own building bylaws and regulations that dictate the rules for construction, including permissions needed for any construction work, adherence to safety norms, and land usage.4. Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments Acts: Each state might have its specific laws governing religious institutions and their properties. These laws often dictate how religious properties can be managed, used, and the permissions needed for any construction or alterations.5. Cooperative Housing Society Bylaws: Housing societies typically have their own bylaws that outline rules and regulations regarding construction, alterations, and usage of common areas. These bylaws are often formulated in line with the state's cooperative society laws.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "What actions can be taken if the society members are not letting us complete our renovation work",
    "answer": "Dear client,Sorry to hear about your situation. Property rights and building codes are controlled by housing society bylaws and local municipal laws. Although it's a good idea to work with the society, you are usually not needed to provide any more paperwork than what is necessary by law. The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA), which describes the rights and responsibilities of both builders and buyers, is a legal resource that you can consult. Your development should be regarded as lawful if it follows the original building design and has municipal approval. Under the Co-operative Societies Act, you may pursue legal recourse if members of the society harass or hinder you. The Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, for instance, forbids deliberate hindrance of legally permitted operations when it comes to section 91.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"
