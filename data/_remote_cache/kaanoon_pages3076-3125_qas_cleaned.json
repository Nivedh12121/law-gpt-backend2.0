    "answer": "- As per law, if a deed contains mistakes like mis-spellings in names, description of property, these mistakes can later be corrected through rectification deeds.- A deed can be rectified at any time since there is no limitation for rectification. Whenever an error found out in a deed, the parties can proceed with rectification of the error at any time.- Since, there is an error in the vendor name in your registered Sale deed; hence it comes under the typographical error and it can be rectified after executing a Rectification deed.- The registration charges and stamp duty for typographical errors are usually around Rs. 100.- Further, the presence of vendor and vendee is necessary before the Registrar for the said rectification, hence even the last deed can be rectified if both the parties are in existence.- Otherwise ,if the last deed not rectified then the latest may create trouble at the time of selling the property.- However, the said vendor can execute an affidavit and can publish in two newspapers after mentioning that both the names are same and of one person.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

Whenever an error found out in a deed, the parties can proceed with rectification of the error at any time.- Since, there is an error in the vendor name in your registered Sale deed; hence it comes under the typographical error and it can be rectified after executing a Rectification deed.- The registration charges and stamp duty for typographical errors are usually around Rs. 100.- Further, the presence of vendor and vendee is necessary before the Registrar for the said rectification, hence even the last deed can be rectified if both the parties are in existence.- Otherwise ,if the last deed not rectified then the latest may create trouble at the time of selling the property.- However, the said vendor can execute an affidavit and can publish in two newspapers after mentioning that both the names are same and of one person.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "This query was already answered beforeYou are just shooting blind shots without reproducing what is exactly stated in the WillB cannot become an executor just because A diedIt all depends on the exact wordings of the WillI had already given my view based on your previous queryIt is only when A refuses to act as an executor or if A is unavailable due to him being out of India for a long time, that B can become an executorThe Will does not say (as the per the limited information given by you in your previous query) that if A dies then B shall assume the role of an executorSo you need to show the Will to a lawyer of your choice for him to advise properlyAsking vague questions like this won't helpIf B cannot become an executor then any legatee named in the Will can apply to the court for being appointed as an administrator for administering the estate of the deceased. For that a LA petition with Will annexed has to be filed.

After your grandfather's time, it devolved equally upon your aunt and your father.

Technically, yes, but the third party may insist on division by metes and bounds before the sale.2. & 3. After your father's death, all his legal heirs are entitled to equal shares in his estate. You cannot claim the whole share. All the legal heirs have to jointly execute the sale deed in favour of the buyer.

For that a LA petition with Will annexed has to be filed.

    "answer": "Dear Client,I would suggest you to consult a lawyer, my understanding of this process is that the offer letter is an intent to offer employment should certain conditions be met, not a guarantee of employment.If this goes to court, it is the companies onus to prove that they have spent this amount of money beyond what is necessary as part of their need to hire manpower, to attract only you as a special candidate.Next time, if you see such clauses on the offer letter, do not join because such organizations are bound to have issues and will surely have higher than normal attrition.They can not claim anything unless they have spent anything for hiring you with your consent, which by the way is not possible.Nothing become a contract unless it is on stamp paper. And an acceptance of offer does not bind you in the way the concerned company has shown. Also, they can take no legal measures, unless you were formally in written informed about their holding right to claim the said amount, that too on stamp paper.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "- As per Specific Relief Act, if any employee quits before the notice period, the Employer can only recover the Notice pay, and the Company cannot force to serve the entire notice period.- Further, the resignation decision is the employee’s decision, and the employer cannot sue for breach of contract, if the employee leaves without serving contractual notice.- Further, no employer can refused to return the original certificates or to issue relieving letter .If they are doing so, their act is illegal, unjustified and against the fundamental rights of the employee.- Further, the employment bond with the negative covenant is valid and legally enforceable, if the parties agree with their free consent i.e. without force, coercion, undue influence, misrepresentation and mistake, but it is not enforceable, if it is either one sided, unconscionable or unreasonable.- Further, theProbationary periods are often applied to new employees as a means of determining their capabilities in a new job.- Further, the employer can terminate during the probation, and employee can also leave the job with the terms and conditions mentioned in the appointment letter for probation.- Hence , if you have not signed the offer letter then you are not responsible for the payment of any amount- You an reply the said notice after mentioning that you are no an employee of the said company legally , and also not accountable to pay any compensation .Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Transfer fee",
    "answer": "The transfer fee charged by the society has a legal basis as in an existing cooperative society, the owner of the flat only holds a share in the society and enjoys the right to occupy the particular flat that he owns. The transfer fee amount is decided by the members of the general body of the society.There is no legal basis on which a builder can levy transfer charges on the apartment owner.It violates theTransfer of Property Act, 1882; which states that ‘a transfer of property, passes forthwith to the transferee, all the interest which the transferor is then capable of passing in the property and in the legal incidents thereof’. According to the Act,the owner alone holds the full right to property and the builder has no right, title or interest over the property post registration of the propertyin the name of the owner.It violates the Indian Contract Act, 1872. It is an extra contractual demand made by the builder on the buyer, which infringes the buyer’s ownership rights.A builder has no rights over the ownership of the buyer’s property and hence if the buyer wants to sell the property off to a third party, then no payment can be demanded on the part of the builder.The builders threaten that upon non-payment of transfer charges, the buyer would not be able to sell off the flat. This is apunishable offense under Section 384 and 385 ofIndian Penal Code(IPC).The undue influence exerted by the builder is prohibited byCompetition Act, 2007.Imposition of unlawful transfer fees by builders is deemed‘abuse of dominant position’as defined under section 4 of the Act.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Transfer fee",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Builder-buyer agreements, which are drafted and executed at the time of sale of an under-construction property, act as a sale agreement between the buyer and the builder. The buyer and the builder have to conclude the property transaction, based on the terms and conditions mentioned in the builder-buyer agreement, which clearly states the nitty-gritties involved in the property sale.Transfer charges in builder-buyer agreementsThis clause in agreements used to state that the buyer had to pay the developer a ‘transfer charge’, if the apartment was resold before the buyer took its possession. No disclosure was, however, made about what kind of amount the buyer would have to pay.Section 13 (2) of the law prescribes that the builder-buyer agreement contain each and every detail, leaving little scope for confusion in terms of the builder’s responsibilities.“The agreement for sale shall specify the particulars of development of the project, including the construction of building and apartments, along with specifications and internal development works and external development works, the dates and the manner by which payments towards the cost are to be made and the date on which it is to be handed over, the rates of interest in case of default, and such other particulars,” says the law.Without registration, a buyer has no legal right over the property so, one cannot sell it to anyone under the Transfer of Property Rights Act.Section 79 of the Cooperative Societies Act says that the premium amount of transfer charge should not exceed Rs 25,000.A transfer fee is applicable only at transfer of property not at first sale by builder. Demand of society for transfer is illegal.While your sale deed is the proof that the property has been legally transferred in your name, a share certificate is legal proof that you are the rightful owner of the co-operative housing society’s shares. It is the duty of the managing committee to issue share certificates after due diligence. In the case of society share certificate transfer, the share certificates should be issued to transferee within a period of one month of receipt of the instrument of transfer by such Company.In case of a resale, if a person needs to transfer the share certificate, all of the paperwork and necessary requirements pertaining to the transfer of shares must be completed on time. It is the new member who needs to pay the transfer premium and ensure that all the dues are cleared by the previous homeowner.In case of transfer/resale, the original share certificate has to be given to the society along with the other documents needed. If the share certificate is being transferred to a new member after resale, they have to finished all paperwork prior to handing the share certificate, including the required transfer of shares procedures.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

No conveyance is possible through an unregistered GPA.Registered Sale Deed in April 2005 based on notarised GPA is legally valid, because the Registration of GPA was optional before the Hon'ble Supreme Court.Sale through GPA is not valid.The provisions of Section 17(1)(g) of the Registration Act apply. Though POA creating power of right of transfer or any transaction relating to immovable property is required to be registered compulsorily, those executed in favour of close relatives such as father, mother, husband, son, daughter etc. have been exempted. As such, the transaction is valid.Property sales through common practice of General Power of Attorney will not give ownership title to the buyer.While stating that property transactions done through general power of attorney (GPA) had no legal sanctity, the Supreme Court (SC) ruled that only registered sale deeds provide any legal holding to such transactions.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

No conveyance is possible through an unregistered GPA.Registered Sale Deed in April 2005 based on notarised GPA is legally valid, because the Registration of GPA was optional before the Hon'ble Supreme Court.Sale through GPA is not valid.The provisions of Section 17(1)(g) of the Registration Act apply. Though POA creating power of right of transfer or any transaction relating to immovable property is required to be registered compulsorily, those executed in favour of close relatives such as father, mother, husband, son, daughter etc. have been exempted. As such, the transaction is valid.Property sales through common practice of General Power of Attorney will not give ownership title to the buyer.While stating that property transactions done through general power of attorney (GPA) had no legal sanctity, the Supreme Court (SC) ruled that only registered sale deeds provide any legal holding to such transactions.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Transfer fee",
    "answer": "The transfer fee charged by the society has a legal basis as in an existing cooperative society, the owner of the flat only holds a share in the society and enjoys the right to occupy the particular flat that he owns. The transfer fee amount is decided by the members of the general body of the society.There is no legal basis on which a builder can levy transfer charges on the apartment owner.It violates theTransfer of Property Act, 1882; which states that ‘a transfer of property, passes forthwith to the transferee, all the interest which the transferor is then capable of passing in the property and in the legal incidents thereof’. According to the Act,the owner alone holds the full right to property and the builder has no right, title or interest over the property post registration of the propertyin the name of the owner.It violates the Indian Contract Act, 1872. It is an extra contractual demand made by the builder on the buyer, which infringes the buyer’s ownership rights.A builder has no rights over the ownership of the buyer’s property and hence if the buyer wants to sell the property off to a third party, then no payment can be demanded on the part of the builder.The builders threaten that upon non-payment of transfer charges, the buyer would not be able to sell off the flat. This is apunishable offense under Section 384 and 385 ofIndian Penal Code(IPC).The undue influence exerted by the builder is prohibited byCompetition Act, 2007.Imposition of unlawful transfer fees by builders is deemed‘abuse of dominant position’as defined under section 4 of the Act.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Transfer fee",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Builder-buyer agreements, which are drafted and executed at the time of sale of an under-construction property, act as a sale agreement between the buyer and the builder. The buyer and the builder have to conclude the property transaction, based on the terms and conditions mentioned in the builder-buyer agreement, which clearly states the nitty-gritties involved in the property sale.Transfer charges in builder-buyer agreementsThis clause in agreements used to state that the buyer had to pay the developer a ‘transfer charge’, if the apartment was resold before the buyer took its possession. No disclosure was, however, made about what kind of amount the buyer would have to pay.Section 13 (2) of the law prescribes that the builder-buyer agreement contain each and every detail, leaving little scope for confusion in terms of the builder’s responsibilities.“The agreement for sale shall specify the particulars of development of the project, including the construction of building and apartments, along with specifications and internal development works and external development works, the dates and the manner by which payments towards the cost are to be made and the date on which it is to be handed over, the rates of interest in case of default, and such other particulars,” says the law.Without registration, a buyer has no legal right over the property so, one cannot sell it to anyone under the Transfer of Property Rights Act.Section 79 of the Cooperative Societies Act says that the premium amount of transfer charge should not exceed Rs 25,000.A transfer fee is applicable only at transfer of property not at first sale by builder. Demand of society for transfer is illegal.While your sale deed is the proof that the property has been legally transferred in your name, a share certificate is legal proof that you are the rightful owner of the co-operative housing society’s shares. It is the duty of the managing committee to issue share certificates after due diligence. In the case of society share certificate transfer, the share certificates should be issued to transferee within a period of one month of receipt of the instrument of transfer by such Company.In case of a resale, if a person needs to transfer the share certificate, all of the paperwork and necessary requirements pertaining to the transfer of shares must be completed on time. It is the new member who needs to pay the transfer premium and ensure that all the dues are cleared by the previous homeowner.In case of transfer/resale, the original share certificate has to be given to the society along with the other documents needed. If the share certificate is being transferred to a new member after resale, they have to finished all paperwork prior to handing the share certificate, including the required transfer of shares procedures.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

No conveyance is possible through an unregistered GPA.Registered Sale Deed in April 2005 based on notarised GPA is legally valid, because the Registration of GPA was optional before the Hon'ble Supreme Court.Sale through GPA is not valid.The provisions of Section 17(1)(g) of the Registration Act apply. Though POA creating power of right of transfer or any transaction relating to immovable property is required to be registered compulsorily, those executed in favour of close relatives such as father, mother, husband, son, daughter etc. have been exempted. As such, the transaction is valid.Property sales through common practice of General Power of Attorney will not give ownership title to the buyer.While stating that property transactions done through general power of attorney (GPA) had no legal sanctity, the Supreme Court (SC) ruled that only registered sale deeds provide any legal holding to such transactions.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Transfer fee",
    "answer": "The transfer fee charged by the society has a legal basis as in an existing cooperative society, the owner of the flat only holds a share in the society and enjoys the right to occupy the particular flat that he owns. The transfer fee amount is decided by the members of the general body of the society.There is no legal basis on which a builder can levy transfer charges on the apartment owner.It violates theTransfer of Property Act, 1882; which states that ‘a transfer of property, passes forthwith to the transferee, all the interest which the transferor is then capable of passing in the property and in the legal incidents thereof’. According to the Act,the owner alone holds the full right to property and the builder has no right, title or interest over the property post registration of the propertyin the name of the owner.It violates the Indian Contract Act, 1872. It is an extra contractual demand made by the builder on the buyer, which infringes the buyer’s ownership rights.A builder has no rights over the ownership of the buyer’s property and hence if the buyer wants to sell the property off to a third party, then no payment can be demanded on the part of the builder.The builders threaten that upon non-payment of transfer charges, the buyer would not be able to sell off the flat. This is apunishable offense under Section 384 and 385 ofIndian Penal Code(IPC).The undue influence exerted by the builder is prohibited byCompetition Act, 2007.Imposition of unlawful transfer fees by builders is deemed‘abuse of dominant position’as defined under section 4 of the Act.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Transfer fee",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Builder-buyer agreements, which are drafted and executed at the time of sale of an under-construction property, act as a sale agreement between the buyer and the builder. The buyer and the builder have to conclude the property transaction, based on the terms and conditions mentioned in the builder-buyer agreement, which clearly states the nitty-gritties involved in the property sale.Transfer charges in builder-buyer agreementsThis clause in agreements used to state that the buyer had to pay the developer a ‘transfer charge’, if the apartment was resold before the buyer took its possession. No disclosure was, however, made about what kind of amount the buyer would have to pay.Section 13 (2) of the law prescribes that the builder-buyer agreement contain each and every detail, leaving little scope for confusion in terms of the builder’s responsibilities.“The agreement for sale shall specify the particulars of development of the project, including the construction of building and apartments, along with specifications and internal development works and external development works, the dates and the manner by which payments towards the cost are to be made and the date on which it is to be handed over, the rates of interest in case of default, and such other particulars,” says the law.Without registration, a buyer has no legal right over the property so, one cannot sell it to anyone under the Transfer of Property Rights Act.Section 79 of the Cooperative Societies Act says that the premium amount of transfer charge should not exceed Rs 25,000.A transfer fee is applicable only at transfer of property not at first sale by builder. Demand of society for transfer is illegal.While your sale deed is the proof that the property has been legally transferred in your name, a share certificate is legal proof that you are the rightful owner of the co-operative housing society’s shares. It is the duty of the managing committee to issue share certificates after due diligence. In the case of society share certificate transfer, the share certificates should be issued to transferee within a period of one month of receipt of the instrument of transfer by such Company.In case of a resale, if a person needs to transfer the share certificate, all of the paperwork and necessary requirements pertaining to the transfer of shares must be completed on time. It is the new member who needs to pay the transfer premium and ensure that all the dues are cleared by the previous homeowner.In case of transfer/resale, the original share certificate has to be given to the society along with the other documents needed. If the share certificate is being transferred to a new member after resale, they have to finished all paperwork prior to handing the share certificate, including the required transfer of shares procedures.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

On the other hand, the Licensor shall compensate the Licensee for loss and inconvenience caused to the Licensee if he has been asked to vacate the premises.\"Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,I would suggest you to consult a lawyer, my understanding of this process is that the offer letter is an intent to offer employment should certain conditions be met, not a guarantee of employment.If this goes to court, it is the companies onus to prove that they have spent this amount of money beyond what is necessary as part of their need to hire manpower, to attract only you as a special candidate.Next time, if you see such clauses on the offer letter, do not join because such organizations are bound to have issues and will surely have higher than normal attrition.They can not claim anything unless they have spent anything for hiring you with your consent, which by the way is not possible.Nothing become a contract unless it is on stamp paper. And an acceptance of offer does not bind you in the way the concerned company has shown. Also, they can take no legal measures, unless you were formally in written informed about their holding right to claim the said amount, that too on stamp paper.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Property transfer using unregistered GPA with notary seal",
    "answer": "Dear Client,It is true that a GPA has to be registered before a sale can be made on its basis. No conveyance is possible through an unregistered GPA.Registered Sale Deed in April 2005 based on notarised GPA is legally valid, because the Registration of GPA was optional before the Hon'ble Supreme Court.Sale through GPA is not valid.The provisions of Section 17(1)(g) of the Registration Act apply. Though POA creating power of right of transfer or any transaction relating to immovable property is required to be registered compulsorily, those executed in favour of close relatives such as father, mother, husband, son, daughter etc. have been exempted. As such, the transaction is valid.Property sales through common practice of General Power of Attorney will not give ownership title to the buyer.While stating that property transactions done through general power of attorney (GPA) had no legal sanctity, the Supreme Court (SC) ruled that only registered sale deeds provide any legal holding to such transactions.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Transfer fee",
    "answer": "The transfer fee charged by the society has a legal basis as in an existing cooperative society, the owner of the flat only holds a share in the society and enjoys the right to occupy the particular flat that he owns. The transfer fee amount is decided by the members of the general body of the society.There is no legal basis on which a builder can levy transfer charges on the apartment owner.It violates theTransfer of Property Act, 1882; which states that ‘a transfer of property, passes forthwith to the transferee, all the interest which the transferor is then capable of passing in the property and in the legal incidents thereof’. According to the Act,the owner alone holds the full right to property and the builder has no right, title or interest over the property post registration of the propertyin the name of the owner.It violates the Indian Contract Act, 1872. It is an extra contractual demand made by the builder on the buyer, which infringes the buyer’s ownership rights.A builder has no rights over the ownership of the buyer’s property and hence if the buyer wants to sell the property off to a third party, then no payment can be demanded on the part of the builder.The builders threaten that upon non-payment of transfer charges, the buyer would not be able to sell off the flat. This is apunishable offense under Section 384 and 385 ofIndian Penal Code(IPC).The undue influence exerted by the builder is prohibited byCompetition Act, 2007.Imposition of unlawful transfer fees by builders is deemed‘abuse of dominant position’as defined under section 4 of the Act.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Transfer fee",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Builder-buyer agreements, which are drafted and executed at the time of sale of an under-construction property, act as a sale agreement between the buyer and the builder. The buyer and the builder have to conclude the property transaction, based on the terms and conditions mentioned in the builder-buyer agreement, which clearly states the nitty-gritties involved in the property sale.Transfer charges in builder-buyer agreementsThis clause in agreements used to state that the buyer had to pay the developer a ‘transfer charge’, if the apartment was resold before the buyer took its possession. No disclosure was, however, made about what kind of amount the buyer would have to pay.Section 13 (2) of the law prescribes that the builder-buyer agreement contain each and every detail, leaving little scope for confusion in terms of the builder’s responsibilities.“The agreement for sale shall specify the particulars of development of the project, including the construction of building and apartments, along with specifications and internal development works and external development works, the dates and the manner by which payments towards the cost are to be made and the date on which it is to be handed over, the rates of interest in case of default, and such other particulars,” says the law.Without registration, a buyer has no legal right over the property so, one cannot sell it to anyone under the Transfer of Property Rights Act.Section 79 of the Cooperative Societies Act says that the premium amount of transfer charge should not exceed Rs 25,000.A transfer fee is applicable only at transfer of property not at first sale by builder. Demand of society for transfer is illegal.While your sale deed is the proof that the property has been legally transferred in your name, a share certificate is legal proof that you are the rightful owner of the co-operative housing society’s shares. It is the duty of the managing committee to issue share certificates after due diligence. In the case of society share certificate transfer, the share certificates should be issued to transferee within a period of one month of receipt of the instrument of transfer by such Company.In case of a resale, if a person needs to transfer the share certificate, all of the paperwork and necessary requirements pertaining to the transfer of shares must be completed on time. It is the new member who needs to pay the transfer premium and ensure that all the dues are cleared by the previous homeowner.In case of transfer/resale, the original share certificate has to be given to the society along with the other documents needed. If the share certificate is being transferred to a new member after resale, they have to finished all paperwork prior to handing the share certificate, including the required transfer of shares procedures.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Being a Malaysian, we were not aware of the term Lock in Period which the landlord stated in the agreement.the above will not assist you. once you enter into a contract it is deemed that you did so with full knowledge of its terms. later on you cannot feign ignoranceeven if there is no penalty clause for vacating the premises during the lock in, a lock in is meant for the protection of the landlordso if the tenant vacates the place before the lock in period, he will have to compensate the landlord for the balance lock in period for which the tenant did not use the premisesso the landlord can very well sue you for thatas regards the deficiencies in the amenities, you were required to bring that to the notice of the landlord. but since you 'adjusted', then now you cannot complain, particularly when you apprehend that the landlord may sue you for breaching the agreement in so far as the lock in period is concernedas you did not object against the deficient amenities, under the law it can be said that you waived your right to objectYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Forced Termination",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Before leaving a job, it is customary to give the employer advance notice of one week or longer. While doing so can maintain cordial relations that may let you ask them for future job references.If they terminate than they have to mention the proper reasons. If employee does not has any fault than company has to mention that it's company's issue not fault of employee. In that case employee is legally can claim much better compensation and company has to give that compensation. If they does not give proper compensation than the employee can complain in labour department or court. If company wrongly mention employee fault in termination letter. Than it also can challenge in labour court. And company has to give much larger compensation. Plus company image also be deminish. There are many such cases, where companies has to give big compensation.So hold your ground strongly. Do not resign if there is no fault from you. Prepare your legal case with a legal advisor. Be ready for fight and gain huge compensation.Ask your HR to provide you a written communication for this. They can just say it but they cannot give you this thing in written.Resignation should be voluntary and not forced. Forced resignation amounts to illegal termination. Since the company is required to follow a lot of legal technicalities as well as pay compensation in case of termination (unless there is any proved misconduct), they ask/ force the employee to resign so that the said employee cannot raise any dispute and/ or demand compensation afterwards.When an employee asks to resign, you can do the following:Refuse to resign and keep working.Ask the employer to communicate in writing expressing their desire of you resigning (which they will never do)Write to the upper management stating that Mr X is forcing you to tender resignationIf you have to tender resignation, write that “As instructed by the management, I have no other alternative but to resign from service w.e.f. …………………………”Do these only if you want to drag the company to the court.Otherwise, negotiate with the company, try to get the best severance amount and leave and look for another opportunity.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If there is a negative clause in the agreement, for example, it’s specified in the agreement that the buyer is required to get the property registered within 3 months, then the limitation period will be extended by that particular period.According to the current legal scenario, an unregistered document that is required to be registered has serious consequences because the party seeking its enforcement won’t be able to depend upon the document for proving its contents. This process might not allow the party to enforce their contract.However, under Section 54, such an unregistered sale deed, although valid under the Registration Act, will not be able to confer the title on the purchaser.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In the good old days, when minors were married their respective parents conducted such ceremonies where both parents signed a 'lagna patrika' agreeing to conduct the wedding of their children at a fixed date. It has no relevance now, bereft of any legal force. Nowadays, boys and girls call off weddings, even after engagements, at their sweet will and pleasure, which has become socially acceptable.

    "answer": "Dear Client,I just know for sure that marriage should not be forced on people. And if it is being forced, then someone should have the guts to take a stand.This involves the personality of the groom and the personalities of his mother and father.It is a matter between two families and at this stage law has nothing to do or interfere. Try to settle the matter amicably.Claim the expenses incurred for engagement ceremony and ask them to return the gifts given at time of engagement.If they have adopted such an attitude even before marriage, just think, what they should not be expected to do when marriage is held. Think about what can happen to the life of the girl after marriage, when you won't be able to break away the relation.Though it has been decided to call off the marriage subsequent to the developments, if at all you still feel that they have to be taught lesson, you may either issue them a legal notice demanding apology as well as compensation for the monetary loss due to the engagement expenses or think of approaching police with criminal complaint. You are the better judge of the situation, think and act wisely on all the issues that may involve due to your such acts.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Contract of service can easily be termed as ' when one person has agreed to employ another person as an employee, and the other person has agreed to the terms of employment and of an employee, then the party have said to be entered in Contract of ServiceIt is a common practice amongst employers in India to have a provision incorporated into the employment contracts that in some fashion restricts the employees from pursuing activities contrary to the business interests of the employer.It is well-settled that a contract which is in restraint of trade cannot be enforced unless it is reasonable as between parties and it is consistent with the interest of the public. These two principles are the sine qua non for a contract which is in restraint of trade.Section 27 of Indian contract Act, 1972 states that, \"Agreement in restraint of trade, void – Every agreement by which any one is restrained from exercising a lawful profession, trade or business of any kind, is to that extent void.In Niranjan Shankar Golikari v. Century Spinning and Manufacturing Company Ltd.,(1967 AIR 1098), the Supreme Court of India considered a case of an employee who hadaccepted the employment offer and signed a contract for a period of five years. The saidcontract contained a stipulation that during the period of employment, the employee shallnot engage in any other business. The Contract also contained a stipulation that during thecontinuation of employment as well as thereafter the employee shall keep confidential, theinformation, instruments and documents of the employer that might come to hisknowledge. In the said case the employee after receiving training and acquiring certainconfidential information, initially remained absent and then tendered resignation, as he hadobtained another employment. The employer did not accept the resignation and tookrecourse against the employee by seeking injunctive relief and damages. The employeechallenged the validity of non-compete and confidentiality clauses, contending that thesame constituted a restraint on trade. Dealing with the said contention, the Supreme Courtheld as under: “The rule now is that restraints whether general or partial may be good ifthey are reasonable. A restraint upon freedom of contract must be shown to be reasonablynecessary for the purpose of freedom of trade. A restraint reasonably necessary for theprotection of the covenantee must prevail unless some specific ground of public policy canbe clearly established against itTherefore you may take proper legal action in case your employer is initiating any legal action on you tendering the resignation.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Contract for overseas assignment",
    "answer": "Contract of service can easily be termed as ' when one person has agreed to employ another person as an employee, and the other person has agreed to the terms of employment and of an employee, then the party have said to be entered in Contract of ServiceIt is a common practice amongst employers in India to have a provision incorporated into the employment contracts that in some fashion restricts the employees from pursuing activities contrary to the business interests of the employer.It is well-settled that a contract which is in restraint of trade cannot be enforced unless it is reasonable as between parties and it is consistent with the interest of the public. These two principles are the sine qua non for a contract which is in restraint of trade.Section 27 of Indian contract Act, 1972 states that, \"Agreement in restraint of trade, void – Every agreement by which any one is restrained from exercising a lawful profession, trade or business of any kind, is to that extent void.In Niranjan Shankar Golikari v. Century Spinning and Manufacturing Company Ltd.,(1967 AIR 1098), the Supreme Court of India considered a case of an employee who hadaccepted the employment offer and signed a contract for a period of five years. The saidcontract contained a stipulation that during the period of employment, the employee shallnot engage in any other business. The Contract also contained a stipulation that during thecontinuation of employment as well as thereafter the employee shall keep confidential, theinformation, instruments and documents of the employer that might come to hisknowledge. In the said case the employee after receiving training and acquiring certainconfidential information, initially remained absent and then tendered resignation, as he hadobtained another employment. The employer did not accept the resignation and tookrecourse against the employee by seeking injunctive relief and damages. The employeechallenged the validity of non-compete and confidentiality clauses, contending that thesame constituted a restraint on trade. Dealing with the said contention, the Supreme Courtheld as under: “The rule now is that restraints whether general or partial may be good ifthey are reasonable. A restraint upon freedom of contract must be shown to be reasonablynecessary for the purpose of freedom of trade. A restraint reasonably necessary for theprotection of the covenantee must prevail unless some specific ground of public policy canbe clearly established against itTherefore you may take proper legal action in case your employer is initiating any legal action on you tendering the resignation.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

And if it is being forced, then someone should have the guts to take a stand.This involves the personality of the groom and the personalities of his mother and father.It is a matter between two families and at this stage law has nothing to do or interfere. Try to settle the matter amicably.Claim the expenses incurred for engagement ceremony and ask them to return the gifts given at time of engagement.If they have adopted such an attitude even before marriage, just think, what they should not be expected to do when marriage is held. Think about what can happen to the life of the girl after marriage, when you won't be able to break away the relation.Though it has been decided to call off the marriage subsequent to the developments, if at all you still feel that they have to be taught lesson, you may either issue them a legal notice demanding apology as well as compensation for the monetary loss due to the engagement expenses or think of approaching police with criminal complaint.

    "answer": "Dear Client,I just know for sure that marriage should not be forced on people. And if it is being forced, then someone should have the guts to take a stand.This involves the personality of the groom and the personalities of his mother and father.It is a matter between two families and at this stage law has nothing to do or interfere. Try to settle the matter amicably.Claim the expenses incurred for engagement ceremony and ask them to return the gifts given at time of engagement.If they have adopted such an attitude even before marriage, just think, what they should not be expected to do when marriage is held. Think about what can happen to the life of the girl after marriage, when you won't be able to break away the relation.Though it has been decided to call off the marriage subsequent to the developments, if at all you still feel that they have to be taught lesson, you may either issue them a legal notice demanding apology as well as compensation for the monetary loss due to the engagement expenses or think of approaching police with criminal complaint.

    "question": "Divorce case - section 125 or 498 and 340",
    "answer": "Mr. Alam, these cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. At times, despite our best efforts, life takes a turn for the worst. We may have wanted different things from life, but life’s got its own plan as well. A bad marriage is something which nobody hopes for, but at times, that’s exactly what we are given and forced to face head on. Marriages are hard. Divorces…even harder. Nobody enters marriage thinking about a divorce in the end. If some are unable to cope with the harsh realities of marriage, the only viable option in front of them is to approach the Court and seek legal separation.Section 125 (4) ofCode of Criminal Procedurestates that no wife shall be entitled to receive an allowance from her husband under this section if she is living in adultery, or if, without any sufficient reason, she refuses to live with her husband, or if they are living separately by mutual consent.Since she is getting stipend of amount 55-64k every month therefore she should not be entitled for maintenance. There are various cases in this regard which can relied on.Husband can reduce maintenance of wife on various ways:In case of wife left the husband on her own.Produce evidence that wife is well of earning.Husband needs to show his liabilities.Negotiation and MediationGrounds on no maintenance to wife are:Wife living in AdulteryWife Living separately without sufficient cause.Professionally qualified wife-Capable of earningSeparated by mutual consentEarning wifePlease understand that the objective of granting interim / permanent maintenance is to ensure that the dependant spouse is not reduced to destitution or vagrancy on account of the failure of the marriage, and not as a punishment to the other spouse. There is no straitjacket formula for fixing the quantum of maintenance to be awarded.The maintenance amount awarded must be reasonable and realistic, and avoid either of the two extremes i.e. maintenance awarded to the wife should neither be so extravagant which becomes oppressive and unbearable for the respondent, nor should it be so meagre that it drives the wife to penury. The sufficiency of the quantum has to be adjudged so that the wife is able to maintain herself with reasonable comfort.Supreme Court in various cases has stated that for determining the quantum of maintenance payable to an applicant, the factors which would weigh with the Court inter alia arethe status of the parties; reasonable needs of the wife and dependant children; whether the applicant is educated and professionally qualified; whether the applicant has any independent source of income; whether the income is sufficient to enable her to maintain the same standard of living as she was accustomed to in her matrimonial home; whether the applicant was employed prior to her marriage; whether she was working during the subsistence of the marriage; etc.the financial capacity of the husband, his actual income, reasonable expenses for his own maintenance, and dependant family members whom he is obliged to maintain under the law, liabilities if any, would be required to be taken into consideration, to arrive at the appropriate quantum of maintenance to be paid. The Court must have due regard to the standard of living of the husband, as well as the spiralling inflation rates and high costs of living.On termination of the relationship, if the wife is educated and professionally qualified, but had to give up her employment opportunities to look after the needs of the family being the primary caregiver to the minor children, and the elder members of the family, this factor would be required to be given due importance. With advancement of age, it would be difficult for a dependant wife to get an easy entry into the work-force after a break of several years as she would be required to undergo fresh training to acquire marketable skills and re-train herself to secure a job.In case where the wife is working, it cannot operate as a bar from being awarded maintenance by the husband. The onus is on the husband to establish with necessary material that there are sufficient grounds to show that he is unable to maintain the family, and discharge his legal obligations for reasons beyond his control. If the husband does not disclose the exact amount of his income, an adverse inference may be drawn by the Court.The living expenses of the child would include expenses for food, clothing, residence, medical expenses, education of children. Extra coaching classes or any other vocational training courses to complement the basic education must be factored in, while awarding child support. Albeit, it should be a reasonable amount to be awarded for extra-curricular/coaching classes, and not an overly extravagant amount which may be claimed.Serious disability or ill health of a spouse, child / children from the marriage / dependant relative who require constant care and recurrent expenditure, would also be a relevant consideration while quantifying maintenanceThe aforesaid factors are however not exhaustive, and the concerned Court may exercise its discretion to consider any other factor/s which may be necessary or of relevance in the facts and circumstances of a case. Detailed discussion is required in such cases.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal Verma,Advocate on Record & Amicus Curiae,Supreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, Delhi418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma"

Society can set aside allotment of car parking slots done by builder.The builder cannot change the boundaries and location of parking place after execution of sale deed in your favour.You may seek a direction from the Civil Court to the builder to retain same parking place for you as stated in the Sale Deed.The terms and conditions contained in that Conveyance Deed will take precedence, hence it is vital to check whether that Conveyance Deed contains such provisions.You have good chances to establish your right on the basis of the allotment letter.In case the Builders Agreement / Construction Agreement (without mentioning about the car parking) has already been registered, a Supplemental Agreement for rectifying the defect may be entered into by and between you and the Promoter / Builder and the same be registered. Even if no registration is required, such a Supplemental Agreement with details will render a permanent solution. This may be in addition to the Allotment Letter, as usual.Parking allotment letter is between you and builder, it dose have legal value.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Selling agricultural land by NRI,  outside of Kapurthalla (Punjab)",
    "answer": "Dear Client,List Of Documents that an NRI requires to sell a property.PassportAn NRI, who want to sell a property in India, should hold a passport; not necessarily an Indian passport. This will serve as the identity proof of the person, involved in the transaction.For an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) and a Person of Indian Origin (PIO), a passport serves the same purpose.PAN CardA number of NRIs do not pay taxes in India, as their income is taxable in the countries they stay. However, experts believe NRIs should apply for a PAN (Permanent Account Number) card here when they intend to buy a property in India, as it will be required to apply for a tax exemption certificate as after the sale of the property. PAN numbers are given out to NRIs with a foreign communication address to select countries.Tax ReturnsIf an NRI has been holding a property for a certain period and earning money from it (by renting it out, etc), the transaction becomes taxable. In that case, tax returns for the whole property-ownership period should also be kept ready.Address ProofAn NRI has to give documents in support of his address in India as well as abroad. This may include a ration card, telephone or electricity bills, life insurance policy statements, etc. Same set of papers are also required as the proof of residence abroad.Sale DeedA key document needed in the process is the sale deed, also a primary proof of ownership. A legal document, sale deed is an agreement executed by an NRI while purchasing an under-construction property in India.Allotment LetterA letter of allotment (from a society, a builder or any relevant authority) bestows the property to the said person who holds it.Documents From The SocietyFor an apartment in a particular society, a letter from the apartment/society is needed for a go-ahead to the sales process. This document states the seller has no outstanding payments to the society. A copy of membership of the society is also important to establish ownership of the property.Approved Building Plan & Occupation CertificateWhile a copy of an approved building plan is necessary for selling a property, an occupation certificate is a proof that the apartment has been occupied and is also given out by the builder or the building society.Encumbrance CertificateAn encumbrance certificate is necessary to assure the buyer that the land or the property has no dues to any legal authority. This is important in the case of a house, an apartment or even land.Apart from these documents, it would also help if an NRI can provide documents of property tax receipts over the years. A guarded buyer may ask for it.In case an NRI is unable to produce any one the above documents, he/she may go for a lawyer certificate that proves the ownership of the property. A lawyer would carry out a title search and produce a report on the property. Though this certificate is also admissible for a sale, an original document is necessary to get a sale done quickly.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It is important to check if the power of attorney holder has entered into any arrangement with any third party.Once a home purchase deal is finalized between a buyer and a seller, a formal process is initiated to conclude it legally. This starts with the buyer paying the seller a small portion of the transaction value, to show his genuine intentions. This payment, in Indian real estate parlance, is commonly known as the ‘token amount’.Since the buyer pays this money to show his genuine interest in the property, this amount is also referred to as the ‘advance deposit’ or ‘earnest deposit’.The interest you earn on an NRO Account is taxable at 30%, deductible at source.If your finances include your income earned in India and you want an account to manage it within India, an NRO Account is an ideal option.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "- The Supreme Court has held that an employee can withdraw his resignation during the notice period and is entitled to consequential benefits from the company if he is not allowed to work.- Further, the resignation can always be withdrawn by the employee before the effective date mentioned in such resignation.- Further, the employer cannot refuse the request for withdrawal of the resignation and to prevent the employee from discharging his/her duties.- Further, the resignation decision is the employee’s decision, and the option is available only to the employee to withdraw it during the notice period.- Hence , your wife cannot be forced to resign by the employer and such acts are against the law.- She can send a legal notice to the said employer for restoring and continuance of the said job .Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Forced Termination",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Before leaving a job, it is customary to give the employer advance notice of one week or longer. While doing so can maintain cordial relations that may let you ask them for future job references.If they terminate than they have to mention the proper reasons. If employee does not has any fault than company has to mention that it's company's issue not fault of employee. In that case employee is legally can claim much better compensation and company has to give that compensation. If they does not give proper compensation than the employee can complain in labour department or court. If company wrongly mention employee fault in termination letter. Than it also can challenge in labour court. And company has to give much larger compensation. Plus company image also be deminish. There are many such cases, where companies has to give big compensation.So hold your ground strongly. Do not resign if there is no fault from you. Prepare your legal case with a legal advisor. Be ready for fight and gain huge compensation.Ask your HR to provide you a written communication for this. They can just say it but they cannot give you this thing in written.Resignation should be voluntary and not forced. Forced resignation amounts to illegal termination. Since the company is required to follow a lot of legal technicalities as well as pay compensation in case of termination (unless there is any proved misconduct), they ask/ force the employee to resign so that the said employee cannot raise any dispute and/ or demand compensation afterwards.When an employee asks to resign, you can do the following:Refuse to resign and keep working.Ask the employer to communicate in writing expressing their desire of you resigning (which they will never do)Write to the upper management stating that Mr X is forcing you to tender resignationIf you have to tender resignation, write that “As instructed by the management, I have no other alternative but to resign from service w.e.f. …………………………”Do these only if you want to drag the company to the court.Otherwise, negotiate with the company, try to get the best severance amount and leave and look for another opportunity.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,I just know for sure that marriage should not be forced on people. And if it is being forced, then someone should have the guts to take a stand.This involves the personality of the groom and the personalities of his mother and father.It is a matter between two families and at this stage law has nothing to do or interfere. Try to settle the matter amicably.Claim the expenses incurred for engagement ceremony and ask them to return the gifts given at time of engagement.If they have adopted such an attitude even before marriage, just think, what they should not be expected to do when marriage is held. Think about what can happen to the life of the girl after marriage, when you won't be able to break away the relation.Though it has been decided to call off the marriage subsequent to the developments, if at all you still feel that they have to be taught lesson, you may either issue them a legal notice demanding apology as well as compensation for the monetary loss due to the engagement expenses or think of approaching police with criminal complaint.

Society can set aside allotment of car parking slots done by builder.The builder cannot change the boundaries and location of parking place after execution of sale deed in your favour.You may seek a direction from the Civil Court to the builder to retain same parking place for you as stated in the Sale Deed.The terms and conditions contained in that Conveyance Deed will take precedence, hence it is vital to check whether that Conveyance Deed contains such provisions.You have good chances to establish your right on the basis of the allotment letter.In case the Builders Agreement / Construction Agreement (without mentioning about the car parking) has already been registered, a Supplemental Agreement for rectifying the defect may be entered into by and between you and the Promoter / Builder and the same be registered. Even if no registration is required, such a Supplemental Agreement with details will render a permanent solution. This may be in addition to the Allotment Letter, as usual.Parking allotment letter is between you and builder, it dose have legal value.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "The engagement ceremony is merely a social function. In the good old days, when minors were married their respective parents conducted such ceremonies where both parents signed a 'lagna patrika' agreeing to conduct the wedding of their children at a fixed date. It has no relevance now, bereft of any legal force. Nowadays, boys and girls call off weddings, even after engagements, at their sweet will and pleasure, which has become socially acceptable.

    "question": "Groom & his Family is Not Interested for marriage after Engagement",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I just know for sure that marriage should not be forced on people. And if it is being forced, then someone should have the guts to take a stand.This involves the personality of the groom and the personalities of his mother and father.It is a matter between two families and at this stage law has nothing to do or interfere. Try to settle the matter amicably.Claim the expenses incurred for engagement ceremony and ask them to return the gifts given at time of engagement.If they have adopted such an attitude even before marriage, just think, what they should not be expected to do when marriage is held. Think about what can happen to the life of the girl after marriage, when you won't be able to break away the relation.Though it has been decided to call off the marriage subsequent to the developments, if at all you still feel that they have to be taught lesson, you may either issue them a legal notice demanding apology as well as compensation for the monetary loss due to the engagement expenses or think of approaching police with criminal complaint. You are the better judge of the situation, think and act wisely on all the issues that may involve due to your such acts.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,List Of Documents that an NRI requires to sell a property.PassportAn NRI, who want to sell a property in India, should hold a passport; not necessarily an Indian passport. This will serve as the identity proof of the person, involved in the transaction.For an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) and a Person of Indian Origin (PIO), a passport serves the same purpose.PAN CardA number of NRIs do not pay taxes in India, as their income is taxable in the countries they stay. However, experts believe NRIs should apply for a PAN (Permanent Account Number) card here when they intend to buy a property in India, as it will be required to apply for a tax exemption certificate as after the sale of the property. PAN numbers are given out to NRIs with a foreign communication address to select countries.Tax ReturnsIf an NRI has been holding a property for a certain period and earning money from it (by renting it out, etc), the transaction becomes taxable. In that case, tax returns for the whole property-ownership period should also be kept ready.Address ProofAn NRI has to give documents in support of his address in India as well as abroad. This may include a ration card, telephone or electricity bills, life insurance policy statements, etc. Same set of papers are also required as the proof of residence abroad.Sale DeedA key document needed in the process is the sale deed, also a primary proof of ownership. A legal document, sale deed is an agreement executed by an NRI while purchasing an under-construction property in India.Allotment LetterA letter of allotment (from a society, a builder or any relevant authority) bestows the property to the said person who holds it.Documents From The SocietyFor an apartment in a particular society, a letter from the apartment/society is needed for a go-ahead to the sales process. This document states the seller has no outstanding payments to the society. A copy of membership of the society is also important to establish ownership of the property.Approved Building Plan & Occupation CertificateWhile a copy of an approved building plan is necessary for selling a property, an occupation certificate is a proof that the apartment has been occupied and is also given out by the builder or the building society.Encumbrance CertificateAn encumbrance certificate is necessary to assure the buyer that the land or the property has no dues to any legal authority. This is important in the case of a house, an apartment or even land.Apart from these documents, it would also help if an NRI can provide documents of property tax receipts over the years. A guarded buyer may ask for it.In case an NRI is unable to produce any one the above documents, he/she may go for a lawyer certificate that proves the ownership of the property. A lawyer would carry out a title search and produce a report on the property. Though this certificate is also admissible for a sale, an original document is necessary to get a sale done quickly.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The chain starting with title deed which validates that the seller is the true owner of the property to sale deed, encumbrance certificate, property tax receipts, among other things.The owner may have given a power of attorney to a third party to deal with the property. It is important to check if the power of attorney holder has entered into any arrangement with any third party.Once a home purchase deal is finalized between a buyer and a seller, a formal process is initiated to conclude it legally. This starts with the buyer paying the seller a small portion of the transaction value, to show his genuine intentions. This payment, in Indian real estate parlance, is commonly known as the ‘token amount’.Since the buyer pays this money to show his genuine interest in the property, this amount is also referred to as the ‘advance deposit’ or ‘earnest deposit’.The interest you earn on an NRO Account is taxable at 30%, deductible at source.If your finances include your income earned in India and you want an account to manage it within India, an NRO Account is an ideal option.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

She can also seek maintenance by filing an application under Section 125 ofCode of Criminal Procedure, 1973. All this she can do without giving divorce. It is not easy for you to divorce her.

    "question": "Forced Termination",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Before leaving a job, it is customary to give the employer advance notice of one week or longer. While doing so can maintain cordial relations that may let you ask them for future job references.If they terminate than they have to mention the proper reasons. If employee does not has any fault than company has to mention that it's company's issue not fault of employee. In that case employee is legally can claim much better compensation and company has to give that compensation. If they does not give proper compensation than the employee can complain in labour department or court. If company wrongly mention employee fault in termination letter. Than it also can challenge in labour court. And company has to give much larger compensation. Plus company image also be deminish. There are many such cases, where companies has to give big compensation.So hold your ground strongly. Do not resign if there is no fault from you. Prepare your legal case with a legal advisor. Be ready for fight and gain huge compensation.Ask your HR to provide you a written communication for this. They can just say it but they cannot give you this thing in written.Resignation should be voluntary and not forced. Forced resignation amounts to illegal termination. Since the company is required to follow a lot of legal technicalities as well as pay compensation in case of termination (unless there is any proved misconduct), they ask/ force the employee to resign so that the said employee cannot raise any dispute and/ or demand compensation afterwards.When an employee asks to resign, you can do the following:Refuse to resign and keep working.Ask the employer to communicate in writing expressing their desire of you resigning (which they will never do)Write to the upper management stating that Mr X is forcing you to tender resignationIf you have to tender resignation, write that “As instructed by the management, I have no other alternative but to resign from service w.e.f. …………………………”Do these only if you want to drag the company to the court.Otherwise, negotiate with the company, try to get the best severance amount and leave and look for another opportunity.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Selling agricultural land by NRI,  outside of Kapurthalla (Punjab)",
    "answer": "Dear Client,List Of Documents that an NRI requires to sell a property.PassportAn NRI, who want to sell a property in India, should hold a passport; not necessarily an Indian passport. This will serve as the identity proof of the person, involved in the transaction.For an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) and a Person of Indian Origin (PIO), a passport serves the same purpose.PAN CardA number of NRIs do not pay taxes in India, as their income is taxable in the countries they stay. However, experts believe NRIs should apply for a PAN (Permanent Account Number) card here when they intend to buy a property in India, as it will be required to apply for a tax exemption certificate as after the sale of the property. PAN numbers are given out to NRIs with a foreign communication address to select countries.Tax ReturnsIf an NRI has been holding a property for a certain period and earning money from it (by renting it out, etc), the transaction becomes taxable. In that case, tax returns for the whole property-ownership period should also be kept ready.Address ProofAn NRI has to give documents in support of his address in India as well as abroad. This may include a ration card, telephone or electricity bills, life insurance policy statements, etc. Same set of papers are also required as the proof of residence abroad.Sale DeedA key document needed in the process is the sale deed, also a primary proof of ownership. A legal document, sale deed is an agreement executed by an NRI while purchasing an under-construction property in India.Allotment LetterA letter of allotment (from a society, a builder or any relevant authority) bestows the property to the said person who holds it.Documents From The SocietyFor an apartment in a particular society, a letter from the apartment/society is needed for a go-ahead to the sales process. This document states the seller has no outstanding payments to the society. A copy of membership of the society is also important to establish ownership of the property.Approved Building Plan & Occupation CertificateWhile a copy of an approved building plan is necessary for selling a property, an occupation certificate is a proof that the apartment has been occupied and is also given out by the builder or the building society.Encumbrance CertificateAn encumbrance certificate is necessary to assure the buyer that the land or the property has no dues to any legal authority. This is important in the case of a house, an apartment or even land.Apart from these documents, it would also help if an NRI can provide documents of property tax receipts over the years. A guarded buyer may ask for it.In case an NRI is unable to produce any one the above documents, he/she may go for a lawyer certificate that proves the ownership of the property. A lawyer would carry out a title search and produce a report on the property. Though this certificate is also admissible for a sale, an original document is necessary to get a sale done quickly.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It is important to check if the power of attorney holder has entered into any arrangement with any third party.Once a home purchase deal is finalized between a buyer and a seller, a formal process is initiated to conclude it legally. This starts with the buyer paying the seller a small portion of the transaction value, to show his genuine intentions. This payment, in Indian real estate parlance, is commonly known as the ‘token amount’.Since the buyer pays this money to show his genuine interest in the property, this amount is also referred to as the ‘advance deposit’ or ‘earnest deposit’.The interest you earn on an NRO Account is taxable at 30%, deductible at source.If your finances include your income earned in India and you want an account to manage it within India, an NRO Account is an ideal option.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Forced Termination",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Before leaving a job, it is customary to give the employer advance notice of one week or longer. While doing so can maintain cordial relations that may let you ask them for future job references.If they terminate than they have to mention the proper reasons. If employee does not has any fault than company has to mention that it's company's issue not fault of employee. In that case employee is legally can claim much better compensation and company has to give that compensation. If they does not give proper compensation than the employee can complain in labour department or court. If company wrongly mention employee fault in termination letter. Than it also can challenge in labour court. And company has to give much larger compensation. Plus company image also be deminish. There are many such cases, where companies has to give big compensation.So hold your ground strongly. Do not resign if there is no fault from you. Prepare your legal case with a legal advisor. Be ready for fight and gain huge compensation.Ask your HR to provide you a written communication for this. They can just say it but they cannot give you this thing in written.Resignation should be voluntary and not forced. Forced resignation amounts to illegal termination. Since the company is required to follow a lot of legal technicalities as well as pay compensation in case of termination (unless there is any proved misconduct), they ask/ force the employee to resign so that the said employee cannot raise any dispute and/ or demand compensation afterwards.When an employee asks to resign, you can do the following:Refuse to resign and keep working.Ask the employer to communicate in writing expressing their desire of you resigning (which they will never do)Write to the upper management stating that Mr X is forcing you to tender resignationIf you have to tender resignation, write that “As instructed by the management, I have no other alternative but to resign from service w.e.f. …………………………”Do these only if you want to drag the company to the court.Otherwise, negotiate with the company, try to get the best severance amount and leave and look for another opportunity.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "US citizen wants to sell property in India via PoA",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In 2011, the Supreme Court ruled that property sale through power of attorney (PoA) is illegal and only registered sale deeds provide any legal holding to property transactions.The concept of POA has been discussed under two laws in India – the Powers of Attorney Act, 1882, and the Indian Stamp Act, 1899. These laws defined POA as an instrument empowering a specified person to act on behalf of the person executing the transaction.Basically, a person gives another person the legal right to present himself as his representative, to perform specific tasks on his behalf.According to the SC, registration of a PoA is mandatory, if it is executed for the sale of a property. Also note that a notarised PoA would be admissible as proof in the court of law.Selling properties where the owner has only right over possession and no right over ownership through PoA is also illegal.To be valid in India, the PoA needs to be attested by the Indian Embassy or any of the Indian consular offices in the U.S. This is possible either by appearing in person or making arrangements through the mail.A power of attorney authorizes its holder to enter into transactions and take decisions on behalf of the actual owner of the property.NRIs would require a special power of attorney to execute a transaction.

    "question": "Forced Termination",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Before leaving a job, it is customary to give the employer advance notice of one week or longer. While doing so can maintain cordial relations that may let you ask them for future job references.If they terminate than they have to mention the proper reasons. If employee does not has any fault than company has to mention that it's company's issue not fault of employee. In that case employee is legally can claim much better compensation and company has to give that compensation. If they does not give proper compensation than the employee can complain in labour department or court. If company wrongly mention employee fault in termination letter. Than it also can challenge in labour court. And company has to give much larger compensation. Plus company image also be deminish. There are many such cases, where companies has to give big compensation.So hold your ground strongly. Do not resign if there is no fault from you. Prepare your legal case with a legal advisor. Be ready for fight and gain huge compensation.Ask your HR to provide you a written communication for this. They can just say it but they cannot give you this thing in written.Resignation should be voluntary and not forced. Forced resignation amounts to illegal termination. Since the company is required to follow a lot of legal technicalities as well as pay compensation in case of termination (unless there is any proved misconduct), they ask/ force the employee to resign so that the said employee cannot raise any dispute and/ or demand compensation afterwards.When an employee asks to resign, you can do the following:Refuse to resign and keep working.Ask the employer to communicate in writing expressing their desire of you resigning (which they will never do)Write to the upper management stating that Mr X is forcing you to tender resignationIf you have to tender resignation, write that “As instructed by the management, I have no other alternative but to resign from service w.e.f. …………………………”Do these only if you want to drag the company to the court.Otherwise, negotiate with the company, try to get the best severance amount and leave and look for another opportunity.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In 2011, the Supreme Court ruled that property sale through power of attorney (PoA) is illegal and only registered sale deeds provide any legal holding to property transactions.The concept of POA has been discussed under two laws in India – the Powers of Attorney Act, 1882, and the Indian Stamp Act, 1899. These laws defined POA as an instrument empowering a specified person to act on behalf of the person executing the transaction.Basically, a person gives another person the legal right to present himself as his representative, to perform specific tasks on his behalf.According to the SC, registration of a PoA is mandatory, if it is executed for the sale of a property. Also note that a notarised PoA would be admissible as proof in the court of law.Selling properties where the owner has only right over possession and no right over ownership through PoA is also illegal.To be valid in India, the PoA needs to be attested by the Indian Embassy or any of the Indian consular offices in the U.S. This is possible either by appearing in person or making arrangements through the mail.A power of attorney authorizes its holder to enter into transactions and take decisions on behalf of the actual owner of the property.NRIs would require a special power of attorney to execute a transaction. Through a general power of attorney, no NRI would be able to sell or purchase property in India.A special power of attorney gives an agent the power to act on behalf of the principal (NRI) for a specific matter, including but not limited to taking legal or financial decisions.To have an effective POA for the purchase of property, an NRI must sign the POA agreement in the presence of a consulate officer or Notary in the country of residence.

    "question": "Divorce case - section 125 or 498 and 340",
    "answer": "Mr. Alam, these cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. At times, despite our best efforts, life takes a turn for the worst. We may have wanted different things from life, but life’s got its own plan as well. A bad marriage is something which nobody hopes for, but at times, that’s exactly what we are given and forced to face head on. Marriages are hard. Divorces…even harder. Nobody enters marriage thinking about a divorce in the end. If some are unable to cope with the harsh realities of marriage, the only viable option in front of them is to approach the Court and seek legal separation.Section 125 (4) ofCode of Criminal Procedurestates that no wife shall be entitled to receive an allowance from her husband under this section if she is living in adultery, or if, without any sufficient reason, she refuses to live with her husband, or if they are living separately by mutual consent.Since she is getting stipend of amount 55-64k every month therefore she should not be entitled for maintenance. There are various cases in this regard which can relied on.Husband can reduce maintenance of wife on various ways:In case of wife left the husband on her own.Produce evidence that wife is well of earning.Husband needs to show his liabilities.Negotiation and MediationGrounds on no maintenance to wife are:Wife living in AdulteryWife Living separately without sufficient cause.Professionally qualified wife-Capable of earningSeparated by mutual consentEarning wifePlease understand that the objective of granting interim / permanent maintenance is to ensure that the dependant spouse is not reduced to destitution or vagrancy on account of the failure of the marriage, and not as a punishment to the other spouse. There is no straitjacket formula for fixing the quantum of maintenance to be awarded.The maintenance amount awarded must be reasonable and realistic, and avoid either of the two extremes i.e. maintenance awarded to the wife should neither be so extravagant which becomes oppressive and unbearable for the respondent, nor should it be so meagre that it drives the wife to penury. The sufficiency of the quantum has to be adjudged so that the wife is able to maintain herself with reasonable comfort.Supreme Court in various cases has stated that for determining the quantum of maintenance payable to an applicant, the factors which would weigh with the Court inter alia arethe status of the parties; reasonable needs of the wife and dependant children; whether the applicant is educated and professionally qualified; whether the applicant has any independent source of income; whether the income is sufficient to enable her to maintain the same standard of living as she was accustomed to in her matrimonial home; whether the applicant was employed prior to her marriage; whether she was working during the subsistence of the marriage; etc.the financial capacity of the husband, his actual income, reasonable expenses for his own maintenance, and dependant family members whom he is obliged to maintain under the law, liabilities if any, would be required to be taken into consideration, to arrive at the appropriate quantum of maintenance to be paid. The Court must have due regard to the standard of living of the husband, as well as the spiralling inflation rates and high costs of living.On termination of the relationship, if the wife is educated and professionally qualified, but had to give up her employment opportunities to look after the needs of the family being the primary caregiver to the minor children, and the elder members of the family, this factor would be required to be given due importance. With advancement of age, it would be difficult for a dependant wife to get an easy entry into the work-force after a break of several years as she would be required to undergo fresh training to acquire marketable skills and re-train herself to secure a job.In case where the wife is working, it cannot operate as a bar from being awarded maintenance by the husband. The onus is on the husband to establish with necessary material that there are sufficient grounds to show that he is unable to maintain the family, and discharge his legal obligations for reasons beyond his control. If the husband does not disclose the exact amount of his income, an adverse inference may be drawn by the Court.The living expenses of the child would include expenses for food, clothing, residence, medical expenses, education of children. Extra coaching classes or any other vocational training courses to complement the basic education must be factored in, while awarding child support. Albeit, it should be a reasonable amount to be awarded for extra-curricular/coaching classes, and not an overly extravagant amount which may be claimed.Serious disability or ill health of a spouse, child / children from the marriage / dependant relative who require constant care and recurrent expenditure, would also be a relevant consideration while quantifying maintenanceThe aforesaid factors are however not exhaustive, and the concerned Court may exercise its discretion to consider any other factor/s which may be necessary or of relevance in the facts and circumstances of a case. Detailed discussion is required in such cases.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal Verma,Advocate on Record & Amicus Curiae,Supreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, Delhi418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma"

    "question": "US citizen wants to sell property in India via PoA",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In 2011, the Supreme Court ruled that property sale through power of attorney (PoA) is illegal and only registered sale deeds provide any legal holding to property transactions.The concept of POA has been discussed under two laws in India – the Powers of Attorney Act, 1882, and the Indian Stamp Act, 1899. These laws defined POA as an instrument empowering a specified person to act on behalf of the person executing the transaction.Basically, a person gives another person the legal right to present himself as his representative, to perform specific tasks on his behalf.According to the SC, registration of a PoA is mandatory, if it is executed for the sale of a property. Also note that a notarised PoA would be admissible as proof in the court of law.Selling properties where the owner has only right over possession and no right over ownership through PoA is also illegal.To be valid in India, the PoA needs to be attested by the Indian Embassy or any of the Indian consular offices in the U.S. This is possible either by appearing in person or making arrangements through the mail.A power of attorney authorizes its holder to enter into transactions and take decisions on behalf of the actual owner of the property.NRIs would require a special power of attorney to execute a transaction. Through a general power of attorney, no NRI would be able to sell or purchase property in India.A special power of attorney gives an agent the power to act on behalf of the principal (NRI) for a specific matter, including but not limited to taking legal or financial decisions.To have an effective POA for the purchase of property, an NRI must sign the POA agreement in the presence of a consulate officer or Notary in the country of residence. Further, such consulate officers must attest to the agreement for it to be valid. The NRI should register the POA under the Indian Registration Act, 1908, to make it valid and enforceable in India.POA can be given to friend or blood relative but the difference is stamp duty.The stamp duty to blood relatives is just Rs. 200The stamp duty to non-blood relatives is 5% of property valueThe difference in stamp duty is huge for blood and non-blood relatives, also blood relatives are considered as trustworthy.Following people comes under blood relative categoryFatherMotherBrotherSisterHusbandWifeChildrenThe stamp duty for above people is just Rs. 200.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "My father-in-law withdraw all the money from my husband account after my husbands death",
    "answer": "Afterthe account holder's death, the nominee can intimate the bank about the same, present the relevant documents (ID proof of the nominee and death certificate of the account holder), withdraw the funds and close the account. However, the nominee is just custodian for the legal heirs and cannot spend the money. Bank is liable to release the amount only after a legal heir certificate/ succession certificate is produced before the bank.If they do so, it amounts to fraud and theft and a criminal complaint can be filed against them for the same. It is illegal to withdraw money using the deceased bank account. It amounts to cheating and fraud. The legal heirs should inform the bank of the death of the deceased soon after the demise of the person.Siddharth JainAdvocate, New Delhi6464 Answers102 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Siddharth Jain"

    "answer": "After death of husband, his wife, parents and kids are as legal heirs are entitled to share his property. After death of son withdrawing money from his accounts without informing the  bank and without consent of other legal heirs like wife is an offence of theft under Section 379. Any legal heir can file a criminal complaint  against the  legal heir who withdrew money from account. Limitation for filing criminal runs from the  date of knowledge of offence. If the  knowledge of withdrawing money by fil accrued to you today, you can file a complaint within three years from date of knowledge. So far as immovable properties of husband are concerned, they cannot be sold without you consent. As you are out of country, they may sell the  properties by manipulation. You can recover such properties even subsequent to sell but that will complicate the  matter. You are advised to issue a public notice in newspapers where the  property is situated warning general public not to purchase properties as you and your son are legal heir to properties. This will prevent them from selling the  properties. Not only you have right, you also have duty to protect the  properties as it belongs to your son. Now they have cheated you and your son, you should directly confront then and file a criminal complaint  under Section 379. You can do everything from abroad by giving GPA to your relative or friend.Ravi ShindeAdvocate, Hyderabad4923 Answers42 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ravi Shinde"

    "context": "Asked 2 years ago in Family Law Religion: Muslim",
    "question": "Divorce case - section 125 or 498 and 340",
    "answer": "Mr. Alam, these cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. At times, despite our best efforts, life takes a turn for the worst. We may have wanted different things from life, but life’s got its own plan as well. A bad marriage is something which nobody hopes for, but at times, that’s exactly what we are given and forced to face head on. Marriages are hard. Divorces…even harder. Nobody enters marriage thinking about a divorce in the end. If some are unable to cope with the harsh realities of marriage, the only viable option in front of them is to approach the Court and seek legal separation.Section 125 (4) ofCode of Criminal Procedurestates that no wife shall be entitled to receive an allowance from her husband under this section if she is living in adultery, or if, without any sufficient reason, she refuses to live with her husband, or if they are living separately by mutual consent.Since she is getting stipend of amount 55-64k every month therefore she should not be entitled for maintenance. There are various cases in this regard which can relied on.Husband can reduce maintenance of wife on various ways:In case of wife left the husband on her own.Produce evidence that wife is well of earning.Husband needs to show his liabilities.Negotiation and MediationGrounds on no maintenance to wife are:Wife living in AdulteryWife Living separately without sufficient cause.Professionally qualified wife-Capable of earningSeparated by mutual consentEarning wifePlease understand that the objective of granting interim / permanent maintenance is to ensure that the dependant spouse is not reduced to destitution or vagrancy on account of the failure of the marriage, and not as a punishment to the other spouse. There is no straitjacket formula for fixing the quantum of maintenance to be awarded.The maintenance amount awarded must be reasonable and realistic, and avoid either of the two extremes i.e. maintenance awarded to the wife should neither be so extravagant which becomes oppressive and unbearable for the respondent, nor should it be so meagre that it drives the wife to penury. The sufficiency of the quantum has to be adjudged so that the wife is able to maintain herself with reasonable comfort.Supreme Court in various cases has stated that for determining the quantum of maintenance payable to an applicant, the factors which would weigh with the Court inter alia arethe status of the parties; reasonable needs of the wife and dependant children; whether the applicant is educated and professionally qualified; whether the applicant has any independent source of income; whether the income is sufficient to enable her to maintain the same standard of living as she was accustomed to in her matrimonial home; whether the applicant was employed prior to her marriage; whether she was working during the subsistence of the marriage; etc.the financial capacity of the husband, his actual income, reasonable expenses for his own maintenance, and dependant family members whom he is obliged to maintain under the law, liabilities if any, would be required to be taken into consideration, to arrive at the appropriate quantum of maintenance to be paid. The Court must have due regard to the standard of living of the husband, as well as the spiralling inflation rates and high costs of living.On termination of the relationship, if the wife is educated and professionally qualified, but had to give up her employment opportunities to look after the needs of the family being the primary caregiver to the minor children, and the elder members of the family, this factor would be required to be given due importance. With advancement of age, it would be difficult for a dependant wife to get an easy entry into the work-force after a break of several years as she would be required to undergo fresh training to acquire marketable skills and re-train herself to secure a job.In case where the wife is working, it cannot operate as a bar from being awarded maintenance by the husband. The onus is on the husband to establish with necessary material that there are sufficient grounds to show that he is unable to maintain the family, and discharge his legal obligations for reasons beyond his control. If the husband does not disclose the exact amount of his income, an adverse inference may be drawn by the Court.The living expenses of the child would include expenses for food, clothing, residence, medical expenses, education of children. Extra coaching classes or any other vocational training courses to complement the basic education must be factored in, while awarding child support. Albeit, it should be a reasonable amount to be awarded for extra-curricular/coaching classes, and not an overly extravagant amount which may be claimed.Serious disability or ill health of a spouse, child / children from the marriage / dependant relative who require constant care and recurrent expenditure, would also be a relevant consideration while quantifying maintenanceThe aforesaid factors are however not exhaustive, and the concerned Court may exercise its discretion to consider any other factor/s which may be necessary or of relevance in the facts and circumstances of a case. Detailed discussion is required in such cases.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal Verma,Advocate on Record & Amicus Curiae,Supreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, Delhi418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma"

    "question": "Selling agricultural land by NRI,  outside of Kapurthalla (Punjab)",
    "answer": "Dear Client,List Of Documents that an NRI requires to sell a property.PassportAn NRI, who want to sell a property in India, should hold a passport; not necessarily an Indian passport. This will serve as the identity proof of the person, involved in the transaction.For an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) and a Person of Indian Origin (PIO), a passport serves the same purpose.PAN CardA number of NRIs do not pay taxes in India, as their income is taxable in the countries they stay. However, experts believe NRIs should apply for a PAN (Permanent Account Number) card here when they intend to buy a property in India, as it will be required to apply for a tax exemption certificate as after the sale of the property. PAN numbers are given out to NRIs with a foreign communication address to select countries.Tax ReturnsIf an NRI has been holding a property for a certain period and earning money from it (by renting it out, etc), the transaction becomes taxable. In that case, tax returns for the whole property-ownership period should also be kept ready.Address ProofAn NRI has to give documents in support of his address in India as well as abroad. This may include a ration card, telephone or electricity bills, life insurance policy statements, etc. Same set of papers are also required as the proof of residence abroad.Sale DeedA key document needed in the process is the sale deed, also a primary proof of ownership. A legal document, sale deed is an agreement executed by an NRI while purchasing an under-construction property in India.Allotment LetterA letter of allotment (from a society, a builder or any relevant authority) bestows the property to the said person who holds it.Documents From The SocietyFor an apartment in a particular society, a letter from the apartment/society is needed for a go-ahead to the sales process. This document states the seller has no outstanding payments to the society. A copy of membership of the society is also important to establish ownership of the property.Approved Building Plan & Occupation CertificateWhile a copy of an approved building plan is necessary for selling a property, an occupation certificate is a proof that the apartment has been occupied and is also given out by the builder or the building society.Encumbrance CertificateAn encumbrance certificate is necessary to assure the buyer that the land or the property has no dues to any legal authority. This is important in the case of a house, an apartment or even land.Apart from these documents, it would also help if an NRI can provide documents of property tax receipts over the years. A guarded buyer may ask for it.In case an NRI is unable to produce any one the above documents, he/she may go for a lawyer certificate that proves the ownership of the property. A lawyer would carry out a title search and produce a report on the property. Though this certificate is also admissible for a sale, an original document is necessary to get a sale done quickly.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The chain starting with title deed which validates that the seller is the true owner of the property to sale deed, encumbrance certificate, property tax receipts, among other things.The owner may have given a power of attorney to a third party to deal with the property. It is important to check if the power of attorney holder has entered into any arrangement with any third party.Once a home purchase deal is finalized between a buyer and a seller, a formal process is initiated to conclude it legally. This starts with the buyer paying the seller a small portion of the transaction value, to show his genuine intentions. This payment, in Indian real estate parlance, is commonly known as the ‘token amount’.Since the buyer pays this money to show his genuine interest in the property, this amount is also referred to as the ‘advance deposit’ or ‘earnest deposit’.The interest you earn on an NRO Account is taxable at 30%, deductible at source.If your finances include your income earned in India and you want an account to manage it within India, an NRO Account is an ideal option.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Two registered wills",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard.In P. Manavala Chetty and Ors. v. P. Ramanujam Chetty and Anr. (1971) a single judge of the Madras High Court on the duty of the court of construction to give intention to the wishes of the testator opined:\"It is the obvious duty of the Court to ascertain and give effect to the true intentions of the testator and also avoid any construction of the will which will defeat or frustrate or bring about a situation which is directly contrary to the intentions of the testator. At the same time, it must be borne in mind that there are obvious limits to this doctrine that the Court should try to ascertain and give effect to the intentions of the testator. The law requires a will to be in writing and it cannot, consistently with this doctrine, permit parol evidence or evidence of collateral circumstances to be adduced to contradict or add to or vary the contents of such a will. No evidence, however powerful it may be, can be given in a Court of construction in order to complete an incomplete will, or project back a valid will, if the terms and conditions of the written will are useless and in-effective to amount to a valid bequest, or to prove any intention or wish of the testator not found in the will. The testator's declarations or evidence of collateral circumstances cannot control the operation of the clear provisions of the will. The provisions of the Indian Succession Act referred to earlier indicate the limits of the Court's power to take note of the testator's declarations and the surroundings circumstances, i.e., evidence of collateral circumstances.\"Section 73 of Indian Succession Act, Sub-section (1) & (2) says:(1) No unprivileged will or codicil, nor any part thereof, which has been revoked in any manner herein before required, & showing an intention to revive the same.(2) When any Will or codicil, which has been partly revoked and afterwards wholly revoked, is revived, such revival shall not extend to so much thereof as has been revoked before the revocation of the whole thereof, unless an intention to the contrary is shown by the Will or codicil.So, the only way in which an unprivileged will or codicil can be revoked have been specified there to be(1) marriage(2) another will or codicil(3) some writing declaring an intention to revoke the same & executed in the manner in which an unprivileged will is required to be executed, or(4) the burning, tearing or otherwise destroying the same by the testator, etc.If the mode adopted by the testatrix is not one of the four modes which are prescribed in Section 70 of Indian Succession Act, the revocation of the unprivileged will or codicil cannot be brought about. Therefore, it is necessary to see the contents of both the wills for concrete opinion.

    "question": "Grandfathers property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,As far as the ancestral property is concerned, you can stake a claim over it by virtue of your birth. For the self acquired properties as well, you being a class I legal heir, have a claim over these. This is, of course, if your father has not willed or gifted the properties to someone else. You can claim the properties by applying for a succession certificate in the civil court or high court that has a jurisdiction over the property or your place of residence. Once the succession certificate is granted by the court, the properties can be transferred in your name.The ancestral property must belong to four generations or we can say that ancestral property must be continued for four generations and passed down from generation to generation.The ancestral property should not be divided by the members and when the division occurs, the property becomes the acquired property.In the case of ancestral property, a person has the rights or interests within the ownership from birth.The ancestral property rights are controlled by per strips and not by each capita. The shares within the ancestral property are first determined for each and every generation and divided for the next generation.Moreover, properties acquired from mother, grandmother, uncle, or even brother are not the ancestor properties. And property inherited by will and gift also is not ancestral property. Ancestor property can become ancestor property whereas if is thrown into the pool of ancestor one and enjoyed in common.Any property gifted by a father to his son cannot become an ancestor within the hands of the son.When it is self acquisition, no body is having right over the same, more so your father gifted the property, either you or anybody don't have any legal rights.If the property gifted is self-acquired by your father, he is entitled to gift it to any one including your mother. In law, a property gifted by a registered deed is on par with a self-acquired property of the recipient (Donee), in your case, it belongs to your mother absolutely.Your mother, as the recipient of the gifted property, is free to do whatever she likes with it. She can bequeth it to any person/s by a Will. If she dies intestate, i.e., without executing a Will, the daughter will have a legitimate claim to a share along with all the brothers and sisters.In case, the property gifted by your father is ancestral, the gift has to be limited to his share in the property. If he has gifted the entire property, it is invalid as the ancestral property is to be shared by the parents and all their children (sons and daughters) equally.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Divorce case - section 125 or 498 and 340",
    "answer": "Mr. Alam, these cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. At times, despite our best efforts, life takes a turn for the worst. We may have wanted different things from life, but life’s got its own plan as well. A bad marriage is something which nobody hopes for, but at times, that’s exactly what we are given and forced to face head on. Marriages are hard. Divorces…even harder. Nobody enters marriage thinking about a divorce in the end. If some are unable to cope with the harsh realities of marriage, the only viable option in front of them is to approach the Court and seek legal separation.Section 125 (4) ofCode of Criminal Procedurestates that no wife shall be entitled to receive an allowance from her husband under this section if she is living in adultery, or if, without any sufficient reason, she refuses to live with her husband, or if they are living separately by mutual consent.Since she is getting stipend of amount 55-64k every month therefore she should not be entitled for maintenance. There are various cases in this regard which can relied on.Husband can reduce maintenance of wife on various ways:In case of wife left the husband on her own.Produce evidence that wife is well of earning.Husband needs to show his liabilities.Negotiation and MediationGrounds on no maintenance to wife are:Wife living in AdulteryWife Living separately without sufficient cause.Professionally qualified wife-Capable of earningSeparated by mutual consentEarning wifePlease understand that the objective of granting interim / permanent maintenance is to ensure that the dependant spouse is not reduced to destitution or vagrancy on account of the failure of the marriage, and not as a punishment to the other spouse. There is no straitjacket formula for fixing the quantum of maintenance to be awarded.The maintenance amount awarded must be reasonable and realistic, and avoid either of the two extremes i.e. maintenance awarded to the wife should neither be so extravagant which becomes oppressive and unbearable for the respondent, nor should it be so meagre that it drives the wife to penury. The sufficiency of the quantum has to be adjudged so that the wife is able to maintain herself with reasonable comfort.Supreme Court in various cases has stated that for determining the quantum of maintenance payable to an applicant, the factors which would weigh with the Court inter alia arethe status of the parties; reasonable needs of the wife and dependant children; whether the applicant is educated and professionally qualified; whether the applicant has any independent source of income; whether the income is sufficient to enable her to maintain the same standard of living as she was accustomed to in her matrimonial home; whether the applicant was employed prior to her marriage; whether she was working during the subsistence of the marriage; etc.the financial capacity of the husband, his actual income, reasonable expenses for his own maintenance, and dependant family members whom he is obliged to maintain under the law, liabilities if any, would be required to be taken into consideration, to arrive at the appropriate quantum of maintenance to be paid. The Court must have due regard to the standard of living of the husband, as well as the spiralling inflation rates and high costs of living.On termination of the relationship, if the wife is educated and professionally qualified, but had to give up her employment opportunities to look after the needs of the family being the primary caregiver to the minor children, and the elder members of the family, this factor would be required to be given due importance. With advancement of age, it would be difficult for a dependant wife to get an easy entry into the work-force after a break of several years as she would be required to undergo fresh training to acquire marketable skills and re-train herself to secure a job.In case where the wife is working, it cannot operate as a bar from being awarded maintenance by the husband. The onus is on the husband to establish with necessary material that there are sufficient grounds to show that he is unable to maintain the family, and discharge his legal obligations for reasons beyond his control. If the husband does not disclose the exact amount of his income, an adverse inference may be drawn by the Court.The living expenses of the child would include expenses for food, clothing, residence, medical expenses, education of children. Extra coaching classes or any other vocational training courses to complement the basic education must be factored in, while awarding child support. Albeit, it should be a reasonable amount to be awarded for extra-curricular/coaching classes, and not an overly extravagant amount which may be claimed.Serious disability or ill health of a spouse, child / children from the marriage / dependant relative who require constant care and recurrent expenditure, would also be a relevant consideration while quantifying maintenanceThe aforesaid factors are however not exhaustive, and the concerned Court may exercise its discretion to consider any other factor/s which may be necessary or of relevance in the facts and circumstances of a case. Detailed discussion is required in such cases.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal Verma,Advocate on Record & Amicus Curiae,Supreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, Delhi418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma"

    "question": "Selling agricultural land by NRI,  outside of Kapurthalla (Punjab)",
    "answer": "Dear Client,List Of Documents that an NRI requires to sell a property.PassportAn NRI, who want to sell a property in India, should hold a passport; not necessarily an Indian passport. This will serve as the identity proof of the person, involved in the transaction.For an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) and a Person of Indian Origin (PIO), a passport serves the same purpose.PAN CardA number of NRIs do not pay taxes in India, as their income is taxable in the countries they stay. However, experts believe NRIs should apply for a PAN (Permanent Account Number) card here when they intend to buy a property in India, as it will be required to apply for a tax exemption certificate as after the sale of the property. PAN numbers are given out to NRIs with a foreign communication address to select countries.Tax ReturnsIf an NRI has been holding a property for a certain period and earning money from it (by renting it out, etc), the transaction becomes taxable. In that case, tax returns for the whole property-ownership period should also be kept ready.Address ProofAn NRI has to give documents in support of his address in India as well as abroad. This may include a ration card, telephone or electricity bills, life insurance policy statements, etc. Same set of papers are also required as the proof of residence abroad.Sale DeedA key document needed in the process is the sale deed, also a primary proof of ownership. A legal document, sale deed is an agreement executed by an NRI while purchasing an under-construction property in India.Allotment LetterA letter of allotment (from a society, a builder or any relevant authority) bestows the property to the said person who holds it.Documents From The SocietyFor an apartment in a particular society, a letter from the apartment/society is needed for a go-ahead to the sales process. This document states the seller has no outstanding payments to the society. A copy of membership of the society is also important to establish ownership of the property.Approved Building Plan & Occupation CertificateWhile a copy of an approved building plan is necessary for selling a property, an occupation certificate is a proof that the apartment has been occupied and is also given out by the builder or the building society.Encumbrance CertificateAn encumbrance certificate is necessary to assure the buyer that the land or the property has no dues to any legal authority. This is important in the case of a house, an apartment or even land.Apart from these documents, it would also help if an NRI can provide documents of property tax receipts over the years. A guarded buyer may ask for it.In case an NRI is unable to produce any one the above documents, he/she may go for a lawyer certificate that proves the ownership of the property. A lawyer would carry out a title search and produce a report on the property. Though this certificate is also admissible for a sale, an original document is necessary to get a sale done quickly.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The chain starting with title deed which validates that the seller is the true owner of the property to sale deed, encumbrance certificate, property tax receipts, among other things.The owner may have given a power of attorney to a third party to deal with the property. It is important to check if the power of attorney holder has entered into any arrangement with any third party.Once a home purchase deal is finalized between a buyer and a seller, a formal process is initiated to conclude it legally. This starts with the buyer paying the seller a small portion of the transaction value, to show his genuine intentions. This payment, in Indian real estate parlance, is commonly known as the ‘token amount’.Since the buyer pays this money to show his genuine interest in the property, this amount is also referred to as the ‘advance deposit’ or ‘earnest deposit’.The interest you earn on an NRO Account is taxable at 30%, deductible at source.If your finances include your income earned in India and you want an account to manage it within India, an NRO Account is an ideal option.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard.In P. Manavala Chetty and Ors. v. P. Ramanujam Chetty and Anr. (1971) a single judge of the Madras High Court on the duty of the court of construction to give intention to the wishes of the testator opined:\"It is the obvious duty of the Court to ascertain and give effect to the true intentions of the testator and also avoid any construction of the will which will defeat or frustrate or bring about a situation which is directly contrary to the intentions of the testator. At the same time, it must be borne in mind that there are obvious limits to this doctrine that the Court should try to ascertain and give effect to the intentions of the testator. The law requires a will to be in writing and it cannot, consistently with this doctrine, permit parol evidence or evidence of collateral circumstances to be adduced to contradict or add to or vary the contents of such a will. No evidence, however powerful it may be, can be given in a Court of construction in order to complete an incomplete will, or project back a valid will, if the terms and conditions of the written will are useless and in-effective to amount to a valid bequest, or to prove any intention or wish of the testator not found in the will. The testator's declarations or evidence of collateral circumstances cannot control the operation of the clear provisions of the will. The provisions of the Indian Succession Act referred to earlier indicate the limits of the Court's power to take note of the testator's declarations and the surroundings circumstances, i.e., evidence of collateral circumstances.\"Section 73 of Indian Succession Act, Sub-section (1) & (2) says:(1) No unprivileged will or codicil, nor any part thereof, which has been revoked in any manner herein before required, & showing an intention to revive the same.(2) When any Will or codicil, which has been partly revoked and afterwards wholly revoked, is revived, such revival shall not extend to so much thereof as has been revoked before the revocation of the whole thereof, unless an intention to the contrary is shown by the Will or codicil.So, the only way in which an unprivileged will or codicil can be revoked have been specified there to be(1) marriage(2) another will or codicil(3) some writing declaring an intention to revoke the same & executed in the manner in which an unprivileged will is required to be executed, or(4) the burning, tearing or otherwise destroying the same by the testator, etc.If the mode adopted by the testatrix is not one of the four modes which are prescribed in Section 70 of Indian Succession Act, the revocation of the unprivileged will or codicil cannot be brought about. Therefore, it is necessary to see the contents of both the wills for concrete opinion.

    "question": "Grandfathers property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,As far as the ancestral property is concerned, you can stake a claim over it by virtue of your birth. For the self acquired properties as well, you being a class I legal heir, have a claim over these. This is, of course, if your father has not willed or gifted the properties to someone else. You can claim the properties by applying for a succession certificate in the civil court or high court that has a jurisdiction over the property or your place of residence. Once the succession certificate is granted by the court, the properties can be transferred in your name.The ancestral property must belong to four generations or we can say that ancestral property must be continued for four generations and passed down from generation to generation.The ancestral property should not be divided by the members and when the division occurs, the property becomes the acquired property.In the case of ancestral property, a person has the rights or interests within the ownership from birth.The ancestral property rights are controlled by per strips and not by each capita. The shares within the ancestral property are first determined for each and every generation and divided for the next generation.Moreover, properties acquired from mother, grandmother, uncle, or even brother are not the ancestor properties. And property inherited by will and gift also is not ancestral property. Ancestor property can become ancestor property whereas if is thrown into the pool of ancestor one and enjoyed in common.Any property gifted by a father to his son cannot become an ancestor within the hands of the son.When it is self acquisition, no body is having right over the same, more so your father gifted the property, either you or anybody don't have any legal rights.If the property gifted is self-acquired by your father, he is entitled to gift it to any one including your mother. In law, a property gifted by a registered deed is on par with a self-acquired property of the recipient (Donee), in your case, it belongs to your mother absolutely.Your mother, as the recipient of the gifted property, is free to do whatever she likes with it. She can bequeth it to any person/s by a Will. If she dies intestate, i.e., without executing a Will, the daughter will have a legitimate claim to a share along with all the brothers and sisters.In case, the property gifted by your father is ancestral, the gift has to be limited to his share in the property. If he has gifted the entire property, it is invalid as the ancestral property is to be shared by the parents and all their children (sons and daughters) equally.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Such a POA is not required to be stamped at the time of execution. However, it needs to be stamped within three months from the date of receipt of the POA in India. Stamp duty would be payable according to Section 2(17) read with Schedule-I of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, when the deed is presented for registration in India.Apostallization: The deed of POA executed outside India are proven through an apostallization process which is governed by the Hague Convention, 1961. Also known as super legalization, apostille is a certificate which confirms and verifies the signature/seal of the person who authenticated the document. However, this deed, too, needs to comply with Indian laws such as the Indian Registration Act, 1908, and the Power of Attorney Act, 1882.

Proper transfer of title and ownership cannot take place, if the sale is done through a POA and not by means of a sale deed.The POA only can be registered in Karnataka for which the necessary stamp duty and the registrations charges need to be paid.The stamp duty for non-blood relatives is 5% of property value.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Grandfathers property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,As far as the ancestral property is concerned, you can stake a claim over it by virtue of your birth. For the self acquired properties as well, you being a class I legal heir, have a claim over these. This is, of course, if your father has not willed or gifted the properties to someone else. You can claim the properties by applying for a succession certificate in the civil court or high court that has a jurisdiction over the property or your place of residence. Once the succession certificate is granted by the court, the properties can be transferred in your name.The ancestral property must belong to four generations or we can say that ancestral property must be continued for four generations and passed down from generation to generation.The ancestral property should not be divided by the members and when the division occurs, the property becomes the acquired property.In the case of ancestral property, a person has the rights or interests within the ownership from birth.The ancestral property rights are controlled by per strips and not by each capita. The shares within the ancestral property are first determined for each and every generation and divided for the next generation.Moreover, properties acquired from mother, grandmother, uncle, or even brother are not the ancestor properties. And property inherited by will and gift also is not ancestral property. Ancestor property can become ancestor property whereas if is thrown into the pool of ancestor one and enjoyed in common.Any property gifted by a father to his son cannot become an ancestor within the hands of the son.When it is self acquisition, no body is having right over the same, more so your father gifted the property, either you or anybody don't have any legal rights.If the property gifted is self-acquired by your father, he is entitled to gift it to any one including your mother. In law, a property gifted by a registered deed is on par with a self-acquired property of the recipient (Donee), in your case, it belongs to your mother absolutely.Your mother, as the recipient of the gifted property, is free to do whatever she likes with it. She can bequeth it to any person/s by a Will. If she dies intestate, i.e., without executing a Will, the daughter will have a legitimate claim to a share along with all the brothers and sisters.In case, the property gifted by your father is ancestral, the gift has to be limited to his share in the property. If he has gifted the entire property, it is invalid as the ancestral property is to be shared by the parents and all their children (sons and daughters) equally.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, the nominee is just custodian for the legal heirs and cannot spend the money.

After death of son withdrawing money from his accounts without informing the  bank and without consent of other legal heirs like wife is an offence of theft under Section 379. Any legal heir can file a criminal complaint  against the  legal heir who withdrew money from account. Limitation for filing criminal runs from the  date of knowledge of offence. If the  knowledge of withdrawing money by fil accrued to you today, you can file a complaint within three years from date of knowledge. So far as immovable properties of husband are concerned, they cannot be sold without you consent. As you are out of country, they may sell the  properties by manipulation. You can recover such properties even subsequent to sell but that will complicate the  matter. You are advised to issue a public notice in newspapers where the  property is situated warning general public not to purchase properties as you and your son are legal heir to properties. This will prevent them from selling the  properties. Not only you have right, you also have duty to protect the  properties as it belongs to your son. Now they have cheated you and your son, you should directly confront then and file a criminal complaint  under Section 379.

After death of son withdrawing money from his accounts without informing the  bank and without consent of other legal heirs like wife is an offence of theft under Section 379. Any legal heir can file a criminal complaint  against the  legal heir who withdrew money from account. Limitation for filing criminal runs from the  date of knowledge of offence. If the  knowledge of withdrawing money by fil accrued to you today, you can file a complaint within three years from date of knowledge. So far as immovable properties of husband are concerned, they cannot be sold without you consent. As you are out of country, they may sell the  properties by manipulation. You can recover such properties even subsequent to sell but that will complicate the  matter. You are advised to issue a public notice in newspapers where the  property is situated warning general public not to purchase properties as you and your son are legal heir to properties. This will prevent them from selling the  properties. Not only you have right, you also have duty to protect the  properties as it belongs to your son. Now they have cheated you and your son, you should directly confront then and file a criminal complaint  under Section 379.

    "question": "Grandfathers property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,As far as the ancestral property is concerned, you can stake a claim over it by virtue of your birth. For the self acquired properties as well, you being a class I legal heir, have a claim over these. This is, of course, if your father has not willed or gifted the properties to someone else. You can claim the properties by applying for a succession certificate in the civil court or high court that has a jurisdiction over the property or your place of residence. Once the succession certificate is granted by the court, the properties can be transferred in your name.The ancestral property must belong to four generations or we can say that ancestral property must be continued for four generations and passed down from generation to generation.The ancestral property should not be divided by the members and when the division occurs, the property becomes the acquired property.In the case of ancestral property, a person has the rights or interests within the ownership from birth.The ancestral property rights are controlled by per strips and not by each capita. The shares within the ancestral property are first determined for each and every generation and divided for the next generation.Moreover, properties acquired from mother, grandmother, uncle, or even brother are not the ancestor properties. And property inherited by will and gift also is not ancestral property. Ancestor property can become ancestor property whereas if is thrown into the pool of ancestor one and enjoyed in common.Any property gifted by a father to his son cannot become an ancestor within the hands of the son.When it is self acquisition, no body is having right over the same, more so your father gifted the property, either you or anybody don't have any legal rights.If the property gifted is self-acquired by your father, he is entitled to gift it to any one including your mother. In law, a property gifted by a registered deed is on par with a self-acquired property of the recipient (Donee), in your case, it belongs to your mother absolutely.Your mother, as the recipient of the gifted property, is free to do whatever she likes with it. She can bequeth it to any person/s by a Will. If she dies intestate, i.e., without executing a Will, the daughter will have a legitimate claim to a share along with all the brothers and sisters.In case, the property gifted by your father is ancestral, the gift has to be limited to his share in the property. If he has gifted the entire property, it is invalid as the ancestral property is to be shared by the parents and all their children (sons and daughters) equally.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

There are two ways to execute a POA from abroad:Legalization: In this case, signatures of the notary or judge before whom the POA is executed are required to be authenticated by the duly accredited representative of the Indian Embassy/Consulate. According to Section 3 of the Diplomatic and Consular Officers (Oaths and Fees) Act, 1948, notarizing a deed from an authorized officer of the Indian Consulate/Embassy would be considered a valid notary. Such a POA is not required to be stamped at the time of execution. However, it needs to be stamped within three months from the date of receipt of the POA in India. Stamp duty would be payable according to Section 2(17) read with Schedule-I of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, when the deed is presented for registration in India.Apostallization: The deed of POA executed outside India are proven through an apostallization process which is governed by the Hague Convention, 1961. Also known as super legalization, apostille is a certificate which confirms and verifies the signature/seal of the person who authenticated the document. However, this deed, too, needs to comply with Indian laws such as the Indian Registration Act, 1908, and the Power of Attorney Act, 1882. You also have to pay the stamp duty on this.Besides, selling properties where the owner has only right over possession and no right over ownership through PoA is illegal. Proper transfer of title and ownership cannot take place, if the sale is done through a POA and not by means of a sale deed.The POA only can be registered in Karnataka for which the necessary stamp duty and the registrations charges need to be paid.The stamp duty for non-blood relatives is 5% of property value.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard.In P. Manavala Chetty and Ors. v. P. Ramanujam Chetty and Anr. (1971) a single judge of the Madras High Court on the duty of the court of construction to give intention to the wishes of the testator opined:\"It is the obvious duty of the Court to ascertain and give effect to the true intentions of the testator and also avoid any construction of the will which will defeat or frustrate or bring about a situation which is directly contrary to the intentions of the testator. At the same time, it must be borne in mind that there are obvious limits to this doctrine that the Court should try to ascertain and give effect to the intentions of the testator. The law requires a will to be in writing and it cannot, consistently with this doctrine, permit parol evidence or evidence of collateral circumstances to be adduced to contradict or add to or vary the contents of such a will. No evidence, however powerful it may be, can be given in a Court of construction in order to complete an incomplete will, or project back a valid will, if the terms and conditions of the written will are useless and in-effective to amount to a valid bequest, or to prove any intention or wish of the testator not found in the will. The testator's declarations or evidence of collateral circumstances cannot control the operation of the clear provisions of the will. The provisions of the Indian Succession Act referred to earlier indicate the limits of the Court's power to take note of the testator's declarations and the surroundings circumstances, i.e., evidence of collateral circumstances.\"Section 73 of Indian Succession Act, Sub-section (1) & (2) says:(1) No unprivileged will or codicil, nor any part thereof, which has been revoked in any manner herein before required, & showing an intention to revive the same.(2) When any Will or codicil, which has been partly revoked and afterwards wholly revoked, is revived, such revival shall not extend to so much thereof as has been revoked before the revocation of the whole thereof, unless an intention to the contrary is shown by the Will or codicil.So, the only way in which an unprivileged will or codicil can be revoked have been specified there to be(1) marriage(2) another will or codicil(3) some writing declaring an intention to revoke the same & executed in the manner in which an unprivileged will is required to be executed, or(4) the burning, tearing or otherwise destroying the same by the testator, etc.If the mode adopted by the testatrix is not one of the four modes which are prescribed in Section 70 of Indian Succession Act, the revocation of the unprivileged will or codicil cannot be brought about.

    "answer": "Dear Client,The registration fee is payable at the rate of Rs.10/- per Rs. 1000/- with a minimum of Rs. 100/- and a maximum fee of Rs. 30,000/- on the market value of property or consideration, whichever is higher.If the Principal conferring Power of Attorney is not staying India: At the time of executing Power of Attorney, the Principal signs the Power of Attorney in the presence of the Competent Authority of the country where he is residing which includes Public Notary/ Judicial Court/Judge/ Magistrate/Indian Counsel or Vice Counsel or Representative of Central Government and such Competent Authority gives authentication that the said party has signed before him.If you are settled abroad and won't be able to visit India in the near future, you may execute a POA from the country of your domicile through the Indian Embassy/ Consulate. There are two ways to execute a POA from abroad:Legalization: In this case, signatures of the notary or judge before whom the POA is executed are required to be authenticated by the duly accredited representative of the Indian Embassy/Consulate. According to Section 3 of the Diplomatic and Consular Officers (Oaths and Fees) Act, 1948, notarizing a deed from an authorized officer of the Indian Consulate/Embassy would be considered a valid notary. Such a POA is not required to be stamped at the time of execution. However, it needs to be stamped within three months from the date of receipt of the POA in India. Stamp duty would be payable according to Section 2(17) read with Schedule-I of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, when the deed is presented for registration in India.Apostallization: The deed of POA executed outside India are proven through an apostallization process which is governed by the Hague Convention, 1961. Also known as super legalization, apostille is a certificate which confirms and verifies the signature/seal of the person who authenticated the document. However, this deed, too, needs to comply with Indian laws such as the Indian Registration Act, 1908, and the Power of Attorney Act, 1882. You also have to pay the stamp duty on this.Besides, selling properties where the owner has only right over possession and no right over ownership through PoA is illegal. Proper transfer of title and ownership cannot take place, if the sale is done through a POA and not by means of a sale deed.The POA only can be registered in Karnataka for which the necessary stamp duty and the registrations charges need to be paid.The stamp duty for non-blood relatives is 5% of property value.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Grandfathers property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,As far as the ancestral property is concerned, you can stake a claim over it by virtue of your birth. For the self acquired properties as well, you being a class I legal heir, have a claim over these. This is, of course, if your father has not willed or gifted the properties to someone else. You can claim the properties by applying for a succession certificate in the civil court or high court that has a jurisdiction over the property or your place of residence. Once the succession certificate is granted by the court, the properties can be transferred in your name.The ancestral property must belong to four generations or we can say that ancestral property must be continued for four generations and passed down from generation to generation.The ancestral property should not be divided by the members and when the division occurs, the property becomes the acquired property.In the case of ancestral property, a person has the rights or interests within the ownership from birth.The ancestral property rights are controlled by per strips and not by each capita. The shares within the ancestral property are first determined for each and every generation and divided for the next generation.Moreover, properties acquired from mother, grandmother, uncle, or even brother are not the ancestor properties. And property inherited by will and gift also is not ancestral property. Ancestor property can become ancestor property whereas if is thrown into the pool of ancestor one and enjoyed in common.Any property gifted by a father to his son cannot become an ancestor within the hands of the son.When it is self acquisition, no body is having right over the same, more so your father gifted the property, either you or anybody don't have any legal rights.If the property gifted is self-acquired by your father, he is entitled to gift it to any one including your mother. In law, a property gifted by a registered deed is on par with a self-acquired property of the recipient (Donee), in your case, it belongs to your mother absolutely.Your mother, as the recipient of the gifted property, is free to do whatever she likes with it. She can bequeth it to any person/s by a Will. If she dies intestate, i.e., without executing a Will, the daughter will have a legitimate claim to a share along with all the brothers and sisters.In case, the property gifted by your father is ancestral, the gift has to be limited to his share in the property. If he has gifted the entire property, it is invalid as the ancestral property is to be shared by the parents and all their children (sons and daughters) equally.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "This is a transfer of a property with an unregistered title deed.Hence the POA is just a formality for the builder to transfer the property from the name of the agreement holder to the actual buyer, which can be done even on the basis of a tripartite agreement.Since the authorisation letter to be given to your FIL is in the form of a POA, in my opinion it need not be adjudicated and he can proceed on the basis of a notarised deed too.Therefore there is no necessity to be worried about the stamp duty in this regardT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The registration fee is payable at the rate of Rs.10/- per Rs. 1000/- with a minimum of Rs. 100/- and a maximum fee of Rs. 30,000/- on the market value of property or consideration, whichever is higher.If the Principal conferring Power of Attorney is not staying India: At the time of executing Power of Attorney, the Principal signs the Power of Attorney in the presence of the Competent Authority of the country where he is residing which includes Public Notary/ Judicial Court/Judge/ Magistrate/Indian Counsel or Vice Counsel or Representative of Central Government and such Competent Authority gives authentication that the said party has signed before him.If you are settled abroad and won't be able to visit India in the near future, you may execute a POA from the country of your domicile through the Indian Embassy/ Consulate. There are two ways to execute a POA from abroad:Legalization: In this case, signatures of the notary or judge before whom the POA is executed are required to be authenticated by the duly accredited representative of the Indian Embassy/Consulate. According to Section 3 of the Diplomatic and Consular Officers (Oaths and Fees) Act, 1948, notarizing a deed from an authorized officer of the Indian Consulate/Embassy would be considered a valid notary. Such a POA is not required to be stamped at the time of execution. However, it needs to be stamped within three months from the date of receipt of the POA in India. Stamp duty would be payable according to Section 2(17) read with Schedule-I of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, when the deed is presented for registration in India.Apostallization: The deed of POA executed outside India are proven through an apostallization process which is governed by the Hague Convention, 1961. Also known as super legalization, apostille is a certificate which confirms and verifies the signature/seal of the person who authenticated the document. However, this deed, too, needs to comply with Indian laws such as the Indian Registration Act, 1908, and the Power of Attorney Act, 1882. You also have to pay the stamp duty on this.Besides, selling properties where the owner has only right over possession and no right over ownership through PoA is illegal. Proper transfer of title and ownership cannot take place, if the sale is done through a POA and not by means of a sale deed.The POA only can be registered in Karnataka for which the necessary stamp duty and the registrations charges need to be paid.The stamp duty for non-blood relatives is 5% of property value.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Two registered wills",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard.In P. Manavala Chetty and Ors. v. P. Ramanujam Chetty and Anr. (1971) a single judge of the Madras High Court on the duty of the court of construction to give intention to the wishes of the testator opined:\"It is the obvious duty of the Court to ascertain and give effect to the true intentions of the testator and also avoid any construction of the will which will defeat or frustrate or bring about a situation which is directly contrary to the intentions of the testator. At the same time, it must be borne in mind that there are obvious limits to this doctrine that the Court should try to ascertain and give effect to the intentions of the testator. The law requires a will to be in writing and it cannot, consistently with this doctrine, permit parol evidence or evidence of collateral circumstances to be adduced to contradict or add to or vary the contents of such a will. No evidence, however powerful it may be, can be given in a Court of construction in order to complete an incomplete will, or project back a valid will, if the terms and conditions of the written will are useless and in-effective to amount to a valid bequest, or to prove any intention or wish of the testator not found in the will. The testator's declarations or evidence of collateral circumstances cannot control the operation of the clear provisions of the will. The provisions of the Indian Succession Act referred to earlier indicate the limits of the Court's power to take note of the testator's declarations and the surroundings circumstances, i.e., evidence of collateral circumstances.\"Section 73 of Indian Succession Act, Sub-section (1) & (2) says:(1) No unprivileged will or codicil, nor any part thereof, which has been revoked in any manner herein before required, & showing an intention to revive the same.(2) When any Will or codicil, which has been partly revoked and afterwards wholly revoked, is revived, such revival shall not extend to so much thereof as has been revoked before the revocation of the whole thereof, unless an intention to the contrary is shown by the Will or codicil.So, the only way in which an unprivileged will or codicil can be revoked have been specified there to be(1) marriage(2) another will or codicil(3) some writing declaring an intention to revoke the same & executed in the manner in which an unprivileged will is required to be executed, or(4) the burning, tearing or otherwise destroying the same by the testator, etc.If the mode adopted by the testatrix is not one of the four modes which are prescribed in Section 70 of Indian Succession Act, the revocation of the unprivileged will or codicil cannot be brought about. Therefore, it is necessary to see the contents of both the wills for concrete opinion. Intention of words needs to be looked into.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal Verma,Advocate on Record & Amicus Curiae,Supreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, Delhi418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma"

If the property sale deed is on the name of Siva then  Kartik cannot claim rights over entire property for any reason.3. If the lenders file a suit for recovery of loan amount then the legal heirs who may inherit the property of the deceased borrower are liable to repay the loan amount in proportion to their inheritance of the property of the deceased.4. It depends on what case filed against him and what documentary evidences that he relies upon.In any case in the given situation,  his defense appears to be slightly weak.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Under the Partition Act, in case of a suit for partition, if it appears to the Court that the partition of the property cannot reasonably happen or sale of the property is more beneficial, then the Court may, on the request of the shareholders interested, direct the sale of the property and distribution of proceeds.The Act provides that any other shareholder may ask for leave to buy the shares of the parties and the Court may thereafter, offer a valuation and shall sell the property to the applicant.The Act contains detailed provisions as to what will happen when there is a disagreement between two shareholders.The provisions of the Act also deal with the rights of the member of the family to purchase the share of the stranger ‘suing’ for partition.Section 9 of the Act gives power to the Court to distribute the property equally and make the sale of reminder property and to distribute the proceeds.Under the 86th Law Commission report on Partition Act, 1893, various suggestions have been made to amend the Act as there are gaps in the Act but the amendment is yet to be made.Any limitations in the partition suit follow guidelines from the Limitation Act. According to the Limitation Act, in the case of a suit for partition, the limitation is fixed at 12 years from the day the plaintiff claims the property. The partition suit limitation for ancestral properties is also fixed at 12 years.Before filing a partition suit, a legal notice must be served to all the co-owners specifying their interest in the property, their share, and the action to be taken and try to settle the dispute. Even after this, if the dispute is not settled, then a civil suit is filed before the Court.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

There are two ways to execute a POA from abroad:Legalization: In this case, signatures of the notary or judge before whom the POA is executed are required to be authenticated by the duly accredited representative of the Indian Embassy/Consulate. According to Section 3 of the Diplomatic and Consular Officers (Oaths and Fees) Act, 1948, notarizing a deed from an authorized officer of the Indian Consulate/Embassy would be considered a valid notary. Such a POA is not required to be stamped at the time of execution. However, it needs to be stamped within three months from the date of receipt of the POA in India. Stamp duty would be payable according to Section 2(17) read with Schedule-I of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, when the deed is presented for registration in India.Apostallization: The deed of POA executed outside India are proven through an apostallization process which is governed by the Hague Convention, 1961. Also known as super legalization, apostille is a certificate which confirms and verifies the signature/seal of the person who authenticated the document. However, this deed, too, needs to comply with Indian laws such as the Indian Registration Act, 1908, and the Power of Attorney Act, 1882. You also have to pay the stamp duty on this.Besides, selling properties where the owner has only right over possession and no right over ownership through PoA is illegal. Proper transfer of title and ownership cannot take place, if the sale is done through a POA and not by means of a sale deed.The POA only can be registered in Karnataka for which the necessary stamp duty and the registrations charges need to be paid.The stamp duty for non-blood relatives is 5% of property value.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Ramanujam Chetty and Anr. (1971) a single judge of the Madras High Court on the duty of the court of construction to give intention to the wishes of the testator opined:\"It is the obvious duty of the Court to ascertain and give effect to the true intentions of the testator and also avoid any construction of the will which will defeat or frustrate or bring about a situation which is directly contrary to the intentions of the testator. At the same time, it must be borne in mind that there are obvious limits to this doctrine that the Court should try to ascertain and give effect to the intentions of the testator. The law requires a will to be in writing and it cannot, consistently with this doctrine, permit parol evidence or evidence of collateral circumstances to be adduced to contradict or add to or vary the contents of such a will. No evidence, however powerful it may be, can be given in a Court of construction in order to complete an incomplete will, or project back a valid will, if the terms and conditions of the written will are useless and in-effective to amount to a valid bequest, or to prove any intention or wish of the testator not found in the will. The testator's declarations or evidence of collateral circumstances cannot control the operation of the clear provisions of the will. The provisions of the Indian Succession Act referred to earlier indicate the limits of the Court's power to take note of the testator's declarations and the surroundings circumstances, i.e., evidence of collateral circumstances.\"Section 73 of Indian Succession Act, Sub-section (1) & (2) says:(1) No unprivileged will or codicil, nor any part thereof, which has been revoked in any manner herein before required, & showing an intention to revive the same.(2) When any Will or codicil, which has been partly revoked and afterwards wholly revoked, is revived, such revival shall not extend to so much thereof as has been revoked before the revocation of the whole thereof, unless an intention to the contrary is shown by the Will or codicil.So, the only way in which an unprivileged will or codicil can be revoked have been specified there to be(1) marriage(2) another will or codicil(3) some writing declaring an intention to revoke the same & executed in the manner in which an unprivileged will is required to be executed, or(4) the burning, tearing or otherwise destroying the same by the testator, etc.If the mode adopted by the testatrix is not one of the four modes which are prescribed in Section 70 of Indian Succession Act, the revocation of the unprivileged will or codicil cannot be brought about. Therefore, it is necessary to see the contents of both the wills for concrete opinion.

    "question": "Applying for MCD. What if wife contests it later?",
    "answer": "It is will be her decision. It is not possible to predict anything about her plans.It is again their decision.There is no preventive vaccine against criminal prosecution. Any agreement/undertaking/guarantee by girl’s family not to file criminal complaint will go against you as the question  will arise why in the first place you need such agreement/undertaking, it will lead to doubt that you are planning some offence against her. Best option is not to give them any excuse to file any cases against you and if your wife is on your side, they cannot do anything. At worst if any false case is  filed, it will not stand in Court.Ravi ShindeAdvocate, Hyderabad4923 Answers42 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ravi Shinde"

    "answer": "1. What she can do after filing MCD cannot be predicted but there's no legal infirmity even if she is filing one as apprehended by you.At that time,  the MCD would be dismissed for non prosecution and the contested case may be taken up by court.2. If they plan to wreak vengeance they may indulge in such activity,  the law cannot prevent them from filing a dowry harassment case on her behalf.3. The MCD case are the substantial evidence in your side to prove that there was no such alleged acts of cruelty committed by you and that you both have decided to dissolve the marriage due to incompatibility and difference of opinion between you both.Besides,  you and your parents can obtain AB and protect yourselves from being arrested in case she or her parents implicate you in the apprehended false case.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Two registered wills",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard.In P. Manavala Chetty and Ors. v. P. Ramanujam Chetty and Anr. (1971) a single judge of the Madras High Court on the duty of the court of construction to give intention to the wishes of the testator opined:\"It is the obvious duty of the Court to ascertain and give effect to the true intentions of the testator and also avoid any construction of the will which will defeat or frustrate or bring about a situation which is directly contrary to the intentions of the testator. At the same time, it must be borne in mind that there are obvious limits to this doctrine that the Court should try to ascertain and give effect to the intentions of the testator. The law requires a will to be in writing and it cannot, consistently with this doctrine, permit parol evidence or evidence of collateral circumstances to be adduced to contradict or add to or vary the contents of such a will. No evidence, however powerful it may be, can be given in a Court of construction in order to complete an incomplete will, or project back a valid will, if the terms and conditions of the written will are useless and in-effective to amount to a valid bequest, or to prove any intention or wish of the testator not found in the will. The testator's declarations or evidence of collateral circumstances cannot control the operation of the clear provisions of the will. The provisions of the Indian Succession Act referred to earlier indicate the limits of the Court's power to take note of the testator's declarations and the surroundings circumstances, i.e., evidence of collateral circumstances.\"Section 73 of Indian Succession Act, Sub-section (1) & (2) says:(1) No unprivileged will or codicil, nor any part thereof, which has been revoked in any manner herein before required, & showing an intention to revive the same.(2) When any Will or codicil, which has been partly revoked and afterwards wholly revoked, is revived, such revival shall not extend to so much thereof as has been revoked before the revocation of the whole thereof, unless an intention to the contrary is shown by the Will or codicil.So, the only way in which an unprivileged will or codicil can be revoked have been specified there to be(1) marriage(2) another will or codicil(3) some writing declaring an intention to revoke the same & executed in the manner in which an unprivileged will is required to be executed, or(4) the burning, tearing or otherwise destroying the same by the testator, etc.If the mode adopted by the testatrix is not one of the four modes which are prescribed in Section 70 of Indian Succession Act, the revocation of the unprivileged will or codicil cannot be brought about. Therefore, it is necessary to see the contents of both the wills for concrete opinion. Intention of words needs to be looked into.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal Verma,Advocate on Record & Amicus Curiae,Supreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, Delhi418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma"

According to the Limitation Act, in the case of a suit for partition, the limitation is fixed at 12 years from the day the plaintiff claims the property. The partition suit limitation for ancestral properties is also fixed at 12 years.Before filing a partition suit, a legal notice must be served to all the co-owners specifying their interest in the property, their share, and the action to be taken and try to settle the dispute. Even after this, if the dispute is not settled, then a civil suit is filed before the Court.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "1. The partition is for the properties left behind by deceased Siva.Meena being one of the legal heirs and successors in interest to succeed to the estates of the deceased who is reported to have died intestate,  is very much entitled to an equal share in the property despite the fact that she received money from her father in the past during his lifetime.2. If the property sale deed is on the name of Siva then  Kartik cannot claim rights over entire property for any reason.3. If the lenders file a suit for recovery of loan amount then the legal heirs who may inherit the property of the deceased borrower are liable to repay the loan amount in proportion to their inheritance of the property of the deceased.4. It depends on what case filed against him and what documentary evidences that he relies upon.In any case in the given situation,  his defense appears to be slightly weak.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Under the Partition Act, in case of a suit for partition, if it appears to the Court that the partition of the property cannot reasonably happen or sale of the property is more beneficial, then the Court may, on the request of the shareholders interested, direct the sale of the property and distribution of proceeds.The Act provides that any other shareholder may ask for leave to buy the shares of the parties and the Court may thereafter, offer a valuation and shall sell the property to the applicant.The Act contains detailed provisions as to what will happen when there is a disagreement between two shareholders.The provisions of the Act also deal with the rights of the member of the family to purchase the share of the stranger ‘suing’ for partition.Section 9 of the Act gives power to the Court to distribute the property equally and make the sale of reminder property and to distribute the proceeds.Under the 86th Law Commission report on Partition Act, 1893, various suggestions have been made to amend the Act as there are gaps in the Act but the amendment is yet to be made.Any limitations in the partition suit follow guidelines from the Limitation Act. According to the Limitation Act, in the case of a suit for partition, the limitation is fixed at 12 years from the day the plaintiff claims the property. The partition suit limitation for ancestral properties is also fixed at 12 years.Before filing a partition suit, a legal notice must be served to all the co-owners specifying their interest in the property, their share, and the action to be taken and try to settle the dispute. Even after this, if the dispute is not settled, then a civil suit is filed before the Court.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

There are two ways to execute a POA from abroad:Legalization: In this case, signatures of the notary or judge before whom the POA is executed are required to be authenticated by the duly accredited representative of the Indian Embassy/Consulate. According to Section 3 of the Diplomatic and Consular Officers (Oaths and Fees) Act, 1948, notarizing a deed from an authorized officer of the Indian Consulate/Embassy would be considered a valid notary. Such a POA is not required to be stamped at the time of execution. However, it needs to be stamped within three months from the date of receipt of the POA in India. Stamp duty would be payable according to Section 2(17) read with Schedule-I of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, when the deed is presented for registration in India.Apostallization: The deed of POA executed outside India are proven through an apostallization process which is governed by the Hague Convention, 1961. Also known as super legalization, apostille is a certificate which confirms and verifies the signature/seal of the person who authenticated the document. However, this deed, too, needs to comply with Indian laws such as the Indian Registration Act, 1908, and the Power of Attorney Act, 1882. You also have to pay the stamp duty on this.Besides, selling properties where the owner has only right over possession and no right over ownership through PoA is illegal. Proper transfer of title and ownership cannot take place, if the sale is done through a POA and not by means of a sale deed.The POA only can be registered in Karnataka for which the necessary stamp duty and the registrations charges need to be paid.The stamp duty for non-blood relatives is 5% of property value.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Two registered wills",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard.In P. Manavala Chetty and Ors. v. P. Ramanujam Chetty and Anr. (1971) a single judge of the Madras High Court on the duty of the court of construction to give intention to the wishes of the testator opined:\"It is the obvious duty of the Court to ascertain and give effect to the true intentions of the testator and also avoid any construction of the will which will defeat or frustrate or bring about a situation which is directly contrary to the intentions of the testator. At the same time, it must be borne in mind that there are obvious limits to this doctrine that the Court should try to ascertain and give effect to the intentions of the testator. The law requires a will to be in writing and it cannot, consistently with this doctrine, permit parol evidence or evidence of collateral circumstances to be adduced to contradict or add to or vary the contents of such a will. No evidence, however powerful it may be, can be given in a Court of construction in order to complete an incomplete will, or project back a valid will, if the terms and conditions of the written will are useless and in-effective to amount to a valid bequest, or to prove any intention or wish of the testator not found in the will. The testator's declarations or evidence of collateral circumstances cannot control the operation of the clear provisions of the will. The provisions of the Indian Succession Act referred to earlier indicate the limits of the Court's power to take note of the testator's declarations and the surroundings circumstances, i.e., evidence of collateral circumstances.\"Section 73 of Indian Succession Act, Sub-section (1) & (2) says:(1) No unprivileged will or codicil, nor any part thereof, which has been revoked in any manner herein before required, & showing an intention to revive the same.(2) When any Will or codicil, which has been partly revoked and afterwards wholly revoked, is revived, such revival shall not extend to so much thereof as has been revoked before the revocation of the whole thereof, unless an intention to the contrary is shown by the Will or codicil.So, the only way in which an unprivileged will or codicil can be revoked have been specified there to be(1) marriage(2) another will or codicil(3) some writing declaring an intention to revoke the same & executed in the manner in which an unprivileged will is required to be executed, or(4) the burning, tearing or otherwise destroying the same by the testator, etc.If the mode adopted by the testatrix is not one of the four modes which are prescribed in Section 70 of Indian Succession Act, the revocation of the unprivileged will or codicil cannot be brought about. Therefore, it is necessary to see the contents of both the wills for concrete opinion.

    "question": "Two registered wills",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard.In P. Manavala Chetty and Ors. v. P. Ramanujam Chetty and Anr. (1971) a single judge of the Madras High Court on the duty of the court of construction to give intention to the wishes of the testator opined:\"It is the obvious duty of the Court to ascertain and give effect to the true intentions of the testator and also avoid any construction of the will which will defeat or frustrate or bring about a situation which is directly contrary to the intentions of the testator. At the same time, it must be borne in mind that there are obvious limits to this doctrine that the Court should try to ascertain and give effect to the intentions of the testator. The law requires a will to be in writing and it cannot, consistently with this doctrine, permit parol evidence or evidence of collateral circumstances to be adduced to contradict or add to or vary the contents of such a will. No evidence, however powerful it may be, can be given in a Court of construction in order to complete an incomplete will, or project back a valid will, if the terms and conditions of the written will are useless and in-effective to amount to a valid bequest, or to prove any intention or wish of the testator not found in the will. The testator's declarations or evidence of collateral circumstances cannot control the operation of the clear provisions of the will. The provisions of the Indian Succession Act referred to earlier indicate the limits of the Court's power to take note of the testator's declarations and the surroundings circumstances, i.e., evidence of collateral circumstances.\"Section 73 of Indian Succession Act, Sub-section (1) & (2) says:(1) No unprivileged will or codicil, nor any part thereof, which has been revoked in any manner herein before required, & showing an intention to revive the same.(2) When any Will or codicil, which has been partly revoked and afterwards wholly revoked, is revived, such revival shall not extend to so much thereof as has been revoked before the revocation of the whole thereof, unless an intention to the contrary is shown by the Will or codicil.So, the only way in which an unprivileged will or codicil can be revoked have been specified there to be(1) marriage(2) another will or codicil(3) some writing declaring an intention to revoke the same & executed in the manner in which an unprivileged will is required to be executed, or(4) the burning, tearing or otherwise destroying the same by the testator, etc.If the mode adopted by the testatrix is not one of the four modes which are prescribed in Section 70 of Indian Succession Act, the revocation of the unprivileged will or codicil cannot be brought about. Therefore, it is necessary to see the contents of both the wills for concrete opinion.

If the CIRP petition of the flat buyers is admitted then a resolution professional will be appointed by the NCLT who will take over the management of the builder company and then devise revival plans for reviving the builder company by calling for proposals from intending builders or other entities who can complete the incomplete project. So all of this will be taken up in the resolution plan to be drawn and to be filed by the intending bidders and the committee of creditors [which will include the flat buyers also] would then have to admit and approve that resolution plan which best serves their interestYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Residential building project not being completed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Primarily, the word ‘delay’ means that a promoter/builder in the sale agreement has agreed to complete the project and give possession of the property within a period but has failed to do so.The RERA has the power to investigate a matter and issue notice on its own motion, as well as imprison the errant promoter.As per Section 31 of RERA, an aggrieved consumer may file a complaint with the Authority or adjudicating officer appointed under the legislation.\"RERA allows a homebuyer a choice of seeking either interest on delayed possession or a complete refund of the money paid along with interest thereon. And, if the builder fails to provide the desired compensation, severe penalties have been prescribed under the Act ranging from imprisonment to registration cancellation\".As per Section 18(1) of RERA, in the events where the promoter delays the possession of a property or fails to complete the project within the agreed time as mentioned in the sale agreement, he shall be liable to return the amount received from the buyer in respect of the apartment/property or plot, along with the due interest. The interest imposed is 10 percent of the amount invested by the buyer. In case of non-compliance, a builder might face imprisonment for a term, which may extend to three years or a fine of up to 10 percent of the estimated cost of the real estate project, or both.If the builder unilaterally changes the possession date of the project, then the buyer has a right to withdraw from the project and claim a refund of the invested amount within 45 days.If the buyer does not withdraw the possession of the apartment/property, he/she retains the right to be compensated for the delay in the form of monthly interest till the date of handover. The monthly interest would be paid at the rates prescribed under the legislation. The interest must be automatically initiated by the builder or the promoter when the delay commences.As per the ruling by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC), buyers can seek a refund from the developer if the possession of the house or a flat is delayed beyond one year. Depending upon the value of the property, buyers can approach NCDRC in the following courts:For properties worth Rs 20 lakh, complaints should be filed with the District CommissionFor properties valued between Rs 20 lakh and Rs 1 crore, grievances should be listed with the State CommissionFor claims of over Rs 1 crore, a homebuyer should approach the National CommissionFor those home buyers whose residential projects have got stuck due to lack of funds with the developer, the announcement made by the government related to the funding of stalled projects has come out as a welcome relief. The Union Cabinet has recently approved the ‘Special Window for Funding Stalled Affordable and Middle-Income Housing Project’, wherein the government will be the Sponsor infusing up to Rs 10,000 crore into the projects.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard.In P. Manavala Chetty and Ors. v. P. Ramanujam Chetty and Anr. (1971) a single judge of the Madras High Court on the duty of the court of construction to give intention to the wishes of the testator opined:\"It is the obvious duty of the Court to ascertain and give effect to the true intentions of the testator and also avoid any construction of the will which will defeat or frustrate or bring about a situation which is directly contrary to the intentions of the testator. At the same time, it must be borne in mind that there are obvious limits to this doctrine that the Court should try to ascertain and give effect to the intentions of the testator. The law requires a will to be in writing and it cannot, consistently with this doctrine, permit parol evidence or evidence of collateral circumstances to be adduced to contradict or add to or vary the contents of such a will. No evidence, however powerful it may be, can be given in a Court of construction in order to complete an incomplete will, or project back a valid will, if the terms and conditions of the written will are useless and in-effective to amount to a valid bequest, or to prove any intention or wish of the testator not found in the will. The testator's declarations or evidence of collateral circumstances cannot control the operation of the clear provisions of the will. The provisions of the Indian Succession Act referred to earlier indicate the limits of the Court's power to take note of the testator's declarations and the surroundings circumstances, i.e., evidence of collateral circumstances.\"Section 73 of Indian Succession Act, Sub-section (1) & (2) says:(1) No unprivileged will or codicil, nor any part thereof, which has been revoked in any manner herein before required, & showing an intention to revive the same.(2) When any Will or codicil, which has been partly revoked and afterwards wholly revoked, is revived, such revival shall not extend to so much thereof as has been revoked before the revocation of the whole thereof, unless an intention to the contrary is shown by the Will or codicil.So, the only way in which an unprivileged will or codicil can be revoked have been specified there to be(1) marriage(2) another will or codicil(3) some writing declaring an intention to revoke the same & executed in the manner in which an unprivileged will is required to be executed, or(4) the burning, tearing or otherwise destroying the same by the testator, etc.If the mode adopted by the testatrix is not one of the four modes which are prescribed in Section 70 of Indian Succession Act, the revocation of the unprivileged will or codicil cannot be brought about. Therefore, it is necessary to see the contents of both the wills for concrete opinion.

You have not mentioned whether the property is self-acquired or ancestral. In case of ancestral property, you have a right to it by virtue of birth and can make a claim over it.

The provisions of the Indian Succession Act referred to earlier indicate the limits of the Court's power to take note of the testator's declarations and the surroundings circumstances, i.e., evidence of collateral circumstances.\"Section 73 of Indian Succession Act, Sub-section (1) & (2) says:(1) No unprivileged will or codicil, nor any part thereof, which has been revoked in any manner herein before required, & showing an intention to revive the same.(2) When any Will or codicil, which has been partly revoked and afterwards wholly revoked, is revived, such revival shall not extend to so much thereof as has been revoked before the revocation of the whole thereof, unless an intention to the contrary is shown by the Will or codicil.So, the only way in which an unprivileged will or codicil can be revoked have been specified there to be(1) marriage(2) another will or codicil(3) some writing declaring an intention to revoke the same & executed in the manner in which an unprivileged will is required to be executed, or(4) the burning, tearing or otherwise destroying the same by the testator, etc.If the mode adopted by the testatrix is not one of the four modes which are prescribed in Section 70 of Indian Succession Act, the revocation of the unprivileged will or codicil cannot be brought about. Therefore, it is necessary to see the contents of both the wills for concrete opinion.

    "question": "Selling or transferring unregistered property in Bangalore",
    "answer": "This is not a registered deed that you have to transfer the property by a sale deed.You have entered into an unregistered sale agreement even though you have obtained loan from the bank.You may take care of the bank loan accordingly and can authorise your father in law to sign the papers on your behalf to cancel the unregistered sale agreement. For this purpose a registered POA deed is not mandatory because the document you would like to cancel i.e., the sale agreement is an unregistered document and it is going to remain with the builder itself.Just because you and your wife may not be present physically to carry out this cancellation task, you can give a notarised power of attorney deed to your father in law authorising him to sign the papers on your behalfT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

In the PoA, you may authorize your FIL to close the bank loan, obtain the documents from the bank and hand them to the buyer on your behalf. The PoA needs to be suitably drafted by a competent lawyer.  The PoA has to be either notarized OR attested by our Embassy/Consulate in the US. Within three months of its arrival in India it needs to be adjudicated (assessed for payment of appropriate stamp duty for the PoA) at Ghaziabad.

    "answer": "Dear Client,The registration fee is payable at the rate of Rs.10/- per Rs. 1000/- with a minimum of Rs. 100/- and a maximum fee of Rs. 30,000/- on the market value of property or consideration, whichever is higher.If the Principal conferring Power of Attorney is not staying India: At the time of executing Power of Attorney, the Principal signs the Power of Attorney in the presence of the Competent Authority of the country where he is residing which includes Public Notary/ Judicial Court/Judge/ Magistrate/Indian Counsel or Vice Counsel or Representative of Central Government and such Competent Authority gives authentication that the said party has signed before him.If you are settled abroad and won't be able to visit India in the near future, you may execute a POA from the country of your domicile through the Indian Embassy/ Consulate. There are two ways to execute a POA from abroad:Legalization: In this case, signatures of the notary or judge before whom the POA is executed are required to be authenticated by the duly accredited representative of the Indian Embassy/Consulate. According to Section 3 of the Diplomatic and Consular Officers (Oaths and Fees) Act, 1948, notarizing a deed from an authorized officer of the Indian Consulate/Embassy would be considered a valid notary. Such a POA is not required to be stamped at the time of execution. However, it needs to be stamped within three months from the date of receipt of the POA in India. Stamp duty would be payable according to Section 2(17) read with Schedule-I of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, when the deed is presented for registration in India.Apostallization: The deed of POA executed outside India are proven through an apostallization process which is governed by the Hague Convention, 1961. Also known as super legalization, apostille is a certificate which confirms and verifies the signature/seal of the person who authenticated the document. However, this deed, too, needs to comply with Indian laws such as the Indian Registration Act, 1908, and the Power of Attorney Act, 1882. You also have to pay the stamp duty on this.Besides, selling properties where the owner has only right over possession and no right over ownership through PoA is illegal. Proper transfer of title and ownership cannot take place, if the sale is done through a POA and not by means of a sale deed.The POA only can be registered in Karnataka for which the necessary stamp duty and the registrations charges need to be paid.The stamp duty for non-blood relatives is 5% of property value.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

An application under Section 125 Cr.P.C. is predicated on two conditions :the husband has sufficient means; and“neglects” to maintain his wife, who is unable to maintain herself.Under the third proviso to the amended Section 125, the application for grant of interim maintenance must be disposed of as far as possible within sixty days’ from the date of service of notice on the respondent.“While there is a tendency on the part of the wife to exaggerate her needs, there is a corresponding tendency by the husband to conceal his actual income.”If men cannot support themselves financially, they can claim maintenance from their wives who are financially well-off and earning more than them.

The error on part of the state government caused a lot of issues to land and property owners.In a relief to landowners, who have been facing hardships due to their lands being listed in the prohibited list, the Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao has directed collectors to enquire into such disputes and take steps to resolve them.The Chief Minister directed the district collectors to complete mutation of lands, which were registered prior to the creation of Dharani portal by accepting applications through Mee- Seva and allotting them slots. He urged them to examine the applications for regularization of Sada Bi Nama and finalize ownership rightsCM said that under no circumstances should tank lands, FTL lands, Wakf lands, forest lands, Endowment lands be registered.You may approach the land revenue department for necessary relief based omn the documentary evidences in your supportT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

If the CIRP petition of the flat buyers is admitted then a resolution professional will be appointed by the NCLT who will take over the management of the builder company and then devise revival plans for reviving the builder company by calling for proposals from intending builders or other entities who can complete the incomplete project. So all of this will be taken up in the resolution plan to be drawn and to be filed by the intending bidders and the committee of creditors [which will include the flat buyers also] would then have to admit and approve that resolution plan which best serves their interestYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Residential building project not being completed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Primarily, the word ‘delay’ means that a promoter/builder in the sale agreement has agreed to complete the project and give possession of the property within a period but has failed to do so.The RERA has the power to investigate a matter and issue notice on its own motion, as well as imprison the errant promoter.As per Section 31 of RERA, an aggrieved consumer may file a complaint with the Authority or adjudicating officer appointed under the legislation.\"RERA allows a homebuyer a choice of seeking either interest on delayed possession or a complete refund of the money paid along with interest thereon. And, if the builder fails to provide the desired compensation, severe penalties have been prescribed under the Act ranging from imprisonment to registration cancellation\".As per Section 18(1) of RERA, in the events where the promoter delays the possession of a property or fails to complete the project within the agreed time as mentioned in the sale agreement, he shall be liable to return the amount received from the buyer in respect of the apartment/property or plot, along with the due interest. The interest imposed is 10 percent of the amount invested by the buyer. In case of non-compliance, a builder might face imprisonment for a term, which may extend to three years or a fine of up to 10 percent of the estimated cost of the real estate project, or both.If the builder unilaterally changes the possession date of the project, then the buyer has a right to withdraw from the project and claim a refund of the invested amount within 45 days.If the buyer does not withdraw the possession of the apartment/property, he/she retains the right to be compensated for the delay in the form of monthly interest till the date of handover. The monthly interest would be paid at the rates prescribed under the legislation. The interest must be automatically initiated by the builder or the promoter when the delay commences.As per the ruling by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC), buyers can seek a refund from the developer if the possession of the house or a flat is delayed beyond one year. Depending upon the value of the property, buyers can approach NCDRC in the following courts:For properties worth Rs 20 lakh, complaints should be filed with the District CommissionFor properties valued between Rs 20 lakh and Rs 1 crore, grievances should be listed with the State CommissionFor claims of over Rs 1 crore, a homebuyer should approach the National CommissionFor those home buyers whose residential projects have got stuck due to lack of funds with the developer, the announcement made by the government related to the funding of stalled projects has come out as a welcome relief. The Union Cabinet has recently approved the ‘Special Window for Funding Stalled Affordable and Middle-Income Housing Project’, wherein the government will be the Sponsor infusing up to Rs 10,000 crore into the projects.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Incorrect link document details mentioned in registered sale deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In case you spot errors in your sale deed or any other property-related document, you should get a rectification deed(or deed of rectification) drafted and registered, to nullify the error.The law does not say anything about the timeline within which an error or a mistake in any document should be corrected. As and when any party involved in the transaction realizes that incorrect information or typing errors are present in the property document, they should bring it to the notice of the other party involved in the transaction and get the mistake corrected, through the creation of a rectification deed.Under Section 26 of the Specific Relief Act,1963, it is provided that when any contract may be rectified:1. When there is a fraud or when there is a mutual mistake by both the parties. Now the person who is entitled for the rectification of instrument are as follows: –Either party or his representative can file.The plaintiff in any suit can file if any rights arising under the rectification of instruments.Defendants can file in any suit as mentioned in sub-clause (B).2. If in any case in which a contract or instrument is to be rectified under clause (1), the court finds that contract is done by fraud or by mutual mistake of the parties, then the court has discretionary power to rectify it.3. If parties claim for rectification and the court thinks fit, then it will be specifically enforced.4. No relief shall be granted until the parties specifically claim for rectification of the instrument.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Regarding partition suit",
    "answer": "1. you have to pay court fee being proportionate to the share which you claim in the joint family properties. because a partition suit is for partition and separate possession. so defendant's objection is legally valid2. if that unregistered deed is not challenged then you can apply to the court for amending your plaint if the trial has not yet commenced in order to meet the defendant's objections3. not necessary because even after the 1970 deed, the parties can acquire properties to be treated as joint family property. however you can make an averment in your plaint that the 1970 deed did not cover all the joint family properties4. you have to seek a declaration that the sale deeds between your brothers and third parties is not binding on you. you will have to pay nominal court fee for seeking such a declaration.5. whether or not you are in possession is immaterial, since in a partition suit you will be asking for partition of the joint family properties by metes and bounds and for separate possession of your share for which you will have to pay the applicable court feeYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Regarding partition suit",
    "answer": "1.a. If it is found that the  requisite court fee was not paid then you may be directed by the court to make good the Deficit court fee.You should understand the difference between court fee and the stamp duty, if court finds you that you are required to pay deficit court fee, you have to either pay it or your suit may be dismissed for the same reason.2. You do not have to answer their such illegal and unlawful questions or allegations because once they accepted that it was an unregistered partition deed, then the said deed becomes invalid in the eyes of law, therefore the partition itself can be held as illegal and invalid. However even if it was a registered partition deed, since you being one of the shareholders, if you are excluded from the partition and allotment of your legitimate share in the property that were partitioned, you can claim your rightful share in the property through court of law.3. You do not have to challenge the recitals mad in the 1970 deed.  The properties subsequently discovered and found to be the family property, then you have full rights to claim your rightful share in them.Do not get misguided by any false or misguiding information in this regard, which may be spread to dissuade your claim in the property.4. You can mention that the sale done by the brothers which include your share in the property hence it is not binding on you therefore you are not required to pay stamp duty on them, however as far as the partition suit is concerned you may have to pay the court fee to the newly added property as per the court fee and suit valuation act of your state.5. The mere mention of constructive possession will take care of all the issues.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Regarding partition suit",
    "answer": "Dear Client,To attain legal validity, a partition deed must be registered with the sub-registrar of the area in which the immovable asset is located. This is mandatory under Section 17 of the Indian registration Act, 1908. This means that the parties involved in the partition, will have to pay stamp duty charges (under the provisions of the Indian stamp Act, 1899) and registration charge, to get the partition deed registered.Partition of any property is subject to the laws of inheritance. This brings into picture inheritance laws governing property division among Hindus, Muslims and Christians. At the time of partition, the share of each member is determined, based on his entitlement under the applicable inheritance laws.In the case of common property the joint tenants or tenants-in-common, all of them are entitled to the said property and are entitled to enjoy the same. If one of them alone holds or occupies the entire property or part of it, his possession cannot be said unlawful. His physical possession is that of an owner of this own interest and also that of an agent as to the other co-owners. Therefore, the possession of one of the co-sharers is the possession of all of them. At the same time, it cannot be said that the person who has been in possession of the property is holding the property not only for himself but also in favour of other co-sharers. A co-sharer who is in possession of the property is also entitled to the enjoyment of the same. The possession of one of them is possession of all in the eye of law unless the person who has been in exclusive possession asserts his title in himself to the exclusion of the other co-sharer which may amount to ouster.Thank You.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"
