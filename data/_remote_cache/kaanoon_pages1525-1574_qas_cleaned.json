    "answer": "1. Assuming that your father died intestate (without executing a WILL), then his property should have devolved equally to his mother ( your paternal grandmother, if alive at the time of your father's death), his wife( your mother) and his children. Assuming that your mother and you are the only legal heirs in the instant case, then each of you are entitled to fifty percent each in your father 'B' s property.2.  Since minor's right was inbuilt in the property, your mother was not legally entitled to sell the property to your uncle.  Your mother should have taken Hon'ble Jurisdictional Court's permission to sell minor's rights over the property.3.  After you had attained majority age of eighteen years, still you had three years time after attaining eighteen years, i.e., till twenty one years you could have challenged the sale deed executed by your mother, as well as you  being minor then your signature ( a minor is barred by entering into contract till he attains eighteen years).4.   Based on the above, file for quashing the sale deed executed by you and your mother and to restore your deceased father' s land to you and your mother by making plea to the jurisdictional Court for condonation of delay.Shashidhar S.

    "question": "Ancestral property sold after father's death",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In India, the Limitation Act sets time limits within which legal actions can be initiated. For property-related disputes, the limitation period can vary. For example, for recovery of possession of immovable property or to enforce any right in the property, the limitation period is typically 12 years from the date the right to sue accrues.However, in cases involving minors, the limitation period might differ. Generally, the clock starts ticking from the date the minor reaches the age of majority (18 years old). So, if you were a minor when this transaction occurred and now, more than 20 years have passed since you turned 18, it might be challenging to bring a legal claim against the property due to the passage of time.Courts often consider various factors and circumstances surrounding a case, including the individual's status as a minor at the time of the disputed transaction, potential fraud, coercion, or lack of understanding of the legal implications. In cases where a significant amount of time has passed, it becomes increasingly challenging to challenge past transactions. However, it will be more viable to judge the circumstances on the basis of evidence.

    "answer": "Dear Client,I'm sorry to hear about the challenges you've faced with your property in WTC Noida. Resolving this situation might require a multi-faceted approach. Gather all your agreements, contracts, and communications related to the property, especially those mentioning assured returns, rental agreements, and the completion of construction. Reach out to Viridian again, preferably in writing (email or formal letter), outlining the issues concisely and referencing the terms of your agreements. Request a clear explanation for the delay in payments and the status of property registration. If there have been consistent delays or refusal to address your concerns, you might consider contacting regulatory authorities related to real estate in Noida. They might have avenues or processes to mediate or resolve such disputes. Explore escalating the matter within Viridian's hierarchy if lower-level communications haven't yielded results. Sometimes, senior management or different departments might have a clearer perspective or more authority to address your concerns. If there is a community or association of property owners within WTC Noida, consider engaging with them. Collective actions or shared concerns might garner more attention and support from the management. Throughout this process, ensure you maintain meticulous records of all communications, agreements, and actions taken. These records will be crucial if legal action becomes necessary.Engaging a lawyer in Noida who is well-versed in the local real estate laws and regulations could be highly beneficial for your case. They would have a better understanding of the region-specific nuances, local practices, and the functioning of the relevant authorities like RERA (Real Estate Regulatory Authority) in Noida. However, considering your location in Chennai, you might also explore the possibility of hiring a lawyer there who specializes in real estate or property law and has experience handling cases across different regions in India. They can collaborate with legal professionals or firms in Noida or even represent you remotely if needed. When searching for a lawyer, ensure they have expertise in real estate matters, experience handling disputes similar to yours, and a good track record of resolving such cases. Additionally, consider their familiarity with the laws and regulations specific to Noida, as this could significantly impact the outcome of your case.You may conduct initial consultations with lawyers in both Noida and Chennai to discuss your situation, understand their approach to handling your case, and assess their expertise in this field. This way, you can make an informed decision about which lawyer would be best suited to represent you in resolving the issues with your property in WTC Noida.

In most places, family law prioritizes the best interests of the child. Courts generally encourage both parents to have meaningful relationships with their children unless there are safety concerns. However, legal options can vary depending on your location and the specific circumstances of your situation. Mediation might help facilitate discussions between you and your wife regarding visitation and custody arrangements. Consider couples' therapy or counseling sessions to work on your marital issues. This could potentially help in finding a middle ground and improving communication.If informal discussions fail, you may need to file for visitation rights through the legal system. Seek a court order for temporary visitation while the divorce or custody proceedings are ongoing.

    "answer": "Dear Client,I'm sorry to hear about the challenges you're facing in your marriage. It sounds like you're dealing with multiple issues, and it's essential to address them carefully and thoughtfully. Firstly, regarding the lack of consummation due to your husband's erectile dysfunction (ED), it's crucial to have open and honest communication with your husband about how this affects both of you. Seeking professional help, such as therapy or counseling, might provide a safe space to discuss these intimate matters and explore potential solutions or compromises. Regarding your husband's insistence on having a child, it's essential to consider various factors, especially considering your age and the potential risks associated with pregnancy at 46. It's commendable that you're cautious about the idea of using a donor egg and considering the implications for yourself. However, surrogacy and fertility treatments are significant decisions that both partners should agree on, especially when using their genetic materials. Concerning your husband's drinking problem and financial instability, these are serious issues that can significantly impact family life and the upbringing of a child. It's important to address these issues before bringing a child into the picture. Encouraging him to seek help for his drinking problem, such as therapy or support groups, might be beneficial.Regarding the legality of surrogacy, if your husband intends to pursue it without meeting the legal requirements outlined by the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, you might have legal grounds to prevent it. The law in India outlines specific conditions and restrictions for surrogacy, and if these conditions are not met, the surrogacy arrangement could be deemed illegal.

    "question": "Ancestral property sold after father's death",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In India, the Limitation Act sets time limits within which legal actions can be initiated. For property-related disputes, the limitation period can vary. For example, for recovery of possession of immovable property or to enforce any right in the property, the limitation period is typically 12 years from the date the right to sue accrues.However, in cases involving minors, the limitation period might differ. Generally, the clock starts ticking from the date the minor reaches the age of majority (18 years old). So, if you were a minor when this transaction occurred and now, more than 20 years have passed since you turned 18, it might be challenging to bring a legal claim against the property due to the passage of time.Courts often consider various factors and circumstances surrounding a case, including the individual's status as a minor at the time of the disputed transaction, potential fraud, coercion, or lack of understanding of the legal implications. In cases where a significant amount of time has passed, it becomes increasingly challenging to challenge past transactions. However, it will be more viable to judge the circumstances on the basis of evidence.

  {
    "context": "Asked 1 year ago in Property Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Do we need to explicitly mention about title transfer in sale deed",
    "answer": "In legal terms, \"title\" generally refers to ownership rights over the property. The statement you provided seems to cover the transfer of all rights, privileges, and interests to the property, which would typically include the title. However, if you want to ensure clarity and completeness in the language of the sale deed, you might consider explicitly mentioning the transfer of title as well. Adding a phrase like \"including full and clear title\" or \"along with the complete title\" after the clause about transferring rights, privileges, and interests can reinforce that the title is indeed being transferred to you as the purchaser. This additional clarification could help avoid any ambiguity or future misunderstandings regarding the transfer of ownership.In Indian real estate law, the absence of the specific word \"title\" in the sale deed doesn't necessarily invalidate the transfer of title from the sellers to the purchaser. The clause you provided is quite comprehensive in stating that the sellers are transferring all rights, privileges, and interests in the property to the purchaser. Courts in India have recognized and upheld the transfer of title even in cases where the word \"title\" itself might not be explicitly mentioned in the sale deed. As long as the language used in the deed clearly demonstrates the intention of transferring ownership, the absence of the word \"title\" might not pose a significant legal issue.If the sale deed has been properly executed, registered, and all legal requirements have been met, the sellers should not be able to sell the property to another purchaser claiming that the title has not been transferred to you. Once a property has been legally sold and the transfer is registered, the title should pass to the new purchaser (you, in this case). However, in rare cases, fraudulent sellers might attempt to resell the same property to multiple buyers or create disputes regarding the title. To prevent such situations, it's crucial to ensure that the sale deed is duly registered with the appropriate authorities, and you have possession of all the legal documents proving your ownership of the property. To safeguard your interests, make sure the sale deed is registered with the Sub-Registrar's office in Bangalore and you have Kept all original documents, including the sale deed and any other relevant papers, safely in your possession.In the context of the missing word \"title\" in the sale deed, rectification may not be mandatory if the deed clearly conveys the transfer of all rights, privileges, and interests in the property. The absence of the word \"title\" itself might not necessarily render the sale deed invalid or incomplete if the language used otherwise effectively conveys the intent to transfer ownership. However, if there's concern about potential ambiguity or if you seek to strengthen the legal clarity of the deed, you might consider a rectification deed. This legal document can be used to clarify or modify the terms of the original sale deed. A rectification deed can explicitly state the transfer of \"title\" to eliminate any ambiguity and ensure the completeness of the document. Nevertheless, as mentioned above, the absence of the specific word \"title\" in the sale deed might not necessarily cause a problem for you if the deed clearly outlines the transfer of all rights, privileges, and interests in the property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "This is a complex situation. Establishing legal heirship often involves documentation and proof of relationships. In your case, although there might not be an adoption document for your father, there are documents like the 10th certificate, ITI certificate, and employment records that incorrectly state his father's name as his uncle's. These discrepancies could complicate matters when establishing legal heirship.Yes, affidavits from your father's living siblings—his brother and sisters—could be crucial in establishing his rightful position as a legal heir. These affidavits should ideally attest to the actual familial relationships and affirm that despite the discrepancies in documentation regarding your father's father's name, your father was indeed the biological son of your grandfather. These affidavits can serve as supporting evidence to rectify any discrepancies in official documents and reinforce the claim for your father's share of the ancestral property. They should detail the family structure, relationships, and any relevant information that supports your father's claim as an heir.However, it's essential to have these affidavits drafted correctly, ensuring they adhere to the legal requirements of your jurisdiction. Consulting with a lawyer to prepare these affidavits and ensure their validity in court or during the legal heirship process would be highly advisable.

Assuming that your mother and you are the only legal heirs in the instant case, then each of you are entitled to fifty percent each in your father 'B' s property.2.  Since minor's right was inbuilt in the property, your mother was not legally entitled to sell the property to your uncle.  Your mother should have taken Hon'ble Jurisdictional Court's permission to sell minor's rights over the property.3.  After you had attained majority age of eighteen years, still you had three years time after attaining eighteen years, i.e., till twenty one years you could have challenged the sale deed executed by your mother, as well as you  being minor then your signature ( a minor is barred by entering into contract till he attains eighteen years).4.   Based on the above, file for quashing the sale deed executed by you and your mother and to restore your deceased father' s land to you and your mother by making plea to the jurisdictional Court for condonation of delay.Shashidhar S.

    "question": "Ancestral property sold after father's death",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In India, the Limitation Act sets time limits within which legal actions can be initiated. For property-related disputes, the limitation period can vary. For example, for recovery of possession of immovable property or to enforce any right in the property, the limitation period is typically 12 years from the date the right to sue accrues.However, in cases involving minors, the limitation period might differ. Generally, the clock starts ticking from the date the minor reaches the age of majority (18 years old). So, if you were a minor when this transaction occurred and now, more than 20 years have passed since you turned 18, it might be challenging to bring a legal claim against the property due to the passage of time.Courts often consider various factors and circumstances surrounding a case, including the individual's status as a minor at the time of the disputed transaction, potential fraud, coercion, or lack of understanding of the legal implications. In cases where a significant amount of time has passed, it becomes increasingly challenging to challenge past transactions. However, it will be more viable to judge the circumstances on the basis of evidence.

    "question": "Gift deed executed",
    "answer": "In this situation, the Managing Committee of the society should take several steps to address the issue and ensure a proper transfer of the flat.1. Verify the Gift Deed: Confirm the authenticity of the gift deed through legal means. Ensure that it is a legally binding document and that the transfer was done appropriately.2. Contact the Lender: Communicate with the lender to verify the claim that the share certificate is with them. Request documentation or confirmation from the lender about the mortgage and the location of the share certificate.3. Request the Son to Provide Necessary Documents: Ask the son to provide any supporting documents related to the mortgage and the whereabouts of the share certificate. This may include correspondence with the lender, loan agreements, or any other relevant paperwork.4. Notice to the Son: Issue a formal notice to the son requesting the production of the share certificate and any other required documents. Clearly state the consequences of non-compliance, such as the inability to complete the transfer.5. Engage Legal Counsel: If the son fails to produce the necessary documents, consider seeking legal advice. Consult with legal counsel to understand the legal options available to the society and the potential consequences for the son's actions.8. Explore Legal Recourse: If all else fails, the society may need to explore legal recourse to enforce the proper transfer of the flat. This could involve taking legal action against the son for non-compliance with the society's rules and regulations.It's important for the Managing Committee to act diligently and in accordance with the society's bylaws and applicable laws.The situation you described, where a flat has been mortgaged without the necessary documentation and the share certificate is not available for the transfer, can have implications for the redevelopment process of the society. The lack of proper documentation and the mortgage without society's consent may have legal and financial implications for the redevelopment process. It's crucial to resolve these issues before moving forward to avoid complications during or after the redevelopment. Redevelopment projects often require clear title and ownership documentation for all units involved. The lack of a proper transfer and unresolved issues related to the flat in question may create complications in establishing clear titles for the redevelopment. Authorities involved in approving redevelopment projects may scrutinize the ownership and legal aspects of each unit. Any discrepancies or unresolved issues may lead to delays or rejection of approvals for the redevelopment project.In summary, it's crucial to address the ownership and legal issues promptly and thoroughly to ensure a smooth and successful redevelopment process. Seeking legal advice specific to the local laws governing real estate and redevelopment can provide valuable insights into the best course of action for the society.If the donor of a property dies, it can have various legal and procedural implications depending on the circumstances, the type of property, and the applicable laws in the jurisdiction.1. Effect on Gifted Property: In many cases, the death of the donor does not automatically nullify a gift. Once a gift is completed, it is generally considered irrevocable. However, the process of transferring ownership might not be finalized, and the property may need to go through probate or other legal procedures.2. Probate Process: If the donor's estate is subject to probate, the gifted property may be included in the probate proceedings. The probate court will oversee the distribution of the deceased person's assets, including the gifted property, according to their will or the laws of intestacy if there is no will.3. Succession Planning: If the donor had a will, the gifted property would typically pass to the designated beneficiary as specified in the will. If the property was jointly owned with rights of survivorship, it might pass directly to the surviving joint owner without going through probate.4. Inheritance Laws: In some cases, the laws of intestacy may come into play if the donor did not have a will or if the will is deemed invalid. In such situations, the property would be distributed to heirs according to the legal order of inheritance defined by the jurisdiction.5. Communication with Relevant Parties: It's important for the relevant parties, such as the recipient of the gift and the executor of the donor's estate, to communicate and coordinate to ensure a smooth transition of ownership.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Do we need to explicitly mention about title transfer in sale deed",
    "answer": "In legal terms, \"title\" generally refers to ownership rights over the property. The statement you provided seems to cover the transfer of all rights, privileges, and interests to the property, which would typically include the title. However, if you want to ensure clarity and completeness in the language of the sale deed, you might consider explicitly mentioning the transfer of title as well. Adding a phrase like \"including full and clear title\" or \"along with the complete title\" after the clause about transferring rights, privileges, and interests can reinforce that the title is indeed being transferred to you as the purchaser. This additional clarification could help avoid any ambiguity or future misunderstandings regarding the transfer of ownership.In Indian real estate law, the absence of the specific word \"title\" in the sale deed doesn't necessarily invalidate the transfer of title from the sellers to the purchaser. The clause you provided is quite comprehensive in stating that the sellers are transferring all rights, privileges, and interests in the property to the purchaser. Courts in India have recognized and upheld the transfer of title even in cases where the word \"title\" itself might not be explicitly mentioned in the sale deed. As long as the language used in the deed clearly demonstrates the intention of transferring ownership, the absence of the word \"title\" might not pose a significant legal issue.If the sale deed has been properly executed, registered, and all legal requirements have been met, the sellers should not be able to sell the property to another purchaser claiming that the title has not been transferred to you. Once a property has been legally sold and the transfer is registered, the title should pass to the new purchaser (you, in this case). However, in rare cases, fraudulent sellers might attempt to resell the same property to multiple buyers or create disputes regarding the title. To prevent such situations, it's crucial to ensure that the sale deed is duly registered with the appropriate authorities, and you have possession of all the legal documents proving your ownership of the property. To safeguard your interests, make sure the sale deed is registered with the Sub-Registrar's office in Bangalore and you have Kept all original documents, including the sale deed and any other relevant papers, safely in your possession.In the context of the missing word \"title\" in the sale deed, rectification may not be mandatory if the deed clearly conveys the transfer of all rights, privileges, and interests in the property. The absence of the word \"title\" itself might not necessarily render the sale deed invalid or incomplete if the language used otherwise effectively conveys the intent to transfer ownership. However, if there's concern about potential ambiguity or if you seek to strengthen the legal clarity of the deed, you might consider a rectification deed. This legal document can be used to clarify or modify the terms of the original sale deed. A rectification deed can explicitly state the transfer of \"title\" to eliminate any ambiguity and ensure the completeness of the document. Nevertheless, as mentioned above, the absence of the specific word \"title\" in the sale deed might not necessarily cause a problem for you if the deed clearly outlines the transfer of all rights, privileges, and interests in the property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

They should detail the family structure, relationships, and any relevant information that supports your father's claim as an heir.However, it's essential to have these affidavits drafted correctly, ensuring they adhere to the legal requirements of your jurisdiction. Consulting with a lawyer to prepare these affidavits and ensure their validity in court or during the legal heirship process would be highly advisable.

The mechanism usually has a set hierarchy and timeline. Bing suggests checking the employer's service rules or HR portal for more details.Conciliation: This involves a neutral third-party facilitating negotiations between the disputing parties to reach a voluntary settlement. The process can be confidential and without prejudice.External ForumsLabour Court: Specializes in industrial relations issues and operates under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. The court can issue various reliefs like reinstatement, compensation, and back wages.Consumer Forum: Functions under theConsumer Protection Act, 2019. It deals with complaints relating to goods or services deficiencies and can grant reliefs like refunds and compensation.Civil Court: Deals with civil matters like contracts and property issues and can grant reliefs like injunctions and specific performance of contracts.Relevant Legal SectionsBing acknowledges the need for a lawyer to provide specific advice but mentions two primary acts that could be of interest:Industrial Disputes Act, 1947: Key sections include:Section 2(k): Defines what constitutes an industrial dispute.Section 2(s): Defines who is considered a workman.Section 33C(2): Allows a workman to recover due money.Consumer Protection Act, 2019: Key sections include:Section 2(7): Defines a consumer.Section 2(11): Defines what constitutes deficiency in goods or services.Section 2(35)and2(47): Define what constitutes a service and what are considered unfair trade practices, respectively.Final RecommendationHowever, before approaching to any particular forum, consultation with a qualified lawyer to choose the appropriate forum and to understand the relevant legal sections based on the specifics of the case.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "a)Which Forum to Approach:1.Internal Grievance Mechanism: As you've mentioned, your first step should be to exhaust your bank's internal grievance mechanism. This typically involves raising the issue with your immediate supervisors, HR, and, if necessary, escalating it to higher levels within the bank.2.Labour Commissioner's Office: If your internal grievance mechanism doesn't yield satisfactory results, you can explore approaching the labor commissioner's office. They can often mediate disputes between employers and employees.3.Consumer Forum: Since your issue involves a rental agreement and potential damages due to negligence, you might consider approaching a consumer forum. They handle disputes related to goods and services, which could include housing agreements.4.Legal Action: If all else fails, you might need to consider taking legal action through the civil court system.b) Relevant Laws and Sections:1.Banking Service Regulations: Familiarize yourself with your bank's internal regulations and guidelines, as well as any specific policies related to employee accommodations and benefits. These might be relevant in demonstrating that the bank has acted in violation of its own rules.c) Case Law:Seeking specific case law to support your case might be challenging without knowing the content of the employment agreement as executed between you and your employer and in the absence of employee accommodations policy of your bank.d)General Advice:1.Document Everything:Keep records of all communications, agreements, denials, and any damages you believe you have suffered.2.Be Prepared to Negotiate: Be open to negotiation and settlement discussions with your bank. Often, disputes can be resolved through negotiation without resorting to legal action.Remember that employment and contractual disputes can be complex, and the specific laws and regulations that apply may be based on the employer agreement as executed between you and your employer. As you have not mentioned anything about your employer agreement it is not easy to give you advice of providing shelter to you under prevailing sections or provisions.Akram KhanAdvocate, Gwalior20 AnswersTalk to Advocate Akram Khan"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In India, in general terms, residential accommodation typically refers to a place used for living or lodging purposes, such as a house, apartment, or other dwelling. In your case, while you've entered into a tripartite agreement for a room in a hotel on a leave and license basis for residential stay/purpose, the categorization of this arrangement as \"residential accommodation\" under Indian laws could be subject to interpretation. The fact that you are using the room for residential purposes aligns with the usual understanding of residential accommodation. However, certain legal intricacies, specific regulations, or local laws might define residential accommodation more narrowly or with additional criteria.Certainly, legal precedents and case laws can often provide clarity on how certain arrangements or situations are interpreted within the legal framework. However, specific case laws related to the classification of hotel rooms as \"residential accommodation\" under Indian law might be less common. In India, courts have addressed various cases related to lease agreements, leave and license agreements, and definitions of residential premises. While there might not be an exact match to your situation, similar cases could offer insights into how courts have interpreted similar arrangements or contractual terms.

    "question": "Gift deed executed",
    "answer": "In this situation, the Managing Committee of the society should take several steps to address the issue and ensure a proper transfer of the flat.1. Verify the Gift Deed: Confirm the authenticity of the gift deed through legal means. Ensure that it is a legally binding document and that the transfer was done appropriately.2. Contact the Lender: Communicate with the lender to verify the claim that the share certificate is with them. Request documentation or confirmation from the lender about the mortgage and the location of the share certificate.3. Request the Son to Provide Necessary Documents: Ask the son to provide any supporting documents related to the mortgage and the whereabouts of the share certificate. This may include correspondence with the lender, loan agreements, or any other relevant paperwork.4. Notice to the Son: Issue a formal notice to the son requesting the production of the share certificate and any other required documents. Clearly state the consequences of non-compliance, such as the inability to complete the transfer.5. Engage Legal Counsel: If the son fails to produce the necessary documents, consider seeking legal advice. Consult with legal counsel to understand the legal options available to the society and the potential consequences for the son's actions.8. Explore Legal Recourse: If all else fails, the society may need to explore legal recourse to enforce the proper transfer of the flat. This could involve taking legal action against the son for non-compliance with the society's rules and regulations.It's important for the Managing Committee to act diligently and in accordance with the society's bylaws and applicable laws.The situation you described, where a flat has been mortgaged without the necessary documentation and the share certificate is not available for the transfer, can have implications for the redevelopment process of the society. The lack of proper documentation and the mortgage without society's consent may have legal and financial implications for the redevelopment process. It's crucial to resolve these issues before moving forward to avoid complications during or after the redevelopment. Redevelopment projects often require clear title and ownership documentation for all units involved. The lack of a proper transfer and unresolved issues related to the flat in question may create complications in establishing clear titles for the redevelopment. Authorities involved in approving redevelopment projects may scrutinize the ownership and legal aspects of each unit. Any discrepancies or unresolved issues may lead to delays or rejection of approvals for the redevelopment project.In summary, it's crucial to address the ownership and legal issues promptly and thoroughly to ensure a smooth and successful redevelopment process. Seeking legal advice specific to the local laws governing real estate and redevelopment can provide valuable insights into the best course of action for the society.If the donor of a property dies, it can have various legal and procedural implications depending on the circumstances, the type of property, and the applicable laws in the jurisdiction.1. Effect on Gifted Property: In many cases, the death of the donor does not automatically nullify a gift. Once a gift is completed, it is generally considered irrevocable. However, the process of transferring ownership might not be finalized, and the property may need to go through probate or other legal procedures.2. Probate Process: If the donor's estate is subject to probate, the gifted property may be included in the probate proceedings. The probate court will oversee the distribution of the deceased person's assets, including the gifted property, according to their will or the laws of intestacy if there is no will.3. Succession Planning: If the donor had a will, the gifted property would typically pass to the designated beneficiary as specified in the will. If the property was jointly owned with rights of survivorship, it might pass directly to the surviving joint owner without going through probate.4. Inheritance Laws: In some cases, the laws of intestacy may come into play if the donor did not have a will or if the will is deemed invalid. In such situations, the property would be distributed to heirs according to the legal order of inheritance defined by the jurisdiction.5. Communication with Relevant Parties: It's important for the relevant parties, such as the recipient of the gift and the executor of the donor's estate, to communicate and coordinate to ensure a smooth transition of ownership.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In case you believe there is a risk of irreparable harm or loss, you may explore the possibility of seeking an injunction from the court. An injunction is a legal order that requires a party to do or refrain from doing a particular action. However, obtaining an injunction typically requires a strong legal case and evidence of imminent harm. While the legal process is ongoing, continue putting pressure on the office bearers and the builder to address the issue. Document any attempts at communication, and consider involving other members of the society to collectively voice concerns. Public pressure can sometimes lead to swifter resolutions.If there are regulatory bodies overseeing cooperative housing societies in Mumbai, consider reaching out to them with your concerns. They may be able to intervene or provide guidance on the matter. Keep yourself informed about the progress of the case.

    "answer": "She would have filed for maintenance in India and got the Ex-parte decree in her favor that’s how she’s claiming that you owe her Rs.20,000,  As this is a quasi-criminal case it is highly unlikely that you’ll be arrested. You can be asked by the court to pay maintenance at worst if you are unable to pay it then it can be recovered from your property, Howeveryou can challenge this decree in court in India and get it set aside on the ground that your wife is living in adultery with her boyfriendas according to  catena of Supreme Court and High Court judgements adulterous wives are not eligible to receive maintenance and it is also a ground for divorce, also you can file civil as well as criminal cases against her for the fraud, cheating and abuse of process of Law in India, and I would advise you to also initiate divorce proceedings against her as soon as you come to India, also if you have doubts that as soon as you get back to India she’ll file false criminal case against you in that case you can apply for anticipatory bail in advance and if you get it from court you will not get arrested in India and you will also be able to pursue your matter and clear yourself from this situation. For further Advice I’ll need more information from you.Also, you should hire some local advocate to check if any case under498A IPChave been file against you and once it is confirmed you’ll be able to visit India freely.Siddharth JainAdvocate, New Delhi6464 Answers102 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Siddharth Jain"

She also filed a false claim for maintenance against you after her visa was rejected. You have filed a case against her for fraud and want to get out of this mess.Some of the possible actions you can take are:File a petition for annulment of marriage in the family court having jurisdiction over your place of marriage or residence in India. You can seek annulment on the grounds of fraud, misrepresentation, and concealment of material facts by your wife.File a counter-claim against your wife’s maintenance petition and challenge her claim on the grounds of fraud, desertion, adultery, and lack of jurisdiction.File a criminal complaint against your wife and her boyfriend for cheating, bigamy, forgery, perjury, and criminal conspiracy under relevant sections of IPC.I hope this information helps you understand your options better.

Custody to Father :Traditionally at Common law, the father was considered the sole guardian of the person and property of the child. However, Custody of Infants Act, 1839, in the UK – enabled the mother to claim custody over minor children, the rights of the father continued to remain supreme. In India, the Guardians and Wards Act was enacted in 1890 by the colonial state, which continued the legacy of Common law, of the supremacy of the paternal right in guardianship and custody of children. Through series of judicial decisions and amendments, the rights of father in India have been diluted. While the older cases under the GWA unequivocally hold that the father can be deprived of his position as the natural guardian only if he is found to be unfit for guardianship, there are many cases where the courts have been making exceptions to this principle. The widespread favoring of mother has been so relentless that in 2004, the Supreme Court noted “We make it clear that we do not subscribe to the general observations and comments made by the High Court in favour of mother as parent to be always a preferable to the father to retain custody of the child. In our considered opinion, such generalisation in favour of the mother should not have been made.”Q. Can father take custody of child after divorce?A.Yes, Father can take custody of child after divorce . As per the laws on Indian child custody,both divorced parents have equal rights over the child even after legal separation. One parent winning custody doesn\\’t mean the other ceases to be the parent and loses all rights over the child.Q. How can a father win custody of child after divorce?A.A father can gain custody of child after divorce in one of two ways:1.If the parents are able to come to an agreement that is going to occur with the children then a father may document this in a set of consent orders or a parenting arrangement so both divorced parents have equal rights to keep custody of child after divorce.2.If the parents are not able to come to an agreement then the matter will go to court and a judge will determine how much time each parent will spend with the child. A father will then need to show that it is in the best interests of the child for the child to spend time with him. Keep in mind that less than 3% of matters end up in court, meaning that there is a good chance it will not be you!Q. Can a couple seek custodial rights based on US laws, if currently they are located in US despite being Indian?A.Yes, in US not in India.Q. Can a stepmother claim a custody of a child in India?A.YesQ. Is mediation the best approach to solving disagreements about child custody?A.Mediation generally is quicker and less painful way to resolve child custody matters.A.YesQ.What happens if a fiancee registersIPC 498aagainst the groom?A.Cannot register. A woman has to be married.Q.Can a person other than husband and her husband’s relative be prosecuted undersection 498aIPC?A.NoQ. Is 498a is baised and wrong step in IPC?A.YesQ.

    "question": "PoA sold government land & extent of legal heir responsibility",
    "answer": "1.  If the properties were sold by your father and had obtained the sale consideration amount himself, then his legal heirs are not obliged to return that amount to the buyer.It becomes the duty and burden of the buyer to produce documentary evidence to prove that the legal heirs of the deceased seller are bound to settle the amount or whatever it is.You can issue a reply notice denying his allegations and inform him that you are not bound by any such obligation since you have not availed any benefit out of the sale of property hence he may look for the solution from the dead person and not from from the irrelevant people even though they are related to him.2. He has no rights over your wife's property, it was purchased by her by a registered sale deed, hence there is no danger to that.3. No criminal liability on you.4. You may obtain anticipatory bail if they have registered FIR, it is a civil matter the police cannot interfere, moreover this property was sold by the owner who is no more alive hence the complaint against his legal heirs is not maintainable, you may go for quash of FIR after that.5. Do not do that mistake. You are no where liable to pay them any money, hence you may refuse to pay any amount.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

You also need to produce your OBC certificate and other documents such as identity proof, address proof, birth certificate, etc.To apply for an OBC-NCL certificate, you can follow these steps:Go to the official website of the state social welfare department or portal where you reside.Click on the link for applying for caste certificate and register yourself with your details.Log in with your credentials and fill in the online application form with the required information and upload the scanned copies of the supporting documents.Submit the application form and pay the fee if applicable.You will receive an acknowledgement slip with a reference number that you can use to track the status of your application.Once your application is verified and approved, you will receive your OBC-NCL certificate either online or offline.You can also apply for an OBC-NCL certificate offline by visiting the nearest tehsil office, SDM office, or revenue office and submitting a written application along with the required documents.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear Client,For an OBC candidate seeking to obtain a Non-Creamy Layer (NCL) certificate, it is important to remember that the NCL status is established by the income and status of the candidate's parents, not by the candidate or their spouse. In cases where both parents have passed away and never held a job, it might be required to provide a \"nil income certificate\" attesting to the fact that the parents never had any income during their lifetime. According to government clarification, the candidate's personal income, such as salary, should not be included in this certificate. Make sure you follow the rules set forth by the local issuing authority and give the parents supporting documentation, such as death certificates.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Cancellation of apartment allotment by builder",
    "answer": "According to the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA), a builder can cancel the allotment of an apartment only in terms of the agreement for sale, and the buyer can approach the Real Estate Regulatory Authority for relief, if they are aggrieved by such cancellation and such cancellation is not in accordance with the terms of the agreement for sale, unilateral and without any sufficient cause. The builder is also bound by law to return the money collected from buyers within 45 days, after deducting the booking amountIn your case, it seems that the builder has violated the terms of the booking form and the sales agreement, which clearly stated the payment plan and the deal structure agreed by both parties. The builder cannot demand 20% of the payment within 21 days of booking, when you have already paid 12.5% as per the mutual agreement. The builder also cannot cancel the allotment without giving you a valid reason and a notice. The builder’s actions seem to be arbitrary and unfair, and may amount to deficiency of service and breach of contract.You have the right to challenge the cancellation of the allotment and seek refund of your money with interest and compensation. You can send a legal notice to the builder, demanding them to honour the agreement and restore your allotment, or to refund your money with interest and compensation. If the builder does not respond or comply, you can file a complaint against them before the Karnataka Real Estate Regulatory Authority (KRERA) under Section 31 of RERA. You can also file a complaint before the consumer forum under theConsumer Protection Act, 2019 for redressal of your grievances.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

Custody to Father :Traditionally at Common law, the father was considered the sole guardian of the person and property of the child. However, Custody of Infants Act, 1839, in the UK – enabled the mother to claim custody over minor children, the rights of the father continued to remain supreme. In India, the Guardians and Wards Act was enacted in 1890 by the colonial state, which continued the legacy of Common law, of the supremacy of the paternal right in guardianship and custody of children. Through series of judicial decisions and amendments, the rights of father in India have been diluted. While the older cases under the GWA unequivocally hold that the father can be deprived of his position as the natural guardian only if he is found to be unfit for guardianship, there are many cases where the courts have been making exceptions to this principle. The widespread favoring of mother has been so relentless that in 2004, the Supreme Court noted “We make it clear that we do not subscribe to the general observations and comments made by the High Court in favour of mother as parent to be always a preferable to the father to retain custody of the child. In our considered opinion, such generalisation in favour of the mother should not have been made.”Q. Can father take custody of child after divorce?A.Yes, Father can take custody of child after divorce . As per the laws on Indian child custody,both divorced parents have equal rights over the child even after legal separation. One parent winning custody doesn\\’t mean the other ceases to be the parent and loses all rights over the child.Q. How can a father win custody of child after divorce?A.A father can gain custody of child after divorce in one of two ways:1.If the parents are able to come to an agreement that is going to occur with the children then a father may document this in a set of consent orders or a parenting arrangement so both divorced parents have equal rights to keep custody of child after divorce.2.If the parents are not able to come to an agreement then the matter will go to court and a judge will determine how much time each parent will spend with the child. A father will then need to show that it is in the best interests of the child for the child to spend time with him. Keep in mind that less than 3% of matters end up in court, meaning that there is a good chance it will not be you!Q. Can a couple seek custodial rights based on US laws, if currently they are located in US despite being Indian?A.Yes, in US not in India.Q. Can a stepmother claim a custody of a child in India?A.YesQ. Is mediation the best approach to solving disagreements about child custody?A.Mediation generally is quicker and less painful way to resolve child custody matters.A.YesQ.What happens if a fiancee registersIPC 498aagainst the groom?A.Cannot register. A woman has to be married.Q.Can a person other than husband and her husband’s relative be prosecuted undersection 498aIPC?A.NoQ. Is 498a is baised and wrong step in IPC?A.YesQ.

You can be asked by the court to pay maintenance at worst if you are unable to pay it then it can be recovered from your property, Howeveryou can challenge this decree in court in India and get it set aside on the ground that your wife is living in adultery with her boyfriendas according to  catena of Supreme Court and High Court judgements adulterous wives are not eligible to receive maintenance and it is also a ground for divorce, also you can file civil as well as criminal cases against her for the fraud, cheating and abuse of process of Law in India, and I would advise you to also initiate divorce proceedings against her as soon as you come to India, also if you have doubts that as soon as you get back to India she’ll file false criminal case against you in that case you can apply for anticipatory bail in advance and if you get it from court you will not get arrested in India and you will also be able to pursue your matter and clear yourself from this situation.

You have filed a case against her for fraud and want to get out of this mess.Some of the possible actions you can take are:File a petition for annulment of marriage in the family court having jurisdiction over your place of marriage or residence in India. You can seek annulment on the grounds of fraud, misrepresentation, and concealment of material facts by your wife.File a counter-claim against your wife’s maintenance petition and challenge her claim on the grounds of fraud, desertion, adultery, and lack of jurisdiction.File a criminal complaint against your wife and her boyfriend for cheating, bigamy, forgery, perjury, and criminal conspiracy under relevant sections of IPC.I hope this information helps you understand your options better. However, this is not a substitute for professional legal advice. You should always consult a lawyer for specific guidance and representation regarding your case. Do you have any other questions about fraudulent marriage or family law?Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

Custody to Father :Traditionally at Common law, the father was considered the sole guardian of the person and property of the child. However, Custody of Infants Act, 1839, in the UK – enabled the mother to claim custody over minor children, the rights of the father continued to remain supreme. In India, the Guardians and Wards Act was enacted in 1890 by the colonial state, which continued the legacy of Common law, of the supremacy of the paternal right in guardianship and custody of children. Through series of judicial decisions and amendments, the rights of father in India have been diluted. While the older cases under the GWA unequivocally hold that the father can be deprived of his position as the natural guardian only if he is found to be unfit for guardianship, there are many cases where the courts have been making exceptions to this principle. The widespread favoring of mother has been so relentless that in 2004, the Supreme Court noted “We make it clear that we do not subscribe to the general observations and comments made by the High Court in favour of mother as parent to be always a preferable to the father to retain custody of the child. In our considered opinion, such generalisation in favour of the mother should not have been made.”Q. Can father take custody of child after divorce?A.Yes, Father can take custody of child after divorce . As per the laws on Indian child custody,both divorced parents have equal rights over the child even after legal separation. One parent winning custody doesn\\’t mean the other ceases to be the parent and loses all rights over the child.Q. How can a father win custody of child after divorce?A.A father can gain custody of child after divorce in one of two ways:1.If the parents are able to come to an agreement that is going to occur with the children then a father may document this in a set of consent orders or a parenting arrangement so both divorced parents have equal rights to keep custody of child after divorce.2.If the parents are not able to come to an agreement then the matter will go to court and a judge will determine how much time each parent will spend with the child. A father will then need to show that it is in the best interests of the child for the child to spend time with him. Keep in mind that less than 3% of matters end up in court, meaning that there is a good chance it will not be you!Q. Can a couple seek custodial rights based on US laws, if currently they are located in US despite being Indian?A.Yes, in US not in India.Q. Can a stepmother claim a custody of a child in India?A.YesQ. Is mediation the best approach to solving disagreements about child custody?A.Mediation generally is quicker and less painful way to resolve child custody matters.A.YesQ.What happens if a fiancee registersIPC 498aagainst the groom?A.Cannot register. A woman has to be married.Q.Can a person other than husband and her husband’s relative be prosecuted undersection 498aIPC?A.NoQ. Is 498a is baised and wrong step in IPC?A.YesQ.

Custody to Father :Traditionally at Common law, the father was considered the sole guardian of the person and property of the child. However, Custody of Infants Act, 1839, in the UK – enabled the mother to claim custody over minor children, the rights of the father continued to remain supreme. In India, the Guardians and Wards Act was enacted in 1890 by the colonial state, which continued the legacy of Common law, of the supremacy of the paternal right in guardianship and custody of children. Through series of judicial decisions and amendments, the rights of father in India have been diluted. While the older cases under the GWA unequivocally hold that the father can be deprived of his position as the natural guardian only if he is found to be unfit for guardianship, there are many cases where the courts have been making exceptions to this principle. The widespread favoring of mother has been so relentless that in 2004, the Supreme Court noted “We make it clear that we do not subscribe to the general observations and comments made by the High Court in favour of mother as parent to be always a preferable to the father to retain custody of the child. In our considered opinion, such generalisation in favour of the mother should not have been made.”Q. Can father take custody of child after divorce?A.Yes, Father can take custody of child after divorce . As per the laws on Indian child custody,both divorced parents have equal rights over the child even after legal separation. One parent winning custody doesn\\’t mean the other ceases to be the parent and loses all rights over the child.Q. How can a father win custody of child after divorce?A.A father can gain custody of child after divorce in one of two ways:1.If the parents are able to come to an agreement that is going to occur with the children then a father may document this in a set of consent orders or a parenting arrangement so both divorced parents have equal rights to keep custody of child after divorce.2.If the parents are not able to come to an agreement then the matter will go to court and a judge will determine how much time each parent will spend with the child. A father will then need to show that it is in the best interests of the child for the child to spend time with him. Keep in mind that less than 3% of matters end up in court, meaning that there is a good chance it will not be you!Q. Can a couple seek custodial rights based on US laws, if currently they are located in US despite being Indian?A.Yes, in US not in India.Q. Can a stepmother claim a custody of a child in India?A.YesQ. Is mediation the best approach to solving disagreements about child custody?A.Mediation generally is quicker and less painful way to resolve child custody matters.A.YesQ.What happens if a fiancee registersIPC 498aagainst the groom?A.Cannot register. A woman has to be married.Q.Can a person other than husband and her husband’s relative be prosecuted undersection 498aIPC?A.NoQ. Is 498a is baised and wrong step in IPC?A.YesQ.

The builder is also bound by law to return the money collected from buyers within 45 days, after deducting the booking amountIn your case, it seems that the builder has violated the terms of the booking form and the sales agreement, which clearly stated the payment plan and the deal structure agreed by both parties. The builder cannot demand 20% of the payment within 21 days of booking, when you have already paid 12.5% as per the mutual agreement. The builder also cannot cancel the allotment without giving you a valid reason and a notice. The builder’s actions seem to be arbitrary and unfair, and may amount to deficiency of service and breach of contract.You have the right to challenge the cancellation of the allotment and seek refund of your money with interest and compensation. You can send a legal notice to the builder, demanding them to honour the agreement and restore your allotment, or to refund your money with interest and compensation.

During this process, it's advisable not to abscond as it might complicate matters further.3) Leaving the Country and Legal Proceedings: Attempting to leave the country might result in complications at the airport. If there's a case ongoing, authorities might have placed restrictions on your travel.4) Police Actions if Abroad: If you're abroad, the police might communicate with you through legal channels like virtual hearings or contact your lawyer. Typically, they won't trouble your family unless there's a suspicion that they are harboring you to evade legal actions.5) Best Course of Action: Cooperate with legal procedures, work closely with your lawyer, and avoid evading the authorities.

However, Custody of Infants Act, 1839, in the UK – enabled the mother to claim custody over minor children, the rights of the father continued to remain supreme. In India, the Guardians and Wards Act was enacted in 1890 by the colonial state, which continued the legacy of Common law, of the supremacy of the paternal right in guardianship and custody of children. Through series of judicial decisions and amendments, the rights of father in India have been diluted. While the older cases under the GWA unequivocally hold that the father can be deprived of his position as the natural guardian only if he is found to be unfit for guardianship, there are many cases where the courts have been making exceptions to this principle. The widespread favoring of mother has been so relentless that in 2004, the Supreme Court noted “We make it clear that we do not subscribe to the general observations and comments made by the High Court in favour of mother as parent to be always a preferable to the father to retain custody of the child. In our considered opinion, such generalisation in favour of the mother should not have been made.”Q. Can father take custody of child after divorce?A.Yes, Father can take custody of child after divorce . As per the laws on Indian child custody,both divorced parents have equal rights over the child even after legal separation. One parent winning custody doesn\\’t mean the other ceases to be the parent and loses all rights over the child.Q. How can a father win custody of child after divorce?A.A father can gain custody of child after divorce in one of two ways:1.If the parents are able to come to an agreement that is going to occur with the children then a father may document this in a set of consent orders or a parenting arrangement so both divorced parents have equal rights to keep custody of child after divorce.2.If the parents are not able to come to an agreement then the matter will go to court and a judge will determine how much time each parent will spend with the child. A father will then need to show that it is in the best interests of the child for the child to spend time with him. Keep in mind that less than 3% of matters end up in court, meaning that there is a good chance it will not be you!Q. Can a couple seek custodial rights based on US laws, if currently they are located in US despite being Indian?A.Yes, in US not in India.Q. Can a stepmother claim a custody of a child in India?A.YesQ. Is mediation the best approach to solving disagreements about child custody?A.Mediation generally is quicker and less painful way to resolve child custody matters.A.YesQ.What happens if a fiancee registersIPC 498aagainst the groom?A.Cannot register.

The creamy layer refers to the relatively affluent and privileged section of the OBC, who are excluded from the benefits of reservation. The OBC-NCL certificate enables the holder to avail the benefits of reservation in education, employment, and other sectors.To apply for an OBC-NCL certificate, one needs to meet certain eligibility criteria, such as:The person must belong to a caste or community that is recognized as OBC by the central or state government.The person’s parents must not be employed in Group A or Group B services of the central or state government, or hold any constitutional positions.The person’s parents must not have an annual income of more than Rs. 8 lakh from all sources, excluding agricultural income.In your case, since both your parents are deceased and were never employed or salaried, you need to produce your own income certificate to prove that you are not part of the creamy layer. You also need to produce your OBC certificate and other documents such as identity proof, address proof, birth certificate, etc.To apply for an OBC-NCL certificate, you can follow these steps:Go to the official website of the state social welfare department or portal where you reside.Click on the link for applying for caste certificate and register yourself with your details.Log in with your credentials and fill in the online application form with the required information and upload the scanned copies of the supporting documents.Submit the application form and pay the fee if applicable.You will receive an acknowledgement slip with a reference number that you can use to track the status of your application.Once your application is verified and approved, you will receive your OBC-NCL certificate either online or offline.You can also apply for an OBC-NCL certificate offline by visiting the nearest tehsil office, SDM office, or revenue office and submitting a written application along with the required documents.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

However, it's important to cooperate with legal procedures and present your side of the story.2) Anticipatory Bail Duration: Anticipatory bail may take a few days to a couple of weeks to get approved, depending on the legal system in your country. During this process, it's advisable not to abscond as it might complicate matters further.3) Leaving the Country and Legal Proceedings: Attempting to leave the country might result in complications at the airport. If there's a case ongoing, authorities might have placed restrictions on your travel.4) Police Actions if Abroad: If you're abroad, the police might communicate with you through legal channels like virtual hearings or contact your lawyer. Typically, they won't trouble your family unless there's a suspicion that they are harboring you to evade legal actions.5) Best Course of Action: Cooperate with legal procedures, work closely with your lawyer, and avoid evading the authorities. Present evidence, witnesses, and any proof that contradicts the false allegations.6) Arrest of Family Members: The police generally don't arrest family members unless they have been found to be actively aiding in the evasion of justice.

    "answer": "Dear Client,The value of a dispute involving a society's bylaws is usually determined by the monetary interest or the relief that is sought. If the dispute isn't about property, its value might have to do with the money at stake or the losses incurred. To find out how much the disagreement is worth in detail, you should speak with a legal professional.The Delhi Court Fees Act, 2012 governs the determination of court fees in Delhi. You must refer to this Act to determine the precise court costs, or you may consult a legal professional who can evaluate your particular situation and determine the appropriate fees. Determining the proper court fees is essential because failing to pay them on time could cause problems for your case.Online options are usually available for paying court fees in Delhi courts. For details on the procedure and how to make the payment, go to Delhi District Courts' official website or get in touch with the court. Requesting that court proceedings be conducted via video conferencing is an option if you are unable to travel to Delhi for hearings. When you include this request with your application or other court submission, the court will provide you instructions on how to take part in hearings via video conference. To help with paperwork, such as drafting the suit in accordance with court rules and obtaining certified copies of previous judgments and filing them, think about hiring a legal consultant or advocate. Legal consultants charge different rates depending on the complexity of your case and the services you need.

Therefore, even if you have agreed to let/sublet your property to a third agency, you are still a consumer of the builder and you have the right to seek redressal for any deficiency in the goods or services provided by the builder.No, you cannot file a case in the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) for your properties worth Rs. 52 lakh and compensation claim of Rs. 60 lakh. The pecuniary jurisdiction of the NCDRC is to entertain complaints where the value of the goods or services paid as consideration, along with the compensation claimed, exceeds Rs. 10 crore2. For complaints below this value, you have to approach the appropriate State Commission or District Forum, depending on their respective pecuniary jurisdiction.If you file a case in the NCDRC through offline method, then the court may summon the builder for hearing at the NCDRC in New Delhi, if it admits your complaint and issues notice to the opposite party. However, as mentioned above, you cannot file a case in the NCDRC for your properties and compensation claim, as they do not fall within its pecuniary jurisdiction. You have to file your case in the State Commission or District Forum where your properties are situated or where the builder’s office is located.No, you cannot file a case in the Consumer Court at your residence district, unless your properties or the builder’s office are also located in that district. The territorial jurisdiction of the Consumer Court is determined by the place where the cause of action arises or where the opposite party resides or carries on business or has a branch office or personally works for gain. Therefore, you have to file your case in the Consumer Court where your properties are situated or where the builder’s office is located.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

The builder cannot demand 20% of the payment within 21 days of booking, when you have already paid 12.5% as per the mutual agreement. The builder also cannot cancel the allotment without giving you a valid reason and a notice. The builder’s actions seem to be arbitrary and unfair, and may amount to deficiency of service and breach of contract.You have the right to challenge the cancellation of the allotment and seek refund of your money with interest and compensation.

You must refer to this Act to determine the precise court costs, or you may consult a legal professional who can evaluate your particular situation and determine the appropriate fees. Determining the proper court fees is essential because failing to pay them on time could cause problems for your case.Online options are usually available for paying court fees in Delhi courts.

The builder cannot demand 20% of the payment within 21 days of booking, when you have already paid 12.5% as per the mutual agreement. The builder also cannot cancel the allotment without giving you a valid reason and a notice. The builder’s actions seem to be arbitrary and unfair, and may amount to deficiency of service and breach of contract.You have the right to challenge the cancellation of the allotment and seek refund of your money with interest and compensation. You can send a legal notice to the builder, demanding them to honour the agreement and restore your allotment, or to refund your money with interest and compensation. If the builder does not respond or comply, you can file a complaint against them before the Karnataka Real Estate Regulatory Authority (KRERA) under Section 31 of RERA. You can also file a complaint before the consumer forum under theConsumer Protection Act, 2019 for redressal of your grievances.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Property succession from late mother to sons",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Inheritance of property in India can vary according to personal and religious laws. If a will is not present, the property will normally be divided among the legal heirs in accordance with the personal laws that apply to your religion—Muslim law in this case. The surviving spouse and children are normally considered the legal heirs under Muslim law. You and your brother will probably be the legal heirs since both of your parents have passed away.In order to prove your claim to the property, you might have to apply for a legal heir certificate. Documents proving your identity and relationships, as well as the death certificates of your parents, may be required during this process. After the legal heirship is established, you and your brother can start the process of transferring the property from your mother's name to yours. To assist you with the property transfer procedure and to make sure that all applicable state laws and regulations are followed, speak with a local attorney.Your brother can give you a power of attorney to act on his behalf in India; he is in the USA. This will enable you to sell the house even though he isn't there in person. He will have to write a POA document outlining the authority given to you and why it is being given. In the United States, the document must be notarized and signed. It might also require an apostille from the Indian Consulate or Embassy in the United States. You should confirm the specific requirements with the Indian Embassy or Consulate as they may differ from one another regarding the attestation of the document.You can use the duly executed and attested Power of Attorney to sell the property on your brother's behalf.

    "question": "Property succession from late mother to sons",
    "answer": "The property succession for Muslims in India is governed by the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, which excludes the application of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 and theHindu Succession Act, 1956. The Muslim law of succession is based on the sources of Islamic law, such as the Quran, the Sunnah, the Ijma, and the Qiyas. The Muslim law of succession is different for Shias and Sunnis, who are the two major sects of Islam.Since your mother passed away without leaving a will, her property will be inherited by her legal heirs according to the rules of intestate succession under Islamic law. The legal heirs of a deceased Muslim are divided into three classes: Quranic heirs, Agnatic heirs, and Uterine heirs. Quranic heirs are those who are mentioned in the Quran and have a fixed share in the inheritance. Agnatic heirs are those who are related to the deceased through a male line. Uterine heirs are those who are related to the deceased through a female line.As per the Sunni law of succession, you and your brother are the Quranic heirs of your mother, as you are her sons. You and your brother will inherit 2/3rd of your mother’s property in equal shares, i.e., 1/3rd each. The remaining 1/3rd of your mother’s property will be inherited by her other legal heirs, such as her father, mother, husband, daughters, etc., according to their respective shares. If your mother has no other legal heirs, then you and your brother will inherit the entire property in equal shares, i.e., 1/2 each.As per the Shia law of succession, you and your brother are also the Quranic heirs of your mother, as you are her sons. However, the shares of the Quranic heirs are different in Shia law. You and your brother will inherit 7/12th of your mother’s property in equal shares, i.e., 7/24th each. The remaining 5/12th of your mother’s property will be inherited by her other legal heirs, such as her father, mother, husband, daughters, etc., according to their respective shares. If your mother has no other legal heirs, then you and your brother will inherit the entire property in equal shares, i.e., 1/2 each.In order to transfer the ownership of your mother’s property to your name and your brother’s name, you need to obtain a legal heir certificate from the local authority, such as the tehsil office or the municipal corporation. The legal heir certificate is a document that certifies the relationship of the heirs with the deceased and their entitlement to the property. You also need to obtain a succession certificate from the district court, which is a document that authorizes the heirs to inherit the property and deal with the debts and liabilities of the deceased. You also need to get the property mutated in your name and your brother’s name in the revenue records of the local authority, by submitting the required documents, such as the death certificate of your mother, the legal heir certificate, the succession certificate, the property tax receipts, etc. You also need to pay the applicable stamp duty and registration fees for the transfer of property.If your brother wants to give you the power of attorney (POA) to sell the house on his behalf, he can do so by executing a POA from abroad. A POA is a legal document that empowers one person to act for another person in legal matters. There are two ways to execute a POA from abroad: Legalisation and Apostille. Legalisation is the process of getting the signatures of the notary or judge before whom the POA is executed authenticated by the duly accredited representative of the Indian Embassy/Consulate in the foreign country. Apostille is the process of getting the POA certified by the designated authority of the foreign country that is a member of the Hague Convention of 1961. The POA should be then sent to India by post and registered at the office of the Sub-Registrar within the jurisdiction of the property. The POA should also be stamped with the appropriate value of stamp duty as per the state laws.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

If the dispute isn't about property, its value might have to do with the money at stake or the losses incurred. To find out how much the disagreement is worth in detail, you should speak with a legal professional.The Delhi Court Fees Act, 2012 governs the determination of court fees in Delhi. You must refer to this Act to determine the precise court costs, or you may consult a legal professional who can evaluate your particular situation and determine the appropriate fees. Determining the proper court fees is essential because failing to pay them on time could cause problems for your case.Online options are usually available for paying court fees in Delhi courts. For details on the procedure and how to make the payment, go to Delhi District Courts' official website or get in touch with the court. Requesting that court proceedings be conducted via video conferencing is an option if you are unable to travel to Delhi for hearings. When you include this request with your application or other court submission, the court will provide you instructions on how to take part in hearings via video conference. To help with paperwork, such as drafting the suit in accordance with court rules and obtaining certified copies of previous judgments and filing them, think about hiring a legal consultant or advocate. Legal consultants charge different rates depending on the complexity of your case and the services you need. Get quotes from several consultants and choose the one that best fits your requirements and budget.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Obtaining OBC - NCL certificate for an applicant whose parents are died",
    "answer": "An OBC-NCL certificate is a document that proves that a person belongs to the Other Backward Class (OBC) category and is not part of the creamy layer. The creamy layer refers to the relatively affluent and privileged section of the OBC, who are excluded from the benefits of reservation. The OBC-NCL certificate enables the holder to avail the benefits of reservation in education, employment, and other sectors.To apply for an OBC-NCL certificate, one needs to meet certain eligibility criteria, such as:The person must belong to a caste or community that is recognized as OBC by the central or state government.The person’s parents must not be employed in Group A or Group B services of the central or state government, or hold any constitutional positions.The person’s parents must not have an annual income of more than Rs. 8 lakh from all sources, excluding agricultural income.In your case, since both your parents are deceased and were never employed or salaried, you need to produce your own income certificate to prove that you are not part of the creamy layer. You also need to produce your OBC certificate and other documents such as identity proof, address proof, birth certificate, etc.To apply for an OBC-NCL certificate, you can follow these steps:Go to the official website of the state social welfare department or portal where you reside.Click on the link for applying for caste certificate and register yourself with your details.Log in with your credentials and fill in the online application form with the required information and upload the scanned copies of the supporting documents.Submit the application form and pay the fee if applicable.You will receive an acknowledgement slip with a reference number that you can use to track the status of your application.Once your application is verified and approved, you will receive your OBC-NCL certificate either online or offline.You can also apply for an OBC-NCL certificate offline by visiting the nearest tehsil office, SDM office, or revenue office and submitting a written application along with the required documents.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Property succession from late mother to sons",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Inheritance of property in India can vary according to personal and religious laws. If a will is not present, the property will normally be divided among the legal heirs in accordance with the personal laws that apply to your religion—Muslim law in this case. The surviving spouse and children are normally considered the legal heirs under Muslim law. You and your brother will probably be the legal heirs since both of your parents have passed away.In order to prove your claim to the property, you might have to apply for a legal heir certificate. Documents proving your identity and relationships, as well as the death certificates of your parents, may be required during this process. After the legal heirship is established, you and your brother can start the process of transferring the property from your mother's name to yours. To assist you with the property transfer procedure and to make sure that all applicable state laws and regulations are followed, speak with a local attorney.Your brother can give you a power of attorney to act on his behalf in India; he is in the USA. This will enable you to sell the house even though he isn't there in person. He will have to write a POA document outlining the authority given to you and why it is being given. In the United States, the document must be notarized and signed. It might also require an apostille from the Indian Consulate or Embassy in the United States. You should confirm the specific requirements with the Indian Embassy or Consulate as they may differ from one another regarding the attestation of the document.You can use the duly executed and attested Power of Attorney to sell the property on your brother's behalf. To make the POA enforceable, make sure it is registered in India.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Property succession from late mother to sons",
    "answer": "The property succession for Muslims in India is governed by the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, which excludes the application of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 and theHindu Succession Act, 1956. The Muslim law of succession is based on the sources of Islamic law, such as the Quran, the Sunnah, the Ijma, and the Qiyas. The Muslim law of succession is different for Shias and Sunnis, who are the two major sects of Islam.Since your mother passed away without leaving a will, her property will be inherited by her legal heirs according to the rules of intestate succession under Islamic law. The legal heirs of a deceased Muslim are divided into three classes: Quranic heirs, Agnatic heirs, and Uterine heirs. Quranic heirs are those who are mentioned in the Quran and have a fixed share in the inheritance. Agnatic heirs are those who are related to the deceased through a male line. Uterine heirs are those who are related to the deceased through a female line.As per the Sunni law of succession, you and your brother are the Quranic heirs of your mother, as you are her sons. You and your brother will inherit 2/3rd of your mother’s property in equal shares, i.e., 1/3rd each. The remaining 1/3rd of your mother’s property will be inherited by her other legal heirs, such as her father, mother, husband, daughters, etc., according to their respective shares. If your mother has no other legal heirs, then you and your brother will inherit the entire property in equal shares, i.e., 1/2 each.As per the Shia law of succession, you and your brother are also the Quranic heirs of your mother, as you are her sons. However, the shares of the Quranic heirs are different in Shia law. You and your brother will inherit 7/12th of your mother’s property in equal shares, i.e., 7/24th each. The remaining 5/12th of your mother’s property will be inherited by her other legal heirs, such as her father, mother, husband, daughters, etc., according to their respective shares. If your mother has no other legal heirs, then you and your brother will inherit the entire property in equal shares, i.e., 1/2 each.In order to transfer the ownership of your mother’s property to your name and your brother’s name, you need to obtain a legal heir certificate from the local authority, such as the tehsil office or the municipal corporation. The legal heir certificate is a document that certifies the relationship of the heirs with the deceased and their entitlement to the property. You also need to obtain a succession certificate from the district court, which is a document that authorizes the heirs to inherit the property and deal with the debts and liabilities of the deceased. You also need to get the property mutated in your name and your brother’s name in the revenue records of the local authority, by submitting the required documents, such as the death certificate of your mother, the legal heir certificate, the succession certificate, the property tax receipts, etc. You also need to pay the applicable stamp duty and registration fees for the transfer of property.If your brother wants to give you the power of attorney (POA) to sell the house on his behalf, he can do so by executing a POA from abroad. A POA is a legal document that empowers one person to act for another person in legal matters. There are two ways to execute a POA from abroad: Legalisation and Apostille. Legalisation is the process of getting the signatures of the notary or judge before whom the POA is executed authenticated by the duly accredited representative of the Indian Embassy/Consulate in the foreign country. Apostille is the process of getting the POA certified by the designated authority of the foreign country that is a member of the Hague Convention of 1961. The POA should be then sent to India by post and registered at the office of the Sub-Registrar within the jurisdiction of the property. The POA should also be stamped with the appropriate value of stamp duty as per the state laws.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "An OBC-NCL certificate is a document that proves that a person belongs to the Other Backward Class (OBC) category and is not part of the creamy layer. The creamy layer refers to the relatively affluent and privileged section of the OBC, who are excluded from the benefits of reservation. The OBC-NCL certificate enables the holder to avail the benefits of reservation in education, employment, and other sectors.To apply for an OBC-NCL certificate, one needs to meet certain eligibility criteria, such as:The person must belong to a caste or community that is recognized as OBC by the central or state government.The person’s parents must not be employed in Group A or Group B services of the central or state government, or hold any constitutional positions.The person’s parents must not have an annual income of more than Rs. 8 lakh from all sources, excluding agricultural income.In your case, since both your parents are deceased and were never employed or salaried, you need to produce your own income certificate to prove that you are not part of the creamy layer. You also need to produce your OBC certificate and other documents such as identity proof, address proof, birth certificate, etc.To apply for an OBC-NCL certificate, you can follow these steps:Go to the official website of the state social welfare department or portal where you reside.Click on the link for applying for caste certificate and register yourself with your details.Log in with your credentials and fill in the online application form with the required information and upload the scanned copies of the supporting documents.Submit the application form and pay the fee if applicable.You will receive an acknowledgement slip with a reference number that you can use to track the status of your application.Once your application is verified and approved, you will receive your OBC-NCL certificate either online or offline.You can also apply for an OBC-NCL certificate offline by visiting the nearest tehsil office, SDM office, or revenue office and submitting a written application along with the required documents.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "The  Bylaw No 38 of the 2013 model society bylaws framed under the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960, read with circular dated August 9, 2001, issued by the government of Maharashtra. unequivocally state that the premium fixed by the society for the transfer of flats, cannot exceed a sum of Rs 25,000.The same law is applicable to Gujarat state also.Therefore the charges demanded by the society can be termed as exorbitant.You may issue a legal notice to the society about this exorbitant charges and refuse to pay more than Rs. 25,000/- quoting the above referred law and also refuse to pay the development charges, which is an illegal demand by the society.Let the society issue a reply notice denying the averments made by you and insist on their original demand,  citing any local bye law, you can approach the registrar of cooperative societies to intervene and render you justice by directing the society to adhere to the bylaws framed by Government for this purpose.If the approach to the  registrar fails to  invoke a positive response you may drag the society to consumer forum for relief, remedy and compensation for deficiency in service and unfair trade practice.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Property succession from late mother to sons",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Inheritance of property in India can vary according to personal and religious laws. If a will is not present, the property will normally be divided among the legal heirs in accordance with the personal laws that apply to your religion—Muslim law in this case. The surviving spouse and children are normally considered the legal heirs under Muslim law. You and your brother will probably be the legal heirs since both of your parents have passed away.In order to prove your claim to the property, you might have to apply for a legal heir certificate. Documents proving your identity and relationships, as well as the death certificates of your parents, may be required during this process. After the legal heirship is established, you and your brother can start the process of transferring the property from your mother's name to yours. To assist you with the property transfer procedure and to make sure that all applicable state laws and regulations are followed, speak with a local attorney.Your brother can give you a power of attorney to act on his behalf in India; he is in the USA. This will enable you to sell the house even though he isn't there in person. He will have to write a POA document outlining the authority given to you and why it is being given. In the United States, the document must be notarized and signed. It might also require an apostille from the Indian Consulate or Embassy in the United States. You should confirm the specific requirements with the Indian Embassy or Consulate as they may differ from one another regarding the attestation of the document.You can use the duly executed and attested Power of Attorney to sell the property on your brother's behalf. To make the POA enforceable, make sure it is registered in India.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Property succession from late mother to sons",
    "answer": "The property succession for Muslims in India is governed by the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, which excludes the application of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 and theHindu Succession Act, 1956. The Muslim law of succession is based on the sources of Islamic law, such as the Quran, the Sunnah, the Ijma, and the Qiyas. The Muslim law of succession is different for Shias and Sunnis, who are the two major sects of Islam.Since your mother passed away without leaving a will, her property will be inherited by her legal heirs according to the rules of intestate succession under Islamic law. The legal heirs of a deceased Muslim are divided into three classes: Quranic heirs, Agnatic heirs, and Uterine heirs. Quranic heirs are those who are mentioned in the Quran and have a fixed share in the inheritance. Agnatic heirs are those who are related to the deceased through a male line. Uterine heirs are those who are related to the deceased through a female line.As per the Sunni law of succession, you and your brother are the Quranic heirs of your mother, as you are her sons. You and your brother will inherit 2/3rd of your mother’s property in equal shares, i.e., 1/3rd each. The remaining 1/3rd of your mother’s property will be inherited by her other legal heirs, such as her father, mother, husband, daughters, etc., according to their respective shares. If your mother has no other legal heirs, then you and your brother will inherit the entire property in equal shares, i.e., 1/2 each.As per the Shia law of succession, you and your brother are also the Quranic heirs of your mother, as you are her sons. However, the shares of the Quranic heirs are different in Shia law. You and your brother will inherit 7/12th of your mother’s property in equal shares, i.e., 7/24th each. The remaining 5/12th of your mother’s property will be inherited by her other legal heirs, such as her father, mother, husband, daughters, etc., according to their respective shares. If your mother has no other legal heirs, then you and your brother will inherit the entire property in equal shares, i.e., 1/2 each.In order to transfer the ownership of your mother’s property to your name and your brother’s name, you need to obtain a legal heir certificate from the local authority, such as the tehsil office or the municipal corporation. The legal heir certificate is a document that certifies the relationship of the heirs with the deceased and their entitlement to the property. You also need to obtain a succession certificate from the district court, which is a document that authorizes the heirs to inherit the property and deal with the debts and liabilities of the deceased. You also need to get the property mutated in your name and your brother’s name in the revenue records of the local authority, by submitting the required documents, such as the death certificate of your mother, the legal heir certificate, the succession certificate, the property tax receipts, etc. You also need to pay the applicable stamp duty and registration fees for the transfer of property.If your brother wants to give you the power of attorney (POA) to sell the house on his behalf, he can do so by executing a POA from abroad. A POA is a legal document that empowers one person to act for another person in legal matters. There are two ways to execute a POA from abroad: Legalisation and Apostille. Legalisation is the process of getting the signatures of the notary or judge before whom the POA is executed authenticated by the duly accredited representative of the Indian Embassy/Consulate in the foreign country. Apostille is the process of getting the POA certified by the designated authority of the foreign country that is a member of the Hague Convention of 1961. The POA should be then sent to India by post and registered at the office of the Sub-Registrar within the jurisdiction of the property. The POA should also be stamped with the appropriate value of stamp duty as per the state laws.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "An OBC-NCL certificate is a document that proves that a person belongs to the Other Backward Class (OBC) category and is not part of the creamy layer. The creamy layer refers to the relatively affluent and privileged section of the OBC, who are excluded from the benefits of reservation. The OBC-NCL certificate enables the holder to avail the benefits of reservation in education, employment, and other sectors.To apply for an OBC-NCL certificate, one needs to meet certain eligibility criteria, such as:The person must belong to a caste or community that is recognized as OBC by the central or state government.The person’s parents must not be employed in Group A or Group B services of the central or state government, or hold any constitutional positions.The person’s parents must not have an annual income of more than Rs. 8 lakh from all sources, excluding agricultural income.In your case, since both your parents are deceased and were never employed or salaried, you need to produce your own income certificate to prove that you are not part of the creamy layer. You also need to produce your OBC certificate and other documents such as identity proof, address proof, birth certificate, etc.To apply for an OBC-NCL certificate, you can follow these steps:Go to the official website of the state social welfare department or portal where you reside.Click on the link for applying for caste certificate and register yourself with your details.Log in with your credentials and fill in the online application form with the required information and upload the scanned copies of the supporting documents.Submit the application form and pay the fee if applicable.You will receive an acknowledgement slip with a reference number that you can use to track the status of your application.Once your application is verified and approved, you will receive your OBC-NCL certificate either online or offline.You can also apply for an OBC-NCL certificate offline by visiting the nearest tehsil office, SDM office, or revenue office and submitting a written application along with the required documents.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Yes, a buyer who buys a flat from a builder by taking a home loan and also mentions in the agreement of sale that he will let/sublet his property to a third agency after possession can be treated as a consumer as per theConsumer Protection Act, 2019. The definition of consumer under the Act includes any person who buys any goods or avails any services for a consideration, whether paid or promised or partly paid or partly promised, or under any system of deferred payment. The Act also covers the person who uses such goods or services with the approval of the buyer. Therefore, even if you have agreed to let/sublet your property to a third agency, you are still a consumer of the builder and you have the right to seek redressal for any deficiency in the goods or services provided by the builder.No, you cannot file a case in the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) for your properties worth Rs. 52 lakh and compensation claim of Rs. 60 lakh. The pecuniary jurisdiction of the NCDRC is to entertain complaints where the value of the goods or services paid as consideration, along with the compensation claimed, exceeds Rs. 10 crore2. For complaints below this value, you have to approach the appropriate State Commission or District Forum, depending on their respective pecuniary jurisdiction.If you file a case in the NCDRC through offline method, then the court may summon the builder for hearing at the NCDRC in New Delhi, if it admits your complaint and issues notice to the opposite party. However, as mentioned above, you cannot file a case in the NCDRC for your properties and compensation claim, as they do not fall within its pecuniary jurisdiction. You have to file your case in the State Commission or District Forum where your properties are situated or where the builder’s office is located.No, you cannot file a case in the Consumer Court at your residence district, unless your properties or the builder’s office are also located in that district. The territorial jurisdiction of the Consumer Court is determined by the place where the cause of action arises or where the opposite party resides or carries on business or has a branch office or personally works for gain. Therefore, you have to file your case in the Consumer Court where your properties are situated or where the builder’s office is located.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Unregistered GPA (buyer) and sale deed",
    "answer": "Dear client,   In India, it's generally advisable to have the power of attorney (GPA) for buyers registered. While a GPA may only be a signing authority, registering it adds legal validity and authenticity to the document. The Supreme Court's judgment in 2011 emphasized the importance of registering GPAs to avoid disputes. So, it would be best for Mr. X and Mrs. Y to consider registering their GPA.Typographical Error in Sale Deed: The misspelling of names in a sale deed can be corrected through a correction deed. This would help ensure that the property title reflects the correct names of the buyers.New Buyer's Concerns: If a new buyer is interested in the property, they may still have concerns about the unregistered GPA for Mr. POA_Buyer. To address this, Mr. X and Mrs. Y could consider executing a correction deed that includes the spelling correction and explicitly states that the unregistered GPA is valid and authorized by them. This correction deed should be registered to make it legally binding.Legal Complexity: The third opinion suggests that the issue is too complex and not recommended for new buyers. While this is a cautious approach, it may not be necessary if the correct legal procedures are followed to rectify the situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "i did not see your follow up which i believe has enlisted all the powers that are granted under the POAI do not see any power to sign and execute any sale deed and to take steps for registering the same by complying with the registration formalitiesit appears that the sub-registrar may have relied on the following powers, for registering the sale deedTo enter into any Agreements, and rectify or alter or cancel the same;To appear before any Authority or Court or person;To appear beforeand to deal withand represent before corporation, or income tax authorities,or other authorities.now there are 2 things: implied authority and ratification of an act which was not authorisedit is not the case of X and Y that Y's father's act of registering the sale deed was illegal and without any authorityin fact X and Y by their conduct have accepted the act of registration of the sale deed by Y's father on behalf of X and YThus even though there is no power in the POA in favour of Y's father to sign and register a sale deed on behalf of X and Y, it can be said that Y's father had an implied authorityX and Y can also ratify the act of the grantee of the POA of signing and registering the sale deed on their behalf, which can again be either express or impliedsee s. 186, 196 and 197 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872so X and Y can make an affidavit [for the new buyer's purpose] that their grantee had an implied authority to sign and register the sale deed on their behalf and even otherwise the said act is being ratified by the donors of the POAThis should allay any doubts in the minds of the new buyera correction deed would require the sellers to be parties. so you will have to approach them. and you may or may not be entertained by them. and by making a correction deed you are in a way admitting that there is some defect in the sale deed by which X and Y acquired title. so i don't see how a correction deed helpshad there been any dispute between the donors and donee of the POA then it was another thing. Here there is none. So you can explore the route of the affidavit as stated above and satisfy your buyerYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Unregistered GPA of the Buyer (Mr. X and Mrs. Y): In many jurisdictions, a Power of Attorney (GPA) for the buyer does not necessarily need to be registered if it is only used for the signing authority and not for transferring property ownership.Typographical Error in Sale Deed: If there is a typographical error in the sale deed, you can consider executing a correction deed (also known as Rectification Deed) to rectify the error. This correction deed should be executed by Mr. X and Mrs. Y, and it should be registered with the sub-registrar's office to make the necessary correction.New Buyer: When selling the property to a new buyer, it's crucial to ensure that the title to the property is clear. This may involve addressing any concerns related to the unregistered GPA and the typographical error.

But, from the actions of your maternal uncles and your mother, it appears that it was not so. You say your mother got a portion from a court order. She was well within her rights to sell her share and distribute the proceeds as she deemed fit. Unfortunately, you cannot claim any share.Father's side:Q.2. Unfortunately, here also, you cannot claim as a matter of right. Whatever your father acquired from your grandfather became his absolute property and he could deal with it as he wished.Q.3. and Q.4. It is legally not appropriate.Swaminathan NeelakantanAdvocate, Coimbatore3023 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Swaminathan Neelakantan"

    "context": "Asked 3 years ago in Property Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Legal heir",
    "answer": "Dear client,1. The transfer of Rs.10,00,000 from your father to you, even if it's being done via cheque, can be construed in different ways by tax authorities. If this transaction is being classified as repayment of a loan, it wouldn't be considered as income. In this scenario, the money you gave your father over the years would be treated as a loan, and the repayment would not attract any tax liability. Second scenario is If authorities view this transfer as a gift from your father, it might not be taxable either, as gifts from relatives are generally not taxed in India. If the total amount received as a gift exceeds Rs.50,000 in a financial year, it's taxable as 'income from other sources', except in specific exempted cases (gift from relatives being one such exemption).To ensure that the transaction is perceived as either a gift or a loan repayment, you can take certain steps. If the initial transfer of Rs.10,00,000 was intended as a loan, ensure you have documentation supporting this. Any written agreement or record of the transactions (bank statements, transfer receipts, or any written acknowledgment of the loan) can help establish that it wasn't a gift but a loan extended to your father. When your father repays the Rs.10,00,000, ensure there's documentation acknowledging this repayment. This could be a simple agreement or a receipt stating that the amount has been repaid by your father to you as per the terms of the loan agreement. If there were any discussions, emails, or messages regarding the nature of the transaction (loan or gift), keep these records safe. They can serve as evidence if needed to establish the intention behind the transfer. Seek advice from a tax consultant or a chartered accountant. They can review the documentation, understand the specifics of your situation, and provide guidance on how to present the transaction to tax authorities to ensure it's treated as a loan repayment or a gift, whichever is applicable and more advantageous for you tax-wise.2. If the agreement is for your father to repay you Rs.10,00,000 without interest, requesting him to issue multiple cheques totaling Rs.10,00,000 but with amounts less than Rs.1,00,000 each could be seen as an attempt to avoid certain banking and tax regulations. In India, banks report transactions of Rs.10,00,000 or more to the Income Tax Department. Splitting the repayment into smaller amounts to avoid this reporting threshold might raise suspicions and could be seen as an attempt to avoid tax scrutiny. It's important to be transparent in financial dealings, especially when dealing with significant amounts. Instead of trying to structure the repayment in a way that raises questions, focus on documenting the repayment properly with a clear acknowledgment that the Rs.10,00,000 received is the repayment of the loan. Proper documentation and transparency in the transaction will support your case if there are any inquiries from tax authorities.3. Ensure the abovementioned documentations and communications.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "1. The 2005 Amendment amended Section 6 of theHindu Succession Actof 1956 and eradicated the age-old discriminatory practice of keeping women out of the coparcenary inheritance system. So now a daughter has equal or the same rights/share in the property as the son.2. The jewelry or any other gifts that your parents gave to your sister during her wedding are considered as her 'Streedhan'. They would not be considered as a share from the property because as per the law, every Hindu woman has full ownership right over any moveable or immovable property she possesses through :InheritancePartitionStreedhanGift from any relative or non-relativeOwn skill or exertionPurchase or prescription, etc.3. Due to the abovementioned points in Para 2, your sister's status would not be considered when distributing the property.4. As per the law, your financial condition would not be considered for distribution of property and therefore would not make you automatically eligible for a higher share.5. Your mother may draft the WILL herself as well, as there is no legal compulsion that a WILL has to be drafted by a lawyer only. But if she feels the need, it is advisable to consult an advocate as they would be able to guide her about the legalities and the finer points.6. Make sure to get the WILL registered as an unregistered WILL might lead to legal hassles in future.NOTE : The above-mentioned points are matters of law in case a person passes away intestate i.e. without making a WILL. But any person including your mother is free to distribute his/her property as per his/her choice and does not have to necessarily distribute his/her property equally amongst all legal heirs. A WILL supersedes and overrides any other law or formula of property distribution. So all the questions that you have asked would not be applicable after your mother makes her WILL and gets it registered.Indu VermaAdvocate, Chandigarh71 Answers8 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Indu Verma"

    "question": "How to evict tenants who are in possession of my property",
    "answer": "1. you can certainly file an eviction suit against the grandchildren on the grounds of arrears of rent, non-user and possession required for immediate demolition2. the rent is in arrears since 2015, so i fear that, that claim may have become time barred. however the other grounds like non-user and possession needed for immediate demolition are certainly there3. for claiming arrears of rent, you will have to issue a statutory notice u/s 15 of the Maharashtra rent control act. Even if the rent is cleared upon receiving the notice, you can still sue them for not paying rent on time. The landlord should not be made to issue a legal notice everytime to the tenant for payment of rent. It should not be that only on receiving the legal notice the tenant pays the rent. This would become onerous for the landlord. So even if the rent arrears are cleared, you can still seek their eviction as the tenant was never ready and willing to pay rent on time and only on being served with the legal notice, he paid the rent. So such a tenant has no right to continue to occupy the premises. This is because the landlord also has to pay the outgoings of the building like property tax etc. And some landlords are dependent on the rental income for their sustenance. Though a rent of Rs. 27/- in today's time is even less than pittance.4. the corporation cannot raise their hands by saying that it will not demolish the building because there are occupants in the building. This is no answer. The corporation owes a duty to the general public and the passers by who could be injured if the building suddenly collapses. So if the corporation is not demolishing the building then you will have to approach the High Court. Also there are judgments which have held that just because the building is demolished, the rights of the tenants/occupants are not obliterated and they are infact preserved and unaffected.5. the grandchildren would be the statutory tenants by virtue of the definition of tenant given in the rent act in s.7(15)(d). So even if the original contractual tenant dies, the tenancy right survives to his family member or legal heir who would then become the statutory tenant under the rent actYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "How to evict tenants who are in possession of my property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,As per the fact of the case tenant is not paying the rent for 8-9 year ,it can be taken as a ground for evicting the tenant from the house.After establishing the grounds for the eviction, the following procedure needs to be followed:Stage I -Send a Notice to the Tenant to Vacate:An eviction notice needs to be filed in a court under the appropriate jurisdiction mentioning the reason for eviction and the time and date by which the tenant has to vacate the property and is then sent to the tenant to vacate the rental property. The landlord must give a reasonable time to the tenant to vacate the rented property. In the majority of cases, the tenants leave the rented premises after receiving a legal notice from the court.Stage II - File an Eviction Suit:The tenant may refuse to vacate the rented property after receiving the court’s eviction notice and contest the eviction. In this case, the landlord can hire a rental property lawyer to file an eviction suit against the tenant. The suit for eviction of the tenant is filed in a civil court under whose jurisdiction the rented property is situated.Stage III - Final Eviction Notice:The court hears both sides and issues a final legal notice for eviction for the tenant based on the arguments and evidence present. The tenant has to vacate the rented property once the court sends the final eviction notice.Thank YouAyantika MondalAdvocate, Bangalore27 Answers9 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ayantika Mondal"

    "question": "How to evict tenants who are in possession of my property",
    "answer": "Rent Default: If the tenants have defaulted on rent payment for an extended period, you can send them a notice for rent arrears. If they pay the outstanding rent along with interest, it may reset the legal situation. However, this doesn't automatically end the tenancy.Tenancy after Original Tenant's Death: In many cases, the tenancy can continue even after the original tenant's death, especially if there is a family member residing in the property. However, this can vary depending on state-specific rent control laws.Dilapidated Structure: If the building is declared dilapidated and uninhabitable, it's essential to follow the proper legal process for eviction. You may need to obtain the necessary permissions and orders from the relevant authority for demolition or repair.Non-Occupancy: If the tenants have not been living in the property for an extended period, it may be possible to argue that they have abandoned the property. However, this should be done legally to avoid any potential claims from the tenants.Corporation's Role: If the corporation is not willing to interfere in the matter, you should focus on following the legal process for eviction as per the existing laws. It's essential to ensure that you adhere to all legal requirements to protect your rights as the landlord.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Partition suit pending for final decree",
    "answer": "In a partition case, a preliminary decree is followed by a final decree that divides the property among co-owners. Your preliminary decree, issued in 2018, granted you a 4/7th (57.15%) share, while the other six co-owners received 7.15% each. However, you've observed construction activities on the property by co-owners holding a collective 42.85% share. You obtained a court-issued stay order, restraining further construction, and have informed the police and municipal authorities. You're located in Chennai, while the property is in Rajasthan, around 2500 km away. You have several questions:Impact of Present Construction:Allowing the ongoing construction could potentially harm your interests, as the new structure's valuation may affect the property's auction price.Property's Status Quo:You mentioned that the property has existed for more than 64 years, implying that the superstructure has fully depreciated. However, the concept of status quo pertains to the property's current physical condition and legal standing, which can change over time due to various factors.Lack of Objections by Co-Owners:Your notice about the construction did not receive objections or attempts to halt it from other co-owners. This, in your view, suggests their complicity in the ongoing construction.Demarcation Challenges:If metes and bounds demarcation of the property isn't feasible, auction may be the only viable solution.Online Case Contestation from Chennai:Whether you can contest the case online from Chennai depends on the nature of your case and the court's available online facilities. E-filing and virtual courts are potential options for online case participation. You'll need to check with the specific court where your case is pending to determine if these options are available.Overall, your concerns are valid, especially regarding the potential impact of the construction on the property's valuation and the need to proceed with an auction. However, the legal processes and options available to you will depend on the specific circumstances of your case and the jurisdiction of the court involved.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

The terms “winding up” and “dissolution” are often used interchangeably, but they actually refer to two distinct legal processes.Winding up is the process of bringing a company's affairs to a close, selling its assets, and distributing the proceeds to creditors and shareholders. Dissolution is the legal process of terminating the company's existence.The winding up process can be initiated by the company’s directors, shareholders, or a court order.The purpose of winding up is to bring a company’s affairs to a close in an orderly and fair manner, ensuring that all creditors are paid in full and that any remaining assets are distributed among the shareholders according to their entitlement. Winding up can also help to minimize the risk of future legal claims against the company, as it provides a clear and final resolution to the company’s outstanding liabilities.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

If registered, GST could apply to the repair charges.b) GST on Regular Bill of Rs. 2,600: The regular maintenance charges, including property tax, may not attract GST, as they are typically exempt. However, this may vary based on specific circumstances, and you should seek professional advice.c) GST Rate and Payment: If GST is applicable, the rate can vary depending on the nature of the services provided. GST rates may include 18% or 12% for certain services. The specific rate should be determined based on the type of repair services provided. GST is generally payable on a monthly or quarterly basis.d) Offset of GST: If you are required to levy GST, you may be eligible to claim input tax credit (ITC) on GST paid for expenses related to the repair and maintenance work. This can include goods and services used for the repair project.

    "answer": "She would have filed for maintenance in India and got the Ex-parte decree in her favor that’s how she’s claiming that you owe her Rs.20,000,  As this is a quasi-criminal case it is highly unlikely that you’ll be arrested. You can be asked by the court to pay maintenance at worst if you are unable to pay it then it can be recovered from your property, Howeveryou can challenge this decree in court in India and get it set aside on the ground that your wife is living in adultery with her boyfriendas according to  catena of Supreme Court and High Court judgements adulterous wives are not eligible to receive maintenance and it is also a ground for divorce, also you can file civil as well as criminal cases against her for the fraud, cheating and abuse of process of Law in India, and I would advise you to also initiate divorce proceedings against her as soon as you come to India, also if you have doubts that as soon as you get back to India she’ll file false criminal case against you in that case you can apply for anticipatory bail in advance and if you get it from court you will not get arrested in India and you will also be able to pursue your matter and clear yourself from this situation. For further Advice I’ll need more information from you.Also, you should hire some local advocate to check if any case under498A IPChave been file against you and once it is confirmed you’ll be able to visit India freely.Siddharth JainAdvocate, New Delhi6464 Answers102 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Siddharth Jain"

    "answer": "You have a case of fraudulent marriage by your wife, who concealed her previous marriage and children from you and married you only to get a visa to the USA. She also filed a false claim for maintenance against you after her visa was rejected. You have filed a case against her for fraud and want to get out of this mess.Some of the possible actions you can take are:File a petition for annulment of marriage in the family court having jurisdiction over your place of marriage or residence in India. You can seek annulment on the grounds of fraud, misrepresentation, and concealment of material facts by your wife.File a counter-claim against your wife’s maintenance petition and challenge her claim on the grounds of fraud, desertion, adultery, and lack of jurisdiction.File a criminal complaint against your wife and her boyfriend for cheating, bigamy, forgery, perjury, and criminal conspiracy under relevant sections of IPC.I hope this information helps you understand your options better. However, this is not a substitute for professional legal advice. You should always consult a lawyer for specific guidance and representation regarding your case.

    "answer": "In the event of dispute between you both and both of you do not want to continue the company any further after divorce, then you can initiate process for winding up of the company.When a company reaches the end of its life cycle, there are various legal processes that must be followed to close it down. The terms “winding up” and “dissolution” are often used interchangeably, but they actually refer to two distinct legal processes.Winding up is the process of bringing a company's affairs to a close, selling its assets, and distributing the proceeds to creditors and shareholders. Dissolution is the legal process of terminating the company's existence.The winding up process can be initiated by the company’s directors, shareholders, or a court order.The purpose of winding up is to bring a company’s affairs to a close in an orderly and fair manner, ensuring that all creditors are paid in full and that any remaining assets are distributed among the shareholders according to their entitlement. Winding up can also help to minimize the risk of future legal claims against the company, as it provides a clear and final resolution to the company’s outstanding liabilities.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Splitting rights over a software product source code",
    "answer": "In a divorce scenario, the division of assets, including intellectual property (IP) like software code, can be complex and may depend on various factors, including the laws of your jurisdiction and any existing agreements you have in place.Without a patent or registered copyright, it may be challenging to establish clear ownership. Since you both hold equal shares in the company, you may each have some claim to the software IP, but the specifics will depend on the legal framework and any prior agreements.Keep in mind that attempting to start a new company with the same codebase without the consent of your spouse or without a legal resolution could lead to legal disputes.

Generally, if the annual turnover of the housing society is above the threshold limit (currently Rs. 20 lakhs for services), it may be required to register for GST. If registered, GST could apply to the repair charges.b) GST on Regular Bill of Rs. 2,600: The regular maintenance charges, including property tax, may not attract GST, as they are typically exempt. However, this may vary based on specific circumstances, and you should seek professional advice.c) GST Rate and Payment: If GST is applicable, the rate can vary depending on the nature of the services provided. GST rates may include 18% or 12% for certain services. The specific rate should be determined based on the type of repair services provided. GST is generally payable on a monthly or quarterly basis.d) Offset of GST: If you are required to levy GST, you may be eligible to claim input tax credit (ITC) on GST paid for expenses related to the repair and maintenance work. This can include goods and services used for the repair project.

The terms “winding up” and “dissolution” are often used interchangeably, but they actually refer to two distinct legal processes.Winding up is the process of bringing a company's affairs to a close, selling its assets, and distributing the proceeds to creditors and shareholders. Dissolution is the legal process of terminating the company's existence.The winding up process can be initiated by the company’s directors, shareholders, or a court order.The purpose of winding up is to bring a company’s affairs to a close in an orderly and fair manner, ensuring that all creditors are paid in full and that any remaining assets are distributed among the shareholders according to their entitlement. Winding up can also help to minimize the risk of future legal claims against the company, as it provides a clear and final resolution to the company’s outstanding liabilities.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "In a divorce scenario, the division of assets, including intellectual property (IP) like software code, can be complex and may depend on various factors, including the laws of your jurisdiction and any existing agreements you have in place.Without a patent or registered copyright, it may be challenging to establish clear ownership. Since you both hold equal shares in the company, you may each have some claim to the software IP, but the specifics will depend on the legal framework and any prior agreements.Keep in mind that attempting to start a new company with the same codebase without the consent of your spouse or without a legal resolution could lead to legal disputes.

Generally, if the annual turnover of the housing society is above the threshold limit (currently Rs. 20 lakhs for services), it may be required to register for GST. If registered, GST could apply to the repair charges.b) GST on Regular Bill of Rs. 2,600: The regular maintenance charges, including property tax, may not attract GST, as they are typically exempt. However, this may vary based on specific circumstances, and you should seek professional advice.c) GST Rate and Payment: If GST is applicable, the rate can vary depending on the nature of the services provided. GST rates may include 18% or 12% for certain services. The specific rate should be determined based on the type of repair services provided. GST is generally payable on a monthly or quarterly basis.d) Offset of GST: If you are required to levy GST, you may be eligible to claim input tax credit (ITC) on GST paid for expenses related to the repair and maintenance work. This can include goods and services used for the repair project.

    "question": "How to evict tenants who are in possession of my property",
    "answer": "1. you can certainly file an eviction suit against the grandchildren on the grounds of arrears of rent, non-user and possession required for immediate demolition2. the rent is in arrears since 2015, so i fear that, that claim may have become time barred. however the other grounds like non-user and possession needed for immediate demolition are certainly there3. for claiming arrears of rent, you will have to issue a statutory notice u/s 15 of the Maharashtra rent control act. Even if the rent is cleared upon receiving the notice, you can still sue them for not paying rent on time. The landlord should not be made to issue a legal notice everytime to the tenant for payment of rent. It should not be that only on receiving the legal notice the tenant pays the rent. This would become onerous for the landlord. So even if the rent arrears are cleared, you can still seek their eviction as the tenant was never ready and willing to pay rent on time and only on being served with the legal notice, he paid the rent. So such a tenant has no right to continue to occupy the premises. This is because the landlord also has to pay the outgoings of the building like property tax etc. And some landlords are dependent on the rental income for their sustenance. Though a rent of Rs. 27/- in today's time is even less than pittance.4. the corporation cannot raise their hands by saying that it will not demolish the building because there are occupants in the building. This is no answer. The corporation owes a duty to the general public and the passers by who could be injured if the building suddenly collapses. So if the corporation is not demolishing the building then you will have to approach the High Court. Also there are judgments which have held that just because the building is demolished, the rights of the tenants/occupants are not obliterated and they are infact preserved and unaffected.5. the grandchildren would be the statutory tenants by virtue of the definition of tenant given in the rent act in s.7(15)(d). So even if the original contractual tenant dies, the tenancy right survives to his family member or legal heir who would then become the statutory tenant under the rent actYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Dear Client,As per the fact of the case tenant is not paying the rent for 8-9 year ,it can be taken as a ground for evicting the tenant from the house.After establishing the grounds for the eviction, the following procedure needs to be followed:Stage I -Send a Notice to the Tenant to Vacate:An eviction notice needs to be filed in a court under the appropriate jurisdiction mentioning the reason for eviction and the time and date by which the tenant has to vacate the property and is then sent to the tenant to vacate the rental property. The landlord must give a reasonable time to the tenant to vacate the rented property. In the majority of cases, the tenants leave the rented premises after receiving a legal notice from the court.Stage II - File an Eviction Suit:The tenant may refuse to vacate the rented property after receiving the court’s eviction notice and contest the eviction. In this case, the landlord can hire a rental property lawyer to file an eviction suit against the tenant. The suit for eviction of the tenant is filed in a civil court under whose jurisdiction the rented property is situated.Stage III - Final Eviction Notice:The court hears both sides and issues a final legal notice for eviction for the tenant based on the arguments and evidence present. The tenant has to vacate the rented property once the court sends the final eviction notice.Thank YouAyantika MondalAdvocate, Bangalore27 Answers9 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ayantika Mondal"

If they pay the outstanding rent along with interest, it may reset the legal situation. However, this doesn't automatically end the tenancy.Tenancy after Original Tenant's Death: In many cases, the tenancy can continue even after the original tenant's death, especially if there is a family member residing in the property. However, this can vary depending on state-specific rent control laws.Dilapidated Structure: If the building is declared dilapidated and uninhabitable, it's essential to follow the proper legal process for eviction. You may need to obtain the necessary permissions and orders from the relevant authority for demolition or repair.Non-Occupancy: If the tenants have not been living in the property for an extended period, it may be possible to argue that they have abandoned the property. However, this should be done legally to avoid any potential claims from the tenants.Corporation's Role: If the corporation is not willing to interfere in the matter, you should focus on following the legal process for eviction as per the existing laws.

    "question": "Unregistered GPA (buyer) and sale deed",
    "answer": "Dear client,   In India, it's generally advisable to have the power of attorney (GPA) for buyers registered. While a GPA may only be a signing authority, registering it adds legal validity and authenticity to the document. The Supreme Court's judgment in 2011 emphasized the importance of registering GPAs to avoid disputes. So, it would be best for Mr. X and Mrs. Y to consider registering their GPA.Typographical Error in Sale Deed: The misspelling of names in a sale deed can be corrected through a correction deed. This would help ensure that the property title reflects the correct names of the buyers.New Buyer's Concerns: If a new buyer is interested in the property, they may still have concerns about the unregistered GPA for Mr. POA_Buyer. To address this, Mr. X and Mrs. Y could consider executing a correction deed that includes the spelling correction and explicitly states that the unregistered GPA is valid and authorized by them. This correction deed should be registered to make it legally binding.Legal Complexity: The third opinion suggests that the issue is too complex and not recommended for new buyers. While this is a cautious approach, it may not be necessary if the correct legal procedures are followed to rectify the situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Unregistered GPA (buyer) and sale deed",
    "answer": "Property transferred to X & Y through unregistered GPA is perfectly valid. Only validation is required by DR on notarized GPA from abroad on payment of validation fee of 1K. registration is not required. You can get it validated even now by payment of penalty of 10K under Stamps Act.Under Registration Act only a notary on GPA from abroad is required. Your buyer is traying to reduce the price by claiming that unregistered is not valid. Refer to Section 33.Typo mistake in sale deed can be corrected by execution of rectification deed. Stamp duty for rectification deed is 100.There is no any legal problem in sale deed in favour of X & Y. There are only minor technical problems. Buyer is creating problems to reduce the price.Ravi ShindeAdvocate, Hyderabad4923 Answers42 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ravi Shinde"

    "context": "Asked 3 years ago in Property Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Legal heir",
    "answer": "Dear client,1. The transfer of Rs.10,00,000 from your father to you, even if it's being done via cheque, can be construed in different ways by tax authorities. If this transaction is being classified as repayment of a loan, it wouldn't be considered as income. In this scenario, the money you gave your father over the years would be treated as a loan, and the repayment would not attract any tax liability. Second scenario is If authorities view this transfer as a gift from your father, it might not be taxable either, as gifts from relatives are generally not taxed in India. If the total amount received as a gift exceeds Rs.50,000 in a financial year, it's taxable as 'income from other sources', except in specific exempted cases (gift from relatives being one such exemption).To ensure that the transaction is perceived as either a gift or a loan repayment, you can take certain steps. If the initial transfer of Rs.10,00,000 was intended as a loan, ensure you have documentation supporting this. Any written agreement or record of the transactions (bank statements, transfer receipts, or any written acknowledgment of the loan) can help establish that it wasn't a gift but a loan extended to your father. When your father repays the Rs.10,00,000, ensure there's documentation acknowledging this repayment. This could be a simple agreement or a receipt stating that the amount has been repaid by your father to you as per the terms of the loan agreement. If there were any discussions, emails, or messages regarding the nature of the transaction (loan or gift), keep these records safe. They can serve as evidence if needed to establish the intention behind the transfer. Seek advice from a tax consultant or a chartered accountant. They can review the documentation, understand the specifics of your situation, and provide guidance on how to present the transaction to tax authorities to ensure it's treated as a loan repayment or a gift, whichever is applicable and more advantageous for you tax-wise.2. If the agreement is for your father to repay you Rs.10,00,000 without interest, requesting him to issue multiple cheques totaling Rs.10,00,000 but with amounts less than Rs.1,00,000 each could be seen as an attempt to avoid certain banking and tax regulations. In India, banks report transactions of Rs.10,00,000 or more to the Income Tax Department. Splitting the repayment into smaller amounts to avoid this reporting threshold might raise suspicions and could be seen as an attempt to avoid tax scrutiny. It's important to be transparent in financial dealings, especially when dealing with significant amounts. Instead of trying to structure the repayment in a way that raises questions, focus on documenting the repayment properly with a clear acknowledgment that the Rs.10,00,000 received is the repayment of the loan. Proper documentation and transparency in the transaction will support your case if there are any inquiries from tax authorities.3. Ensure the abovementioned documentations and communications.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "1. The 2005 Amendment amended Section 6 of theHindu Succession Actof 1956 and eradicated the age-old discriminatory practice of keeping women out of the coparcenary inheritance system. So now a daughter has equal or the same rights/share in the property as the son.2. The jewelry or any other gifts that your parents gave to your sister during her wedding are considered as her 'Streedhan'. They would not be considered as a share from the property because as per the law, every Hindu woman has full ownership right over any moveable or immovable property she possesses through :InheritancePartitionStreedhanGift from any relative or non-relativeOwn skill or exertionPurchase or prescription, etc.3. Due to the abovementioned points in Para 2, your sister's status would not be considered when distributing the property.4. As per the law, your financial condition would not be considered for distribution of property and therefore would not make you automatically eligible for a higher share.5. Your mother may draft the WILL herself as well, as there is no legal compulsion that a WILL has to be drafted by a lawyer only. But if she feels the need, it is advisable to consult an advocate as they would be able to guide her about the legalities and the finer points.6. Make sure to get the WILL registered as an unregistered WILL might lead to legal hassles in future.NOTE : The above-mentioned points are matters of law in case a person passes away intestate i.e. without making a WILL. But any person including your mother is free to distribute his/her property as per his/her choice and does not have to necessarily distribute his/her property equally amongst all legal heirs. A WILL supersedes and overrides any other law or formula of property distribution. So all the questions that you have asked would not be applicable after your mother makes her WILL and gets it registered.Indu VermaAdvocate, Chandigarh71 Answers8 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Indu Verma"

Given the fact that genuine family arrangements/settlements are outside the purview of taxation, this mode of dispute resolution has gained popularity over a period. Civil proceedings in a court are not only time consuming but also a costly affair and therefore family settlements should be a preferred choice for dispute resolution amongst families.

    "answer": "Dear client,The right procedure to transfer the property without attracting long-term capital gains taxes by the Income Tax department can be complex, and it's essential to consider both the legal and financial aspects.Gift Deed: If the property was received in a family settlement, you may consider executing a gift deed from your name to the family members who should have legal ownership. While gift deeds are generally subject to income tax, if the property was acquired through a family settlement, there may be specific exemptions. Consult with your CA to understand the tax implications fully.Sale Deed: You can sell the property to the family members at a fair market value. Ensure that the sale price is reasonable to avoid any disputes with tax authorities. The tax implications will depend on the difference between the purchase price and the sale price.Family Settlement: If the property was initially received through a family settlement, another family settlement might be considered, but this can be legally complex. Consult with a lawyer to assess the feasibility of this option.Gift Tax Rules: Keep in mind that there are provisions under the Income Tax Act related to gift tax, and you should understand how these apply in your specific case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Unregistered GPA (buyer) and sale deed",
    "answer": "Dear client,   In India, it's generally advisable to have the power of attorney (GPA) for buyers registered. While a GPA may only be a signing authority, registering it adds legal validity and authenticity to the document. The Supreme Court's judgment in 2011 emphasized the importance of registering GPAs to avoid disputes. So, it would be best for Mr. X and Mrs. Y to consider registering their GPA.Typographical Error in Sale Deed: The misspelling of names in a sale deed can be corrected through a correction deed. This would help ensure that the property title reflects the correct names of the buyers.New Buyer's Concerns: If a new buyer is interested in the property, they may still have concerns about the unregistered GPA for Mr. POA_Buyer. To address this, Mr. X and Mrs. Y could consider executing a correction deed that includes the spelling correction and explicitly states that the unregistered GPA is valid and authorized by them. This correction deed should be registered to make it legally binding.Legal Complexity: The third opinion suggests that the issue is too complex and not recommended for new buyers. While this is a cautious approach, it may not be necessary if the correct legal procedures are followed to rectify the situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Inheritance of property from an Indian citizen by an American citizen with OCI status",
    "answer": "When it comes to inheritance of property in India by a foreign national or a person of Indian origin, there are specific regulations and restrictions under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) and other laws. I'll address your queries step by step:Ownership by OCI: An Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) can inherit any immovable property in India, be it agricultural, residential, or commercial. However, while you can inherit and own agricultural land, you cannot purchase it directly. In your case, since you are inheriting it through a will, it's permissible.Will & Its Contestability: Your father's cousin can absolutely will his property to you. Having a well-drafted and registered will would strengthen the legitimacy of the transfer. But, like in many jurisdictions, a will can be contested in India. Common grounds for contesting include:The testator (person creating the will) was not of sound mind when the will was created.The will was made under duress or undue influence.The will is forged or tampered with.The testator did not follow the proper procedure in drafting or executing the will.Given the familial relationship and the fact that your father's cousin has children and grandchildren, there's a likelihood they may contest the will, especially if they feel they have been unfairly excluded.Chances in Court: It's hard to predict outcomes in legal cases since they depend heavily on the specifics. But if the will is drafted correctly, clearly specifies the intentions of your father's cousin, and if it can be established that he was of sound mind and not under undue influence when making the will, the chances of it being upheld are better. It would also be helpful if there are witnesses (preferably neutral parties) to the will's execution.Mortgaging the Property: This is a complex strategy and might not provide the security you're hoping for. If your father's cousin mortgages the property to you (with you acting as the lender), and his heirs later successfully contest the will, they'd inherit the property subject to the mortgage. This doesn't necessarily mean they would have to repay the mortgage immediately. Also, creating a mortgage for this purpose might be seen as an attempt to circumvent the law, which can have its own complications.Precautionary Measures:Ensure the will is drafted by an experienced attorney and the reasons for bequeathing the property to you are clearly laid out.It might also be a good idea for your father's cousin to discuss his intentions with his immediate family to mitigate any surprises and potential disputes later on.Consider the option of a \"testamentary trust\" where the property is held in trust with specific instructions on its use, disposal, or management.Finally, given the complexities involved, it's highly recommended you consult with a property lawyer who can provide guidance tailored to the specific circumstances.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "- As per law, an OCI can inherit any immovable property in India, whether it is residential or commercial or an agricultural land or a farmhouse.- Hence, your fathers cousin being the owner of a self acquired property can registered a Will in your name without getting consent of any of other family members- No other family members are entitled to get the share in that property , and hence they cannot challenge that will- The said inherited property cannot be mortgaged as the Will can only be executed after demise of him."

    "answer": "1. a person can make a bequest of his property to any person of his choice by his Will2. it is not necessary that the beneficiary in the Will have to be the legal heirs of the person3. so the person can make a bequest even in favour of a foreigner4. if the person has already given some properties in his lifetime to his children/grandchildren, then that factum ought to be mentioned in the Will to justify the exclusion of the children/grandchildren from the Will and to avert any possibility of the Will being challenged on the ground that it is unnatural since it unjustly excludes the legal heirs5. the Will is not required to be registered under the law. Even if it is registered, the formal proof of due execution of the Will would still have to be discharged by the person who relies on such Will or who propounds such Will. Registering the Will does not give it any more legitimacy than when the Will would be unregistered. So registration not being the requirement of law, can be skipped completely6. asking questions like - what are the chances of the heirs winning - is completely illogical since that cannot be predicted by an advocate. What if the advocate says that there is no chance of the heirs winning, but the heirs in fact win the case? In that case will you hold the advocate responsible? Predicting is the job of an astrologer and not of an advocate.7. mortgaging the property with the proposed legatee will not serve any purpose. In fact it will backfire. So it will be a futile exercise.8. the Will can be made in any language known to the testator. It has to be signed by the testator in front of 2 witnesses. It is not necessary that both the witnesses are present together at the time the testator signs his Will. The requirement is that the witness must have seen the testator sign his Will in the presence of the witness.9. the witnesses can also be any person who know the testator and who can depose and testify that when he testator signed his Will he was in a sound and disposing state of mind10. attaching a doctor's certificate to the Will to show that the testator has a sound state of mind, is completely optional and is not a requirement under the lawYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Protection against false cases by wife to claim husband's property",
    "answer": "There are some situations where your future wife may be able to claim your property if you get married under Muslim Marriage Act. These situations include:If you desert her or treat her with cruelty or neglect, she can file a suit forrestitution of conjugal rightsor judicial separation and claim maintenance and a share in your property as per Section 4 of the Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act, 1939.If you convert to another religion, she can file a suit for dissolution of marriage and claim maintenance and a share in your property as per Section 4 of the Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act, 1939.If you die intestate (without leaving a will), she can inherit a share in your property as per the rules of succession under Muslim law.Therefore, you may want to take some precautions to protect yourself against any false cases or claims by your future wife. Some possible precautions are:Transfer your properties in the name of your parents before getting married. This may prevent your future wife from claiming any right or interest in them. However, this may not be foolproof, as she may still challenge the validity or genuineness of the transfer and allege that it was done to defraud her or defeat her rights. She may also claim that you have retained some beneficial interest or control over the properties even after transferring them to your parents.Get your father to legally disown you after transferring the properties to him. This may sever your legal relationship with him and make you ineligible to inherit his property. However, this may not be effective either, as disowning is not recognized by law as a valid mode of disinheriting an heir. Your father may still change his mind and revoke his decision to disown you or make a will in your favour. Moreover, disowning may have other adverse consequences for you, such as losing your right to maintenance or family pension from your father.Make a prenuptial agreement with your future wife before getting married. A prenuptial agreement is a contract between two prospective spouses that specifies their rights and obligations regarding their property, finances, maintenance, divorce, etc. A prenuptial agreement may help you to safeguard your properties from any false claims or disputes by your future wife. However, you should be aware that prenuptial agreements are not very common or popular in India and their legal validity and enforceability are still uncertain and debatable.Therefore, none of these precautions may guarantee complete protection against false cases by your future wife to claim your property.

    "question": "Partition suit pending for final decree",
    "answer": "In a partition case, a preliminary decree is followed by a final decree that divides the property among co-owners. Your preliminary decree, issued in 2018, granted you a 4/7th (57.15%) share, while the other six co-owners received 7.15% each. However, you've observed construction activities on the property by co-owners holding a collective 42.85% share. You obtained a court-issued stay order, restraining further construction, and have informed the police and municipal authorities. You're located in Chennai, while the property is in Rajasthan, around 2500 km away. You have several questions:Impact of Present Construction:Allowing the ongoing construction could potentially harm your interests, as the new structure's valuation may affect the property's auction price.Property's Status Quo:You mentioned that the property has existed for more than 64 years, implying that the superstructure has fully depreciated. However, the concept of status quo pertains to the property's current physical condition and legal standing, which can change over time due to various factors.Lack of Objections by Co-Owners:Your notice about the construction did not receive objections or attempts to halt it from other co-owners. This, in your view, suggests their complicity in the ongoing construction.Demarcation Challenges:If metes and bounds demarcation of the property isn't feasible, auction may be the only viable solution.Online Case Contestation from Chennai:Whether you can contest the case online from Chennai depends on the nature of your case and the court's available online facilities. E-filing and virtual courts are potential options for online case participation. You'll need to check with the specific court where your case is pending to determine if these options are available.Overall, your concerns are valid, especially regarding the potential impact of the construction on the property's valuation and the need to proceed with an auction.

    "answer": "Here are some responses to your questions:Challenge to Construction Activities: You've already taken a positive step by obtaining a stay order to prevent further construction. If you believe that allowing the construction would prejudice your interests, it's essential to continue pursuing this matter in court. Your lawyer can file an application for permanent injunction or any other appropriate legal remedy to prevent construction that may affect the valuation of the property.Status Quo of Property: The existing status quo of the property can be an important factor in partition cases. You should document and present evidence in court to support your argument regarding the depreciated superstructure.Notice to Co-Owners: The fact that you issued a notice and the co-owners did not object to the ongoing construction may be relevant in court. Your lawyer can use this as evidence to establish that they were aware of the construction activities.Property Demarcation and Auction: If demarcation of the property is not feasible, and if you believe that a fair division cannot be achieved, you can request the court to order the sale of the property and distribute the proceeds among the co-owners as per their shares. Your lawyer can file a partition suit for the sale of the property.Contesting the Case Online: Courts in India have increasingly started using online platforms for case management and hearings. Depending on the specific court and its procedures, it may be possible to participate in the case online from Chennai.

Your lawyer can file an application for permanent injunction or any other appropriate legal remedy to prevent construction that may affect the valuation of the property.Status Quo of Property: The existing status quo of the property can be an important factor in partition cases. You should document and present evidence in court to support your argument regarding the depreciated superstructure.Notice to Co-Owners: The fact that you issued a notice and the co-owners did not object to the ongoing construction may be relevant in court. Your lawyer can use this as evidence to establish that they were aware of the construction activities.Property Demarcation and Auction: If demarcation of the property is not feasible, and if you believe that a fair division cannot be achieved, you can request the court to order the sale of the property and distribute the proceeds among the co-owners as per their shares. Your lawyer can file a partition suit for the sale of the property.Contesting the Case Online: Courts in India have increasingly started using online platforms for case management and hearings.

    "question": "Unregistered GPA (buyer) and sale deed",
    "answer": "Dear client,   In India, it's generally advisable to have the power of attorney (GPA) for buyers registered. While a GPA may only be a signing authority, registering it adds legal validity and authenticity to the document. The Supreme Court's judgment in 2011 emphasized the importance of registering GPAs to avoid disputes. So, it would be best for Mr. X and Mrs. Y to consider registering their GPA.Typographical Error in Sale Deed: The misspelling of names in a sale deed can be corrected through a correction deed. This would help ensure that the property title reflects the correct names of the buyers.New Buyer's Concerns: If a new buyer is interested in the property, they may still have concerns about the unregistered GPA for Mr. POA_Buyer. To address this, Mr. X and Mrs. Y could consider executing a correction deed that includes the spelling correction and explicitly states that the unregistered GPA is valid and authorized by them. This correction deed should be registered to make it legally binding.Legal Complexity: The third opinion suggests that the issue is too complex and not recommended for new buyers. While this is a cautious approach, it may not be necessary if the correct legal procedures are followed to rectify the situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Unregistered GPA (buyer) and sale deed",
    "answer": "Unregistered GPA of the Buyer (Mr. X and Mrs. Y): In many jurisdictions, a Power of Attorney (GPA) for the buyer does not necessarily need to be registered if it is only used for the signing authority and not for transferring property ownership.Typographical Error in Sale Deed: If there is a typographical error in the sale deed, you can consider executing a correction deed (also known as Rectification Deed) to rectify the error.

You are aware that, withdrawal is time taking process. She will insist on payment 9L before filing for withdrawal and meanwhile she can anytime turn back. High Court  cannot direct any party to withdraw cases even if there is agreement or order from Court. Your best option is to fight out cases with her on merit. Now you are on bail, it is difficult for her to get the bail cancelled.

    "question": "Asset under partnership",
    "answer": "1) The Supreme Court held that property belonging to the partners or any one of them is incapable of being deemed as a partnership property, merely of being used for business purposes, and thus cannot be deemed as partnership properties.2) Section 14 of the Partnership Act, 1932 expressly declares that property exclusively belonging to a person, on his entering into partnership with others,does not become a property of the partnership merely because it is used for the business of the partnership, in the absence of an agreement to the contrary.3) partnership firm does not have a separate legal identity,different from the partners.It cannot sell or purchase property in its own name.4) When a partner pools his asset with partnership assets by contributing such asset as capital of the firm, it becomes the property of the firm under section 14 of The Partnership Act by operation of law without the formality of the conveyance. Where an immovable property is contributed as capital by the partner crediting his capital account and debiting his asset account, such pooling would convert the proprietary property as firm’s property by operation of the partnership law, though it is not registered because there is no conveyance requiring registration.5) no written or registered document is necessary for an individual to contribute any land or immovable property as a contribution against his share of the capital of a new partnership business6) as far as clauses in partnership deed are concerned you would have share in said properties only if it was contributed as capital by the partner in the partnership firm7) get partnership deed drafted by local lawyerAjay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "answer": "1. The 2005 Amendment amended Section 6 of theHindu Succession Actof 1956 and eradicated the age-old discriminatory practice of keeping women out of the coparcenary inheritance system. So now a daughter has equal or the same rights/share in the property as the son.2. The jewelry or any other gifts that your parents gave to your sister during her wedding are considered as her 'Streedhan'. They would not be considered as a share from the property because as per the law, every Hindu woman has full ownership right over any moveable or immovable property she possesses through :InheritancePartitionStreedhanGift from any relative or non-relativeOwn skill or exertionPurchase or prescription, etc.3. Due to the abovementioned points in Para 2, your sister's status would not be considered when distributing the property.4. As per the law, your financial condition would not be considered for distribution of property and therefore would not make you automatically eligible for a higher share.5. Your mother may draft the WILL herself as well, as there is no legal compulsion that a WILL has to be drafted by a lawyer only. But if she feels the need, it is advisable to consult an advocate as they would be able to guide her about the legalities and the finer points.6. Make sure to get the WILL registered as an unregistered WILL might lead to legal hassles in future.NOTE : The above-mentioned points are matters of law in case a person passes away intestate i.e. without making a WILL. But any person including your mother is free to distribute his/her property as per his/her choice and does not have to necessarily distribute his/her property equally amongst all legal heirs. A WILL supersedes and overrides any other law or formula of property distribution. So all the questions that you have asked would not be applicable after your mother makes her WILL and gets it registered.Indu VermaAdvocate, Chandigarh71 Answers8 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Indu Verma"

    "question": "How to evict tenants who are in possession of my property",
    "answer": "1. you can certainly file an eviction suit against the grandchildren on the grounds of arrears of rent, non-user and possession required for immediate demolition2. the rent is in arrears since 2015, so i fear that, that claim may have become time barred. however the other grounds like non-user and possession needed for immediate demolition are certainly there3. for claiming arrears of rent, you will have to issue a statutory notice u/s 15 of the Maharashtra rent control act. Even if the rent is cleared upon receiving the notice, you can still sue them for not paying rent on time. The landlord should not be made to issue a legal notice everytime to the tenant for payment of rent. It should not be that only on receiving the legal notice the tenant pays the rent. This would become onerous for the landlord. So even if the rent arrears are cleared, you can still seek their eviction as the tenant was never ready and willing to pay rent on time and only on being served with the legal notice, he paid the rent. So such a tenant has no right to continue to occupy the premises. This is because the landlord also has to pay the outgoings of the building like property tax etc. And some landlords are dependent on the rental income for their sustenance. Though a rent of Rs. 27/- in today's time is even less than pittance.4. the corporation cannot raise their hands by saying that it will not demolish the building because there are occupants in the building. This is no answer. The corporation owes a duty to the general public and the passers by who could be injured if the building suddenly collapses. So if the corporation is not demolishing the building then you will have to approach the High Court. Also there are judgments which have held that just because the building is demolished, the rights of the tenants/occupants are not obliterated and they are infact preserved and unaffected.5. the grandchildren would be the statutory tenants by virtue of the definition of tenant given in the rent act in s.7(15)(d). So even if the original contractual tenant dies, the tenancy right survives to his family member or legal heir who would then become the statutory tenant under the rent actYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "How to evict tenants who are in possession of my property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,As per the fact of the case tenant is not paying the rent for 8-9 year ,it can be taken as a ground for evicting the tenant from the house.After establishing the grounds for the eviction, the following procedure needs to be followed:Stage I -Send a Notice to the Tenant to Vacate:An eviction notice needs to be filed in a court under the appropriate jurisdiction mentioning the reason for eviction and the time and date by which the tenant has to vacate the property and is then sent to the tenant to vacate the rental property. The landlord must give a reasonable time to the tenant to vacate the rented property. In the majority of cases, the tenants leave the rented premises after receiving a legal notice from the court.Stage II - File an Eviction Suit:The tenant may refuse to vacate the rented property after receiving the court’s eviction notice and contest the eviction. In this case, the landlord can hire a rental property lawyer to file an eviction suit against the tenant. The suit for eviction of the tenant is filed in a civil court under whose jurisdiction the rented property is situated.Stage III - Final Eviction Notice:The court hears both sides and issues a final legal notice for eviction for the tenant based on the arguments and evidence present. The tenant has to vacate the rented property once the court sends the final eviction notice.Thank YouAyantika MondalAdvocate, Bangalore27 Answers9 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ayantika Mondal"

    "question": "How to evict tenants who are in possession of my property",
    "answer": "Rent Default: If the tenants have defaulted on rent payment for an extended period, you can send them a notice for rent arrears. If they pay the outstanding rent along with interest, it may reset the legal situation. However, this doesn't automatically end the tenancy.Tenancy after Original Tenant's Death: In many cases, the tenancy can continue even after the original tenant's death, especially if there is a family member residing in the property. However, this can vary depending on state-specific rent control laws.Dilapidated Structure: If the building is declared dilapidated and uninhabitable, it's essential to follow the proper legal process for eviction. You may need to obtain the necessary permissions and orders from the relevant authority for demolition or repair.Non-Occupancy: If the tenants have not been living in the property for an extended period, it may be possible to argue that they have abandoned the property. However, this should be done legally to avoid any potential claims from the tenants.Corporation's Role: If the corporation is not willing to interfere in the matter, you should focus on following the legal process for eviction as per the existing laws. It's essential to ensure that you adhere to all legal requirements to protect your rights as the landlord.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Unregistered GPA (buyer) and sale deed",
    "answer": "Dear client,   In India, it's generally advisable to have the power of attorney (GPA) for buyers registered. While a GPA may only be a signing authority, registering it adds legal validity and authenticity to the document. The Supreme Court's judgment in 2011 emphasized the importance of registering GPAs to avoid disputes. So, it would be best for Mr. X and Mrs. Y to consider registering their GPA.Typographical Error in Sale Deed: The misspelling of names in a sale deed can be corrected through a correction deed. This would help ensure that the property title reflects the correct names of the buyers.New Buyer's Concerns: If a new buyer is interested in the property, they may still have concerns about the unregistered GPA for Mr. POA_Buyer. To address this, Mr. X and Mrs. Y could consider executing a correction deed that includes the spelling correction and explicitly states that the unregistered GPA is valid and authorized by them. This correction deed should be registered to make it legally binding.Legal Complexity: The third opinion suggests that the issue is too complex and not recommended for new buyers. While this is a cautious approach, it may not be necessary if the correct legal procedures are followed to rectify the situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Division and transfer of property to children",
    "answer": "1. The 2005 Amendment amended Section 6 of theHindu Succession Actof 1956 and eradicated the age-old discriminatory practice of keeping women out of the coparcenary inheritance system. So now a daughter has equal or the same rights/share in the property as the son.2. The jewelry or any other gifts that your parents gave to your sister during her wedding are considered as her 'Streedhan'. They would not be considered as a share from the property because as per the law, every Hindu woman has full ownership right over any moveable or immovable property she possesses through :InheritancePartitionStreedhanGift from any relative or non-relativeOwn skill or exertionPurchase or prescription, etc.3. Due to the abovementioned points in Para 2, your sister's status would not be considered when distributing the property.4. As per the law, your financial condition would not be considered for distribution of property and therefore would not make you automatically eligible for a higher share.5. Your mother may draft the WILL herself as well, as there is no legal compulsion that a WILL has to be drafted by a lawyer only. But if she feels the need, it is advisable to consult an advocate as they would be able to guide her about the legalities and the finer points.6. Make sure to get the WILL registered as an unregistered WILL might lead to legal hassles in future.NOTE : The above-mentioned points are matters of law in case a person passes away intestate i.e. without making a WILL. But any person including your mother is free to distribute his/her property as per his/her choice and does not have to necessarily distribute his/her property equally amongst all legal heirs. A WILL supersedes and overrides any other law or formula of property distribution. So all the questions that you have asked would not be applicable after your mother makes her WILL and gets it registered.Indu VermaAdvocate, Chandigarh71 Answers8 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Indu Verma"

    "question": "How to evict tenants who are in possession of my property",
    "answer": "1. you can certainly file an eviction suit against the grandchildren on the grounds of arrears of rent, non-user and possession required for immediate demolition2. the rent is in arrears since 2015, so i fear that, that claim may have become time barred. however the other grounds like non-user and possession needed for immediate demolition are certainly there3. for claiming arrears of rent, you will have to issue a statutory notice u/s 15 of the Maharashtra rent control act. Even if the rent is cleared upon receiving the notice, you can still sue them for not paying rent on time. The landlord should not be made to issue a legal notice everytime to the tenant for payment of rent. It should not be that only on receiving the legal notice the tenant pays the rent. This would become onerous for the landlord. So even if the rent arrears are cleared, you can still seek their eviction as the tenant was never ready and willing to pay rent on time and only on being served with the legal notice, he paid the rent. So such a tenant has no right to continue to occupy the premises. This is because the landlord also has to pay the outgoings of the building like property tax etc. And some landlords are dependent on the rental income for their sustenance. Though a rent of Rs. 27/- in today's time is even less than pittance.4. the corporation cannot raise their hands by saying that it will not demolish the building because there are occupants in the building. This is no answer. The corporation owes a duty to the general public and the passers by who could be injured if the building suddenly collapses. So if the corporation is not demolishing the building then you will have to approach the High Court. Also there are judgments which have held that just because the building is demolished, the rights of the tenants/occupants are not obliterated and they are infact preserved and unaffected.5. the grandchildren would be the statutory tenants by virtue of the definition of tenant given in the rent act in s.7(15)(d). So even if the original contractual tenant dies, the tenancy right survives to his family member or legal heir who would then become the statutory tenant under the rent actYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

In this case, the landlord can hire a rental property lawyer to file an eviction suit against the tenant. The suit for eviction of the tenant is filed in a civil court under whose jurisdiction the rented property is situated.Stage III - Final Eviction Notice:The court hears both sides and issues a final legal notice for eviction for the tenant based on the arguments and evidence present.

However, this doesn't automatically end the tenancy.Tenancy after Original Tenant's Death: In many cases, the tenancy can continue even after the original tenant's death, especially if there is a family member residing in the property. However, this can vary depending on state-specific rent control laws.Dilapidated Structure: If the building is declared dilapidated and uninhabitable, it's essential to follow the proper legal process for eviction. You may need to obtain the necessary permissions and orders from the relevant authority for demolition or repair.Non-Occupancy: If the tenants have not been living in the property for an extended period, it may be possible to argue that they have abandoned the property. However, this should be done legally to avoid any potential claims from the tenants.Corporation's Role: If the corporation is not willing to interfere in the matter, you should focus on following the legal process for eviction as per the existing laws.

However, if you have custody and visiting rights mentioned in the divorce decree, it should be sufficient.Language of Divorce Decree:If your divorce decree is in Hindi, you should get it translated into English. You can consult a certified translator or approach the family court where the decree was issued to provide a translated version.Impact of Ex-Wife's Name Change:If your ex-wife has changed her name and is reissuing her passport, it may not directly impact your son's passport renewal. However, make sure that all the documents and information provided in your son's passport application are consistent with the details mentioned in the divorce decree and other legal documents.Foreign Travel:Traveling with your son using his new surname in his passport and your old surname in your passport should be fine as long as you have the necessary legal documents to prove your relationship and custody.It's essential to consult the official website of the Passport Seva Kendra or contact them directly to get the most up-to-date and accurate information about the specific requirements and procedures for renewing a minor's passport, given your circumstances.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The builder is also bound by law to return the money collected from buyers within 45 days, after deducting the booking amountIn your case, it seems that the builder has violated the terms of the booking form and the sales agreement, which clearly stated the payment plan and the deal structure agreed by both parties. The builder cannot demand 20% of the payment within 21 days of booking, when you have already paid 12.5% as per the mutual agreement. The builder also cannot cancel the allotment without giving you a valid reason and a notice. The builder’s actions seem to be arbitrary and unfair, and may amount to deficiency of service and breach of contract.You have the right to challenge the cancellation of the allotment and seek refund of your money with interest and compensation. You can send a legal notice to the builder, demanding them to honour the agreement and restore your allotment, or to refund your money with interest and compensation.

The final decree will specify how the land is to be divided.If one of the brothers objects to the partition plans proposed by the collector, it may cause delays. However, the court's final decree should provide a clear plan for division, and objections might need to be addressed through legal means.The division by the collector should provide separate 7/12 documents for each brother, indicating their individual ownership shares.The timeline for the collector to divide the land can vary.

    "question": "Online marriage",
    "answer": "According to the Indian law, a marriage can be registered under either of the two Marriage Acts: theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 or theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954. TheHindu Marriage Actis applicable to Hindus, whereas theSpecial Marriage Actis applicable to all citizens of India irrespective of their religion. The Supreme Court of India has held that marriages of Indians solemnized in foreign countries are valid in India if they are performed according to the law of that country.online marriages, also known as virtual marriages or e-marriages, were not widely recognized in India. In India, marriage is primarily governed by personal laws based on one's religion, and the process of solemnizing a marriage typically involves physical presence before the marriage registrar or religious authority, along with the fulfillment of certain legal requirements. However, it's important to note that laws and regulations can change over time, and there may have been developments or changes in Indian marriage laws since my last update. Additionally, the recognition of online marriages can vary from one Indian state or union territory to another, as some states may have different interpretations or policies regarding such marriages.Therefore, if you and your fiance are planning to get married online through a platform called courtley, which provides a valid marriage certificate issued by USA government authorities, you may not be able to use it as a proof of your marital status in India. You may have to register your marriage in India under theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, which allows for marriages between Indian citizens and foreign nationals. You may also have to get an apostille stamp on your USA marriage certificate, which is a form of authentication issued by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) for documents that are intended for use in Hague Convention countries. An apostille stamp verifies the authenticity of your document and makes it acceptable in other countries.To register your marriage in India, you may have to follow these steps:Fill an online application form on the website of the Registrar General of Marriages.Submit the required documents, such as passport copies, visa copies, birth certificates, address proofs, photographs, etc.Pay the prescribed fee online or offline.Book an appointment for verification and registration at the nearest marriage office.Appear before the marriage officer along with your fiance and two witnesses on the appointed date and time.Sign the declaration form and receive your marriage certificate.To get an apostille stamp on your USA marriage certificate, you may have to follow these steps:Get your USA marriage certificate authenticated by the Secretary of State of the state where it was issued.Send your authenticated USA marriage certificate along with a photocopy of your passport and a self-addressed envelope to the MEA Branch Secretariat in New Delhi or any other city where it is located.Pay the prescribed fee online or offline.Receive your apostilled USA marriage certificate by mail or courier.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

Here are some key points to consider:Validity of Foreign Marriage Certificates: In India, foreign marriage certificates are generally recognized if they are issued by competent authorities in the foreign country and are in compliance with Indian laws.Apostille Stamp: To use a foreign marriage certificate in India, it may need to be apostilled. An apostille is a form of authentication that verifies the legitimacy of the document for use in a foreign country. The requirement for an apostille can vary depending on the state or Union Territory in India, so it's advisable to check with the local authorities in the specific location where you intend to use the certificate.Specific Indian Laws: India has its own set of laws governing marriage, and the recognition of a foreign marriage certificate may also depend on the specific circumstances and legal requirements.

    "question": "Sale deed using POA of Deceased Person",
    "answer": "According to the Supreme Court of India, a power of attorney (PoA) does not confer property title if a sale deed is not executed and registered to validate the PoA, and no action is taken by its holder. A PoA is merely a document that allows the principal to appoint another person as their agent, conferring authority on that agent to perform certain acts or functions on their behalf. A PoA is usually terminated when the principal dies or becomes incapacitated3.In your case, it seems that you executed a sale deed through a PoA of a deceased person, who was the land owner. This may not be a valid transaction, as the PoA would have become invalid after the death of the principal. The legal heirs of the deceased person would have inherited the property as per the law of succession. Therefore, you should have obtained the consent and signatures of all the legal heirs as sellers in the sale deed, not just as witnesses in the deed of confirmation. Their signature as mere witnesses would not suffice to transfer their rights and interests in the property.You may have to face legal challenges from the legal heir who wants to dispute the sale deed and demand extra money or share in land portion. You may have to prove that you acted in good faith and were not aware of the death of the donor at the time of executing the sale deed. You may also have to show that you paid a fair consideration for the property and that there was no fraud or coercion involved.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear client,In India, the sale of property through a power of attorney (POA) granted by a deceased person can be complex and may raise legal issues. Here are some points to consider:False Declaration: Making a false declaration about the donor (POA issuer) being alive during the sale deed registration is a legal issue. It may impact the validity of the sale deed.Legal Heirs' Confirmation: While you obtained a deed of confirmation from the legal heirs, it's essential to ensure the validity of this document. Their consent may not necessarily resolve the issue if there were discrepancies or misrepresentations in the original sale deed.Legal Action: If one of the legal heirs is challenging the sale deed, it's advisable to consult with a legal expert in India. They can provide specific advice based on the details of your case and the relevant property laws in your jurisdiction.Negotiation: If there's a dispute, it's often beneficial to explore negotiation and mediation options to resolve the matter without resorting to litigation.Document Review: Ensure that all documents, including the POA, sale deed, and the deed of confirmation, are thoroughly reviewed by a legal professional to assess their legality and validity.Legal Remedies: Consult an attorney to understand your legal rights and potential remedies.

    "question": "Bank has filed criminal case for loan default",
    "answer": "Loan default is generally a civil wrong, except in cases where there is fraudulent or dishonest intention on the part of the borrower at the time of availing the loan. The bank can file a civil suit against you for recovery of the loan amount, interest, and damages. The bank can also take possession of any collateral or security that you have pledged for the loan. However, the bank cannot file a criminal case against you for loan default, unless they can prove that you have cheated, misappropriated, or conspired to defraud them. The sections invoked by the bank are related to cheating, criminal breach of trust, cheating with knowledge of wrongful loss, cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property, cheating with intent to cause wrongful loss or wrongful gain, and criminal conspiracy. These are serious offences that can attract imprisonment and fine.However, it is possible that the bank is filing a false or frivolous criminal case against you to harass and intimidate you into paying the loan amount. This is an abuse of the process of law and a violation of your rights. You have the right to defend yourself against such false allegations and seek legal help.Here are some steps you can take to deal with this situation:Do not ignore the summon or warrant issued by the court. You must appear before the court on the date and time mentioned in the summon or warrant. If you fail to do so, you may be declared as an absconder or a proclaimed offender, which can worsen your situation.Seek legal advice from a lawyer who can guide you on how to deal with the criminal case and protect your rights and interests. You can also apply for anticipatory bail or regular bail if you are arrested or likely to be arrested.Challenge the jurisdiction of the court where the bank has filed the criminal case. If the court is in a different state 2000 km away from your and your business location, you can argue that it is inconvenient and unfair for you to attend the proceedings there. You can request the court to transfer the case to a court near your location or quash the case altogether.File a counter-complaint against the bank for filing a false and malicious criminal case against you. You can also file a complaint before the Banking Ombudsman or the Consumer Forum for redressal of your grievances. You can claim compensation for mental harassment, defamation, and violation of your rights.Negotiate with the bank for an amicable settlement of your loan account. You can explain your financial situation and offer to pay what you can afford. You can also request the bank to waive off some interest or penalty charges. You can seek the help of a mediator or a counsellor to facilitate the negotiation process.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "How to evict tenants who are in possession of my property",
    "answer": "1. you can certainly file an eviction suit against the grandchildren on the grounds of arrears of rent, non-user and possession required for immediate demolition2. the rent is in arrears since 2015, so i fear that, that claim may have become time barred. however the other grounds like non-user and possession needed for immediate demolition are certainly there3. for claiming arrears of rent, you will have to issue a statutory notice u/s 15 of the Maharashtra rent control act. Even if the rent is cleared upon receiving the notice, you can still sue them for not paying rent on time. The landlord should not be made to issue a legal notice everytime to the tenant for payment of rent. It should not be that only on receiving the legal notice the tenant pays the rent. This would become onerous for the landlord. So even if the rent arrears are cleared, you can still seek their eviction as the tenant was never ready and willing to pay rent on time and only on being served with the legal notice, he paid the rent. So such a tenant has no right to continue to occupy the premises. This is because the landlord also has to pay the outgoings of the building like property tax etc. And some landlords are dependent on the rental income for their sustenance. Though a rent of Rs. 27/- in today's time is even less than pittance.4. the corporation cannot raise their hands by saying that it will not demolish the building because there are occupants in the building. This is no answer. The corporation owes a duty to the general public and the passers by who could be injured if the building suddenly collapses. So if the corporation is not demolishing the building then you will have to approach the High Court. Also there are judgments which have held that just because the building is demolished, the rights of the tenants/occupants are not obliterated and they are infact preserved and unaffected.5. the grandchildren would be the statutory tenants by virtue of the definition of tenant given in the rent act in s.7(15)(d). So even if the original contractual tenant dies, the tenancy right survives to his family member or legal heir who would then become the statutory tenant under the rent actYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Dear Client,As per the fact of the case tenant is not paying the rent for 8-9 year ,it can be taken as a ground for evicting the tenant from the house.After establishing the grounds for the eviction, the following procedure needs to be followed:Stage I -Send a Notice to the Tenant to Vacate:An eviction notice needs to be filed in a court under the appropriate jurisdiction mentioning the reason for eviction and the time and date by which the tenant has to vacate the property and is then sent to the tenant to vacate the rental property. The landlord must give a reasonable time to the tenant to vacate the rented property. In the majority of cases, the tenants leave the rented premises after receiving a legal notice from the court.Stage II - File an Eviction Suit:The tenant may refuse to vacate the rented property after receiving the court’s eviction notice and contest the eviction. In this case, the landlord can hire a rental property lawyer to file an eviction suit against the tenant. The suit for eviction of the tenant is filed in a civil court under whose jurisdiction the rented property is situated.Stage III - Final Eviction Notice:The court hears both sides and issues a final legal notice for eviction for the tenant based on the arguments and evidence present. The tenant has to vacate the rented property once the court sends the final eviction notice.Thank YouAyantika MondalAdvocate, Bangalore27 Answers9 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ayantika Mondal"

If they pay the outstanding rent along with interest, it may reset the legal situation. However, this doesn't automatically end the tenancy.Tenancy after Original Tenant's Death: In many cases, the tenancy can continue even after the original tenant's death, especially if there is a family member residing in the property. However, this can vary depending on state-specific rent control laws.Dilapidated Structure: If the building is declared dilapidated and uninhabitable, it's essential to follow the proper legal process for eviction. You may need to obtain the necessary permissions and orders from the relevant authority for demolition or repair.Non-Occupancy: If the tenants have not been living in the property for an extended period, it may be possible to argue that they have abandoned the property. However, this should be done legally to avoid any potential claims from the tenants.Corporation's Role: If the corporation is not willing to interfere in the matter, you should focus on following the legal process for eviction as per the existing laws.

A family settlement is an effective alternative dispute resolution mechanism and should be a preferred route for families to protect generational wealth from being marred by disputes. Given the fact that genuine family arrangements/settlements are outside the purview of taxation, this mode of dispute resolution has gained popularity over a period. Civil proceedings in a court are not only time consuming but also a costly affair and therefore family settlements should be a preferred choice for dispute resolution amongst families. Further, as held by the Hon'ble Apex Court there is no alienation (transfer) of property in a family settlement.It would be better to have a detailed discussion in this regard with complete documents to decide the correct procedure.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, Delhi418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma"

    "answer": "Dear client,The right procedure to transfer the property without attracting long-term capital gains taxes by the Income Tax department can be complex, and it's essential to consider both the legal and financial aspects.Gift Deed: If the property was received in a family settlement, you may consider executing a gift deed from your name to the family members who should have legal ownership. While gift deeds are generally subject to income tax, if the property was acquired through a family settlement, there may be specific exemptions. Consult with your CA to understand the tax implications fully.Sale Deed: You can sell the property to the family members at a fair market value. Ensure that the sale price is reasonable to avoid any disputes with tax authorities. The tax implications will depend on the difference between the purchase price and the sale price.Family Settlement: If the property was initially received through a family settlement, another family settlement might be considered, but this can be legally complex. Consult with a lawyer to assess the feasibility of this option.Gift Tax Rules: Keep in mind that there are provisions under the Income Tax Act related to gift tax, and you should understand how these apply in your specific case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This fact can simply be mentioned in the sale deed to be executed between X and Y [as sellers] and the new buyerthe opinions which you have got from certain 'lawyers' are preposterous. It seems those 'lawyers' have not read the Registration Act, 1908if there was any issue with the POA of X&Y in favour of Y's father, then at the time of registering the sale deed with the builder, the sub-registrar would have refused to act on that POA.Just because the builder's + Land owners' POA is registered [which is a misnomer since a presentation POA is not registered with the sub-registrar's office but only attested by the sub-registrar] would not mean that the buyer side POA should also have been registered.Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Unregistered GPA (buyer) and sale deed",
    "answer": "Dear client,   In India, it's generally advisable to have the power of attorney (GPA) for buyers registered. While a GPA may only be a signing authority, registering it adds legal validity and authenticity to the document. The Supreme Court's judgment in 2011 emphasized the importance of registering GPAs to avoid disputes. So, it would be best for Mr. X and Mrs. Y to consider registering their GPA.Typographical Error in Sale Deed: The misspelling of names in a sale deed can be corrected through a correction deed. This would help ensure that the property title reflects the correct names of the buyers.New Buyer's Concerns: If a new buyer is interested in the property, they may still have concerns about the unregistered GPA for Mr. POA_Buyer. To address this, Mr. X and Mrs. Y could consider executing a correction deed that includes the spelling correction and explicitly states that the unregistered GPA is valid and authorized by them. This correction deed should be registered to make it legally binding.Legal Complexity: The third opinion suggests that the issue is too complex and not recommended for new buyers. While this is a cautious approach, it may not be necessary if the correct legal procedures are followed to rectify the situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, the rent agreement must be registered under Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908. The Ministry does not specify the number of witnesses required for the rent agreement, but it is advisable to have at least two witnesses as per the general practice.It is possible that your passport application was put on hold due to one less sign of witness in the rent agreement, if the Passport Issuing Authority (PIA) found it insufficient or invalid. The PIA has the discretion to accept or reject any document as proof of address. It is also possible that there was a mistake or oversight at counter A and token counter, where they did not check your rent agreement properly. The acknowledgement letter may not have any remark because it is a generic document that does not reflect the status of your application.To resolve this issue, you may have to contact the PIA and provide them with a valid rent agreement with two witnesses, or any other document that can prove your address, such as Aadhaar card, voter ID card, bank statement, etc. You may also have to submit a fresh passport application form with the correct documents.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

To address this issue, you should consider taking the following steps:Contact Passport Office: Reach out to the passport office where you submitted your application. Inquire about the specific reason for putting your application on hold and seek clarification on the discrepancy between counter A and counter B.Correct the Issue: If the missing witness signature is the problem, you may need to amend your rent agreement to include the required witness and then resubmit the application. Make sure to follow the guidelines provided by the passport office.Review Acknowledgment Letter: Review the acknowledgment letter you received from the passport office carefully to ensure that all the submitted documents are in order. If there's no remark on the letter, it's possible that the issue was identified later in the process.Seek Assistance: If you encounter difficulties resolving the issue, consider seeking assistance from the passport office's customer service or support team. They may be able to provide guidance on how to proceed.It's essential to follow the specific instructions and requirements of your country's passport office to ensure the smooth processing of your passport renewal application.

    "question": "Relieving letter",
    "answer": "- As per the Employment Act, employees have the right to resign at any time, by serving notice or by compensating the employer with salary in lieu. It is an offence for employers to disallow employees to leave their job.- Further, the Supreme Court has declared in the judgment of the case titled as Sanjay Jain versus National Aviation Company of India Ltd, , that to resign is a right of an employee who cannot be forced to serve in case he is not willing until and unless there is some stipulation in the rules or in the terms of appointment or disciplinary proceedings is pending or contemplated which is sought to be avoided by resigning from the service.- Hence, if any disciplinary enquiry is going on against that employee, then only an employer can reject the resignation of an employee.- Since, there is no enquiry now , then they cannot refuse to relieve you and to issue a Relieving letter- Legally, in government job , the notice period is 90 days , and further you may be called by the competent authority to explain the reasons for the resignation , and thereby they will issue a Relieving letter to you.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "How to evict tenants who are in possession of my property",
    "answer": "1. you can certainly file an eviction suit against the grandchildren on the grounds of arrears of rent, non-user and possession required for immediate demolition2. the rent is in arrears since 2015, so i fear that, that claim may have become time barred. however the other grounds like non-user and possession needed for immediate demolition are certainly there3. for claiming arrears of rent, you will have to issue a statutory notice u/s 15 of the Maharashtra rent control act. Even if the rent is cleared upon receiving the notice, you can still sue them for not paying rent on time. The landlord should not be made to issue a legal notice everytime to the tenant for payment of rent. It should not be that only on receiving the legal notice the tenant pays the rent. This would become onerous for the landlord. So even if the rent arrears are cleared, you can still seek their eviction as the tenant was never ready and willing to pay rent on time and only on being served with the legal notice, he paid the rent. So such a tenant has no right to continue to occupy the premises. This is because the landlord also has to pay the outgoings of the building like property tax etc. And some landlords are dependent on the rental income for their sustenance. Though a rent of Rs. 27/- in today's time is even less than pittance.4. the corporation cannot raise their hands by saying that it will not demolish the building because there are occupants in the building. This is no answer. The corporation owes a duty to the general public and the passers by who could be injured if the building suddenly collapses. So if the corporation is not demolishing the building then you will have to approach the High Court. Also there are judgments which have held that just because the building is demolished, the rights of the tenants/occupants are not obliterated and they are infact preserved and unaffected.5. the grandchildren would be the statutory tenants by virtue of the definition of tenant given in the rent act in s.7(15)(d). So even if the original contractual tenant dies, the tenancy right survives to his family member or legal heir who would then become the statutory tenant under the rent actYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Dear Client,As per the fact of the case tenant is not paying the rent for 8-9 year ,it can be taken as a ground for evicting the tenant from the house.After establishing the grounds for the eviction, the following procedure needs to be followed:Stage I -Send a Notice to the Tenant to Vacate:An eviction notice needs to be filed in a court under the appropriate jurisdiction mentioning the reason for eviction and the time and date by which the tenant has to vacate the property and is then sent to the tenant to vacate the rental property. The landlord must give a reasonable time to the tenant to vacate the rented property. In the majority of cases, the tenants leave the rented premises after receiving a legal notice from the court.Stage II - File an Eviction Suit:The tenant may refuse to vacate the rented property after receiving the court’s eviction notice and contest the eviction. In this case, the landlord can hire a rental property lawyer to file an eviction suit against the tenant. The suit for eviction of the tenant is filed in a civil court under whose jurisdiction the rented property is situated.Stage III - Final Eviction Notice:The court hears both sides and issues a final legal notice for eviction for the tenant based on the arguments and evidence present. The tenant has to vacate the rented property once the court sends the final eviction notice.Thank YouAyantika MondalAdvocate, Bangalore27 Answers9 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ayantika Mondal"

However, this can vary depending on state-specific rent control laws.Dilapidated Structure: If the building is declared dilapidated and uninhabitable, it's essential to follow the proper legal process for eviction. You may need to obtain the necessary permissions and orders from the relevant authority for demolition or repair.Non-Occupancy: If the tenants have not been living in the property for an extended period, it may be possible to argue that they have abandoned the property. However, this should be done legally to avoid any potential claims from the tenants.Corporation's Role: If the corporation is not willing to interfere in the matter, you should focus on following the legal process for eviction as per the existing laws.

Do not share any personal or financial information with them, such as your Aadhaar card, PAN card, ATM card, bank account details, OTP, etc. These scammers may use this information to steal your money or identity.The second thing you should do is to report this incident to the cyber cell of Delhi police.

    "question": "Inheritance of property from an Indian citizen by an American citizen with OCI status",
    "answer": "When it comes to inheritance of property in India by a foreign national or a person of Indian origin, there are specific regulations and restrictions under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) and other laws. I'll address your queries step by step:Ownership by OCI: An Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) can inherit any immovable property in India, be it agricultural, residential, or commercial. However, while you can inherit and own agricultural land, you cannot purchase it directly. In your case, since you are inheriting it through a will, it's permissible.Will & Its Contestability: Your father's cousin can absolutely will his property to you. Having a well-drafted and registered will would strengthen the legitimacy of the transfer. But, like in many jurisdictions, a will can be contested in India. Common grounds for contesting include:The testator (person creating the will) was not of sound mind when the will was created.The will was made under duress or undue influence.The will is forged or tampered with.The testator did not follow the proper procedure in drafting or executing the will.Given the familial relationship and the fact that your father's cousin has children and grandchildren, there's a likelihood they may contest the will, especially if they feel they have been unfairly excluded.Chances in Court: It's hard to predict outcomes in legal cases since they depend heavily on the specifics. But if the will is drafted correctly, clearly specifies the intentions of your father's cousin, and if it can be established that he was of sound mind and not under undue influence when making the will, the chances of it being upheld are better. It would also be helpful if there are witnesses (preferably neutral parties) to the will's execution.Mortgaging the Property: This is a complex strategy and might not provide the security you're hoping for. If your father's cousin mortgages the property to you (with you acting as the lender), and his heirs later successfully contest the will, they'd inherit the property subject to the mortgage. This doesn't necessarily mean they would have to repay the mortgage immediately. Also, creating a mortgage for this purpose might be seen as an attempt to circumvent the law, which can have its own complications.Precautionary Measures:Ensure the will is drafted by an experienced attorney and the reasons for bequeathing the property to you are clearly laid out.It might also be a good idea for your father's cousin to discuss his intentions with his immediate family to mitigate any surprises and potential disputes later on.Consider the option of a \"testamentary trust\" where the property is held in trust with specific instructions on its use, disposal, or management.Finally, given the complexities involved, it's highly recommended you consult with a property lawyer who can provide guidance tailored to the specific circumstances.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "- As per law, an OCI can inherit any immovable property in India, whether it is residential or commercial or an agricultural land or a farmhouse.- Hence, your fathers cousin being the owner of a self acquired property can registered a Will in your name without getting consent of any of other family members- No other family members are entitled to get the share in that property , and hence they cannot challenge that will- The said inherited property cannot be mortgaged as the Will can only be executed after demise of him."

    "question": "Inheritance of property from an Indian citizen by an American citizen with OCI status",
    "answer": "1. a person can make a bequest of his property to any person of his choice by his Will2. it is not necessary that the beneficiary in the Will have to be the legal heirs of the person3. so the person can make a bequest even in favour of a foreigner4. if the person has already given some properties in his lifetime to his children/grandchildren, then that factum ought to be mentioned in the Will to justify the exclusion of the children/grandchildren from the Will and to avert any possibility of the Will being challenged on the ground that it is unnatural since it unjustly excludes the legal heirs5. the Will is not required to be registered under the law. Even if it is registered, the formal proof of due execution of the Will would still have to be discharged by the person who relies on such Will or who propounds such Will. Registering the Will does not give it any more legitimacy than when the Will would be unregistered. So registration not being the requirement of law, can be skipped completely6. asking questions like - what are the chances of the heirs winning - is completely illogical since that cannot be predicted by an advocate. What if the advocate says that there is no chance of the heirs winning, but the heirs in fact win the case? In that case will you hold the advocate responsible? Predicting is the job of an astrologer and not of an advocate.7. mortgaging the property with the proposed legatee will not serve any purpose. In fact it will backfire. So it will be a futile exercise.8. the Will can be made in any language known to the testator. It has to be signed by the testator in front of 2 witnesses. It is not necessary that both the witnesses are present together at the time the testator signs his Will. The requirement is that the witness must have seen the testator sign his Will in the presence of the witness.9. the witnesses can also be any person who know the testator and who can depose and testify that when he testator signed his Will he was in a sound and disposing state of mind10. attaching a doctor's certificate to the Will to show that the testator has a sound state of mind, is completely optional and is not a requirement under the lawYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Asset under partnership",
    "answer": "Dear client,In situations where one partner contributes property as their capital contribution to a partnership, it's common to include a clause in the partnership deed specifying that the property is considered part of the partnership's assets, even if it's registered in an individual partner's name. This clause would affirm that the land is treated as a capital contribution to the partnership entity, in your case, the school.However, the legal complexities surrounding land acquisition and registration in Assam, especially for non-residents, may require consulting with a legal professional well-versed in local property and partnership laws. They can help ensure that your partnership deed complies with all applicable regulations and that your interests are protected.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Bank has filed criminal case for loan default",
    "answer": "Loan default is generally a civil wrong, except in cases where there is fraudulent or dishonest intention on the part of the borrower at the time of availing the loan. The bank can file a civil suit against you for recovery of the loan amount, interest, and damages. The bank can also take possession of any collateral or security that you have pledged for the loan. However, the bank cannot file a criminal case against you for loan default, unless they can prove that you have cheated, misappropriated, or conspired to defraud them. The sections invoked by the bank are related to cheating, criminal breach of trust, cheating with knowledge of wrongful loss, cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property, cheating with intent to cause wrongful loss or wrongful gain, and criminal conspiracy. These are serious offences that can attract imprisonment and fine.However, it is possible that the bank is filing a false or frivolous criminal case against you to harass and intimidate you into paying the loan amount. This is an abuse of the process of law and a violation of your rights. You have the right to defend yourself against such false allegations and seek legal help.Here are some steps you can take to deal with this situation:Do not ignore the summon or warrant issued by the court. You must appear before the court on the date and time mentioned in the summon or warrant. If you fail to do so, you may be declared as an absconder or a proclaimed offender, which can worsen your situation.Seek legal advice from a lawyer who can guide you on how to deal with the criminal case and protect your rights and interests. You can also apply for anticipatory bail or regular bail if you are arrested or likely to be arrested.Challenge the jurisdiction of the court where the bank has filed the criminal case. If the court is in a different state 2000 km away from your and your business location, you can argue that it is inconvenient and unfair for you to attend the proceedings there. You can request the court to transfer the case to a court near your location or quash the case altogether.File a counter-complaint against the bank for filing a false and malicious criminal case against you. You can also file a complaint before the Banking Ombudsman or the Consumer Forum for redressal of your grievances. You can claim compensation for mental harassment, defamation, and violation of your rights.Negotiate with the bank for an amicable settlement of your loan account. You can explain your financial situation and offer to pay what you can afford. You can also request the bank to waive off some interest or penalty charges. You can seek the help of a mediator or a counsellor to facilitate the negotiation process.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Protection against false cases by wife to claim husband's property",
    "answer": "There are some situations where your future wife may be able to claim your property if you get married under Muslim Marriage Act. These situations include:If you desert her or treat her with cruelty or neglect, she can file a suit forrestitution of conjugal rightsor judicial separation and claim maintenance and a share in your property as per Section 4 of the Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act, 1939.If you convert to another religion, she can file a suit for dissolution of marriage and claim maintenance and a share in your property as per Section 4 of the Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act, 1939.If you die intestate (without leaving a will), she can inherit a share in your property as per the rules of succession under Muslim law.Therefore, you may want to take some precautions to protect yourself against any false cases or claims by your future wife. Some possible precautions are:Transfer your properties in the name of your parents before getting married. This may prevent your future wife from claiming any right or interest in them. However, this may not be foolproof, as she may still challenge the validity or genuineness of the transfer and allege that it was done to defraud her or defeat her rights. She may also claim that you have retained some beneficial interest or control over the properties even after transferring them to your parents.Get your father to legally disown you after transferring the properties to him. This may sever your legal relationship with him and make you ineligible to inherit his property. However, this may not be effective either, as disowning is not recognized by law as a valid mode of disinheriting an heir. Your father may still change his mind and revoke his decision to disown you or make a will in your favour. Moreover, disowning may have other adverse consequences for you, such as losing your right to maintenance or family pension from your father.Make a prenuptial agreement with your future wife before getting married. A prenuptial agreement is a contract between two prospective spouses that specifies their rights and obligations regarding their property, finances, maintenance, divorce, etc. A prenuptial agreement may help you to safeguard your properties from any false claims or disputes by your future wife. However, you should be aware that prenuptial agreements are not very common or popular in India and their legal validity and enforceability are still uncertain and debatable.Therefore, none of these precautions may guarantee complete protection against false cases by your future wife to claim your property. The best way to avoid any such trouble is to have a happy and harmonious marriage based on mutual trust, respect, and love.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Unregistered GPA (buyer) and sale deed",
    "answer": "Dear client,   In India, it's generally advisable to have the power of attorney (GPA) for buyers registered. While a GPA may only be a signing authority, registering it adds legal validity and authenticity to the document. The Supreme Court's judgment in 2011 emphasized the importance of registering GPAs to avoid disputes. So, it would be best for Mr. X and Mrs. Y to consider registering their GPA.Typographical Error in Sale Deed: The misspelling of names in a sale deed can be corrected through a correction deed. This would help ensure that the property title reflects the correct names of the buyers.New Buyer's Concerns: If a new buyer is interested in the property, they may still have concerns about the unregistered GPA for Mr. POA_Buyer. To address this, Mr. X and Mrs. Y could consider executing a correction deed that includes the spelling correction and explicitly states that the unregistered GPA is valid and authorized by them. This correction deed should be registered to make it legally binding.Legal Complexity: The third opinion suggests that the issue is too complex and not recommended for new buyers. While this is a cautious approach, it may not be necessary if the correct legal procedures are followed to rectify the situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Here there is none.

This correction deed should be executed by Mr. X and Mrs. Y, and it should be registered with the sub-registrar's office to make the necessary correction.New Buyer: When selling the property to a new buyer, it's crucial to ensure that the title to the property is clear. This may involve addressing any concerns related to the unregistered GPA and the typographical error.

    "answer": "Dear client,When lending a substantial amount of money to someone for the purpose of buying property in India, it's crucial to take proper legal precautions to protect your interests. Here are some options to consider:1. Loan Agreement:You should create a detailed loan agreement that outlines the terms and conditions of the loan, including the principal amount, interest rate (if any), repayment schedule, and consequences of default.Specify the currency in which the loan is to be repaid (USD in your case), and the repayment period (e.g., 10 years).Include clauses related to the consequences of non-payment, such as the right to take legal action to recover the loan.2. Mortgage Deed:A mortgage deed is a legal document that allows you to secure the loan against the property being purchased. If the borrower defaults, you can initiate foreclosure proceedings to recover the loan amount through the sale of the property.Consult with an Indian lawyer to draft a legally binding mortgage deed. Your presence in India or appointing a power of attorney may be necessary for the execution of this deed.3. Co-ownership or Joint Registry:A joint ownership arrangement allows you to be a co-owner of the property. You can either jointly own the property or hold a share in it.Consult with a legal expert to understand the implications of co-ownership and its potential tax implications in both India and the United States.As a US citizen, you may not need to have an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card to be a joint owner, but consult with a legal professional to confirm.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

TheHindu Marriage Actis applicable to Hindus, whereas theSpecial Marriage Actis applicable to all citizens of India irrespective of their religion. The Supreme Court of India has held that marriages of Indians solemnized in foreign countries are valid in India if they are performed according to the law of that country.online marriages, also known as virtual marriages or e-marriages, were not widely recognized in India. In India, marriage is primarily governed by personal laws based on one's religion, and the process of solemnizing a marriage typically involves physical presence before the marriage registrar or religious authority, along with the fulfillment of certain legal requirements. However, it's important to note that laws and regulations can change over time, and there may have been developments or changes in Indian marriage laws since my last update. Additionally, the recognition of online marriages can vary from one Indian state or union territory to another, as some states may have different interpretations or policies regarding such marriages.Therefore, if you and your fiance are planning to get married online through a platform called courtley, which provides a valid marriage certificate issued by USA government authorities, you may not be able to use it as a proof of your marital status in India. You may have to register your marriage in India under theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, which allows for marriages between Indian citizens and foreign nationals. You may also have to get an apostille stamp on your USA marriage certificate, which is a form of authentication issued by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) for documents that are intended for use in Hague Convention countries. An apostille stamp verifies the authenticity of your document and makes it acceptable in other countries.To register your marriage in India, you may have to follow these steps:Fill an online application form on the website of the Registrar General of Marriages.Submit the required documents, such as passport copies, visa copies, birth certificates, address proofs, photographs, etc.Pay the prescribed fee online or offline.Book an appointment for verification and registration at the nearest marriage office.Appear before the marriage officer along with your fiance and two witnesses on the appointed date and time.Sign the declaration form and receive your marriage certificate.To get an apostille stamp on your USA marriage certificate, you may have to follow these steps:Get your USA marriage certificate authenticated by the Secretary of State of the state where it was issued.Send your authenticated USA marriage certificate along with a photocopy of your passport and a self-addressed envelope to the MEA Branch Secretariat in New Delhi or any other city where it is located.Pay the prescribed fee online or offline.Receive your apostilled USA marriage certificate by mail or courier.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

Here are some key points to consider:Validity of Foreign Marriage Certificates: In India, foreign marriage certificates are generally recognized if they are issued by competent authorities in the foreign country and are in compliance with Indian laws.Apostille Stamp: To use a foreign marriage certificate in India, it may need to be apostilled. An apostille is a form of authentication that verifies the legitimacy of the document for use in a foreign country. The requirement for an apostille can vary depending on the state or Union Territory in India, so it's advisable to check with the local authorities in the specific location where you intend to use the certificate.Specific Indian Laws: India has its own set of laws governing marriage, and the recognition of a foreign marriage certificate may also depend on the specific circumstances and legal requirements. Different states in India may have slightly different requirements.Bank Accounts and Property Rentals: Using a foreign marriage certificate for activities like opening a joint bank account or renting property may be possible, but it's recommended to check with the specific institutions or authorities involved.

However, the rent agreement must be registered under Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908. The Ministry does not specify the number of witnesses required for the rent agreement, but it is advisable to have at least two witnesses as per the general practice.It is possible that your passport application was put on hold due to one less sign of witness in the rent agreement, if the Passport Issuing Authority (PIA) found it insufficient or invalid. The PIA has the discretion to accept or reject any document as proof of address. It is also possible that there was a mistake or oversight at counter A and token counter, where they did not check your rent agreement properly. The acknowledgement letter may not have any remark because it is a generic document that does not reflect the status of your application.To resolve this issue, you may have to contact the PIA and provide them with a valid rent agreement with two witnesses, or any other document that can prove your address, such as Aadhaar card, voter ID card, bank statement, etc. You may also have to submit a fresh passport application form with the correct documents.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Passport on hold",
    "answer": "Dear client,In some cases, the absence of a witness's signature on a rent agreement could lead to an application being placed on hold, especially if that is a requirement according to the rules and regulations of the passport issuing authority.It's possible that there was an oversight or inconsistency in the process you went through at different counters. To address this issue, you should consider taking the following steps:Contact Passport Office: Reach out to the passport office where you submitted your application. Inquire about the specific reason for putting your application on hold and seek clarification on the discrepancy between counter A and counter B.Correct the Issue: If the missing witness signature is the problem, you may need to amend your rent agreement to include the required witness and then resubmit the application. Make sure to follow the guidelines provided by the passport office.Review Acknowledgment Letter: Review the acknowledgment letter you received from the passport office carefully to ensure that all the submitted documents are in order. If there's no remark on the letter, it's possible that the issue was identified later in the process.Seek Assistance: If you encounter difficulties resolving the issue, consider seeking assistance from the passport office's customer service or support team. They may be able to provide guidance on how to proceed.It's essential to follow the specific instructions and requirements of your country's passport office to ensure the smooth processing of your passport renewal application.

    "question": "Sale deed using POA of Deceased Person",
    "answer": "According to the Supreme Court of India, a power of attorney (PoA) does not confer property title if a sale deed is not executed and registered to validate the PoA, and no action is taken by its holder. A PoA is merely a document that allows the principal to appoint another person as their agent, conferring authority on that agent to perform certain acts or functions on their behalf. A PoA is usually terminated when the principal dies or becomes incapacitated3.In your case, it seems that you executed a sale deed through a PoA of a deceased person, who was the land owner. This may not be a valid transaction, as the PoA would have become invalid after the death of the principal. The legal heirs of the deceased person would have inherited the property as per the law of succession. Therefore, you should have obtained the consent and signatures of all the legal heirs as sellers in the sale deed, not just as witnesses in the deed of confirmation. Their signature as mere witnesses would not suffice to transfer their rights and interests in the property.You may have to face legal challenges from the legal heir who wants to dispute the sale deed and demand extra money or share in land portion. You may have to prove that you acted in good faith and were not aware of the death of the donor at the time of executing the sale deed. You may also have to show that you paid a fair consideration for the property and that there was no fraud or coercion involved.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Sale deed using POA of Deceased Person",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, the sale of property through a power of attorney (POA) granted by a deceased person can be complex and may raise legal issues. Here are some points to consider:False Declaration: Making a false declaration about the donor (POA issuer) being alive during the sale deed registration is a legal issue. It may impact the validity of the sale deed.Legal Heirs' Confirmation: While you obtained a deed of confirmation from the legal heirs, it's essential to ensure the validity of this document. Their consent may not necessarily resolve the issue if there were discrepancies or misrepresentations in the original sale deed.Legal Action: If one of the legal heirs is challenging the sale deed, it's advisable to consult with a legal expert in India. They can provide specific advice based on the details of your case and the relevant property laws in your jurisdiction.Negotiation: If there's a dispute, it's often beneficial to explore negotiation and mediation options to resolve the matter without resorting to litigation.Document Review: Ensure that all documents, including the POA, sale deed, and the deed of confirmation, are thoroughly reviewed by a legal professional to assess their legality and validity.Legal Remedies: Consult an attorney to understand your legal rights and potential remedies. The outcome may vary based on the facts and circumstances of your case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Neigbour car Parking",
    "answer": "Dear client,Dear sir/madam,Your advocate can refer to these sections/laws:The National Urban Transport Policy (NUTP) of India devised by the Ministry of Urban Development in 2006 largely sets the tone for parking in India. It directs state governments to make suitable amendments to building rules to provide adequate parking spaces. The Municipal Corporation or the concerned city authorities have the mandate to govern both on-street and off-street parking. However, laws relating to parking are loosely set, based on guidelines and conviction of the local bodies since states have historically given less importance to parking while devising urban development plans.The Rules of the Road Regulations, 1989 state that when parking a vehicle it must be made sure that “it does not cause any danger, obstruction or inconvenience for other road users.”Clause 122 of the Motor Vehicles Act (1988) says that “no motor vehicle should be left on the public road in a dangerous position or in such a manner so as to cause inconvenience to other road users or abandoned.” This means that parking in front of a neighbor’s garage, double parking, parking on private property or public places not sanctioned for parking is against the law.Even places that are designated parking areas are not free of regulations; clause 126 of the Motor Vehicles Act states that “no motor vehicle should remain stationary in a public place unless there is a licensed driver in the vehicle or where the engine has stopped running, proper precautionary methods have been taken to ensure that the vehicle will not move accidentally in the absence of the driver.” Sloped roads or storefronts with “No Parking” signals are not fair game.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,In the context of society redevelopment, the consideration of area and how it impacts the distribution of benefits can be complex and may depend on the society's bylaws, redevelopment agreement, and local regulations.Calculation of Area for Proposal:Typically, during the proposal phase for redevelopment, the society should consider the total area of each flat, including any balconies or extra spaces, as per the society's bylaws or agreement with the developer. This will form the basis for determining the benefits each member will receive after redevelopment.Challenging the Decision:If the society passes a resolution regarding area calculations and a member believes it is unfair, they may challenge this decision. The process for challenging such a decision is usually governed by the society's bylaws and the local cooperative housing society regulations.Generally, the member can raise their concerns and objections during society meetings or general body meetings. If the issue remains unresolved, they may consider legal action or dispute resolution mechanisms as provided by the cooperative housing society regulations.Appropriate Authority:The appropriate authority for challenging decisions within a cooperative housing society is often the Registrar of Cooperative Societies or the Cooperative Court, depending on your location. These authorities oversee cooperative society matters and disputes.

    "question": "Unregistered GPA (buyer) and sale deed",
    "answer": "Dear client,   In India, it's generally advisable to have the power of attorney (GPA) for buyers registered. While a GPA may only be a signing authority, registering it adds legal validity and authenticity to the document. The Supreme Court's judgment in 2011 emphasized the importance of registering GPAs to avoid disputes. So, it would be best for Mr. X and Mrs. Y to consider registering their GPA.Typographical Error in Sale Deed: The misspelling of names in a sale deed can be corrected through a correction deed. This would help ensure that the property title reflects the correct names of the buyers.New Buyer's Concerns: If a new buyer is interested in the property, they may still have concerns about the unregistered GPA for Mr. POA_Buyer. To address this, Mr. X and Mrs. Y could consider executing a correction deed that includes the spelling correction and explicitly states that the unregistered GPA is valid and authorized by them. This correction deed should be registered to make it legally binding.Legal Complexity: The third opinion suggests that the issue is too complex and not recommended for new buyers. While this is a cautious approach, it may not be necessary if the correct legal procedures are followed to rectify the situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "A person resident in India (other than an Indian company) may borrow on non-repatriation basis from an NRI or a PIO outside India subject to following: Amount of loan shall be received by inward remittance from outside India or out of NRE/FCNR/NRO account of the lender in India.People resident in India may borrow, both in rupees or foreign currency; but conditions apply. In case of borrowing in INR from NRIs/PIOs, these terms and conditions need to be complied with...* Borrowing shall be only on a non-repatriation basis.* The amount of loan should be received either by inward remittance from outside India or by debit to the NRE/NRO/FCNR(B)/NRNR/NRSR account of the lender, maintained with an authorized dealer/bank in India.* The period of loan shall not exceed three years.* The rate of interest on the loan shall not be more than 2% above the bank rate prevailing on the date of taking the loan.* The payment of interest and repayment of principal shall be made only to the NRO account of the lender.The terms and conditions are prescribed under the Foreign Exchange Management (Borrowing and Lending) Regulations, 2018, for borrowing in foreign currency from NRIs/PIOs. However, a loan from a foreign national in favour of an Indian citizen under the automatic route may not be possible.Since there are restrictions to lend as mentioned above, you may better lend the amount through your close relatives under a mortgage loan which will be very safe especially if he fails to return the amount, his property can be brought to sale and money can be recovered.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "United States citizen helping someone to buy property in India",
    "answer": "Dear client,When lending a substantial amount of money to someone for the purpose of buying property in India, it's crucial to take proper legal precautions to protect your interests. Here are some options to consider:1. Loan Agreement:You should create a detailed loan agreement that outlines the terms and conditions of the loan, including the principal amount, interest rate (if any), repayment schedule, and consequences of default.Specify the currency in which the loan is to be repaid (USD in your case), and the repayment period (e.g., 10 years).Include clauses related to the consequences of non-payment, such as the right to take legal action to recover the loan.2. Mortgage Deed:A mortgage deed is a legal document that allows you to secure the loan against the property being purchased. If the borrower defaults, you can initiate foreclosure proceedings to recover the loan amount through the sale of the property.Consult with an Indian lawyer to draft a legally binding mortgage deed. Your presence in India or appointing a power of attorney may be necessary for the execution of this deed.3. Co-ownership or Joint Registry:A joint ownership arrangement allows you to be a co-owner of the property. You can either jointly own the property or hold a share in it.Consult with a legal expert to understand the implications of co-ownership and its potential tax implications in both India and the United States.As a US citizen, you may not need to have an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card to be a joint owner, but consult with a legal professional to confirm.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Neigbour car Parking",
    "answer": "Dear client,Dear sir/madam,Your advocate can refer to these sections/laws:The National Urban Transport Policy (NUTP) of India devised by the Ministry of Urban Development in 2006 largely sets the tone for parking in India. It directs state governments to make suitable amendments to building rules to provide adequate parking spaces. The Municipal Corporation or the concerned city authorities have the mandate to govern both on-street and off-street parking. However, laws relating to parking are loosely set, based on guidelines and conviction of the local bodies since states have historically given less importance to parking while devising urban development plans.The Rules of the Road Regulations, 1989 state that when parking a vehicle it must be made sure that “it does not cause any danger, obstruction or inconvenience for other road users.”Clause 122 of the Motor Vehicles Act (1988) says that “no motor vehicle should be left on the public road in a dangerous position or in such a manner so as to cause inconvenience to other road users or abandoned.” This means that parking in front of a neighbor’s garage, double parking, parking on private property or public places not sanctioned for parking is against the law.Even places that are designated parking areas are not free of regulations; clause 126 of the Motor Vehicles Act states that “no motor vehicle should remain stationary in a public place unless there is a licensed driver in the vehicle or where the engine has stopped running, proper precautionary methods have been taken to ensure that the vehicle will not move accidentally in the absence of the driver.” Sloped roads or storefronts with “No Parking” signals are not fair game.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,In the case of renewing a minor's passport, especially when the parents are divorced, there are specific requirements and considerations. Here's the information you may need:Presence at Passport Office:Typically, one parent can apply for a minor's passport renewal without the presence of the other parent, but you should provide an authorization letter from the absent parent.Divorce Decree:Yes, the passport office may ask for the divorce decree as it helps establish legal custody and guardianship. However, if you have custody and visiting rights mentioned in the divorce decree, it should be sufficient.Language of Divorce Decree:If your divorce decree is in Hindi, you should get it translated into English. You can consult a certified translator or approach the family court where the decree was issued to provide a translated version.Impact of Ex-Wife's Name Change:If your ex-wife has changed her name and is reissuing her passport, it may not directly impact your son's passport renewal. However, make sure that all the documents and information provided in your son's passport application are consistent with the details mentioned in the divorce decree and other legal documents.Foreign Travel:Traveling with your son using his new surname in his passport and your old surname in your passport should be fine as long as you have the necessary legal documents to prove your relationship and custody.It's essential to consult the official website of the Passport Seva Kendra or contact them directly to get the most up-to-date and accurate information about the specific requirements and procedures for renewing a minor's passport, given your circumstances.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It's important to note that these policies can vary between banks.Here are some steps you can consider:Review Bank Policies: Look into the terms and conditions of your SBI account to understand their minimum balance requirements and penalty charges. These should be outlined in your account agreement.Contact Bank Officially: Request a detailed explanation from the bank in writing for the charges and why they were not closed or made dormant. Make sure to keep records of all correspondence.Negotiate: Try negotiating with the bank to waive or reduce the penalty, especially if you are closing the account. Sometimes, banks may be willing to work with customers in such cases.Consult Legal Advice: If the bank doesn't provide a satisfactory resolution, you may want to consult with a lawyer who specializes in banking or consumer law to explore your legal options.Complain to Regulatory Authorities: In India, you can also consider filing a complaint with the Banking Ombudsman, who handles customer complaints against banks. The Banking Ombudsman is appointed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).It's essential to keep all documentation related to your account and any interactions with the bank. Bank policies and regulations can change, so consulting with a legal expert who can provide advice specific to your situation is advisable.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "1.Specific cases are mentioned under the GST law where no input tax credit shall be available for claims to the taxpayer.  ITC cannot be claimed if it is restricted in GSTR-2B available under Section 38 of the GST Act. Section 38 is completely revamped as ‘Communication of details of inward supplies and input tax credit’ in line with the Form GSTR-2B.2. Since the implementation of GST, it has been clear that health care services provided by an authorised medical practitioner or para medics through a clinical establishment are exempt vide Notification No. 12/2017-Central tax (Rate) dated [deleted]. But there have been certain grey areas in health care services regarding the availability of Input Tax Credit ) on certain supplies that needed a crystal-clear approach to be a compliant taxpayer.Advance ruling aimed at determining whether ITC is required to be restricted on medicines supplied to three types of a person :1)Supply of medicine to In-patients: ITC is required to be restricted on medicines used in the supply of health care services provided to admitted patients.2.2)Supply of medicine to Out-patients:This kind of supply involves 2 transactions:Sale of medicine from the pharmacy counter of the applicant:Medicine forming a part of health care servicesThe ITC is required to be restricted on medicines that are consumed in the provision of health care service and the output is health care service only which is exempt from tax.3. Supply of medicine to customers:The ITC is not required to be restricted on medicines supplied to a customer as there is no health care services provided and is liable to pay tax on the outward supply of medicines.The medicines are used in course of furtherance of business as per section 16 and are not blocked credit under section 17(5) (g) , consequently the applicant is eligible for ITC on inward supply of medicines under section 16(1) subject to fulfillment of rules 36 to 45 of CGST Rules.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Input Tax Credit on Business Purchases Done by Director of Company",
    "answer": "In India, Input Tax Credit (ITC) is governed by the Goods and Services Tax (GST) laws. When a business entity, such as your company, wants to claim ITC on purchases, certain conditions must be met:Recipient of Goods or Services: ITC can only be claimed by the registered recipient of goods or services. In your case, the company is the intended recipient.Tax Invoice in the Name of the Registered Entity: The tax invoice for the purchased goods or services should be in the name of the registered entity that intends to claim the ITC. In your case, the tax invoices should be in the name of the company, not in the Director's name.Compliance with GST Law: The company should be registered under GST and should be in compliance with GST law.Based on these conditions, it is typically not possible to claim ITC on purchases made under the license held in the Director's name. The ITC can generally only be claimed if the tax invoices are issued in the name of the registered company. This is to prevent misuse and ensure that the ITC is appropriately accounted for.To claim ITC and conduct business under the company's umbrella, you should consider the following steps:Transfer Ownership: Consider transferring the ownership of the drug store license from the Director's name to the company's name.Reissue Invoices: Ensure that all invoices for medicines and purchases are issued in the name of the company, not the Director.Registration under GST: If not already done, ensure that the company is registered under GST.Maintain Proper Records: Keep accurate records of all transactions, invoices, and ITC claims for future tax assessments.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Redevelopment of Society",
    "answer": "Dear client,In the context of society redevelopment, the consideration of area and how it impacts the distribution of benefits can be complex and may depend on the society's bylaws, redevelopment agreement, and local regulations.Calculation of Area for Proposal:Typically, during the proposal phase for redevelopment, the society should consider the total area of each flat, including any balconies or extra spaces, as per the society's bylaws or agreement with the developer. This will form the basis for determining the benefits each member will receive after redevelopment.Challenging the Decision:If the society passes a resolution regarding area calculations and a member believes it is unfair, they may challenge this decision. The process for challenging such a decision is usually governed by the society's bylaws and the local cooperative housing society regulations.Generally, the member can raise their concerns and objections during society meetings or general body meetings. If the issue remains unresolved, they may consider legal action or dispute resolution mechanisms as provided by the cooperative housing society regulations.Appropriate Authority:The appropriate authority for challenging decisions within a cooperative housing society is often the Registrar of Cooperative Societies or the Cooperative Court, depending on your location. These authorities oversee cooperative society matters and disputes. Legal action, if necessary, would typically be filed with the Cooperative Court.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Your brother and sister can sign as attesting witness to this registered settlement deed, which will doubly confirm that they were very well in the knowledge of this transfer.The POA deed stands automatically cancelled upon the death of the principal.2.  The stamp duty would be heavy for execution of gift duty when compared to that of the settlement deed, because the settlement deed is executed between the blood relations, hence it would be advisable that a settlement deed may be executed to effect this transfer as advised in the point number one above.3. Unfortunately by a Will, your mother can transfer only one third of her property in favor of the beneficiary as per muslim personal law. Under Muslim law no person is entitled to make will of the whole property.  Limitations are imposed in making will.  Therefore it is not an advisable mode of transfer of entire proeprty in your favor.4.

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. In Suraj Lamp & Industries (P) Ltd. v. State of Haryana, a two-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court declared “power of attorney” sales to be an invalid mode of property transfer. Therefore, POA cannot be done your case. If one gets property through the PoA then mutation will not take place in municipal and revenue records as a PoA doesn't give ownership rights to the agent in whose favour the instrument has been made. In other words, any person who buys a property through a PoA may have the 'possession' of the property but in the absence of a genuine registered sale deed he would not be considered as the rightful legal owner of the said property.Under Muslim law no person is entitled to make will or gift of the whole property. Only for 1/3 property it can be done. Limitations are imposed in making will or gift. The reason being to pay the respect to the word of prophet in order to ensure the shares of the legal heirs.Signature of your siblings are not required in case of gift or will.  A Muslim may transfer his property in various ways. One of such way is Hiba. Hiba is a transfer of property in the form of gift governed as per Muslim Law. A transfer of gift is regulated byTransfer of Property Act,1882. However, there are many limitations on this act as Muslim Law prevails over this law to maintain the religious freedom. Hon’ble High Court of Kerela speaking through Hon'ble MR. Justice P. Bhavadasan in the case of Salekath Beevi v. Mumthas Beevi stated \"Hiba is an immediate and unconditional transfer of the corpus of the property without any return. Every Muslim, who has attained majority and has a sound mind can make a gift\".

Since the implementation of GST, it has been clear that health care services provided by an authorised medical practitioner or para medics through a clinical establishment are exempt vide Notification No. 12/2017-Central tax (Rate) dated [deleted]. But there have been certain grey areas in health care services regarding the availability of Input Tax Credit ) on certain supplies that needed a crystal-clear approach to be a compliant taxpayer.Advance ruling aimed at determining whether ITC is required to be restricted on medicines supplied to three types of a person :1)Supply of medicine to In-patients: ITC is required to be restricted on medicines used in the supply of health care services provided to admitted patients.2.2)Supply of medicine to Out-patients:This kind of supply involves 2 transactions:Sale of medicine from the pharmacy counter of the applicant:Medicine forming a part of health care servicesThe ITC is required to be restricted on medicines that are consumed in the provision of health care service and the output is health care service only which is exempt from tax.3. Supply of medicine to customers:The ITC is not required to be restricted on medicines supplied to a customer as there is no health care services provided and is liable to pay tax on the outward supply of medicines.The medicines are used in course of furtherance of business as per section 16 and are not blocked credit under section 17(5) (g) , consequently the applicant is eligible for ITC on inward supply of medicines under section 16(1) subject to fulfillment of rules 36 to 45 of CGST Rules.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Input Tax Credit on Business Purchases Done by Director of Company",
    "answer": "In India, Input Tax Credit (ITC) is governed by the Goods and Services Tax (GST) laws. When a business entity, such as your company, wants to claim ITC on purchases, certain conditions must be met:Recipient of Goods or Services: ITC can only be claimed by the registered recipient of goods or services. In your case, the company is the intended recipient.Tax Invoice in the Name of the Registered Entity: The tax invoice for the purchased goods or services should be in the name of the registered entity that intends to claim the ITC. In your case, the tax invoices should be in the name of the company, not in the Director's name.Compliance with GST Law: The company should be registered under GST and should be in compliance with GST law.Based on these conditions, it is typically not possible to claim ITC on purchases made under the license held in the Director's name. The ITC can generally only be claimed if the tax invoices are issued in the name of the registered company. This is to prevent misuse and ensure that the ITC is appropriately accounted for.To claim ITC and conduct business under the company's umbrella, you should consider the following steps:Transfer Ownership: Consider transferring the ownership of the drug store license from the Director's name to the company's name.Reissue Invoices: Ensure that all invoices for medicines and purchases are issued in the name of the company, not the Director.Registration under GST: If not already done, ensure that the company is registered under GST.Maintain Proper Records: Keep accurate records of all transactions, invoices, and ITC claims for future tax assessments.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "My wife is getting abusive verbally and a little physically",
    "answer": "Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is a mental condition that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. People with NPD have an inflated sense of self-importance, a deep need for admiration, and a lack of empathy for others. They often exploit, manipulate, and hurt the people closest to them, such as their spouses, children, and family members.Living with a narcissistic spouse can be very stressful and damaging to your mental health and well-being. You may experience emotional abuse, verbal abuse, physical abuse, or financial abuse from your spouse. You may also feel isolated, lonely, guilty, ashamed, or worthless because of their constant criticism, blame, and contempt. You may lose your sense of identity, self-esteem, and self-respect because of their control and domination.However, you do not have to suffer in silence or endure this abuse forever. You have the right to protect yourself and your child from harm and seek happiness and peace in your life. You have the power to change your situation and reclaim your dignity and freedom.Here are some steps that you can take to deal with your narcissistic wife and improve your situation:Seek professional help. The first and most important step is to seek help from a qualified mental health professional who can provide you with counseling, therapy, support, and guidance. A therapist can help you cope with your emotions, heal from the trauma, and regain your confidence and self-worth. A therapist can also help you understand the nature of NPD and how it affects your spouse’s behavior and your relationship. A therapist can also help you decide whether to stay in the marriage or leave it.Educate yourself. The second step is to educate yourself about NPD and how to deal with it. You can read books, articles, blogs, or watch videos on this topic. You can also join online forums or support groups where you can share your experiences and learn from others who have faced similar situations. You can also consult a lawyer or a legal aid service to know your rights and options regarding divorce, custody, alimony, etc.Set boundaries. The third step is to set clear and firm boundaries with your spouse and stick to them. Boundaries are the rules or limits that you establish to protect yourself from harm and disrespect. You need to communicate your boundaries to your spouse and let them know what you will and will not tolerate from them. For example, you can tell them that you will not accept any verbal or physical abuse, that you will not give them money unless they contribute to the household expenses, that you will not let them interfere with your parenting decisions, etc. You also need to enforce your boundaries by taking action if they violate them. For example, you can hang up the phone, walk away, call the police, or file a complaint if they abuse you.Practice self-care. The fourth step is to practice self-care and take care of your physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual needs. Self-care is the act of doing things that make you feel good, healthy, happy, and relaxed. You need to prioritize your own well-being over pleasing your spouse or meeting their demands. You need to do things that nourish your body, mind, soul, and heart. For example, you can eat well, exercise regularly, sleep enough, meditate daily, pursue your hobbies or passions,Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Banks typically have policies in place regarding minimum balance requirements and penalties for not maintaining them. It's important to note that these policies can vary between banks.Here are some steps you can consider:Review Bank Policies: Look into the terms and conditions of your SBI account to understand their minimum balance requirements and penalty charges. These should be outlined in your account agreement.Contact Bank Officially: Request a detailed explanation from the bank in writing for the charges and why they were not closed or made dormant. Make sure to keep records of all correspondence.Negotiate: Try negotiating with the bank to waive or reduce the penalty, especially if you are closing the account. Sometimes, banks may be willing to work with customers in such cases.Consult Legal Advice: If the bank doesn't provide a satisfactory resolution, you may want to consult with a lawyer who specializes in banking or consumer law to explore your legal options.Complain to Regulatory Authorities: In India, you can also consider filing a complaint with the Banking Ombudsman, who handles customer complaints against banks. The Banking Ombudsman is appointed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).It's essential to keep all documentation related to your account and any interactions with the bank. Bank policies and regulations can change, so consulting with a legal expert who can provide advice specific to your situation is advisable.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Property related legal question",
    "answer": "1. Instead of obtaining a power of attorney from your mother, you may better get it transferred to your name by your mother executing a registered settlement deed by retaining life interest in the proeprty. Your brother and sister can sign as attesting witness to this registered settlement deed, which will doubly confirm that they were very well in the knowledge of this transfer.The POA deed stands automatically cancelled upon the death of the principal.2.  The stamp duty would be heavy for execution of gift duty when compared to that of the settlement deed, because the settlement deed is executed between the blood relations, hence it would be advisable that a settlement deed may be executed to effect this transfer as advised in the point number one above.3. Unfortunately by a Will, your mother can transfer only one third of her property in favor of the beneficiary as per muslim personal law. Under Muslim law no person is entitled to make will of the whole property.  Limitations are imposed in making will.  Therefore it is not an advisable mode of transfer of entire proeprty in your favor.4. If you would like to obtain loan on the property it should be on the name of the Principal only because the power agent cannot avail loan for his personal purposes  by pledging the property.The power of attorney deed do not devastate the title of the owner of the property, the power agent is appointed only to carry out certain tasks on behalf of the principal by the virtue of the power deed in his favor as prescribed in the power of attorney deed.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. In Suraj Lamp & Industries (P) Ltd. v. State of Haryana, a two-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court declared “power of attorney” sales to be an invalid mode of property transfer. Therefore, POA cannot be done your case. If one gets property through the PoA then mutation will not take place in municipal and revenue records as a PoA doesn't give ownership rights to the agent in whose favour the instrument has been made. In other words, any person who buys a property through a PoA may have the 'possession' of the property but in the absence of a genuine registered sale deed he would not be considered as the rightful legal owner of the said property.Under Muslim law no person is entitled to make will or gift of the whole property. Only for 1/3 property it can be done. Limitations are imposed in making will or gift. The reason being to pay the respect to the word of prophet in order to ensure the shares of the legal heirs.Signature of your siblings are not required in case of gift or will.  A Muslim may transfer his property in various ways. One of such way is Hiba. Hiba is a transfer of property in the form of gift governed as per Muslim Law. A transfer of gift is regulated byTransfer of Property Act,1882. However, there are many limitations on this act as Muslim Law prevails over this law to maintain the religious freedom. Hon’ble High Court of Kerela speaking through Hon'ble MR. Justice P. Bhavadasan in the case of Salekath Beevi v. Mumthas Beevi stated \"Hiba is an immediate and unconditional transfer of the corpus of the property without any return. Every Muslim, who has attained majority and has a sound mind can make a gift\". Most banks will not provide a loan to the power of attorney holder.Detailed discussion is required in such cases.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, Delhi418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma"

    "answer": "Power of Attorney (POA):You can obtain a Power of Attorney from your mother to manage the property. A POA allows you to act on her behalf.The process for acquiring a POA can vary, but it typically involves drafting a legal document specifying the powers granted.The necessity for your siblings to sign or witness the document may depend on the specific terms and local regulations. Consulting a local lawyer is advisable.Gift Deed:If your mother wishes to gift the property to you, you can create a Gift Deed. The associated registration fees and costs vary and are subject to state-specific rules.The involvement of your siblings in signing or witnessing the document may be required in some cases.Will:Creating a will is a way to specify how the property will be distributed after your mother's passing. Your siblings may not necessarily need to sign the will, but it's advisable to consult with a legal expert to ensure its validity.Bank Loan:Having a Power of Attorney may allow you to secure a bank loan against the property, but this can vary based on the bank's policies and the terms of the POA.The involvement of your siblings in signing the loan documents might depend on the bank's requirements and whether they have any legal claim to the property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "context": "Asked 3 years ago in Property Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Legal heir",
    "answer": "Dear client,1. The transfer of Rs.10,00,000 from your father to you, even if it's being done via cheque, can be construed in different ways by tax authorities. If this transaction is being classified as repayment of a loan, it wouldn't be considered as income. In this scenario, the money you gave your father over the years would be treated as a loan, and the repayment would not attract any tax liability. Second scenario is If authorities view this transfer as a gift from your father, it might not be taxable either, as gifts from relatives are generally not taxed in India. If the total amount received as a gift exceeds Rs.50,000 in a financial year, it's taxable as 'income from other sources', except in specific exempted cases (gift from relatives being one such exemption).To ensure that the transaction is perceived as either a gift or a loan repayment, you can take certain steps. If the initial transfer of Rs.10,00,000 was intended as a loan, ensure you have documentation supporting this. Any written agreement or record of the transactions (bank statements, transfer receipts, or any written acknowledgment of the loan) can help establish that it wasn't a gift but a loan extended to your father. When your father repays the Rs.10,00,000, ensure there's documentation acknowledging this repayment. This could be a simple agreement or a receipt stating that the amount has been repaid by your father to you as per the terms of the loan agreement. If there were any discussions, emails, or messages regarding the nature of the transaction (loan or gift), keep these records safe. They can serve as evidence if needed to establish the intention behind the transfer. Seek advice from a tax consultant or a chartered accountant. They can review the documentation, understand the specifics of your situation, and provide guidance on how to present the transaction to tax authorities to ensure it's treated as a loan repayment or a gift, whichever is applicable and more advantageous for you tax-wise.2. If the agreement is for your father to repay you Rs.10,00,000 without interest, requesting him to issue multiple cheques totaling Rs.10,00,000 but with amounts less than Rs.1,00,000 each could be seen as an attempt to avoid certain banking and tax regulations. In India, banks report transactions of Rs.10,00,000 or more to the Income Tax Department. Splitting the repayment into smaller amounts to avoid this reporting threshold might raise suspicions and could be seen as an attempt to avoid tax scrutiny. It's important to be transparent in financial dealings, especially when dealing with significant amounts. Instead of trying to structure the repayment in a way that raises questions, focus on documenting the repayment properly with a clear acknowledgment that the Rs.10,00,000 received is the repayment of the loan. Proper documentation and transparency in the transaction will support your case if there are any inquiries from tax authorities.3. Ensure the abovementioned documentations and communications.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,The right procedure to transfer the property without attracting long-term capital gains taxes by the Income Tax department can be complex, and it's essential to consider both the legal and financial aspects.Gift Deed: If the property was received in a family settlement, you may consider executing a gift deed from your name to the family members who should have legal ownership. While gift deeds are generally subject to income tax, if the property was acquired through a family settlement, there may be specific exemptions. Consult with your CA to understand the tax implications fully.Sale Deed: You can sell the property to the family members at a fair market value. Ensure that the sale price is reasonable to avoid any disputes with tax authorities. The tax implications will depend on the difference between the purchase price and the sale price.Family Settlement: If the property was initially received through a family settlement, another family settlement might be considered, but this can be legally complex. Consult with a lawyer to assess the feasibility of this option.Gift Tax Rules: Keep in mind that there are provisions under the Income Tax Act related to gift tax, and you should understand how these apply in your specific case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Legality Of Partnership",
    "answer": "According to the Indian Partnership Act, 1932, a partnership can be formed by an oral or written agreement between two or more persons. The registration of a partnership firm is not mandatory, but it has certain advantages and disadvantages. A registered partnership firm has legal recognition and can sue or be sued in its own name. An unregistered partnership firm, on the other hand, has certain limitations and disabilities, such as not being able to enforce its rights or obligations against third parties or other partners in a court of law.The legality of your father’s partnership firm may depend on the nature and terms of the agreement that he had with his friend. If there was a written partnership deed that clearly defined the roles, responsibilities, and profit-sharing ratio of each partner, then it may be considered as a valid agreement between them. However, if there was no written partnership deed or if the partnership deed was vague or ambiguous, then it may be difficult to prove the existence and validity of the partnership in a court of law.The Essential Commodities Act, 1955, is an act that regulates the production, supply, and distribution of certain commodities that are essential for the public. The act empowers the central and state governments to issue licenses and permits for dealing with such commodities and to impose restrictions and penalties for violating the provisions of the act. The Indian Contract Act, 1872, is an act that governs the formation and enforcement of contracts in India. The act lays down the principles and rules for valid contracts, their performance, breach, and remedies.Your father’s partnership firm may be illegal under the Essential Commodities Act if it was dealing with fertilizers without a valid license issued by the state government. This may attract criminal liability and penalties under the act. Your father may also be liable under the Indian Contract Act if he breached any contractual obligations that he had with his customers or suppliers.Your claim for money due from your father’s partner may not be dismissed if you can prove that your father was a partner in the firm and that he had contributed capital and was entitled to a share of profits as per the partnership deed. You may also have to prove that your father’s partner owes him money as per the audited financial statements of the firm. You may have to file a civil suit for recovery of money against your father’s partner in the court of competent jurisdiction.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Legality Of Partnership",
    "answer": "An unregistered partnership deed is still a valid agreement between the partners but has certain limitations. It cannot be used as evidence to settle disputes between partners or third parties in a court of law. Partners cannot enforce rights or obligations under the partnership deed against third parties.As a consequence of the non-registration of the firm,a partnership firm cannot approach the legal authorities for help in case of any dispute or breach of contract. To do so, the firm or the concerned partner has to have its name registered with the Registrar of Firms.a partner of an erstwhile unregistered partnership firm cannot bring a suit to enforce a right arising out of a contract hit by the provision of section 69 or the partnership act . However a suit by a partner to recover money from a third person is not barred by section 69 of the Act, if the transaction, involved in the suit, is in his own name only and the defendant had no notice of the existence of the partnershipT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "In India, partnerships can be registered or unregistered, and they are governed by the Indian Partnership Act, 1932. While it's ideal for partnerships to be registered, unregistered partnerships are not necessarily illegal.The fact that your father does not have a license for dealing in fertilizers may be a separate issue related to compliance with the Essential Commodities Act and other relevant regulations. This may need to be addressed separately from the partnership issue.Regarding the money your father is owed based on the partnership agreement, you may still have a valid claim for it. The partnership deed should outline the terms of capital contribution, remuneration, and profit-sharing. If your father's partner is not clearing the dues as per the agreement, your father may have legal recourse to recover the outstanding amount.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "COVID orphaned child custody and welfare",
    "answer": "The legal matters related to the custody and welfare of COVID orphaned children are governed by the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, which is a law that aims to protect the rights and interests of children in need of care and protection. The act provides for various mechanisms and authorities to deal with the cases of children who have lost their parents due to COVID-19 or any other reason. The act also provides for the rights and responsibilities of the relatives and guardians of such children.Some of the points that you should know about the custody and welfare of COVID orphaned children are:The custody and welfare of COVID orphaned children are primarily the responsibility of the state government and its agencies, such as the Child Welfare Committees (CWCs), the District Child Protection Units (DCPUs), and the Childline Services. These agencies are mandated to identify, verify, and rehabilitate such children as per the provisions of the act.The relatives and guardians of COVID orphaned children have a secondary responsibility to take care of such children. They can claim custody or guardianship of such children by applying to the CWCs or the courts having jurisdiction over the matter. They have to prove their relationship with the children and their ability and willingness to look after them. They also have to abide by the directions and conditions imposed by the CWCs or the courts regarding the welfare of the children.The CWCs or the courts have the power to decide the custody or guardianship of COVID orphaned children based on their best interest and welfare. They can consider various factors, such as the age, gender, preference, background, health, education, etc., of the children, as well as the suitability, capability, financial status, character, etc., of the relatives or guardians. They can also order periodic reports, visits, or reviews to monitor the well-being of the children.The relatives or guardians of COVID orphaned children have no right to sell or dispose of their property without their consent or permission from the CWCs or the courts. The property of such children is protected by law and can only be used for their benefit and welfare. The relatives or guardians have to maintain proper accounts and records of the property and income of such children and submit them to the CWCs or the courts as required.Based on these points, I can suggest some steps that you can take to claim your rights and ensure your nephews’ welfare:Contact your nearest CWC or DCPU or Childline Service and inform them about your situation. Provide them with all the relevant details and documents regarding your nephews’ parents’ death, your relationship with them, your financial status, etc.Apply for custody or guardianship of your nephews before the CWC or the court having jurisdiction over your area. Attach all the necessary documents and evidence to support your claim. You may hire a lawyer to represent you or appear in person.Attend the hearings and meetings with the CWC or the court and present your case. You may also request for a home study or a social investigation report to assess your suitability as a custodian or guardian.If you get an order for custody or guardianship in your favour, follow all the directions and conditions given by the CWC or the court regarding the care and protection of your nephews. You may also seek assistance from the DCPU or the Childline Service for any support or guidance.If you lose the case or are not satisfied with the order, you may appeal to a higher authority within the prescribed time limit. You may also seek stay of execution of the order by depositing security or giving an undertaking as directed by the authority.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "COVID orphaned child custody and welfare",
    "answer": "Dear client,When a child loses both parents, it's crucial to ensure their welfare and legal rights are protected. Here are some steps you can consider:Guardianship and Custody: Typically, when both parents pass away, legal guardianship and custody of the children must be determined by the court. As an uncle and grandfather, you and your father have a legal right to apply for guardianship of the children. The court will consider what is in the best interest of the children when making this decision.Child's Best Interests: The court's primary concern is the welfare and best interests of the children. Factors such as the children's age, their relationship with potential guardians, their emotional and physical well-being, and the stability of their environment will be considered in determining custody and guardianship.Property Rights: The property that belongs to the children should be protected for their future benefit. Generally, the legal guardian of the children will be responsible for managing and protecting their assets. If you have concerns that their property might be mismanaged or sold without consent, you should raise these concerns with the court during the guardianship proceedings.Consult with an Attorney: It's highly advisable to consult with a family law attorney in Tamil Nadu who can provide guidance specific to your situation. They can help you understand your legal rights, initiate the process of seeking custody or guardianship, and ensure the children's interests are protected.Mediation: If possible, consider discussing the situation with the children's current caregivers (your sister's husband's family) to see if an amicable arrangement can be reached that ensures the children's well-being. Mediation can sometimes be a way to resolve disputes without going through lengthy court proceedings.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Higher education loan: reduction in maintenance",
    "answer": "Maintenance is the amount payable by the husband to his wife in case she is unable to maintain herself either during the subsistence of the marriage or upon separation and divorce. Maintenance should include necessarily include a provision for residence. The amount of maintenance given to a wife is determined by various factors, such as the parties’ position and status, legitimate needs of the claimant, the claimant’s property worth and any income received from it, or from the claimant’s own income, or from any other source.According to Section 25 of theHindu Marriage Act,1955, the Applicant being either the husband or wife is entitled to receive his or her maintenance from the spouse in the form of a gross sum or monthly sum for a term not exceeding the lifetime of the applicant or until the applicant remarries. The court may vary, modify or rescind any such order in such manner as the court may deem just if it appears to the court that there is a change in the circumstances of either party at any time after it has been made.Therefore, if you take a loan for higher education, it may affect the amount of maintenance that you have to pay to your wife, depending on how it changes your income and expenses. The court may consider your education loan EMI as a factor while calculating maintenance, but it may not necessarily reduce the maintenance amount. The court may also look at other factors, such as your earning potential after completing your higher education, your wife’s financial needs and status, and the best interests of your children (if any).Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Can I get SC converted Christian as my caste ?",
    "answer": "It seems that you are facing a difficulty in claiming your caste as SC converted Christian. This is a complex issue that involves the interplay of religion, caste, and reservation in India.The legal matters related to the SC converted Christian caste are governed by the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order (Amendment) Act, 1990, and the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order (Second Amendment) Act, 2002. These laws specify the castes and communities that are recognized as Scheduled Castes (SC) for the purpose of reservation in public services and educational institutions under Article 341 of theConstitution of India. These laws also exclude persons who profess a religion different from Hinduism, Sikhism, or Buddhism from the SC categorySome of the points that you should know about the SC converted Christian caste are:The SC converted Christian caste is a term used to describe persons who belong to castes that are listed as SCs under the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, but have converted to Christianity from Hinduism, Sikhism, or Buddhism. These persons are not eligible for reservation benefits as SCs under the Constitution.The SC converted Christian caste is different from the Dalit Christian caste, which is a term used to describe persons who belong to castes that are not listed as SCs under the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, but have converted to Christianity from Hinduism, Sikhism, or Buddhism. These persons are also not eligible for reservation benefits as SCs under the Constitution.The SC converted Christian caste is also different from the Latin Catholic caste, which is a term used to describe persons who belong to castes that are listed as Other Backward Classes (OBCs) under the National Commission for Backward Classes Act, 1993. These persons are eligible for reservation benefits as OBCs under the Constitution.The SC converted Christian caste has been demanding for inclusion in the SC category for a long time, citing historical and social reasons. They have argued that they face double discrimination on the basis of religion and caste, and that their conversion has not changed their socio-economic status. They have also challenged the constitutional validity of the exclusion clause in the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 before various courts and commissions .The government has been opposing the demand for inclusion of SC converted Christians in the SC category, citing legal and policy reasons. They have argued that religion and caste are distinct concepts, and that conversion implies a change of identity and affiliation. They have also argued that inclusion of SC converted Christians in the SC category would violate the principle of secularism and affect the rights of other SCs .Based on these points, I can try to answer your queries as follows:You cannot get SC converted Christian as your caste under the current legal framework, as you are not eligible for reservation benefits as an SC under the Constitution. Your father’s re-conversion to Hinduism may not affect your status as an SC converted Christian, as it depends on your own profession of faith. Your mother’s Latin Catholic caste may also not affect your status as an SC converted Christian, as it depends on your own birth and descent.You may have taken your caste as SC converted Christian till date based on your family history and social identity. However, this may not be legally valid or acceptable for official purposes such as admission or employment. You may have to face legal issues if you claim reservation benefits as an SC based on your caste certificate or declaration.You may not be able to get an SC converted Christian claim under the current legal framework, as there is no provision for granting reservation benefits to SC converted Christians under the Constitution. However, you may be able to get some benefits under the OBC category if your caste is listed as an OBC by the state or central government.You may also be able to pursue your legal challenge against the exclusion clause in the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 before the Supreme Court or other competent authorities. However, this may take a long time and involve a lot of litigation and uncertainty.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Inheritance of property by HUF",
    "answer": "HUF stands for Hindu Undivided Family. It is a separate legal entity that can be formed by a Hindu family consisting of a common ancestor and his lineal descendants, along with their wives and unmarried daughters. A HUF can own property, run a business, invest in various assets, and file tax returns in its own name. A HUF has its own PAN and enjoys a separate basic tax exemption of Rs. 2.50 lakh in addition to the tax exemption of each of its members.To form a HUF, you need to follow these steps:Write an HUF deed on a stamp paper, stating the names of the HUF’s karta, coparceners and members. The karta is the senior-most male member who manages the affairs of the HUF. The coparceners are the male members who have a right to demand a share in the HUF property. The members are the female members and minor children who have a right to maintenance from the HUF.Apply for an HUF PAN card using Form 49A at the NSDL website.Open an HUF bank account.To transfer your property to your HUF, you need to execute a deed of assignment or gift in favour of your HUF, stating that you are transferring your individual rights in the property to your HUF as a gift or for consideration. You may have to pay stamp duty and registration charges on such transfer, depending on the state laws.When you sell the property as an HUF, you will have to pay capital gains tax on the difference between the sale price and the cost of acquisition or improvement of the property. The capital gains tax rate depends on whether the property is long-term or short-term, depending on the period of holding. Long-term capital gains are taxed at 20% with indexation benefit, while short-term capital gains are taxed at the normal slab rates applicable to the HUF. You can claim exemption from capital gains tax by investing the sale proceeds in another residential property or specified bonds under Section 54 or 54EC of the Income Tax Act.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "According to the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999, an Overseas Indian citizen, who is a person of Indian origin (PIO) or an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI), can inherit any immovable property in India from anyone, including their relatives. The property can be residential, commercial, agricultural or a farmhouse. The NRI can inherit property in India even from another NRI, subject to certain conditions.The process to register the property in the son’s name after inheriting it from the father may vary depending on the state and the type of property. However, some general steps are as follows:Obtain a legal heir certificate from the local authority or the court. This certificate establishes the relationship between the deceased and the legal heirs. It may require documents such as death certificate of the father, birth certificate of the son, identity proofs of the legal heirs, etc.Obtain a succession certificate from the court. This certificate grants the right to inherit the property to the legal heirs. It may require documents such as legal heir certificate, copy of the will (if any), affidavit by the legal heirs, etc.Transfer the title of the property in the son’s name by executing a relinquishment deed or a family settlement deed. These deeds are used to transfer the rights and interests of other legal heirs in favor of one heir. They have to be signed by all the legal heirs and attested by two witnesses. They also have to be stamped and registered with the sub-registrar of the area where the property is located.Pay the applicable stamp duty and registration fees for the transfer of property. The stamp duty and registration fees may vary depending on the state and the value of the property. They have to be paid online or offline before registering the deed.Update the revenue records of the property with the local authority or the revenue department. This is done to reflect the change in ownership and tax liability of the property. It may require documents such as copy of the registered deed, mutation application, identity proof of the son, etc.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Caught with 2 Litre Alcohol in Bihar & Completed 44 hrs Jail term in Central Jail Purnia",
    "answer": "You have been caught with alcohol in Bihar, where there is a complete prohibition of liquor since April 2016. According to the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016, any person who manufactures, bottles, distributes, transports, collects, stores, possesses, purchases, sells or consumes any intoxicant or liquor is liable to be punished with imprisonment and fine. The punishment may vary depending on the quantity of liquor involved and the number of offences committed. For example, if a person is caught with more than 5 litres of liquor for the first time, he may be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years and with fine which may extend to one lakh rupees.You have been arrested and sent to jail for 44 hours before getting bail. This means that you have a criminal record which may affect your job prospects in the government sector. According to a Supreme Court judgment, a person facing criminal cases cannot be considered suitable for appointment in government service unless acquitted of the charges. The court also held that the employer has the right to verify the antecedents of the candidates and reject those who have criminal cases pending against them.Therefore, if you want to apply for a government job, you may have to disclose your criminal record and face the possibility of rejection. You may also have to undergo a background verification process which may include checking your court records and police records. You may also have to produce a certificate of good conduct from the authorities concerned.However, you have also mentioned that no one called you regarding the case for one year. This may mean that the case has not been pursued by the prosecution or that there is some delay or error in the judicial process. You should try to find out the status of your case and whether it has been closed or not.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "context": "Asked 1 year ago in Property Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Father is not allowing my mother to sell his gifted property",
    "answer": "According to theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, you can file for divorce on two grounds: mutual consent or contested divorce.Mutual consent divorceis when both spouses agree to end their marriage amicably and settle all the issues related to alimony, child custody, and property division. Contested divorce is when one spouse files for divorce without the consent of the other spouse on certain grounds such as cruelty, adultery, desertion, conversion, mental disorder, etc.If your mother wants to file for a contested divorce, she will have to prove the ground on which she is seeking divorce in the court. She will also have to hire a lawyer who can represent her case and guide her through the legal process. The procedure of contested divorce may vary depending on the location and the court where the petition is filed. Generally, it involves the following steps:Filing of a petition: The spouse who wants to file for divorce has to prepare a petition stating the facts and grounds of the case. The petition has to be filed in the family court or district court where the spouses last resided together or where the marriage was solemnized.Service of notice: The court will issue a notice to the other spouse along with a copy of the petition. The other spouse has to file a written statement in response to the petition within a specified time limit.Framing of issues: The court will examine the petition and the written statement and frame the issues that need to be decided in the case. The issues may relate to the grounds of divorce, alimony, child custody, property division, etc.Evidence and cross-examination: Both spouses have to submit their evidence and documents to support their claims and allegations. They also have to cross-examine each other and their witnesses in the court.Arguments and judgment: After the completion of evidence and cross-examination, both spouses have to present their arguments before the judge. The judge will then pass a judgment granting or dismissing the divorce petition.The duration of a contested divorce may vary depending on the complexity of the case and the pendency of cases in the court. It may take anywhere from six months to several years for a contested divorce to be finalized.If your mother wants to sell the gifted property that your father gave her, she will have to prove that she has a valid title over it. A gift deed is a legal document that describes the voluntary transfer of a property from a donor (owner of the property) to a donee (receiver of gift) without any monetary favor in return. The donor should not be insolvent and should not use this as a tool for evasion of tax and illegal gains.Registering a gift deed with the sub-registrar is mandatory under the laws in India (Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908 and Section 123 of theTransfer of Property Act.) If this is not done, the transfer will be invalid. Once a gift deed is registered, only then the change in the title of ownership of property is possible.If your father is not allowing your mother to sell the gifted property, he may be challenging the validity of the gift deed or claiming that he has revoked it. A gift deed can be revoked by mutual consent of both parties or by rescinding it in a court of law on certain grounds such as fraud, coercion, undue influence, mistake, etc.Your mother may have to file a suit for declaration and injunction in a civil court to assert her right over the gifted property and restrain your father from interfering with it. She will have to produce the registered gift deed and other documents to prove her title over it. She will also have to hire a lawyer who can represent her case and guide her through the legal process.The procedure of filing a suit for declaration and injunction may vary depending on the location and the court where it is filed. Generally, it involves the following steps:Filing of plaint: The plaintiff (your mother) has to prepare a plaint stating the facts and relief sought in the case. The plaint has to be filed in the civil court having jurisdiction over the matter along with court fees and other documents.Service of summons: The court will issue summons to the defendant (your father) along with a copy of plaint. The defendant has to file a written statement in response to plaint within a specified time limit.Framing of issues: The court will examine plaint and written statement and frame issues that need to be decided in case. The issues may relate to validity of gift deed, title over property, revocation of gift deed etc.Evidence and cross-examination: Both parties have to submit their evidence and documents to support their claims and allegations. They also have cross-examine each other and their witnesses in court.Arguments and judgment: After completion of evidence and cross-examination, both parties have to present their arguments before judge. The judge will then pass a judgment granting or dismissing the suit.The duration of a suit for declaration and injunction may vary depending on the complexity of the case and the pendency of cases in the court. It may take anywhere from six months to several years for a suit to be finalized.I hope this information helps you understand the legal options available to you and your mother.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

Only a title deed can prove the seller’s absolute ownership over that property.A typical sale deed usually includes all the basic details of the buyer as well as the seller. Moreover, this document is used to prove that the property’s title has been conveyed to the new buyer by the seller.it’s essential for the seller to clear all the taxes and ensure that the local municipal corporation hasn’t issued any such penalties.When purchasing any land in Hyderabad, the 7/12 extract document is one of the most important documents. This document involves information such as survey numbers and the current owner’s name registration date.A building plan approval is one of the most important legal documents in Hyderabad that you should check before buying a flat. As per the RERA act, every property developer must obtain a building plan approval.The commencement certificate and occupancy certificate are other important documents to check. A builder can obtain the Commencement Certificate issued by GHCM.Before buying any property or flat in Hyderabad, it’s always better to take care of all the legal documents that are required for the purchase and also obtain a proper legal opinion before purchase."

    "question": "Exhaustive checklist for buying a plot in Gram panchayat layout in Telangana",
    "answer": "A Gram panchayat layout refers to a plot arrangement approved by the Gram panchayat, the governing body in rural regions. Such layouts might not always have clearance from the Director of Town and Country Planning (DTCP) or the Urban Development Authority (UDA). Purchasing a plot in these layouts can pose risks like unclear titles or lack of amenities.When considering a plot in a Gram panchayat layout in Telangana, here's a checklist:Title Deed Verification: Ensure the land's title deed, the main ownership document, is clear and authenticated by the sub-registrar’s office.Encumbrance Certificate (EC): This certificate shows the land's transaction history for a minimum of 30 years and should be free from any claims.Layout Approval Certificate: It certifies the plot layout's approval by the relevant authority, either Gram panchayat, DTCP, or UDA. Also, ensure RERA registration.Land Use Certificate: Ensure the land's conversion from agricultural to non-agricultural residential use, obtained from the revenue department.GO 111 Area Check: Ensure the land doesn't fall under the GO 111 area that restricts construction near Himayatsagar and Osmansagar lakes.R1 Zone Check: Verify if the land is in the R1 residential zone, which allows specific housing development parameters.Document Verification: Ensure related documents like sale agreement, mutation record, tax receipts, etc., are accurate and updated.Amenities Check: Assess basic facilities like road access, water, electricity, drainage, and confirm no pending dues on these services.Professional Help: Engage a lawyer for legal document reviews and a surveyor for accurate plot measurements.In essence, while purchasing a plot in Telangana's Gram panchayat layout, thorough due diligence is essential to avoid potential pitfalls.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

If the first sale occurred in 1968 and there has been no challenge or legal action taken against it for several decades, it's possible that any time limit for challenging the sale may have expired.

    "question": "Federation rights over housing society",
    "answer": "In India, housing societies are governed by the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960. Generally, the federation or managing body of the housing societies has the authority to regulate and manage common areas, which may include stilt parking spaces. They often require documentation for various purposes, such as issuing parking stickers or ensuring compliance with society rules.However, the exact authority and rules may vary depending on the specific bylaws and regulations of your housing federation. It's essential to review your society's bylaws and the cooperative society's rules to understand the extent of their authority regarding parking areas and document requests.If you believe that the federation is overstepping its authority or making unreasonable requests, you may want to consult with a legal expert specializing in property and cooperative society matters for guidance on how to address the situation and protect your rights as a member of the housing society.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Federation rights over housing society",
    "answer": "A federation of housing societies is essentially a collective of cooperative housing societies registered under Maharashtra's legal framework. While it can offer various services like guidance, arbitration, and representation to its member societies, it doesn't possess the authority to interfere in a member society's internal affairs without explicit authorization.Functions of the Federation: The federation can guide, assist, arbitrate, and represent its member societies.Limitations of the Federation: It cannot intrude in a member society's management unless given permission either by the society's general body or the Registrar of Cooperative Societies. It is bound by the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act and Rules, and cannot impose conditions conflicting with these regulations. For instance, the federation cannot demand parking ownership documents or flat ownership papers unrelated to its objectives.Addressing Disputes: If disagreements arise between a housing society and the federation, attempts for amicable resolutions through discussions or mediation are recommended. If these don't work, societies can approach the Registrar of Cooperative Societies or the Cooperative Court for resolution.Regarding the stilt parking:Ownership and Sale: Stilt parking spaces are categorized as common areas in a cooperative housing society. Builders or promoters can't sell them according to the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA) and the Maharashtra Ownership Flats Act, 1963 (MOFA). They can only charge for the construction costs, not for land or FSI.Addressing Overcharge: If someone purchased stilt parking space from a builder in 2004, they might have a claim against the builder for overcharging. Legal actions, such as sending a notice demanding a refund with interest and compensation, can be initiated. If unresolved, one can approach consumer forums or RERA authorities for redressal.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Legal heir",
    "answer": "Dear client,1. The transfer of Rs.10,00,000 from your father to you, even if it's being done via cheque, can be construed in different ways by tax authorities. If this transaction is being classified as repayment of a loan, it wouldn't be considered as income. In this scenario, the money you gave your father over the years would be treated as a loan, and the repayment would not attract any tax liability. Second scenario is If authorities view this transfer as a gift from your father, it might not be taxable either, as gifts from relatives are generally not taxed in India. If the total amount received as a gift exceeds Rs.50,000 in a financial year, it's taxable as 'income from other sources', except in specific exempted cases (gift from relatives being one such exemption).To ensure that the transaction is perceived as either a gift or a loan repayment, you can take certain steps. If the initial transfer of Rs.10,00,000 was intended as a loan, ensure you have documentation supporting this. Any written agreement or record of the transactions (bank statements, transfer receipts, or any written acknowledgment of the loan) can help establish that it wasn't a gift but a loan extended to your father. When your father repays the Rs.10,00,000, ensure there's documentation acknowledging this repayment. This could be a simple agreement or a receipt stating that the amount has been repaid by your father to you as per the terms of the loan agreement. If there were any discussions, emails, or messages regarding the nature of the transaction (loan or gift), keep these records safe. They can serve as evidence if needed to establish the intention behind the transfer. Seek advice from a tax consultant or a chartered accountant. They can review the documentation, understand the specifics of your situation, and provide guidance on how to present the transaction to tax authorities to ensure it's treated as a loan repayment or a gift, whichever is applicable and more advantageous for you tax-wise.2. If the agreement is for your father to repay you Rs.10,00,000 without interest, requesting him to issue multiple cheques totaling Rs.10,00,000 but with amounts less than Rs.1,00,000 each could be seen as an attempt to avoid certain banking and tax regulations. In India, banks report transactions of Rs.10,00,000 or more to the Income Tax Department. Splitting the repayment into smaller amounts to avoid this reporting threshold might raise suspicions and could be seen as an attempt to avoid tax scrutiny. It's important to be transparent in financial dealings, especially when dealing with significant amounts. Instead of trying to structure the repayment in a way that raises questions, focus on documenting the repayment properly with a clear acknowledgment that the Rs.10,00,000 received is the repayment of the loan. Proper documentation and transparency in the transaction will support your case if there are any inquiries from tax authorities.3.

    "answer": "In Mumbai, Maharashtra, the rules and regulations regarding property transactions, including gift deeds, are subject to the Stamp Act of Maharashtra. When a property is transferred through a gift deed, it may be subject to stamp duty.The payment of stamp duty typically falls on the person who is receiving the gifted property, which in this case is the daughter. It is the daughter's responsibility to pay the stamp duty associated with the gift deed. The amount of stamp duty can vary based on the market value of the property, the relationship between the donor (mother) and the donee (daughter), and other factors.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"
