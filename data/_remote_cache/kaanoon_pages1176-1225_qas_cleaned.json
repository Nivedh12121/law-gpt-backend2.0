    "answer": "There is no requirement to obtain NOC by Australian immigration for applying for skilled migrant visa to Australia.The demand for skilled workers in Australia is high. Both academic and (even more so) trade occupations are in high demand and have good prospects for obtaining an Australian visa.Qualified professionals in particular are offered visa subclasses based on a points-tested basis, as these often lead to a permanent residency with a work permit. The points-test-based visa subclass is an interesting option for qualified workers because these are predominantly permanent visas.This visa is available for individuals with specific qualifications and experience. The Australian Government analyses the future demand for skilled workers and publishes the relevant occupations on the Skilled Occupations Lists.A skills assessment is required prior to application for this visa. An assessing authority assesses whether the individual’s qualifications are applicable and relevant to the occupation in question.For this particular visa subclass, eligible skilled workers are in demand Australia-wide. As such, the Australian Government grants applicants permanent residency status immediately without certain residency and workplace requirements.

Therefore, it should be impressed upon all the Courts that they should accept the charge-sheet whenever it is produced by the police with any endorsement to be made on the charge-sheet by the staff or the Magistrate pertaining to any omission or requirement in the charge-sheet.3)The word “custody” appearing in Section 170 of the Cr.P.C. does not contemplate either police or judicial custody but it merely connotes the presentation of the accused by the Investigating Officer before the court while filing the chargesheet.4) in response to your second query it does appear letter from IO is contrary to SC judgement5)any person who is willing to take responsibility for the accusedcan act as a surety. It can be a family member, friend, or any individual willing to vouch for the accused's appearance in court6)person can stand surety to more than one accused person, but he needs to make a declaration regarding this before the Court.7) Courts insists production of property documents. Sometimes, in lieu of the same, Courts demand production of RC books of two-wheelers, four-wheelers, etc.8)some times an accused, who is an utter stranger to the area or he has no friends or relatives in the area or he could not secure a person to stand as surety can offer cash surety. The Court can accept cash surety, instead of personal surety. But the Court cannot demand personal surety, property surety and cash surety, at a time. It is not cumulative. It is alternative.9) you can go abroad for work purposes or education if no conditions are imposed by court while granting bailotherwise you need court permission to travel abroad10) fixed deposit can work as surety11) discharge is good optionAjay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

After your grandmother's lifetime, her 25% undivided share shall devolve on her 2 daughters equally, and NOT upon you and your brother.

    "answer": "Dear clientYes, you might be able to recover the loan amount you paid on your brother's behalf, with the loan agreement and bank statements as evidence. Here's how:1. Written Agreement:The strongest option is a written agreement between you and your brother. This agreement should clearly state:The amount you loaned him (your payments towards the loan).The interest rate (optional, but strengthens your claim).The repayment schedule.Signatures from both of you.2. Verbal Agreement with Documentation:If you don't have a written agreement, your situation can still be addressed, but it might be more challenging.The loan agreement and bank statements showing your payments can be used as evidence of your contribution.Steps to Recover the Amount:Communication:Talk to your brother openly about your situation.Documentation:Gather all documentation:Loan agreement (both your names should be on it).Bank statements highlighting your payments towards the loan.Repayment Plan:Work out a repayment plan with your brother that is comfortable for both of you.Formalize the Agreement (Optional):While a verbal agreement might work, consider getting a written repayment plan signed by both of you. This strengthens your claim in case of future disagreements.Legal Action (Last Resort):If your brother is unwilling to cooperate, you might have to consider legal action. This should be a last resort due to potential strain on your relationship.Key Points:Having a clear agreement upfront protects both you and your brother.Open communication is crucial throughout the process.Legal action should be a last resort.Additional Considerations:Tax implications: Depending on your location, there might be tax implications for the interest charged on the loan to your brother. Consulting a tax advisor might be helpful."

If such situation occurs, a true owner extinguishes his ownership over the property.You have stated to have occupied the property on the basis of unregistered sale deed around 4 decades ago, hence it would be better that you get the title declared through a court of lawIn your case even if you have rented the property , you are termed to be still occupied and cannot be said that you are out of your possession.You are in continuous possession of the proeprty hence if there is any dispute regarding your title at the time of redevelopment then it is pertinent that you need to establish yor title to the property in the legally valid manner.If you are not knowing the name and address of the original vendor you can send the notice to the vendor to his last known address after which you can file a suit.This is a bit big subject hence you need to consult  and discuss in person with an experienced lawyer, and if you are really serious to solve the issue then you can take steps to solve them legally.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

In case an owner does not stake his claim over his property for 12 years, a squatter can acquire legal rights over the property.  The prescribed period in case of for government-owned properties is 30 years.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

While the original deed may only mention the super built area, if the local regulations require both super built and carpet area to be specified, it might be necessary to include an estimate of the carpet area. However, it's essential to ensure that any estimates provided are accurate and clearly disclosed as approximations. It's generally advisable to adhere to the requirements specified for submitting queries, as failure to do so might result in rejection or delays in processing. If the lawyer had to include the carpet area in the query to meet regulatory standards, it might not be feasible to exclude it in the gift deed without potentially facing complications or non-compliance issues. It's possible to mention in the gift deed that your father is transferring his share of the super built area of the flat to you, especially if you jointly hold the flat with him. However, it's crucial to ensure that the language used in the deed accurately reflects the terms of the transfer and complies with legal requirements.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This agreement should clearly state:The amount you loaned him (your payments towards the loan).The interest rate (optional, but strengthens your claim).The repayment schedule.Signatures from both of you.2. Verbal Agreement with Documentation:If you don't have a written agreement, your situation can still be addressed, but it might be more challenging.The loan agreement and bank statements showing your payments can be used as evidence of your contribution.Steps to Recover the Amount:Communication:Talk to your brother openly about your situation.Documentation:Gather all documentation:Loan agreement (both your names should be on it).Bank statements highlighting your payments towards the loan.Repayment Plan:Work out a repayment plan with your brother that is comfortable for both of you.Formalize the Agreement (Optional):While a verbal agreement might work, consider getting a written repayment plan signed by both of you. This strengthens your claim in case of future disagreements.Legal Action (Last Resort):If your brother is unwilling to cooperate, you might have to consider legal action. This should be a last resort due to potential strain on your relationship.Key Points:Having a clear agreement upfront protects both you and your brother.Open communication is crucial throughout the process.Legal action should be a last resort.Additional Considerations:Tax implications: Depending on your location, there might be tax implications for the interest charged on the loan to your brother.

    "answer": "A suit seeking declaration of title by operating the law of adverse possession can be filed after 12 years of continuous possession of the propertyIf a person claiming title or  ownership on the basis of the registered title deed on his name, fails to file suit for recovery of possession, within a period of limitation, his right to recover the possession of that property also extinguishes. If such situation occurs, a true owner extinguishes his ownership over the property.You have stated to have occupied the property on the basis of unregistered sale deed around 4 decades ago, hence it would be better that you get the title declared through a court of lawIn your case even if you have rented the property , you are termed to be still occupied and cannot be said that you are out of your possession.You are in continuous possession of the proeprty hence if there is any dispute regarding your title at the time of redevelopment then it is pertinent that you need to establish yor title to the property in the legally valid manner.If you are not knowing the name and address of the original vendor you can send the notice to the vendor to his last known address after which you can file a suit.This is a bit big subject hence you need to consult  and discuss in person with an experienced lawyer, and if you are really serious to solve the issue then you can take steps to solve them legally.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "- After a long period of 40 years the sale deed cannot be executed only on the ground of share certificate- Further, the appearance of both parties are required before the Registrar for the execution of the sale deed , and hence if the earlier owner is not traceable then it cannot be registered , and even a deed of confirmation also not possible- Further, as per law , A sale deed is the proof that the property has been legally transferred in your name, whereas a share certificate is legal proof that you are the rightful owner of the co-operative housing society's shares.- Hence, a share certificate cannot be considered as title deed of the property- You can file a suit for declaration before the court for declaring legal owner of the property on the ground of adverse possession- As per Supreme court Judgment, provisions on adverse possession are made under the Limitation Act, 1963. In case an owner does not stake his claim over his property for 12 years, a squatter can acquire legal rights over the property.  The prescribed period in case of for government-owned properties is 30 years.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

If it is intentional it ceases to be amistake.If the bidder is reported to have committed any error or mistake and if it was not given a serious thought, then the relaxation in favour of onebidder would create justifiable doubts in the minds of otherbidders, would impair the rule of transparency and fairness and provide room for manipulation to suit the whims of the State agencies in picking and choosing abidder for awarding contracts as in the case of distributing bounty or charity.However you may consult a local lawyer with all papers or revert back with more details if you are really serious to get proper opinions to your queryT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

Written Agreement:The strongest option is a written agreement between you and your brother. This agreement should clearly state:The amount you loaned him (your payments towards the loan).The interest rate (optional, but strengthens your claim).The repayment schedule.Signatures from both of you.2. Verbal Agreement with Documentation:If you don't have a written agreement, your situation can still be addressed, but it might be more challenging.The loan agreement and bank statements showing your payments can be used as evidence of your contribution.Steps to Recover the Amount:Communication:Talk to your brother openly about your situation.Documentation:Gather all documentation:Loan agreement (both your names should be on it).Bank statements highlighting your payments towards the loan.Repayment Plan:Work out a repayment plan with your brother that is comfortable for both of you.Formalize the Agreement (Optional):While a verbal agreement might work, consider getting a written repayment plan signed by both of you. This strengthens your claim in case of future disagreements.Legal Action (Last Resort):If your brother is unwilling to cooperate, you might have to consider legal action. This should be a last resort due to potential strain on your relationship.Key Points:Having a clear agreement upfront protects both you and your brother.Open communication is crucial throughout the process.Legal action should be a last resort.Additional Considerations:Tax implications: Depending on your location, there might be tax implications for the interest charged on the loan to your brother. Consulting a tax advisor might be helpful."

    "question": "Is it too late to get property registered with Sub-Registrar i.e. after some 40 years?",
    "answer": "- After a long period of 40 years the sale deed cannot be executed only on the ground of share certificate- Further, the appearance of both parties are required before the Registrar for the execution of the sale deed , and hence if the earlier owner is not traceable then it cannot be registered , and even a deed of confirmation also not possible- Further, as per law , A sale deed is the proof that the property has been legally transferred in your name, whereas a share certificate is legal proof that you are the rightful owner of the co-operative housing society's shares.- Hence, a share certificate cannot be considered as title deed of the property- You can file a suit for declaration before the court for declaring legal owner of the property on the ground of adverse possession- As per Supreme court Judgment, provisions on adverse possession are made under the Limitation Act, 1963. In case an owner does not stake his claim over his property for 12 years, a squatter can acquire legal rights over the property.  The prescribed period in case of for government-owned properties is 30 years.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

If it is intentional it ceases to be amistake.If the bidder is reported to have committed any error or mistake and if it was not given a serious thought, then the relaxation in favour of onebidder would create justifiable doubts in the minds of otherbidders, would impair the rule of transparency and fairness and provide room for manipulation to suit the whims of the State agencies in picking and choosing abidder for awarding contracts as in the case of distributing bounty or charity.However you may consult a local lawyer with all papers or revert back with more details if you are really serious to get proper opinions to your queryT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

Written Agreement:The strongest option is a written agreement between you and your brother. This agreement should clearly state:The amount you loaned him (your payments towards the loan).The interest rate (optional, but strengthens your claim).The repayment schedule.Signatures from both of you.2. Verbal Agreement with Documentation:If you don't have a written agreement, your situation can still be addressed, but it might be more challenging.The loan agreement and bank statements showing your payments can be used as evidence of your contribution.Steps to Recover the Amount:Communication:Talk to your brother openly about your situation.Documentation:Gather all documentation:Loan agreement (both your names should be on it).Bank statements highlighting your payments towards the loan.Repayment Plan:Work out a repayment plan with your brother that is comfortable for both of you.Formalize the Agreement (Optional):While a verbal agreement might work, consider getting a written repayment plan signed by both of you. This strengthens your claim in case of future disagreements.Legal Action (Last Resort):If your brother is unwilling to cooperate, you might have to consider legal action. This should be a last resort due to potential strain on your relationship.Key Points:Having a clear agreement upfront protects both you and your brother.Open communication is crucial throughout the process.Legal action should be a last resort.Additional Considerations:Tax implications: Depending on your location, there might be tax implications for the interest charged on the loan to your brother. Consulting a tax advisor might be helpful."

The police will take action against you on the above lines.4. They will wait and implicate you in some other false cases too as a revenge to your such acts.5.

    "question": "Can police file defamation case If I go to press on a false case they implicated on me",
    "answer": "I understand you're in a frustrating situation with the police case and considering going to the press. Here's a breakdown of your questions and some guidance:1. Challenging the Conviction:Reopening the case in the same court is unlikely. However, you can appeal the conviction to a higher court. A lawyer can advise on the best approach based on the specifics of your case.The inconsistencies in the police statements (SI vs. Constable) strengthen your case for appeal. A lawyer can highlight these discrepancies in the appeal.2. Press Interview:You can discuss the case with the press, but be mindful of what you say.Sticking to the facts in the charge sheet and court order is crucial. Avoid making unsubstantiated accusations.Defamation laws exist, but if you stay truthful and avoid personal attacks, the police filing a defamation case is less likely.3. Using Police Photos:Using the police officers' WhatsApp photos requires caution. Copyright laws might apply, and using them without permission could lead to legal trouble.4. Defamation Case Implications:If the police sue for defamation, the amount claimed can vary. The burden of proof lies on them to show your statements were false and caused them harm.5. Imprisonment:Since you paid the fine, you don't face imprisonment. Going to the press shouldn't change that.6. Other Legal Issues:There's a possibility of the police filing a counter-case for obstructing a public servant (original charge), but it depends on their actions.Consulting a lawyer specializing in media law can help you navigate the press conference and minimize legal risks.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear clientYes, you might be able to recover the loan amount you paid on your brother's behalf, with the loan agreement and bank statements as evidence. Here's how:1. Written Agreement:The strongest option is a written agreement between you and your brother. This agreement should clearly state:The amount you loaned him (your payments towards the loan).The interest rate (optional, but strengthens your claim).The repayment schedule.Signatures from both of you.2. Verbal Agreement with Documentation:If you don't have a written agreement, your situation can still be addressed, but it might be more challenging.The loan agreement and bank statements showing your payments can be used as evidence of your contribution.Steps to Recover the Amount:Communication:Talk to your brother openly about your situation.Documentation:Gather all documentation:Loan agreement (both your names should be on it).Bank statements highlighting your payments towards the loan.Repayment Plan:Work out a repayment plan with your brother that is comfortable for both of you.Formalize the Agreement (Optional):While a verbal agreement might work, consider getting a written repayment plan signed by both of you. This strengthens your claim in case of future disagreements.Legal Action (Last Resort):If your brother is unwilling to cooperate, you might have to consider legal action. This should be a last resort due to potential strain on your relationship.Key Points:Having a clear agreement upfront protects both you and your brother.Open communication is crucial throughout the process.Legal action should be a last resort.Additional Considerations:Tax implications: Depending on your location, there might be tax implications for the interest charged on the loan to your brother. Consulting a tax advisor might be helpful."

This creates a complex jurisdictional issue.Potential Courses of Action:Indian Courts:For mushlim, polygamy is legal in India, proving a marriage happening abroad can be challenging. However, you can still explore options in an Indian court:Nullity of Marriage: Since the husband allegedly took a second wife without a proper divorce,  or consultation with your sister. your sister can file for a declaration of nullity of marriage in an Indian court. This would legally invalidate their marriage from the beginning.Domestic Violence: If your sister experienced any emotional or financial abuse during the marriage in India, she can file adomestic violencecase against her husband.Considering Saudi Arabia:Polygamy is legal in Saudi Arabia. However, certain conditions need to be met, including the first wife's consent and fair treatment of all wives.

It's generally advisable to adhere to the requirements specified for submitting queries, as failure to do so might result in rejection or delays in processing.

    "question": "What is the difference between Multiple Enquiries and Further Investigation?",
    "answer": "Difference between Investigation and Inquiry: Investigation involves a systematic process of examining and gathering evidence to uncover facts or resolve a specific matter, often pertaining to legal or serious issues. On the other hand, inquiry refers to a less formal exploration or seeking of information to gain understanding or knowledge about a subject..Section 169 of the CrPC reads as under:“169. Release of accused when evidence deficient.—If, upon an investigation under this Chapter, it appears to theofficer in charge of the police station that there is not sufficientevidence or reasonable ground of suspicion to justify theforwarding of the accused to a Magistrate, such officer shall, ifsuch person is in custody, release him on his executing a bond,with or without sureties, as such officer may direct, to appear, ifand when so required, before a Magistrate empowered to takecognizance of the offence on a police report, and to try theaccused or commit him for trial.”Reinvestigation defined:the act or process of carefully examining a crime, problem, statement, etc. again, especially to discover the truth. Understanding the Concept of Further InvestigationAs a result, if a charge-sheet has been filed, the investigating agency may conduct additional investigations, and the Court may order more investigations.

    "question": "What is the difference between Multiple Enquiries and Further Investigation?",
    "answer": "Dear clientHere's the breakdown of the difference between Multiple Enquiries and Further Investigation after a chargesheet:Multiple Enquiries:This refers to situations where the police reopen a closed investigation after giving a \"clean chit\" (finding no criminal wrongdoing).This can be harassing for the accused, who thought the matter was settled.The High Court is concerned about this practice, as it can be misused to target individuals.Further Investigation:This refers to the continuation of the original investigation after a chargesheet is filed.This is done if new evidence comes to light or there are loose ends that need tying up.It's a legitimate investigative tool, but only if done with proper justification.In your scenario:The police conducting further investigation and potentially discharging the accused seems like a legitimate use of their power.The High Court's request for a list of multiple enquiries shouldn't be seen as interference in this specific case.They are likely looking at broader trends and want to ensure further investigations are conducted only when necessary, not to reopen settled cases.Key Points:Multiple enquiries raise concerns about harassment and misuse of power.Further investigation is a valid tool for ongoing cases with new evidence.The High Court is likely trying to differentiate between the two practices.Additional Notes:Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Tenancy law for daughters",
    "answer": "The pagdi system was legalised by the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999. Generally, upon the death of a pagdi tenant, the tenancy rights are transferred to the legal heir/s who were living in the flat when the tenant died, by asking the landlord to issue the new rent receipts in the heir/s name/s.An agreement with the tenant will come to an end on the death of the tenant, the heirs will have no rights in the name of tenancy rights, they can stay there for a further period of one year/5 year as per the tenancy protection rights in the event of the death of tenant, therefore the so called legal heirs cannot claim tenancy rights or rental agreement in their names or object to the new rental agreement to the son of the deceased tenant in any manner and no such objections will sustain in law.Son selling off the property recently, by himself.In pagadi system though in literal language it is called as selling of the property, legallyNobody can claim a share in it as a right in any capacity, all such things have to be settled by a meeting among the family members only.As a matter of fact if you were not living or were with your father into the business at the time of his death, you can't claim inheritance of tenancy rights too.Thus better settle the matter amicably because in your family dispute the landlord will take benefit and throw everyone out of the shop without giving any benefits to anyone.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "I understand this is a stressful situation. Here's some guidance on property inheritance and dealing with your brother in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, considering your Hindu religion:Inheritance Rights:In a Hindu Undivided Family (HUF), sons (including brothers) and daughters have coparcenary rights in ancestral property (inherited from grandparents or further generations).Since your mother passed away, her share would devolve upon your father and then be distributed as per the will or intestacy laws.Deed of Distribution:If your father has a registered deed dividing the assets, it will supersede intestacy laws and dictate the distribution of property.Selling the House:Selling While Father Alive:With a deed: If the deed allows selling the house, all co-owners (including your brother) must consent to the sale.Without a deed: All coparceners (father, you, and brother) have equal rights, and everyone's consent is required.Selling Part of the House (Floor-wise):This is not common in India but can be achieved through a partition suit in court. However, it's a complex and time-consuming process.Dealing with Brother:Negotiation:Try mediation or involving a respected family member to convince your brother to agree to a sale.Partition Suit:If negotiation fails, consider filing a partition suit in court to divide the property by metes and bounds (dividing the physical property) or selling it and dividing the proceeds.Legal Action Against Brother:Police Help:While police can't evict your brother as a co-owner, they can intervene if his behavior amounts to harassment or threats.Suit for Injunction:You or your father can file a suit for injunction to restrain your brother's disruptive behavior and ensure peaceful co-existence.Recommendations:Consult a lawyer specializing in property inheritance and family disputes in Lucknow. They can review the deed (if any) and advise on the most suitable course of action, including:Enforcing the terms of the deed (if it allows selling the house).Filing a partition suit if selling the entire house isn't feasible.Filing a suit for injunction against your brother's disruptive behavior."

This could complicate identifying the source of funds used for the plot.Gift Documentation:A documented gift from your mother significantly strengthens your case.Intestacy Laws:Each state has its own laws regarding inheritance without a will. Knowing your state's laws is crucial.Recommendations:Consult a Lawyer:A lawyer specializing in property and inheritance law in your state can analyze your situation and advise on the best course of action.Gather Documents:Collect documents like bank statements showing the transfer from the joint account to your account, gift documents from your mother (if any), and land ownership/EMI payment proofs.Communication:Try to have an open conversation with your sister. Explain your perspective and show the documents. Perhaps you can reach an amicable agreement.Possible Outcomes:Agreement:Hopefully, with clear evidence and open communication, you and your sister can reach a mutually agreeable solution.Legal Battle:If no agreement is reached, a lawsuit might be necessary. A lawyer can represent you and fight for your ownership of the plot.Protecting Your Plot:Having a strong legal case with the documented financial trail and potentially involving a lawyer in communication with your sister can help deter her from taking legal action."

Section 70 of the stringent Prevention of Money Laundering Act deals with offences by companies.The provision states: “Where a person committing a contravention of any of the provisions of this Act or of any rule, direction or order made thereunder is a company, every person who, at the time the contravention was committed, was in charge of and was responsible to the company, for the conduct of the business of the company as well as the company, shall be deemed to be guilty of the contravention and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly.”While a political party is not a “company” incorporated under the Companies Act, 2013, the provision has a crucial explanation that could bring a political party under the ambit of the anti-money laundering law.Under this, a “company” means any body corporate and includes a firm or other association of individuals.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

While the original deed may only mention the super built area, if the local regulations require both super built and carpet area to be specified, it might be necessary to include an estimate of the carpet area. However, it's essential to ensure that any estimates provided are accurate and clearly disclosed as approximations. It's generally advisable to adhere to the requirements specified for submitting queries, as failure to do so might result in rejection or delays in processing. If the lawyer had to include the carpet area in the query to meet regulatory standards, it might not be feasible to exclude it in the gift deed without potentially facing complications or non-compliance issues. It's possible to mention in the gift deed that your father is transferring his share of the super built area of the flat to you, especially if you jointly hold the flat with him.

While the original deed may only mention the super built area, if the local regulations require both super built and carpet area to be specified, it might be necessary to include an estimate of the carpet area. However, it's essential to ensure that any estimates provided are accurate and clearly disclosed as approximations. It's generally advisable to adhere to the requirements specified for submitting queries, as failure to do so might result in rejection or delays in processing. If the lawyer had to include the carpet area in the query to meet regulatory standards, it might not be feasible to exclude it in the gift deed without potentially facing complications or non-compliance issues. It's possible to mention in the gift deed that your father is transferring his share of the super built area of the flat to you, especially if you jointly hold the flat with him. However, it's crucial to ensure that the language used in the deed accurately reflects the terms of the transfer and complies with legal requirements.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

While the original deed may only mention the super built area, if the local regulations require both super built and carpet area to be specified, it might be necessary to include an estimate of the carpet area.

It's generally advisable to adhere to the requirements specified for submitting queries, as failure to do so might result in rejection or delays in processing.

    "answer": "Muslim can remarry during subsistence of earlier marriage as per Muslim personal law but consent of first wife is necessary2)Can't Compel Wife To Live With Muslim Husband Who Has Married Again Against Her Will If It Isn't Equitable: Allahabad High Court3) you can file for divorce on grounds of cruelty4) One of the most ingredients to attract the offence under section 494 IPC is that the second marriage should be void. So far as Muslim males are concerned, since they can have four wives living at a time, the second marriage is not void. Since the second marriage is not void, the offence under section 494 IPC is not attracted, even if the Muslim male marries a second woman.5)Even Section 494, Penal Code, which makes bigamy an offence applies to Parsis, Christians and others, but not to Muslims because polygamy is recognized as a valid institution when a Muslim male marries more than one wife.Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "answer": "I understand this is a difficult situation for your family. Here's what you can do:Legal Jurisdiction:While your sister's marriage happened in India, her husband currently resides in Saudi Arabia. This creates a complex jurisdictional issue.Potential Courses of Action:Indian Courts:For mushlim, polygamy is legal in India, proving a marriage happening abroad can be challenging. However, you can still explore options in an Indian court:Nullity of Marriage: Since the husband allegedly took a second wife without a proper divorce,  or consultation with your sister. your sister can file for a declaration of nullity of marriage in an Indian court. This would legally invalidate their marriage from the beginning.Domestic Violence: If your sister experienced any emotional or financial abuse during the marriage in India, she can file adomestic violencecase against her husband.Considering Saudi Arabia:Polygamy is legal in Saudi Arabia. However, certain conditions need to be met, including the first wife's consent and fair treatment of all wives. Here, legal options are limited for your sister as she isn't residing in Saudi Arabia.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

While the law protects women's property rights, social pressures regarding ancestral land might remain.Indian Christian Marriage Act (ICMA)Benefits:Religious Sanction: May hold religious significance for the Christian partner and their family.Drawbacks:Conversion Requirement: The non-Christian partner would need to convert to Christianity before marriage.Unequal Inheritance (Possible): In some Christian denominations, inheritance laws might favor male offspring. It's crucial to understand the specific denomination's practices.Rights to Consider:Property and Inheritance: Both SMA and ICMA provide women with inheritance rights. However, local customs and traditions regarding ancestral property, especially in the boy's case, might influence how inheritance is handled in practice. Open communication with both families is essential.Religious Freedom: The SMA safeguards the right to practice one's religion after marriage.

Even though the son is an adult, the mother can act on his behalf with his authorization.Section Applicable: TheIndian Penal Code(IPC) Section 499 defines defamation. A legal notice can reference this section to highlight the offense.3. Legal Notice for Unfulfilled WhatsApp Assurance:Potentially, a legal notice can be sent.

Section 10 of the Act mentions a written contract not required by law to be in any specific form.Important Considerations:Legal Notice is a Pre-litigation Step: A legal notice serves as a formal warning to the company. It doesn't guarantee a resolution but can be a starting point for negotiation or further legal action.Consult a Lawyer: For all these scenarios, consulting a lawyer specializing in consumer protection or contract law is recommended.

    "question": "Is it legal to demand compensation for out of court settlement",
    "answer": "Yes, it is legal to demand compensation for an out-of-court settlement in India. This is a common practice in resolving disputes outside of the court system.Here's a breakdown of the legal aspects:Contractual Freedom:The Indian Contract Act allows parties involved in a dispute to enter into a settlement agreement. This agreement can involve one party offering compensation to the other in exchange for resolving the dispute and avoiding litigation.Mutual Agreement:The key element is that the compensation amount must be agreed upon by both parties willingly. There should be no coercion or undue influence.Settlement Documentation:It's advisable to have a lawyer draft a formal settlement agreement outlining the terms of the settlement, including the compensation amount and how it will be paid. This document serves as legal proof of the agreement.Benefits of Out-of-Court Settlements:Faster Resolution:Settling disputes outside of court can be significantly faster and less expensive compared to a full-blown lawsuit.Confidentiality:The terms of the settlement can be kept confidential, unlike court proceedings which are generally public.Control Over Outcome:Both parties have more control over the resolution compared to an uncertain court verdict.Seeking Legal Advice:While demanding compensation for an out-of-court settlement is legal, it's always recommended to consult a lawyer specializing in the specific area of your dispute (contract disputes, property disputes etc.). They can advise on:Reasonable Compensation:What constitutes a fair compensation amount in your situation.Settlement Agreement:Drafting a watertight settlement agreement that protects your interests.Negotiation Strategy:Negotiating effectively to reach a favorable agreement."

    "question": "Unlawful grab of orphan childs money by her maternal family",
    "answer": "I understand this is a sensitive situation involving the well-being of a young orphan and a financial dispute. Here's some guidance based on Islamic principles and Indian legal aspects:Custody and Guardianship (Hiranat and ولاية Wilaayah):Paternal Preference: Under Islamic law, the paternal uncle (Khal) usually has the preferential right to custody (Hiranat) and guardianship (Wilaayah) of the orphaned child, especially a girl, unless there are compelling reasons to the contrary.Court's Decision: Ultimately, the court will decide guardianship based on the child's best interests. Both sides can present their case regarding their suitability to raise the child.Financial Matters (Mal):Child's Money: The money from the father's LIC policy belongs to the orphaned child. It should be used for her benefit, including education, healthcare, and future needs.Dispute Resolution:Sharia Council: Consider approaching a Sharia Council affiliated with a local mosque for mediation. They can help resolve the financial dispute based on Islamic inheritance principles.Legal Action: If mediation fails, a lawsuit can be filed in the civil court to recover the funds. This can be a lengthy process.Minimal Resistance Path:Negotiation and Agreement: Open communication and a written agreement outlining how the money will be managed for the child's benefit could be a solution. A neutral third party, perhaps a respected member of the community, could mediate the agreement.Joint Account: Consider a joint bank account with representatives from both sides to manage the money for the child's well-being. This can build trust and ensure transparency.Here are some resources that might be helpful:Sharia Councils: Local mosques might have affiliated Sharia councils that offer mediation services.Lawyers: Look for lawyers with expertise in Islamic law and inheritance in West Bengal.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "I understand this is a stressful situation. Here's some guidance on property inheritance and dealing with your brother in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, considering your Hindu religion:Inheritance Rights:In a Hindu Undivided Family (HUF), sons (including brothers) and daughters have coparcenary rights in ancestral property (inherited from grandparents or further generations).Since your mother passed away, her share would devolve upon your father and then be distributed as per the will or intestacy laws.Deed of Distribution:If your father has a registered deed dividing the assets, it will supersede intestacy laws and dictate the distribution of property.Selling the House:Selling While Father Alive:With a deed: If the deed allows selling the house, all co-owners (including your brother) must consent to the sale.Without a deed: All coparceners (father, you, and brother) have equal rights, and everyone's consent is required.Selling Part of the House (Floor-wise):This is not common in India but can be achieved through a partition suit in court. However, it's a complex and time-consuming process.Dealing with Brother:Negotiation:Try mediation or involving a respected family member to convince your brother to agree to a sale.Partition Suit:If negotiation fails, consider filing a partition suit in court to divide the property by metes and bounds (dividing the physical property) or selling it and dividing the proceeds.Legal Action Against Brother:Police Help:While police can't evict your brother as a co-owner, they can intervene if his behavior amounts to harassment or threats.Suit for Injunction:You or your father can file a suit for injunction to restrain your brother's disruptive behavior and ensure peaceful co-existence.Recommendations:Consult a lawyer specializing in property inheritance and family disputes in Lucknow. They can review the deed (if any) and advise on the most suitable course of action, including:Enforcing the terms of the deed (if it allows selling the house).Filing a partition suit if selling the entire house isn't feasible.Filing a suit for injunction against your brother's disruptive behavior."

You can inform the court during the next hearing.NOC Requirement:In Tamil Nadu, a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the current lawyer might not be strictly necessary for changing lawyers in a district court case.However, it can smoothen the transition.Hiring Temporary Lawyer:Yes, you can hire another lawyer temporarily to manage the upcoming hearing. This lawyer can then file a substitution of attorney motion with the court to formally take over the case.Resolving the Situation:Here's a possible approach:Send the revised letter to your current lawyer requesting the case documents and informing him about termination.Contact the new lawyer and discuss the situation. They can advise on the best course of action, including potentially negotiating a lower fee with your current lawyer or filing a motion with the court to obtain the case documents.Additional Tips:Keep copies of all communication with your current lawyer.Be prepared to discuss the reasons for changing lawyers with the court if necessary."

    "question": "Can I sell 1 of 2 builder floors in a residential property that is co-owned?",
    "answer": "Selling your share of a jointly owned property like this can be tricky, but there are options. Here's a breakdown of the situation and potential solutions:Selling Your Share:Legally Not Possible: In most jurisdictions, you cannot directly sell your share of a residence within a single house. The property is most likely registered as one unit, even though it has separate floors and entrances.Alternative Solutions: Here are some approaches to consider:Negotiate with Your Brother: Explore the possibility of convincing your brother to agree to sell the entire property. Perhaps you can offer him a larger portion of the proceeds to incentivize him.Partition Suit: If negotiation fails, consider filing a partition suit in court. This legal process would compel the sale of the entire property and division of the proceeds based on your ownership share (usually 50/50 in this case). This can be a lengthy and expensive process, so weigh the pros and cons carefully.Rights of a Buyer in Your Scenario:Limited Rights: A buyer purchasing your share would technically own a portion of the entire property, including the house and compound. However, occupying the ground floor exclusively might be challenging due to your brother's residence on the first floor and shared access points (stairs, compound).Potential Issues for the Buyer:Shared Access and Usage: The buyer might face limitations on using certain areas like the compound or shared utilities due to your brother's occupancy.Difficulties with Future Sale: Reselling this kind of ownership structure can be difficult for the buyer as most buyers would prefer a property with sole ownership.Recommendations:Consult a Real Estate Lawyer: An experienced real estate lawyer can advise you on the best course of action based on your specific situation and local laws. They can explain the legal implications of a partition suit and explore other possibilities depending on your location.Mediation: Before resorting to legal action, consider mediation. A neutral third party can facilitate a discussion with your brother to explore solutions that work for both of you.Conclusion:Selling your share in this situation requires careful consideration. While selling the entire property with your brother's agreement is ideal, a partition suit or finding a buyer willing to navigate the complexities of shared ownership are other possibilities.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "I'll provide a response regarding the potential land dispute in Gautam Buddha Nagar, Uttar Pradesh, considering your Hindu religion:Inheritance of Ancestral LandIn your scenario, the land is ancestral property if it was inherited by your grandfather from his parents or further generations.Under theHindu Succession Act(1956), upon your grandfather's demise, the land would be classified as coparcenary property.This means your father and uncle (both sons) have equal coparcenary rights.Father's Will or GiftWill:Your grandfather can create a will distributing the land as he wishes. However, he cannot completely disinherit a coparcener (your father) without a valid and justifiable reason. Courts may question such a will.Gift:During his lifetime, your grandfather can gift a portion of the land to your uncle. However, this gift cannot exceed his own share (i.e., half of the land).Taking Legal ActionIf your father feels disadvantaged by the will or gift, he can contest it in court.The court will consider the validity of the will or the reasonableness of the gift.Potential LossesMaximum Loss Through Will: In the worst-case scenario, your grandfather's will might leave a very small portion (e.g., 1%) to your father. However, challenging such a will can be time-consuming and expensive.Maximum Loss Through Gift: Your grandfather can potentially gift up to half of the land to your uncle. However, exceeding his own share and leaving your father with nothing might be deemed unreasonable by the court.RecommendationGiven your desire to minimize conflict and potential legal expenses, consider these options:Negotiation: If the \"minor favor\" to your uncle is manageable, discuss with your father if peaceful co-existence is preferable to a potentially lengthy legal battle.Mediation: Explore involving a neutral third party (mediator) to facilitate communication and find a solution acceptable to all parties.Consulting a LawyerWhile I've provided a general overview, a lawyer specializing in property inheritance in Gautam Buddha Nagar, Uttar Pradesh, can offer more specific guidance based on the details of your situation. They can advise on:The validity of a potential will or the reasonableness of a gift.The likelihood of success in a legal challenge.The potential costs and time involved in litigation.Alternative dispute resolution options like mediation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Plot division and inherited property division",
    "answer": "1.  Assuming that the land was originally self acquired by your great grandfather (grandfather's father) and he gave a large piece of land to your grandfather through a registered deed, then in your grandfather's hands, it has to be treated as his seperate property having the characteristics of self acquired property and not his ancestral property. Then the registered Partition Deed dividing the land amongst his sons' is in order.Based on the partition deed, the land acquired by your father is his separate property and during your father's lifetime he will be independent to take any decision regarding this property including gifting or selling or executing WILL in favour of anyone.In case your great grandfather had given a large piece of land to your grandfather without a registered document and the name of your great grandfather still remains intact in the property documents, then the property qualifies to be ancestral property.2.  You and your sister may convince your father to execute registered Gift Deed/Partition Deed/WILL demarcating clearly the boundaries amongst siblings.3.  To stop/prevent construction on your father's owned land, let your father bring Injunction Order as the property is in your father's name, which has to be treated as his self acquired property and your brother, without your father's permission, can't unilaterally construct buildings, including school for poor kids.4.   Regarding the plot in your mother's name bought by your father, it's not clear as to whether your mother is dead or alive. If dead, then whether she died intestate (without executing a WILL) or testate (executed WILL) naming the beneficiaries to her property.5.  Assuming that your mother died intestate, then her property would devolve equally to her husband and children. In the instant case, 1/4th undivided share to your father, 1/4th undivided share to you, 1/4th undivided share to your sister and 1/4th undivided share to your brother.6.   If your brother tries to sell this plot to a prospective buyer, then send a legal notice to him so that the issue could be resolved.Shashidhar S.

    "question": "Plot division and inherited property division",
    "answer": "Here's some guidance on the property division situation:Regarding the Farm Land:Inheritance Rights: Since your grandfather divided the land and your father received a share, you and your siblings most likely have inheritance rights to that portion.Negotiation or Mediation: The ideal scenario would be to have an open and honest conversation with your father and brother about dividing the land fairly. Perhaps a mediator could facilitate a productive discussion to avoid putting stress on your parents.Legal Action: If communication fails, consider consulting a property lawyer specializing in inheritance. They can advise you on the legal options for partition, which might involve filing a lawsuit. However, legal action can be lengthy and expensive, so explore all possibilities before resorting to it.Your Brother's Construction Activities:Consent for Construction: If your brother hasn't obtained your consent for building on the property, it might be considered trespassing. A lawyer can advise on the legality of his actions.Impact on Land Value: Large-scale constructions might affect the land's future value when divided. It's crucial to document these constructions with photographs and receipts.The Plot Nominated to Your Brother:Nominee vs. Owner: Being a nominee on a plot doesn't necessarily grant ownership. Your mother likely remains the legal owner.Selling the Plot: If your father wants to sell and share the proceeds, but keeps delaying due to market fluctuations, it creates a complex situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Difference between Investigation and Inquiry: Investigation involves a systematic process of examining and gathering evidence to uncover facts or resolve a specific matter, often pertaining to legal or serious issues. On the other hand, inquiry refers to a less formal exploration or seeking of information to gain understanding or knowledge about a subject..Section 169 of the CrPC reads as under:“169. Release of accused when evidence deficient.—If, upon an investigation under this Chapter, it appears to theofficer in charge of the police station that there is not sufficientevidence or reasonable ground of suspicion to justify theforwarding of the accused to a Magistrate, such officer shall, ifsuch person is in custody, release him on his executing a bond,with or without sureties, as such officer may direct, to appear, ifand when so required, before a Magistrate empowered to takecognizance of the offence on a police report, and to try theaccused or commit him for trial.”Reinvestigation defined:the act or process of carefully examining a crime, problem, statement, etc. again, especially to discover the truth.

    "answer": "Dear clientHere's the breakdown of the difference between Multiple Enquiries and Further Investigation after a chargesheet:Multiple Enquiries:This refers to situations where the police reopen a closed investigation after giving a \"clean chit\" (finding no criminal wrongdoing).This can be harassing for the accused, who thought the matter was settled.The High Court is concerned about this practice, as it can be misused to target individuals.Further Investigation:This refers to the continuation of the original investigation after a chargesheet is filed.This is done if new evidence comes to light or there are loose ends that need tying up.It's a legitimate investigative tool, but only if done with proper justification.In your scenario:The police conducting further investigation and potentially discharging the accused seems like a legitimate use of their power.The High Court's request for a list of multiple enquiries shouldn't be seen as interference in this specific case.They are likely looking at broader trends and want to ensure further investigations are conducted only when necessary, not to reopen settled cases.Key Points:Multiple enquiries raise concerns about harassment and misuse of power.Further investigation is a valid tool for ongoing cases with new evidence.The High Court is likely trying to differentiate between the two practices.Additional Notes:Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Ultimatum and Options:Her husband's demands are controlling and isolate her from family. She shouldn't have to choose between peace and her children seeing their grandparents. Here are some options:Negotiate:Can they compromise? Maybe less frequent visits with clear communication.Counseling:Consider couples therapy to address communication and control issues.Leave:If negotiation fails, leaving might be necessary.2. Child Custody:It's hard to predict, but courts prioritize the children's well-being. Since they live together and he's a parent, getting full custody might be difficult for him. However, a contested custody battle can be stressful and expensive.3. Property Rights:Since she's a joint owner and contributed financially, she has rights to both flats. Not paying recent EMIs might affect the final division, but a lawyer can advise on her specific situation.4. Alimony:Depending on your location and her income, she might be eligible for spousal support, especially if there's a significant income disparity. A lawyer can advise on this.5.

So far as Muslim males are concerned, since they can have four wives living at a time, the second marriage is not void. Since the second marriage is not void, the offence under section 494 IPC is not attracted, even if the Muslim male marries a second woman.5)Even Section 494, Penal Code, which makes bigamy an offence applies to Parsis, Christians and others, but not to Muslims because polygamy is recognized as a valid institution when a Muslim male marries more than one wife.Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "answer": "I understand this is a difficult situation for your family. Here's what you can do:Legal Jurisdiction:While your sister's marriage happened in India, her husband currently resides in Saudi Arabia. This creates a complex jurisdictional issue.Potential Courses of Action:Indian Courts:For mushlim, polygamy is legal in India, proving a marriage happening abroad can be challenging. However, you can still explore options in an Indian court:Nullity of Marriage: Since the husband allegedly took a second wife without a proper divorce,  or consultation with your sister. your sister can file for a declaration of nullity of marriage in an Indian court. This would legally invalidate their marriage from the beginning.Domestic Violence: If your sister experienced any emotional or financial abuse during the marriage in India, she can file adomestic violencecase against her husband.Considering Saudi Arabia:Polygamy is legal in Saudi Arabia. However, certain conditions need to be met, including the first wife's consent and fair treatment of all wives.

    "question": "Refund for flat booking and registration",
    "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about your father's passing. Here's the general procedure to follow for getting a refund on a booked flat when the registered owner has passed away:1. Contact the Developer:The first step is to get in touch with the developer or builder you made the booking with.Inform them about your father's passing and your intention to seek a refund.Submit copies of the death certificate, booking documents, and payment slips as proof.2. Review the Agreement:Carefully examine the terms and conditions mentioned in the flat booking agreement.These documents often outline the process for refunds in case of unforeseen circumstances like death.3. Nomination Clause:Check if the booking agreement has a nomination clause. This clause allows the registered owner to nominate someone to inherit the booked flat in case of death.If a nominee is present, the refund process might be smoother as the nominee can take over the booking.4. Inherited Property:If there's no nominee and you intend to inherit the property, legalities might be involved. You might need to obtain a probate (court order) to establish yourself as the legal heir.A lawyer can guide you through the probate process.5. Developer's Policy:The developer might have a specific policy regarding refunds in case of death.Some developers might offer a full or partial refund, while others might allow you to transfer the booking to another person.Additional Tips:Stay Polite and Proactive: Maintain clear communication with the developer and keep following up on your request.Gather All Documentation: Ensure you have all relevant documents like death certificate, booking agreement, payment proofs, and any communication with the developer readily availableAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "I understand you're considering registering a flat on the 18th floor of an under-construction building in Mumbai. Here's some information to help you decide, but it's important to understand this isn't legal advice.Registering Flat with Pending Layout Plan:Potential Risk: Registering a flat where the layout plan for your specific floor (18th) is unavailable might be risky.Approval Uncertainties: Without the approved layout plan, there's no guarantee the 18th floor will be built as envisioned, impacting the flat's size, location, or configuration.Key Points to Consider:Developer's Assurance: While the developer might claim sufficient FSI (Floor Space Index) is available, rely only on official approvals, not verbal assurances.Sub-Registrar's Role: The sub-registrar might register the flat despite the missing layout plan, but it doesn't guarantee future approvals or the final configuration of your flat.Recommendations:Delay Registration: Consider waiting until the layout plan for the 18th floor is approved by the authorities. This provides clarity on the flat's specifics before registration.Consult Lawyer: A lawyer specializing in property law can review the agreement and advise on the risks and benefits of registering before the layout plan is finalized. They can also help negotiate terms that protect your interests in case of layout changes.Additional Considerations:Financial Implications: If the layout changes significantly after registration, you might have limited recourse, especially if the final flat size is smaller than what you envisioned.Time Factor: While waiting for the layout plan might delay registration, it could save you from potential issues later.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Here's a breakdown:Secured Loan and Repayment:A secured loan involves pledging an asset (like property) as collateral for the loan.Upon the borrower's passing, the lender has two options:Recover from the estate: The lender can approach the legal heirs to recover the outstanding amount. However, unlike unsecured loans, heirs are not personally liable for the entire debt.Seize the pledged asset: The lender can repossess the secured asset and sell it through auction to recover the loan amount.Liability of Heirs:Heirs are only liable for the secured loan to the extent of the inherited assets.This means if the inherited assets are worth less than the outstanding loan, the heirs are only responsible for the value of the assets, not the remaining debt.Important Points:Heirs can choose to repay the loan and keep the asset.They can also disclaim the inheritance, including the secured asset, to avoid any liability.In some cases, the loan agreement might have a clause stating the transfer of liability to heirs upon the borrower's death. It's important to review the loan documents carefully.Recommendation:If you're an heir inheriting assets with an outstanding secured loan, it's wise to:Review the loan agreement to understand the terms and conditions.Get a valuation of the inherited asset.Consult with a financial advisor to determine the best course of action, considering factors like repaying the loan, selling the asset, or disclaiming the inheritance.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "I understand you're in a frustrating situation with the police case and considering going to the press. Here's a breakdown of your questions and some guidance:1. Challenging the Conviction:Reopening the case in the same court is unlikely. However, you can appeal the conviction to a higher court. A lawyer can advise on the best approach based on the specifics of your case.The inconsistencies in the police statements (SI vs. Constable) strengthen your case for appeal. A lawyer can highlight these discrepancies in the appeal.2. Press Interview:You can discuss the case with the press, but be mindful of what you say.Sticking to the facts in the charge sheet and court order is crucial. Avoid making unsubstantiated accusations.Defamation laws exist, but if you stay truthful and avoid personal attacks, the police filing a defamation case is less likely.3. Using Police Photos:Using the police officers' WhatsApp photos requires caution. Copyright laws might apply, and using them without permission could lead to legal trouble.4. Defamation Case Implications:If the police sue for defamation, the amount claimed can vary. The burden of proof lies on them to show your statements were false and caused them harm.5. Imprisonment:Since you paid the fine, you don't face imprisonment. Going to the press shouldn't change that.6. Other Legal Issues:There's a possibility of the police filing a counter-case for obstructing a public servant (original charge), but it depends on their actions.Consulting a lawyer specializing in media law can help you navigate the press conference and minimize legal risks.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "I understand this is a stressful situation. Here's some guidance on property inheritance and dealing with your brother in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, considering your Hindu religion:Inheritance Rights:In a Hindu Undivided Family (HUF), sons (including brothers) and daughters have coparcenary rights in ancestral property (inherited from grandparents or further generations).Since your mother passed away, her share would devolve upon your father and then be distributed as per the will or intestacy laws.Deed of Distribution:If your father has a registered deed dividing the assets, it will supersede intestacy laws and dictate the distribution of property.Selling the House:Selling While Father Alive:With a deed: If the deed allows selling the house, all co-owners (including your brother) must consent to the sale.Without a deed: All coparceners (father, you, and brother) have equal rights, and everyone's consent is required.Selling Part of the House (Floor-wise):This is not common in India but can be achieved through a partition suit in court. However, it's a complex and time-consuming process.Dealing with Brother:Negotiation:Try mediation or involving a respected family member to convince your brother to agree to a sale.Partition Suit:If negotiation fails, consider filing a partition suit in court to divide the property by metes and bounds (dividing the physical property) or selling it and dividing the proceeds.Legal Action Against Brother:Police Help:While police can't evict your brother as a co-owner, they can intervene if his behavior amounts to harassment or threats.Suit for Injunction:You or your father can file a suit for injunction to restrain your brother's disruptive behavior and ensure peaceful co-existence.Recommendations:Consult a lawyer specializing in property inheritance and family disputes in Lucknow. They can review the deed (if any) and advise on the most suitable course of action, including:Enforcing the terms of the deed (if it allows selling the house).Filing a partition suit if selling the entire house isn't feasible.Filing a suit for injunction against your brother's disruptive behavior."

Here's some information that might help, but it's important to remember this isn't legal advice.Understanding Your Situation:Desertion: Desertion is a ground for seeking divorce in India. You can file for divorce based on this.Domestic Violence: The photos and videos your husband might be using could be considered evidence ofdomestic violence. However, the act of taking a knife to defend yourself might be viewed differently in court.498A:Section 498Ais a law to protect women from cruelty by their husbands or in-laws. It's a serious offense, and filing a false case can have legal repercussions.Recommendations:Consult a Lawyer: A lawyer specializing in family law and NRI cases can advise you on the best course of action considering your specific situation, evidence, and desired outcome (divorce, reconciliation, etc.)Gather Evidence: Collect any proof you have of desertion,domestic violence, or any communication with your husband.Regarding 498A and Embassy:Filing 498A: Filing 498A can initiate a legal process against your husband in India. Whether it compels him to return or impacts his job depends on the case and US-India legal agreements.Embassy and Employer: Indian embassies typically don't get involved in domestic disputes. While informing his employer is an option, it's important to be aware of potential legal ramifications in the US for such actions.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

There might be limitations due to load-bearing walls etc.Negotiation Points:Bulk Purchase Discount: Highlight that you're purchasing two units, generating a larger sale for them. Request a discount for this bulk purchase.Double Charges for Amenities: Point out that you're essentially paying double for amenities like water, STP, power backup, etc., by buying two flats. Negotiate a combined rate for these considering the shared usage.Structural Changes: Negotiate for the builder to absorb some or all the cost of structural changes needed for combining the flats. This is because it saves them the cost of finishing another separate unit.Payment Terms: If possible, offer a faster payment turnaround in exchange for a better price. This incentivizes the builder to close the deal quickly.Alternative: Express willingness to walk away if negotiations aren't satisfactory. However, ensure you have explored other options and are genuinely prepared to do so.Reaching Your Budget:With your budget of 1.6-1.7 Crore, aim for a price per square foot lower than the quoted 7000/sqft for the flats.Negotiate a combined price for the two flats that falls within your budget, considering the saved amenity charges and potential discount for structural changes.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Parking charges",
    "answer": "Dear client.The legality of charging parking fees in your co-operative housing society (CHS) depends on your location and the society's bylaws. Here's a breakdown:General Legality:In some regions, like Maharashtra, the Model Bye-laws (2014) of the Maharashtra Ownership of Flats Act (MOFA) allow societies to charge parking fees (https://www.thedigitel.com/s/charleston/top-stories-news-politics/charleston-dipping-reserves-hiking-parking-fees-[deleted]/). This applies to allotted parking spaces.Open Parking:The situation with open parking is less clear-cut.Societies might argue they can charge a fee for managing the space, even if it's first-come, first-served.However, courts have sometimes ruled against such charges if there's ample space and no designated allocation (https://library.municode.com/sc/charleston/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=CICO_CH19MOVETR_ARTVIIISTSTPA_DIV1GE).Recommendations:Review Your Bye-laws:Check your society's bylaws for specific clauses regarding parking charges.Check for Allotment:See if there's a system for allocating open parking spaces. If not, and there's ample space, a fee might be challenged.Reasonableness of Charge:Even if a fee is legal, it should be reasonable and not excessively high (https://parkingsociety.com/contact/).If you disagree with the charges, consider:Discussing the issue with the managing committee.Raising the concern at the next general body meeting."

    "question": "Document for transfer of tenancy to family member staying with tenant at her time of death in Mumbai",

Since your mother has been occupying the flat since 1970, you and your sister likely have inherited tenancy rights. These rights are generally protected under the Act, and a formal tenancy agreement might not be mandatory, especially if rent has been paid continuously.Landlord's Insistence:However, the Parsi trust managing the building might still prefer a documented agreement for record-keeping purposes or to clarify terms of occupancy.Negotiate the Agreement:If a lawyer advises a tenancy agreement is best, work with the trust to draft a document outlining:Details of the parties involved (you, your sister & the trust)Description of the flatMonthly rent amountDeposit details (if any)Term of occupancy (if applicable)Rights and responsibilities of both parties (maintenance, repairs etc.)Stamp Duty and Registration:If a tenancy agreement is drafted, stamp duty will likely be applicable based on the rent amount and agreement duration. A lawyer can advise on the exact stamp duty amount applicable in Maharashtra.Registration of the agreement is generally not mandatory for leave and license agreements (common in trust buildings) with a term less than 12 months. However, registration offers stronger legal protection in case of disputes. A lawyer can advise on the benefits and costs involved in registration."

    "answer": "I understand you're in a frustrating situation with the police case and considering going to the press. Here's a breakdown of your questions and some guidance:1. Challenging the Conviction:Reopening the case in the same court is unlikely. However, you can appeal the conviction to a higher court. A lawyer can advise on the best approach based on the specifics of your case.The inconsistencies in the police statements (SI vs. Constable) strengthen your case for appeal. A lawyer can highlight these discrepancies in the appeal.2. Press Interview:You can discuss the case with the press, but be mindful of what you say.Sticking to the facts in the charge sheet and court order is crucial. Avoid making unsubstantiated accusations.Defamation laws exist, but if you stay truthful and avoid personal attacks, the police filing a defamation case is less likely.3. Using Police Photos:Using the police officers' WhatsApp photos requires caution. Copyright laws might apply, and using them without permission could lead to legal trouble.4. Defamation Case Implications:If the police sue for defamation, the amount claimed can vary. The burden of proof lies on them to show your statements were false and caused them harm.5. Imprisonment:Since you paid the fine, you don't face imprisonment. Going to the press shouldn't change that.6. Other Legal Issues:There's a possibility of the police filing a counter-case for obstructing a public servant (original charge), but it depends on their actions.Consulting a lawyer specializing in media law can help you navigate the press conference and minimize legal risks.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear clientI understand this is a difficult situation. Here's some guidance on child maintenance in India for a mutual divorce:Child Maintenance in Mutual Divorce (India):There's no fixed amount for child maintenance in India.Courts consider various factors to determine a fair amount, including:Needs of the child (food, clothing, education, healthcare)Income of both parentsStandard of living enjoyed by the child before the divorceAny special needs of the childGiven your situation, here's a likely range for child maintenance:₹80,000 (Spouse's salary) is comparable to yours, so the financial burden should ideally be shared proportionately.₹1.26 Crore seems excessive as a lump sum amount.Possible Solutions:Negotiation:Discuss a more reasonable monthly amount with your spouse. Consider factors mentioned above.Mediation:A mediator can help you reach a mutually agreeable amount for child maintenance."

    "question": "Mortgage loan repayment responsibilities and legal implications",
    "answer": "Dear clientI understand this is a stressful situation. Here's a breakdown of your situation and some potential next steps:Repercussions for You:Since you were a minor when the loan was taken, you generally cannot be held personally liable for the debt. The bank's recourse would primarily be against the mortgaged property and your father's assets as guarantor.Outstanding Amount and Negotiations:The high claimed amount due to accrued interest is a common issue with NPAs. It's crucial to negotiate a settlement with the bank. Here's how you can approach it:Gather Documents: Collect all loan-related documents (agreement, repayment history, court order etc.)Dispute the Claimed Amount: You can contest the high interest amount with the bank. Present a clear breakdown of the original loan amount and any payments made.Settlement Offer: Propose a settlement offer that considers the property's current market value and your capacity to repay.Resolving the Debt:Auction and Settlement:If the auction proceeds cover the entire outstanding balance (including a negotiated settlement), the issue is resolved.If the auction proceeds fall short, the bank can pursue recovery from your father's assets as per the guarantor agreement.Personal Assets:As you were a minor when the loan was taken, your personal savings and properties are generally not at risk unless you used them as collateral for the loan or signed any guarantee agreements yourself.Communication with Bank: Maintain open communication with Canara Bank. Explain your situation and willingness to resolve the debt.Explore One-Time Settlement Schemes: Banks often offer one-time settlement (OTS) schemes for NPAs with a significant discount on the outstanding amount. Explore this option with the bank.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Document for transfer of tenancy to family member staying with tenant at her time of death in Mumbai",
    "answer": "Dear clientIn your situation, a few things need to be considered:Tenancy Rights and Agreements:Rent Control Laws:Mumbai falls under the Rent Control Act, 1948. Since your mother has been occupying the flat since 1970, you and your sister likely have inherited tenancy rights. These rights are generally protected under the Act, and a formal tenancy agreement might not be mandatory, especially if rent has been paid continuously.Landlord's Insistence:However, the Parsi trust managing the building might still prefer a documented agreement for record-keeping purposes or to clarify terms of occupancy.Negotiate the Agreement:If a lawyer advises a tenancy agreement is best, work with the trust to draft a document outlining:Details of the parties involved (you, your sister & the trust)Description of the flatMonthly rent amountDeposit details (if any)Term of occupancy (if applicable)Rights and responsibilities of both parties (maintenance, repairs etc.)Stamp Duty and Registration:If a tenancy agreement is drafted, stamp duty will likely be applicable based on the rent amount and agreement duration. A lawyer can advise on the exact stamp duty amount applicable in Maharashtra.Registration of the agreement is generally not mandatory for leave and license agreements (common in trust buildings) with a term less than 12 months. However, registration offers stronger legal protection in case of disputes. A lawyer can advise on the benefits and costs involved in registration."

    "question": "Liability of legal heirs on secured loan",
    "answer": "In the case of a secured loan, the legal heirs of the borrower generally have a more limited liability compared to unsecured loans. Here's a breakdown:Secured Loan and Repayment:A secured loan involves pledging an asset (like property) as collateral for the loan.Upon the borrower's passing, the lender has two options:Recover from the estate: The lender can approach the legal heirs to recover the outstanding amount. However, unlike unsecured loans, heirs are not personally liable for the entire debt.Seize the pledged asset: The lender can repossess the secured asset and sell it through auction to recover the loan amount.Liability of Heirs:Heirs are only liable for the secured loan to the extent of the inherited assets.This means if the inherited assets are worth less than the outstanding loan, the heirs are only responsible for the value of the assets, not the remaining debt.Important Points:Heirs can choose to repay the loan and keep the asset.They can also disclaim the inheritance, including the secured asset, to avoid any liability.In some cases, the loan agreement might have a clause stating the transfer of liability to heirs upon the borrower's death. It's important to review the loan documents carefully.Recommendation:If you're an heir inheriting assets with an outstanding secured loan, it's wise to:Review the loan agreement to understand the terms and conditions.Get a valuation of the inherited asset.Consult with a financial advisor to determine the best course of action, considering factors like repaying the loan, selling the asset, or disclaiming the inheritance.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Need help on how to negotiate apartment price with builder",
    "answer": "Here's how you can approach negotiating the price for your desired 4-BHK duplex apartment:Before Negotiation:Research: Check similar projects in the area and their pricing for 4-BHK duplexes. This will give you a benchmark for negotiation.Feasibility: Confirm with the builder if combining two 2-BHK flats into a 4-BHK duplex is structurally possible. Get this confirmation in writing. There might be limitations due to load-bearing walls etc.Negotiation Points:Bulk Purchase Discount: Highlight that you're purchasing two units, generating a larger sale for them. Request a discount for this bulk purchase.Double Charges for Amenities: Point out that you're essentially paying double for amenities like water, STP, power backup, etc., by buying two flats. Negotiate a combined rate for these considering the shared usage.Structural Changes: Negotiate for the builder to absorb some or all the cost of structural changes needed for combining the flats. This is because it saves them the cost of finishing another separate unit.Payment Terms: If possible, offer a faster payment turnaround in exchange for a better price. This incentivizes the builder to close the deal quickly.Alternative: Express willingness to walk away if negotiations aren't satisfactory. However, ensure you have explored other options and are genuinely prepared to do so.Reaching Your Budget:With your budget of 1.6-1.7 Crore, aim for a price per square foot lower than the quoted 7000/sqft for the flats.Negotiate a combined price for the two flats that falls within your budget, considering the saved amenity charges and potential discount for structural changes.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Mortgage loan repayment responsibilities and legal implications",
    "answer": "Dear clientI understand this is a stressful situation. Here's a breakdown of your situation and some potential next steps:Repercussions for You:Since you were a minor when the loan was taken, you generally cannot be held personally liable for the debt. The bank's recourse would primarily be against the mortgaged property and your father's assets as guarantor.Outstanding Amount and Negotiations:The high claimed amount due to accrued interest is a common issue with NPAs. It's crucial to negotiate a settlement with the bank. Here's how you can approach it:Gather Documents: Collect all loan-related documents (agreement, repayment history, court order etc.)Dispute the Claimed Amount: You can contest the high interest amount with the bank. Present a clear breakdown of the original loan amount and any payments made.Settlement Offer: Propose a settlement offer that considers the property's current market value and your capacity to repay.Resolving the Debt:Auction and Settlement:If the auction proceeds cover the entire outstanding balance (including a negotiated settlement), the issue is resolved.If the auction proceeds fall short, the bank can pursue recovery from your father's assets as per the guarantor agreement.Personal Assets:As you were a minor when the loan was taken, your personal savings and properties are generally not at risk unless you used them as collateral for the loan or signed any guarantee agreements yourself.Communication with Bank: Maintain open communication with Canara Bank. Explain your situation and willingness to resolve the debt.Explore One-Time Settlement Schemes: Banks often offer one-time settlement (OTS) schemes for NPAs with a significant discount on the outstanding amount. Explore this option with the bank.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Without Daughter signature father's self-acquired property sold by mother&brothers after FatherDeath",
    "answer": "Dear clientYour situation is complex and involves property law, succession rights, and interpreting a will. Here's a breakdown of your questions and some general advice (consulting a lawyer specializing in property law is highly recommended):Your Rights as a Daughter:Claiming Share: You likely have a right to claim your share of the 26 acres. TheHindu Succession Act, 1956 (amended in Andhra Pradesh) grants daughters equal coparcenary rights in their deceased father's self-acquired property.New Suit: You can potentially file a new suit for partition or declaration to claim your share against the current landowners. However, there might be complexities due to the time elapsed since the sale (2005) and the High Court order.Mother & Brother's Sale: The sale deed without your signature might be challenged if you weren't informed or given due share.Will and Grandchildren:Will & Grandchildren: The will might be challenged on grounds that it cannot override your rights as a legal heir under theHindu Succession Act. Since the grandchildren are now adults, the will's provisions regarding their rights might be irrelevant.Challenging Will: You and your brothers can potentially challenge the will. Being a witness in the will doesn't prevent S2 from inheriting, but the court will consider the circumstances.Current Landowners:Landowners' Rights: The current landowners might have some protection under \"bona fide purchaser\" principles if they bought the land without knowledge of any dispute. However, the specifics depend on the details of each sale.Limitation Period:Claiming Sold Property: Limitation period for property claims can vary depending on the nature of the suit. Consulting a lawyer is crucial to determine the applicable limitation period in your case. It might start from 2005 (sale year) or potentially from 2019 (when you learned about the land).Recommendation:Consult a lawyer specializing in property law in Andhra Pradesh. They can analyze the specific details of your case, including the will, sale deeds, and partition suit documents. Based on that, they can advise on the most suitable type of suit to file (partition, declaration, or something else) and the legal arguments with the strongest chance of success.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Here's a breakdown of the possibilities:Possible Scenarios:Early Stage of Selection:If you're shortlisted for the interview stage but haven't yet been interviewed, there might be a chance to submit your OBC NCL certificate and request to be considered under the OBC category.Action: Contact the university's recruitment department immediately. Explain your situation and inquire about the possibility of submitting the OBC NCL certificate for OBC category consideration.Later Stage of Selection:If you've already been interviewed under the Unreserved category, it's less likely they'll allow a category switch at this point. Selection processes are designed to be fair and consistent, and changing categories midway might disadvantage other candidates.University Policy:The key factor is the university's recruitment policy. Some universities might have a clause allowing category change at specific stages (before interview) with proper justification.Action: Review the university's recruitment notification or advertisement for Assistant Professor. Look for sections on category, reservation, and document submission. You might also find contact information for the recruitment department.General Recommendation:Contact the university's recruitment department as soon as possible. Explain your situation and inquire about the possibility of submitting the OBC NCL certificate. Be polite, professional, and highlight your qualifications for the position.Additional Tips:Even if they don't allow a category switch, attending the interview under the Unreserved category still showcases your skills and experience. You might still impress the selection committee and get shortlisted.If you don't get selected this time, keep an eye out for future openings at the university. By the next application round, you'll have your OBC NCL certificate ready and can apply under the OBC category from the beginning.Remember, this is general advice. The specific situation depends on the university's recruitment policy.

    "answer": "Difference between Investigation and Inquiry: Investigation involves a systematic process of examining and gathering evidence to uncover facts or resolve a specific matter, often pertaining to legal or serious issues. On the other hand, inquiry refers to a less formal exploration or seeking of information to gain understanding or knowledge about a subject..Section 169 of the CrPC reads as under:“169. Release of accused when evidence deficient.—If, upon an investigation under this Chapter, it appears to theofficer in charge of the police station that there is not sufficientevidence or reasonable ground of suspicion to justify theforwarding of the accused to a Magistrate, such officer shall, ifsuch person is in custody, release him on his executing a bond,with or without sureties, as such officer may direct, to appear, ifand when so required, before a Magistrate empowered to takecognizance of the offence on a police report, and to try theaccused or commit him for trial.”Reinvestigation defined:the act or process of carefully examining a crime, problem, statement, etc. again, especially to discover the truth. Understanding the Concept of Further InvestigationAs a result, if a charge-sheet has been filed, the investigating agency may conduct additional investigations, and the Court may order more investigations.

    "answer": "Dear clientHere's the breakdown of the difference between Multiple Enquiries and Further Investigation after a chargesheet:Multiple Enquiries:This refers to situations where the police reopen a closed investigation after giving a \"clean chit\" (finding no criminal wrongdoing).This can be harassing for the accused, who thought the matter was settled.The High Court is concerned about this practice, as it can be misused to target individuals.Further Investigation:This refers to the continuation of the original investigation after a chargesheet is filed.This is done if new evidence comes to light or there are loose ends that need tying up.It's a legitimate investigative tool, but only if done with proper justification.In your scenario:The police conducting further investigation and potentially discharging the accused seems like a legitimate use of their power.The High Court's request for a list of multiple enquiries shouldn't be seen as interference in this specific case.They are likely looking at broader trends and want to ensure further investigations are conducted only when necessary, not to reopen settled cases.Key Points:Multiple enquiries raise concerns about harassment and misuse of power.Further investigation is a valid tool for ongoing cases with new evidence.The High Court is likely trying to differentiate between the two practices.Additional Notes:Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This likely applies to all parties, including you (the buyer), the bank, and the borrower.Payment Due Date:You have an agreement with the bank to pay the remaining 75% within 90 days.Conflicting Demands:The bank wants payment while the court order restricts actions.Possible Courses of Action:Seek Clarification:You could try contacting DRAT Allahabad to understand the specific implications of the Status Quo order on your payment obligation.Communicate with the Bank:Inform the bank (in writing) about the court order and your inability to pay due to it. Express your willingness to pay once the order is lifted. Emphasize that you're adhering to the court order.Important Considerations:Non-Payment Risks:Not paying as per the agreement could lead to the bank taking action like forfeiting your deposit or initiating further legal proceedings.Contempt of Court:It's unlikely depositing the remaining amount would be considered contempt if the bank is willing to accept it (verify with a lawyer).Sale Letter:The bank might be hesitant to issue a sale letter due to the court order.Leveraging the Status Quo:The Status Quo order might provide temporary protection from the bank taking action against your deposit if it's interpreted to include a freeze on payments. However, a lawyer can confirm this interpretation.Religion and Property Law:Generally, religious beliefs shouldn't affect property law in the UAE. The focus will be on the contract and court order."

    "question": "Can police file defamation case If I go to press on a false case they implicated on me",
    "answer": "I understand you're in a frustrating situation with the police case and considering going to the press. Here's a breakdown of your questions and some guidance:1. Challenging the Conviction:Reopening the case in the same court is unlikely. However, you can appeal the conviction to a higher court. A lawyer can advise on the best approach based on the specifics of your case.The inconsistencies in the police statements (SI vs. Constable) strengthen your case for appeal. A lawyer can highlight these discrepancies in the appeal.2. Press Interview:You can discuss the case with the press, but be mindful of what you say.Sticking to the facts in the charge sheet and court order is crucial. Avoid making unsubstantiated accusations.Defamation laws exist, but if you stay truthful and avoid personal attacks, the police filing a defamation case is less likely.3. Using Police Photos:Using the police officers' WhatsApp photos requires caution. Copyright laws might apply, and using them without permission could lead to legal trouble.4. Defamation Case Implications:If the police sue for defamation, the amount claimed can vary. The burden of proof lies on them to show your statements were false and caused them harm.5. Imprisonment:Since you paid the fine, you don't face imprisonment. Going to the press shouldn't change that.6. Other Legal Issues:There's a possibility of the police filing a counter-case for obstructing a public servant (original charge), but it depends on their actions.Consulting a lawyer specializing in media law can help you navigate the press conference and minimize legal risks.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "I have read your question and clearly stated that when charge sheet is filed you should  appear  before trial court and apply for regular bail2) SC has held refusal by criminal Courts either through the learned Magistrate or through their office staff to accept the charge-sheet without production of the accused persons is not justified by any provision of law. Therefore, it should be impressed upon all the Courts that they should accept the charge-sheet whenever it is produced by the police with any endorsement to be made on the charge-sheet by the staff or the Magistrate pertaining to any omission or requirement in the charge-sheet.3)The word “custody” appearing in Section 170 of the Cr.P.C. does not contemplate either police or judicial custody but it merely connotes the presentation of the accused by the Investigating Officer before the court while filing the chargesheet.4) in response to your second query it does appear letter from IO is contrary to SC judgement5)any person who is willing to take responsibility for the accusedcan act as a surety. It can be a family member, friend, or any individual willing to vouch for the accused's appearance in court6)person can stand surety to more than one accused person, but he needs to make a declaration regarding this before the Court.7) Courts insists production of property documents. Sometimes, in lieu of the same, Courts demand production of RC books of two-wheelers, four-wheelers, etc.8)some times an accused, who is an utter stranger to the area or he has no friends or relatives in the area or he could not secure a person to stand as surety can offer cash surety. The Court can accept cash surety, instead of personal surety. But the Court cannot demand personal surety, property surety and cash surety, at a time. It is not cumulative. It is alternative.9) you can go abroad for work purposes or education if no conditions are imposed by court while granting bailotherwise you need court permission to travel abroad10) fixed deposit can work as surety11) discharge is good optionAjay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

This could involve compensation for your share of the terrace or revised construction plans that respect your rights.Mediation: A mediator can help facilitate a mutually agreeable solution.Legal Action: If negotiations fail, you might consider legal action to enforce your co-ownership rights and prevent unauthorized construction. A lawyer can advise on the most suitable course of action.Additional Considerations:Review Deed & Building Documents: A lawyer can examine your property deed, building plans, and any relevant MCD regulations to determine the legalities of construction and your rights.Notice to New Terrace Owner & Co-Owners: Sending a formal notice outlining your concerns and referencing your co-ownership rights might be a good first step.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Tax Distribution and Double Tax Treaty:Tax Residency: Since you have a valid work visa in Hong Kong, you'll likely be considered a tax resident there. This means your worldwide income, including earnings from India, could be taxable in Hong Kong.Double Tax Treaty: Fortunately, India and Hong Kong have a Double Tax Treaty. This treaty prevents double taxation on the same income.Tax Filing: You might need to file tax returns in both countries, but you can claim a tax credit in Hong Kong for taxes already paid in India under the treaty provisions. A tax advisor can help navigate the specifics.2. NRO Account:NRO Account is Suitable: An NRO account is the right choice for your situation. It allows you to receive income from India while residing abroad and hold it in rupees.3. Saving Taxes:Limited Options: While Hong Kong's tax rate is lower than India's, you might have limited opportunities for significant tax savings as a freelancer.Focus on Deductions: You can explore claiming business-related deductions in both India and Hong Kong (if applicable) to reduce your taxable income. These might include internet expenses, professional development costs, or a portion of your home office rent (subject to limitations).Recommendations:Understand Tax Filing Obligations: Get clarity on whether you need to file tax returns in both countries and the deadlines involved.Here are some additional resources:Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can the registration date of marriage be changed",
    "answer": "1. Recently I have changed the marriage date of my client who had registered her marriage as perHindu Marriage Actwithout actually marrying religiously and when asked by the Marriage registrar about her date of religious marriage, had mentioned the date which was found later on to be impossible since on that date her husband was in UK as per his passport.2. The date of religious marriage (sat fere)given was 21.5.2021 and the marriage was registered on 10.9.2021.3.   It was found that from 01.7.2019 till 8.9.2021, the husband was in UK and it was an online affair. It was feared that while applying for Visa by the girl submitting the marriage certificate, the Consulate will find from the records that the groom was not present in India at all to marry socially and she will be black listed for ever.4. An application was filed before the Registrar General of Marriage stating that their religious marriage was performed on 21.5.2019 which was told to the Registrar but he entered the year 2021 in place of 2019 in the on line form which is required to be rectified now.5.

    "question": "What is the difference between Multiple Enquiries and Further Investigation?",
    "answer": "Difference between Investigation and Inquiry: Investigation involves a systematic process of examining and gathering evidence to uncover facts or resolve a specific matter, often pertaining to legal or serious issues. On the other hand, inquiry refers to a less formal exploration or seeking of information to gain understanding or knowledge about a subject..Section 169 of the CrPC reads as under:“169. Release of accused when evidence deficient.—If, upon an investigation under this Chapter, it appears to theofficer in charge of the police station that there is not sufficientevidence or reasonable ground of suspicion to justify theforwarding of the accused to a Magistrate, such officer shall, ifsuch person is in custody, release him on his executing a bond,with or without sureties, as such officer may direct, to appear, ifand when so required, before a Magistrate empowered to takecognizance of the offence on a police report, and to try theaccused or commit him for trial.”Reinvestigation defined:the act or process of carefully examining a crime, problem, statement, etc. again, especially to discover the truth. Understanding the Concept of Further InvestigationAs a result, if a charge-sheet has been filed, the investigating agency may conduct additional investigations, and the Court may order more investigations.

    "question": "What is the difference between Multiple Enquiries and Further Investigation?",
    "answer": "Dear clientHere's the breakdown of the difference between Multiple Enquiries and Further Investigation after a chargesheet:Multiple Enquiries:This refers to situations where the police reopen a closed investigation after giving a \"clean chit\" (finding no criminal wrongdoing).This can be harassing for the accused, who thought the matter was settled.The High Court is concerned about this practice, as it can be misused to target individuals.Further Investigation:This refers to the continuation of the original investigation after a chargesheet is filed.This is done if new evidence comes to light or there are loose ends that need tying up.It's a legitimate investigative tool, but only if done with proper justification.In your scenario:The police conducting further investigation and potentially discharging the accused seems like a legitimate use of their power.The High Court's request for a list of multiple enquiries shouldn't be seen as interference in this specific case.They are likely looking at broader trends and want to ensure further investigations are conducted only when necessary, not to reopen settled cases.Key Points:Multiple enquiries raise concerns about harassment and misuse of power.Further investigation is a valid tool for ongoing cases with new evidence.The High Court is likely trying to differentiate between the two practices.Additional Notes:Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Recover money from primary applicant",
    "answer": "Dear clientYes, you might be able to recover the loan amount you paid on your brother's behalf, with the loan agreement and bank statements as evidence. Here's how:1. Written Agreement:The strongest option is a written agreement between you and your brother. This agreement should clearly state:The amount you loaned him (your payments towards the loan).The interest rate (optional, but strengthens your claim).The repayment schedule.Signatures from both of you.2. Verbal Agreement with Documentation:If you don't have a written agreement, your situation can still be addressed, but it might be more challenging.The loan agreement and bank statements showing your payments can be used as evidence of your contribution.Steps to Recover the Amount:Communication:Talk to your brother openly about your situation.Documentation:Gather all documentation:Loan agreement (both your names should be on it).Bank statements highlighting your payments towards the loan.Repayment Plan:Work out a repayment plan with your brother that is comfortable for both of you.Formalize the Agreement (Optional):While a verbal agreement might work, consider getting a written repayment plan signed by both of you. This strengthens your claim in case of future disagreements.Legal Action (Last Resort):If your brother is unwilling to cooperate, you might have to consider legal action. This should be a last resort due to potential strain on your relationship.Key Points:Having a clear agreement upfront protects both you and your brother.Open communication is crucial throughout the process.Legal action should be a last resort.Additional Considerations:Tax implications: Depending on your location, there might be tax implications for the interest charged on the loan to your brother. Consulting a tax advisor might be helpful."

    "answer": "Dear clientThis is a difficult situation and your sister has some tough choices to make. Here's a breakdown to help navigate:1. Ultimatum and Options:Her husband's demands are controlling and isolate her from family. She shouldn't have to choose between peace and her children seeing their grandparents. Here are some options:Negotiate:Can they compromise? Maybe less frequent visits with clear communication.Counseling:Consider couples therapy to address communication and control issues.Leave:If negotiation fails, leaving might be necessary.2. Child Custody:It's hard to predict, but courts prioritize the children's well-being. Since they live together and he's a parent, getting full custody might be difficult for him. However, a contested custody battle can be stressful and expensive.3. Property Rights:Since she's a joint owner and contributed financially, she has rights to both flats. Not paying recent EMIs might affect the final division, but a lawyer can advise on her specific situation.4. Alimony:Depending on your location and her income, she might be eligible for spousal support, especially if there's a significant income disparity. A lawyer can advise on this.5. Lack of Support and Resources:Many legal aid organizations can offer support and representation in family law cases. It's worth exploring these options. Here are some resources to find legal aid:National Legal Aid & Defender Association: https://www.nlada.org/American Bar Association: [invalid URL removed]6. Recorded Calls:Admissibility of recordings depends on your location. It's best to consult a lawyer familiar with your state's laws to know if recordings are helpful evidence.Additional Tips:Document Everything:Keep records of communication (emails, texts) and any instances of abuse.Gather Financial Records:Document income, expenses, and contributions made towards the flats.Seek Support Network:Friends, family (even if limited), and support groups can provide emotional support."

    "question": "Tenancy law for daughters",
    "answer": "The pagdi system was legalised by the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999. Generally, upon the death of a pagdi tenant, the tenancy rights are transferred to the legal heir/s who were living in the flat when the tenant died, by asking the landlord to issue the new rent receipts in the heir/s name/s.An agreement with the tenant will come to an end on the death of the tenant, the heirs will have no rights in the name of tenancy rights, they can stay there for a further period of one year/5 year as per the tenancy protection rights in the event of the death of tenant, therefore the so called legal heirs cannot claim tenancy rights or rental agreement in their names or object to the new rental agreement to the son of the deceased tenant in any manner and no such objections will sustain in law.Son selling off the property recently, by himself.In pagadi system though in literal language it is called as selling of the property, legallyNobody can claim a share in it as a right in any capacity, all such things have to be settled by a meeting among the family members only.As a matter of fact if you were not living or were with your father into the business at the time of his death, you can't claim inheritance of tenancy rights too.Thus better settle the matter amicably because in your family dispute the landlord will take benefit and throw everyone out of the shop without giving any benefits to anyone.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

This could complicate identifying the source of funds used for the plot.Gift Documentation:A documented gift from your mother significantly strengthens your case.Intestacy Laws:Each state has its own laws regarding inheritance without a will. Knowing your state's laws is crucial.Recommendations:Consult a Lawyer:A lawyer specializing in property and inheritance law in your state can analyze your situation and advise on the best course of action.Gather Documents:Collect documents like bank statements showing the transfer from the joint account to your account, gift documents from your mother (if any), and land ownership/EMI payment proofs.Communication:Try to have an open conversation with your sister. Explain your perspective and show the documents. Perhaps you can reach an amicable agreement.Possible Outcomes:Agreement:Hopefully, with clear evidence and open communication, you and your sister can reach a mutually agreeable solution.Legal Battle:If no agreement is reached, a lawsuit might be necessary. A lawyer can represent you and fight for your ownership of the plot.Protecting Your Plot:Having a strong legal case with the documented financial trail and potentially involving a lawyer in communication with your sister can help deter her from taking legal action."

On the other hand, inquiry refers to a less formal exploration or seeking of information to gain understanding or knowledge about a subject..Section 169 of the CrPC reads as under:“169. Release of accused when evidence deficient.—If, upon an investigation under this Chapter, it appears to theofficer in charge of the police station that there is not sufficientevidence or reasonable ground of suspicion to justify theforwarding of the accused to a Magistrate, such officer shall, ifsuch person is in custody, release him on his executing a bond,with or without sureties, as such officer may direct, to appear, ifand when so required, before a Magistrate empowered to takecognizance of the offence on a police report, and to try theaccused or commit him for trial.”Reinvestigation defined:the act or process of carefully examining a crime, problem, statement, etc. again, especially to discover the truth.

    "answer": "Dear clientHere's the breakdown of the difference between Multiple Enquiries and Further Investigation after a chargesheet:Multiple Enquiries:This refers to situations where the police reopen a closed investigation after giving a \"clean chit\" (finding no criminal wrongdoing).This can be harassing for the accused, who thought the matter was settled.The High Court is concerned about this practice, as it can be misused to target individuals.Further Investigation:This refers to the continuation of the original investigation after a chargesheet is filed.This is done if new evidence comes to light or there are loose ends that need tying up.It's a legitimate investigative tool, but only if done with proper justification.In your scenario:The police conducting further investigation and potentially discharging the accused seems like a legitimate use of their power.The High Court's request for a list of multiple enquiries shouldn't be seen as interference in this specific case.They are likely looking at broader trends and want to ensure further investigations are conducted only when necessary, not to reopen settled cases.Key Points:Multiple enquiries raise concerns about harassment and misuse of power.Further investigation is a valid tool for ongoing cases with new evidence.The High Court is likely trying to differentiate between the two practices.Additional Notes:Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Therefore, it should be impressed upon all the Courts that they should accept the charge-sheet whenever it is produced by the police with any endorsement to be made on the charge-sheet by the staff or the Magistrate pertaining to any omission or requirement in the charge-sheet.3)The word “custody” appearing in Section 170 of the Cr.P.C. does not contemplate either police or judicial custody but it merely connotes the presentation of the accused by the Investigating Officer before the court while filing the chargesheet.4) in response to your second query it does appear letter from IO is contrary to SC judgement5)any person who is willing to take responsibility for the accusedcan act as a surety. It can be a family member, friend, or any individual willing to vouch for the accused's appearance in court6)person can stand surety to more than one accused person, but he needs to make a declaration regarding this before the Court.7) Courts insists production of property documents. Sometimes, in lieu of the same, Courts demand production of RC books of two-wheelers, four-wheelers, etc.8)some times an accused, who is an utter stranger to the area or he has no friends or relatives in the area or he could not secure a person to stand as surety can offer cash surety. The Court can accept cash surety, instead of personal surety. But the Court cannot demand personal surety, property surety and cash surety, at a time. It is not cumulative. It is alternative.9) you can go abroad for work purposes or education if no conditions are imposed by court while granting bailotherwise you need court permission to travel abroad10) fixed deposit can work as surety11) discharge is good optionAjay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "answer": "I understand you're in a frustrating situation with the police case and considering going to the press. Here's a breakdown of your questions and some guidance:1. Challenging the Conviction:Reopening the case in the same court is unlikely. However, you can appeal the conviction to a higher court. A lawyer can advise on the best approach based on the specifics of your case.The inconsistencies in the police statements (SI vs. Constable) strengthen your case for appeal. A lawyer can highlight these discrepancies in the appeal.2. Press Interview:You can discuss the case with the press, but be mindful of what you say.Sticking to the facts in the charge sheet and court order is crucial. Avoid making unsubstantiated accusations.Defamation laws exist, but if you stay truthful and avoid personal attacks, the police filing a defamation case is less likely.3. Using Police Photos:Using the police officers' WhatsApp photos requires caution. Copyright laws might apply, and using them without permission could lead to legal trouble.4. Defamation Case Implications:If the police sue for defamation, the amount claimed can vary. The burden of proof lies on them to show your statements were false and caused them harm.5. Imprisonment:Since you paid the fine, you don't face imprisonment. Going to the press shouldn't change that.6. Other Legal Issues:There's a possibility of the police filing a counter-case for obstructing a public servant (original charge), but it depends on their actions.Consulting a lawyer specializing in media law can help you navigate the press conference and minimize legal risks.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Tax Distribution and Double Tax Treaty:Tax Residency: Since you have a valid work visa in Hong Kong, you'll likely be considered a tax resident there. This means your worldwide income, including earnings from India, could be taxable in Hong Kong.Double Tax Treaty: Fortunately, India and Hong Kong have a Double Tax Treaty. This treaty prevents double taxation on the same income.Tax Filing: You might need to file tax returns in both countries, but you can claim a tax credit in Hong Kong for taxes already paid in India under the treaty provisions. A tax advisor can help navigate the specifics.2. NRO Account:NRO Account is Suitable: An NRO account is the right choice for your situation. It allows you to receive income from India while residing abroad and hold it in rupees.3. Saving Taxes:Limited Options: While Hong Kong's tax rate is lower than India's, you might have limited opportunities for significant tax savings as a freelancer.Focus on Deductions: You can explore claiming business-related deductions in both India and Hong Kong (if applicable) to reduce your taxable income. These might include internet expenses, professional development costs, or a portion of your home office rent (subject to limitations).Recommendations:Understand Tax Filing Obligations: Get clarity on whether you need to file tax returns in both countries and the deadlines involved.Here are some additional resources:Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Different advocates providing conflicting information is quite common.Alternative: Marriage in Indonesia:Feasibility: Getting married in Indonesia can be a viable option, especially considering the challenges with the NOC.Interfaith Marriage: Indonesia allows interfaith marriages, but with a requirement: one partner must convert to Islam before the marriage. This might not be ideal for your situation.Validity of Indonesian Marriage in India:General Recognition: Marriages conducted abroad following the local laws are generally recognized as valid in India, provided both parties were legally competent to marry at the time.Registration: Once married in Indonesia, you'll need to register the marriage with the Indian Embassy in Indonesia and later get it re-registered in India upon your girlfriend's arrival.Addressing Your Concerns:Ex-Wife's Case: A valid marriage in Indonesia would strengthen your position if your ex-wife files a case.Recommendations:Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "What is the difference between Multiple Enquiries and Further Investigation?",
    "answer": "Difference between Investigation and Inquiry: Investigation involves a systematic process of examining and gathering evidence to uncover facts or resolve a specific matter, often pertaining to legal or serious issues. On the other hand, inquiry refers to a less formal exploration or seeking of information to gain understanding or knowledge about a subject..Section 169 of the CrPC reads as under:“169. Release of accused when evidence deficient.—If, upon an investigation under this Chapter, it appears to theofficer in charge of the police station that there is not sufficientevidence or reasonable ground of suspicion to justify theforwarding of the accused to a Magistrate, such officer shall, ifsuch person is in custody, release him on his executing a bond,with or without sureties, as such officer may direct, to appear, ifand when so required, before a Magistrate empowered to takecognizance of the offence on a police report, and to try theaccused or commit him for trial.”Reinvestigation defined:the act or process of carefully examining a crime, problem, statement, etc. again, especially to discover the truth. Understanding the Concept of Further InvestigationAs a result, if a charge-sheet has been filed, the investigating agency may conduct additional investigations, and the Court may order more investigations.

    "answer": "Dear clientHere's the breakdown of the difference between Multiple Enquiries and Further Investigation after a chargesheet:Multiple Enquiries:This refers to situations where the police reopen a closed investigation after giving a \"clean chit\" (finding no criminal wrongdoing).This can be harassing for the accused, who thought the matter was settled.The High Court is concerned about this practice, as it can be misused to target individuals.Further Investigation:This refers to the continuation of the original investigation after a chargesheet is filed.This is done if new evidence comes to light or there are loose ends that need tying up.It's a legitimate investigative tool, but only if done with proper justification.In your scenario:The police conducting further investigation and potentially discharging the accused seems like a legitimate use of their power.The High Court's request for a list of multiple enquiries shouldn't be seen as interference in this specific case.They are likely looking at broader trends and want to ensure further investigations are conducted only when necessary, not to reopen settled cases.Key Points:Multiple enquiries raise concerns about harassment and misuse of power.Further investigation is a valid tool for ongoing cases with new evidence.The High Court is likely trying to differentiate between the two practices.Additional Notes:Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Tenancy law for daughters",
    "answer": "The pagdi system was legalised by the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999. Generally, upon the death of a pagdi tenant, the tenancy rights are transferred to the legal heir/s who were living in the flat when the tenant died, by asking the landlord to issue the new rent receipts in the heir/s name/s.An agreement with the tenant will come to an end on the death of the tenant, the heirs will have no rights in the name of tenancy rights, they can stay there for a further period of one year/5 year as per the tenancy protection rights in the event of the death of tenant, therefore the so called legal heirs cannot claim tenancy rights or rental agreement in their names or object to the new rental agreement to the son of the deceased tenant in any manner and no such objections will sustain in law.Son selling off the property recently, by himself.In pagadi system though in literal language it is called as selling of the property, legallyNobody can claim a share in it as a right in any capacity, all such things have to be settled by a meeting among the family members only.As a matter of fact if you were not living or were with your father into the business at the time of his death, you can't claim inheritance of tenancy rights too.Thus better settle the matter amicably because in your family dispute the landlord will take benefit and throw everyone out of the shop without giving any benefits to anyone.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

Ultimatum and Options:Her husband's demands are controlling and isolate her from family. She shouldn't have to choose between peace and her children seeing their grandparents. Here are some options:Negotiate:Can they compromise? Maybe less frequent visits with clear communication.Counseling:Consider couples therapy to address communication and control issues.Leave:If negotiation fails, leaving might be necessary.2. Child Custody:It's hard to predict, but courts prioritize the children's well-being. Since they live together and he's a parent, getting full custody might be difficult for him. However, a contested custody battle can be stressful and expensive.3. Property Rights:Since she's a joint owner and contributed financially, she has rights to both flats. Not paying recent EMIs might affect the final division, but a lawyer can advise on her specific situation.4. Alimony:Depending on your location and her income, she might be eligible for spousal support, especially if there's a significant income disparity. A lawyer can advise on this.5. Lack of Support and Resources:Many legal aid organizations can offer support and representation in family law cases. It's worth exploring these options. Here are some resources to find legal aid:National Legal Aid & Defender Association: https://www.nlada.org/American Bar Association: [invalid URL removed]6. Recorded Calls:Admissibility of recordings depends on your location. It's best to consult a lawyer familiar with your state's laws to know if recordings are helpful evidence.Additional Tips:Document Everything:Keep records of communication (emails, texts) and any instances of abuse.Gather Financial Records:Document income, expenses, and contributions made towards the flats.Seek Support Network:Friends, family (even if limited), and support groups can provide emotional support."

Therefore, it should be impressed upon all the Courts that they should accept the charge-sheet whenever it is produced by the police with any endorsement to be made on the charge-sheet by the staff or the Magistrate pertaining to any omission or requirement in the charge-sheet.3)The word “custody” appearing in Section 170 of the Cr.P.C. does not contemplate either police or judicial custody but it merely connotes the presentation of the accused by the Investigating Officer before the court while filing the chargesheet.4) in response to your second query it does appear letter from IO is contrary to SC judgement5)any person who is willing to take responsibility for the accusedcan act as a surety. It can be a family member, friend, or any individual willing to vouch for the accused's appearance in court6)person can stand surety to more than one accused person, but he needs to make a declaration regarding this before the Court.7) Courts insists production of property documents.

The Court can accept cash surety, instead of personal surety. But the Court cannot demand personal surety, property surety and cash surety, at a time. It is not cumulative.

This could complicate identifying the source of funds used for the plot.Gift Documentation:A documented gift from your mother significantly strengthens your case.Intestacy Laws:Each state has its own laws regarding inheritance without a will. Knowing your state's laws is crucial.Recommendations:Consult a Lawyer:A lawyer specializing in property and inheritance law in your state can analyze your situation and advise on the best course of action.Gather Documents:Collect documents like bank statements showing the transfer from the joint account to your account, gift documents from your mother (if any), and land ownership/EMI payment proofs.Communication:Try to have an open conversation with your sister. Explain your perspective and show the documents. Perhaps you can reach an amicable agreement.Possible Outcomes:Agreement:Hopefully, with clear evidence and open communication, you and your sister can reach a mutually agreeable solution.Legal Battle:If no agreement is reached, a lawsuit might be necessary. A lawyer can represent you and fight for your ownership of the plot.Protecting Your Plot:Having a strong legal case with the documented financial trail and potentially involving a lawyer in communication with your sister can help deter her from taking legal action."

    "answer": "Dear clientHere's some guidance on managing your taxes as a freelance teacher in Hong Kong, earning from Indian EdTech companies:1. Tax Distribution and Double Tax Treaty:Tax Residency: Since you have a valid work visa in Hong Kong, you'll likely be considered a tax resident there. This means your worldwide income, including earnings from India, could be taxable in Hong Kong.Double Tax Treaty: Fortunately, India and Hong Kong have a Double Tax Treaty. This treaty prevents double taxation on the same income.Tax Filing: You might need to file tax returns in both countries, but you can claim a tax credit in Hong Kong for taxes already paid in India under the treaty provisions. A tax advisor can help navigate the specifics.2. NRO Account:NRO Account is Suitable: An NRO account is the right choice for your situation. It allows you to receive income from India while residing abroad and hold it in rupees.3. Saving Taxes:Limited Options: While Hong Kong's tax rate is lower than India's, you might have limited opportunities for significant tax savings as a freelancer.Focus on Deductions: You can explore claiming business-related deductions in both India and Hong Kong (if applicable) to reduce your taxable income. These might include internet expenses, professional development costs, or a portion of your home office rent (subject to limitations).Recommendations:Understand Tax Filing Obligations: Get clarity on whether you need to file tax returns in both countries and the deadlines involved.Here are some additional resources:Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can police file defamation case If I go to press on a false case they implicated on me",
    "answer": "I understand you're in a frustrating situation with the police case and considering going to the press. Here's a breakdown of your questions and some guidance:1. Challenging the Conviction:Reopening the case in the same court is unlikely. However, you can appeal the conviction to a higher court. A lawyer can advise on the best approach based on the specifics of your case.The inconsistencies in the police statements (SI vs. Constable) strengthen your case for appeal. A lawyer can highlight these discrepancies in the appeal.2. Press Interview:You can discuss the case with the press, but be mindful of what you say.Sticking to the facts in the charge sheet and court order is crucial. Avoid making unsubstantiated accusations.Defamation laws exist, but if you stay truthful and avoid personal attacks, the police filing a defamation case is less likely.3. Using Police Photos:Using the police officers' WhatsApp photos requires caution. Copyright laws might apply, and using them without permission could lead to legal trouble.4. Defamation Case Implications:If the police sue for defamation, the amount claimed can vary. The burden of proof lies on them to show your statements were false and caused them harm.5. Imprisonment:Since you paid the fine, you don't face imprisonment. Going to the press shouldn't change that.6. Other Legal Issues:There's a possibility of the police filing a counter-case for obstructing a public servant (original charge), but it depends on their actions.Consulting a lawyer specializing in media law can help you navigate the press conference and minimize legal risks.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Appearance before JIMC Court/Magistrate Court",
    "answer": "I have read your question and clearly stated that when charge sheet is filed you should  appear  before trial court and apply for regular bail2) SC has held refusal by criminal Courts either through the learned Magistrate or through their office staff to accept the charge-sheet without production of the accused persons is not justified by any provision of law. Therefore, it should be impressed upon all the Courts that they should accept the charge-sheet whenever it is produced by the police with any endorsement to be made on the charge-sheet by the staff or the Magistrate pertaining to any omission or requirement in the charge-sheet.3)The word “custody” appearing in Section 170 of the Cr.P.C. does not contemplate either police or judicial custody but it merely connotes the presentation of the accused by the Investigating Officer before the court while filing the chargesheet.4) in response to your second query it does appear letter from IO is contrary to SC judgement5)any person who is willing to take responsibility for the accusedcan act as a surety. It can be a family member, friend, or any individual willing to vouch for the accused's appearance in court6)person can stand surety to more than one accused person, but he needs to make a declaration regarding this before the Court.7) Courts insists production of property documents. Sometimes, in lieu of the same, Courts demand production of RC books of two-wheelers, four-wheelers, etc.8)some times an accused, who is an utter stranger to the area or he has no friends or relatives in the area or he could not secure a person to stand as surety can offer cash surety. The Court can accept cash surety, instead of personal surety. But the Court cannot demand personal surety, property surety and cash surety, at a time. It is not cumulative. It is alternative.9) you can go abroad for work purposes or education if no conditions are imposed by court while granting bailotherwise you need court permission to travel abroad10) fixed deposit can work as surety11) discharge is good optionAjay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear clientYes, you might be able to recover the loan amount you paid on your brother's behalf, with the loan agreement and bank statements as evidence. Here's how:1. Written Agreement:The strongest option is a written agreement between you and your brother. This agreement should clearly state:The amount you loaned him (your payments towards the loan).The interest rate (optional, but strengthens your claim).The repayment schedule.Signatures from both of you.2. Verbal Agreement with Documentation:If you don't have a written agreement, your situation can still be addressed, but it might be more challenging.The loan agreement and bank statements showing your payments can be used as evidence of your contribution.Steps to Recover the Amount:Communication:Talk to your brother openly about your situation.Documentation:Gather all documentation:Loan agreement (both your names should be on it).Bank statements highlighting your payments towards the loan.Repayment Plan:Work out a repayment plan with your brother that is comfortable for both of you.Formalize the Agreement (Optional):While a verbal agreement might work, consider getting a written repayment plan signed by both of you. This strengthens your claim in case of future disagreements.Legal Action (Last Resort):If your brother is unwilling to cooperate, you might have to consider legal action. This should be a last resort due to potential strain on your relationship.Key Points:Having a clear agreement upfront protects both you and your brother.Open communication is crucial throughout the process.Legal action should be a last resort.Additional Considerations:Tax implications: Depending on your location, there might be tax implications for the interest charged on the loan to your brother. Consulting a tax advisor might be helpful."

    "question": "Tenancy law for daughters",
    "answer": "The pagdi system was legalised by the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999. Generally, upon the death of a pagdi tenant, the tenancy rights are transferred to the legal heir/s who were living in the flat when the tenant died, by asking the landlord to issue the new rent receipts in the heir/s name/s.An agreement with the tenant will come to an end on the death of the tenant, the heirs will have no rights in the name of tenancy rights, they can stay there for a further period of one year/5 year as per the tenancy protection rights in the event of the death of tenant, therefore the so called legal heirs cannot claim tenancy rights or rental agreement in their names or object to the new rental agreement to the son of the deceased tenant in any manner and no such objections will sustain in law.Son selling off the property recently, by himself.In pagadi system though in literal language it is called as selling of the property, legallyNobody can claim a share in it as a right in any capacity, all such things have to be settled by a meeting among the family members only.As a matter of fact if you were not living or were with your father into the business at the time of his death, you can't claim inheritance of tenancy rights too.Thus better settle the matter amicably because in your family dispute the landlord will take benefit and throw everyone out of the shop without giving any benefits to anyone.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

This could complicate identifying the source of funds used for the plot.Gift Documentation:A documented gift from your mother significantly strengthens your case.Intestacy Laws:Each state has its own laws regarding inheritance without a will. Knowing your state's laws is crucial.Recommendations:Consult a Lawyer:A lawyer specializing in property and inheritance law in your state can analyze your situation and advise on the best course of action.Gather Documents:Collect documents like bank statements showing the transfer from the joint account to your account, gift documents from your mother (if any), and land ownership/EMI payment proofs.Communication:Try to have an open conversation with your sister. Explain your perspective and show the documents. Perhaps you can reach an amicable agreement.Possible Outcomes:Agreement:Hopefully, with clear evidence and open communication, you and your sister can reach a mutually agreeable solution.Legal Battle:If no agreement is reached, a lawsuit might be necessary. A lawyer can represent you and fight for your ownership of the plot.Protecting Your Plot:Having a strong legal case with the documented financial trail and potentially involving a lawyer in communication with your sister can help deter her from taking legal action."

No, you have no right as the father purchased the property himself and this property will considered as self-acquired property and for that Land he made a Will in favor of the grand children hence you have no right over that property i.e., property 26 acres.2. except 26 acres land, the properties sold by them without you are illegal and those sale deed can be cancelled by the Civil Court.3. Consider opinion no.1.4. those properties are related to grandchildren now after the execution of Will and death of your father.5. What will be challenged?6. The present owner related to 26 acres of property which was self-acquired property of your father who had executed a Will in favour of his grand children, those properties are safe and the present owner shall be legally owner of those properties but the sale deeds of those properties which were sold by them without your signature except that 26 acres, will be declare as null and void as you are also the share holder in the ancestral properties.7.

    "question": "Without Daughter signature father's self-acquired property sold by mother&brothers after FatherDeath",
    "answer": "Dear clientYour situation is complex and involves property law, succession rights, and interpreting a will. Here's a breakdown of your questions and some general advice (consulting a lawyer specializing in property law is highly recommended):Your Rights as a Daughter:Claiming Share: You likely have a right to claim your share of the 26 acres. TheHindu Succession Act, 1956 (amended in Andhra Pradesh) grants daughters equal coparcenary rights in their deceased father's self-acquired property.New Suit: You can potentially file a new suit for partition or declaration to claim your share against the current landowners. However, there might be complexities due to the time elapsed since the sale (2005) and the High Court order.Mother & Brother's Sale: The sale deed without your signature might be challenged if you weren't informed or given due share.Will and Grandchildren:Will & Grandchildren: The will might be challenged on grounds that it cannot override your rights as a legal heir under theHindu Succession Act. Since the grandchildren are now adults, the will's provisions regarding their rights might be irrelevant.Challenging Will: You and your brothers can potentially challenge the will. Being a witness in the will doesn't prevent S2 from inheriting, but the court will consider the circumstances.Current Landowners:Landowners' Rights: The current landowners might have some protection under \"bona fide purchaser\" principles if they bought the land without knowledge of any dispute. However, the specifics depend on the details of each sale.Limitation Period:Claiming Sold Property: Limitation period for property claims can vary depending on the nature of the suit. Consulting a lawyer is crucial to determine the applicable limitation period in your case. It might start from 2005 (sale year) or potentially from 2019 (when you learned about the land).Recommendation:Consult a lawyer specializing in property law in Andhra Pradesh. They can analyze the specific details of your case, including the will, sale deeds, and partition suit documents. Based on that, they can advise on the most suitable type of suit to file (partition, declaration, or something else) and the legal arguments with the strongest chance of success.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "The recent Madhya Pradesh High Court judgment (Writ Petition No. 2301 of 2024) you mentioned doesn't necessarily determine the absolute necessity of probate for mutation in all cases.Here's a breakdown:Probate vs. Mutation:Probate validates a will in court, granting legal recognition.Mutation updates land records with the new owner's name (in this case, the inheritor through the will).Relevance of the Judgment:Without access to the full judgment, it's difficult to say definitively.The court might have ruled based on specific facts of that case.General Scenario (assuming no dispute):In Madhya Pradesh, probate for mutation might not be mandatory if:The will is registered.There's no dispute about the will's authenticity.However, specific procedures for mutation might still be required.Additional Considerations:Some states in India might have different requirements for probate and mutation.Even if probate isn't mandatory, it can offer additional legal protection in case of future disputes.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

On the other hand, inquiry refers to a less formal exploration or seeking of information to gain understanding or knowledge about a subject..Section 169 of the CrPC reads as under:“169. Release of accused when evidence deficient.—If, upon an investigation under this Chapter, it appears to theofficer in charge of the police station that there is not sufficientevidence or reasonable ground of suspicion to justify theforwarding of the accused to a Magistrate, such officer shall, ifsuch person is in custody, release him on his executing a bond,with or without sureties, as such officer may direct, to appear, ifand when so required, before a Magistrate empowered to takecognizance of the offence on a police report, and to try theaccused or commit him for trial.”Reinvestigation defined:the act or process of carefully examining a crime, problem, statement, etc. again, especially to discover the truth.

    "question": "DRAT Status Quo order after the Auction and payment of 25% deposit",
    "answer": "Dear clientbased on your situation, considering you're in the United Arab Emirates with Hindu religious beliefs:Understanding the Situation:Status Quo Order:A \"Status Quo\" order from DRAT Allahabad (assuming it's Debt Recovery Tribunal) freezes the situation until the next hearing. This likely applies to all parties, including you (the buyer), the bank, and the borrower.Payment Due Date:You have an agreement with the bank to pay the remaining 75% within 90 days.Conflicting Demands:The bank wants payment while the court order restricts actions.Possible Courses of Action:Seek Clarification:You could try contacting DRAT Allahabad to understand the specific implications of the Status Quo order on your payment obligation.Communicate with the Bank:Inform the bank (in writing) about the court order and your inability to pay due to it. Express your willingness to pay once the order is lifted. Emphasize that you're adhering to the court order.Important Considerations:Non-Payment Risks:Not paying as per the agreement could lead to the bank taking action like forfeiting your deposit or initiating further legal proceedings.Contempt of Court:It's unlikely depositing the remaining amount would be considered contempt if the bank is willing to accept it (verify with a lawyer).Sale Letter:The bank might be hesitant to issue a sale letter due to the court order.Leveraging the Status Quo:The Status Quo order might provide temporary protection from the bank taking action against your deposit if it's interpreted to include a freeze on payments. However, a lawyer can confirm this interpretation.Religion and Property Law:Generally, religious beliefs shouldn't affect property law in the UAE. The focus will be on the contract and court order."

    "answer": "The pagdi system was legalised by the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999. Generally, upon the death of a pagdi tenant, the tenancy rights are transferred to the legal heir/s who were living in the flat when the tenant died, by asking the landlord to issue the new rent receipts in the heir/s name/s.An agreement with the tenant will come to an end on the death of the tenant, the heirs will have no rights in the name of tenancy rights, they can stay there for a further period of one year/5 year as per the tenancy protection rights in the event of the death of tenant, therefore the so called legal heirs cannot claim tenancy rights or rental agreement in their names or object to the new rental agreement to the son of the deceased tenant in any manner and no such objections will sustain in law.Son selling off the property recently, by himself.In pagadi system though in literal language it is called as selling of the property, legallyNobody can claim a share in it as a right in any capacity, all such things have to be settled by a meeting among the family members only.As a matter of fact if you were not living or were with your father into the business at the time of his death, you can't claim inheritance of tenancy rights too.Thus better settle the matter amicably because in your family dispute the landlord will take benefit and throw everyone out of the shop without giving any benefits to anyone.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Dear clientThis is a difficult situation and your sister has some tough choices to make. Here's a breakdown to help navigate:1. Ultimatum and Options:Her husband's demands are controlling and isolate her from family. She shouldn't have to choose between peace and her children seeing their grandparents. Here are some options:Negotiate:Can they compromise? Maybe less frequent visits with clear communication.Counseling:Consider couples therapy to address communication and control issues.Leave:If negotiation fails, leaving might be necessary.2. Child Custody:It's hard to predict, but courts prioritize the children's well-being. Since they live together and he's a parent, getting full custody might be difficult for him. However, a contested custody battle can be stressful and expensive.3. Property Rights:Since she's a joint owner and contributed financially, she has rights to both flats. Not paying recent EMIs might affect the final division, but a lawyer can advise on her specific situation.4. Alimony:Depending on your location and her income, she might be eligible for spousal support, especially if there's a significant income disparity. A lawyer can advise on this.5. Lack of Support and Resources:Many legal aid organizations can offer support and representation in family law cases. It's worth exploring these options. Here are some resources to find legal aid:National Legal Aid & Defender Association: https://www.nlada.org/American Bar Association: [invalid URL removed]6. Recorded Calls:Admissibility of recordings depends on your location. It's best to consult a lawyer familiar with your state's laws to know if recordings are helpful evidence.Additional Tips:Document Everything:Keep records of communication (emails, texts) and any instances of abuse.Gather Financial Records:Document income, expenses, and contributions made towards the flats.Seek Support Network:Friends, family (even if limited), and support groups can provide emotional support."

    "answer": "I understand this is a stressful situation. Here's some guidance on property inheritance and dealing with your brother in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, considering your Hindu religion:Inheritance Rights:In a Hindu Undivided Family (HUF), sons (including brothers) and daughters have coparcenary rights in ancestral property (inherited from grandparents or further generations).Since your mother passed away, her share would devolve upon your father and then be distributed as per the will or intestacy laws.Deed of Distribution:If your father has a registered deed dividing the assets, it will supersede intestacy laws and dictate the distribution of property.Selling the House:Selling While Father Alive:With a deed: If the deed allows selling the house, all co-owners (including your brother) must consent to the sale.Without a deed: All coparceners (father, you, and brother) have equal rights, and everyone's consent is required.Selling Part of the House (Floor-wise):This is not common in India but can be achieved through a partition suit in court. However, it's a complex and time-consuming process.Dealing with Brother:Negotiation:Try mediation or involving a respected family member to convince your brother to agree to a sale.Partition Suit:If negotiation fails, consider filing a partition suit in court to divide the property by metes and bounds (dividing the physical property) or selling it and dividing the proceeds.Legal Action Against Brother:Police Help:While police can't evict your brother as a co-owner, they can intervene if his behavior amounts to harassment or threats.Suit for Injunction:You or your father can file a suit for injunction to restrain your brother's disruptive behavior and ensure peaceful co-existence.Recommendations:Consult a lawyer specializing in property inheritance and family disputes in Lucknow. They can review the deed (if any) and advise on the most suitable course of action, including:Enforcing the terms of the deed (if it allows selling the house).Filing a partition suit if selling the entire house isn't feasible.Filing a suit for injunction against your brother's disruptive behavior."

This could involve compensation for your share of the terrace or revised construction plans that respect your rights.Mediation: A mediator can help facilitate a mutually agreeable solution.Legal Action: If negotiations fail, you might consider legal action to enforce your co-ownership rights and prevent unauthorized construction.

    "answer": "Dear clientbased on your situation, considering you're in the United Arab Emirates with Hindu religious beliefs:Understanding the Situation:Status Quo Order:A \"Status Quo\" order from DRAT Allahabad (assuming it's Debt Recovery Tribunal) freezes the situation until the next hearing. This likely applies to all parties, including you (the buyer), the bank, and the borrower.Payment Due Date:You have an agreement with the bank to pay the remaining 75% within 90 days.Conflicting Demands:The bank wants payment while the court order restricts actions.Possible Courses of Action:Seek Clarification:You could try contacting DRAT Allahabad to understand the specific implications of the Status Quo order on your payment obligation.Communicate with the Bank:Inform the bank (in writing) about the court order and your inability to pay due to it. Express your willingness to pay once the order is lifted. Emphasize that you're adhering to the court order.Important Considerations:Non-Payment Risks:Not paying as per the agreement could lead to the bank taking action like forfeiting your deposit or initiating further legal proceedings.Contempt of Court:It's unlikely depositing the remaining amount would be considered contempt if the bank is willing to accept it (verify with a lawyer).Sale Letter:The bank might be hesitant to issue a sale letter due to the court order.Leveraging the Status Quo:The Status Quo order might provide temporary protection from the bank taking action against your deposit if it's interpreted to include a freeze on payments. However, a lawyer can confirm this interpretation.Religion and Property Law:Generally, religious beliefs shouldn't affect property law in the UAE. The focus will be on the contract and court order."

    "question": "What is the difference between Multiple Enquiries and Further Investigation?",
    "answer": "Difference between Investigation and Inquiry: Investigation involves a systematic process of examining and gathering evidence to uncover facts or resolve a specific matter, often pertaining to legal or serious issues. On the other hand, inquiry refers to a less formal exploration or seeking of information to gain understanding or knowledge about a subject..Section 169 of the CrPC reads as under:“169. Release of accused when evidence deficient.—If, upon an investigation under this Chapter, it appears to theofficer in charge of the police station that there is not sufficientevidence or reasonable ground of suspicion to justify theforwarding of the accused to a Magistrate, such officer shall, ifsuch person is in custody, release him on his executing a bond,with or without sureties, as such officer may direct, to appear, ifand when so required, before a Magistrate empowered to takecognizance of the offence on a police report, and to try theaccused or commit him for trial.”Reinvestigation defined:the act or process of carefully examining a crime, problem, statement, etc. again, especially to discover the truth. Understanding the Concept of Further InvestigationAs a result, if a charge-sheet has been filed, the investigating agency may conduct additional investigations, and the Court may order more investigations. However, any further investigation will not imply a new investigation or a reinvestigation.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "What is the difference between Multiple Enquiries and Further Investigation?",
    "answer": "Dear clientHere's the breakdown of the difference between Multiple Enquiries and Further Investigation after a chargesheet:Multiple Enquiries:This refers to situations where the police reopen a closed investigation after giving a \"clean chit\" (finding no criminal wrongdoing).This can be harassing for the accused, who thought the matter was settled.The High Court is concerned about this practice, as it can be misused to target individuals.Further Investigation:This refers to the continuation of the original investigation after a chargesheet is filed.This is done if new evidence comes to light or there are loose ends that need tying up.It's a legitimate investigative tool, but only if done with proper justification.In your scenario:The police conducting further investigation and potentially discharging the accused seems like a legitimate use of their power.The High Court's request for a list of multiple enquiries shouldn't be seen as interference in this specific case.They are likely looking at broader trends and want to ensure further investigations are conducted only when necessary, not to reopen settled cases.Key Points:Multiple enquiries raise concerns about harassment and misuse of power.Further investigation is a valid tool for ongoing cases with new evidence.The High Court is likely trying to differentiate between the two practices.Additional Notes:Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Liability of legal heirs on secured loan",
    "answer": "In the case of a secured loan, the legal heirs of the borrower generally have a more limited liability compared to unsecured loans. Here's a breakdown:Secured Loan and Repayment:A secured loan involves pledging an asset (like property) as collateral for the loan.Upon the borrower's passing, the lender has two options:Recover from the estate: The lender can approach the legal heirs to recover the outstanding amount. However, unlike unsecured loans, heirs are not personally liable for the entire debt.Seize the pledged asset: The lender can repossess the secured asset and sell it through auction to recover the loan amount.Liability of Heirs:Heirs are only liable for the secured loan to the extent of the inherited assets.This means if the inherited assets are worth less than the outstanding loan, the heirs are only responsible for the value of the assets, not the remaining debt.Important Points:Heirs can choose to repay the loan and keep the asset.They can also disclaim the inheritance, including the secured asset, to avoid any liability.In some cases, the loan agreement might have a clause stating the transfer of liability to heirs upon the borrower's death. It's important to review the loan documents carefully.Recommendation:If you're an heir inheriting assets with an outstanding secured loan, it's wise to:Review the loan agreement to understand the terms and conditions.Get a valuation of the inherited asset.Consult with a financial advisor to determine the best course of action, considering factors like repaying the loan, selling the asset, or disclaiming the inheritance.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear clientYes, you might be able to recover the loan amount you paid on your brother's behalf, with the loan agreement and bank statements as evidence. Here's how:1. Written Agreement:The strongest option is a written agreement between you and your brother. This agreement should clearly state:The amount you loaned him (your payments towards the loan).The interest rate (optional, but strengthens your claim).The repayment schedule.Signatures from both of you.2. Verbal Agreement with Documentation:If you don't have a written agreement, your situation can still be addressed, but it might be more challenging.The loan agreement and bank statements showing your payments can be used as evidence of your contribution.Steps to Recover the Amount:Communication:Talk to your brother openly about your situation.Documentation:Gather all documentation:Loan agreement (both your names should be on it).Bank statements highlighting your payments towards the loan.Repayment Plan:Work out a repayment plan with your brother that is comfortable for both of you.Formalize the Agreement (Optional):While a verbal agreement might work, consider getting a written repayment plan signed by both of you. This strengthens your claim in case of future disagreements.Legal Action (Last Resort):If your brother is unwilling to cooperate, you might have to consider legal action. This should be a last resort due to potential strain on your relationship.Key Points:Having a clear agreement upfront protects both you and your brother.Open communication is crucial throughout the process.Legal action should be a last resort.Additional Considerations:Tax implications: Depending on your location, there might be tax implications for the interest charged on the loan to your brother. Consulting a tax advisor might be helpful."

Ultimatum and Options:Her husband's demands are controlling and isolate her from family. She shouldn't have to choose between peace and her children seeing their grandparents. Here are some options:Negotiate:Can they compromise? Maybe less frequent visits with clear communication.Counseling:Consider couples therapy to address communication and control issues.Leave:If negotiation fails, leaving might be necessary.2. Child Custody:It's hard to predict, but courts prioritize the children's well-being. Since they live together and he's a parent, getting full custody might be difficult for him. However, a contested custody battle can be stressful and expensive.3. Property Rights:Since she's a joint owner and contributed financially, she has rights to both flats. Not paying recent EMIs might affect the final division, but a lawyer can advise on her specific situation.4. Alimony:Depending on your location and her income, she might be eligible for spousal support, especially if there's a significant income disparity. A lawyer can advise on this.5. Lack of Support and Resources:Many legal aid organizations can offer support and representation in family law cases. It's worth exploring these options. Here are some resources to find legal aid:National Legal Aid & Defender Association: https://www.nlada.org/American Bar Association: [invalid URL removed]6. Recorded Calls:Admissibility of recordings depends on your location. It's best to consult a lawyer familiar with your state's laws to know if recordings are helpful evidence.Additional Tips:Document Everything:Keep records of communication (emails, texts) and any instances of abuse.Gather Financial Records:Document income, expenses, and contributions made towards the flats.Seek Support Network:Friends, family (even if limited), and support groups can provide emotional support."

This could complicate identifying the source of funds used for the plot.Gift Documentation:A documented gift from your mother significantly strengthens your case.Intestacy Laws:Each state has its own laws regarding inheritance without a will. Knowing your state's laws is crucial.Recommendations:Consult a Lawyer:A lawyer specializing in property and inheritance law in your state can analyze your situation and advise on the best course of action.Gather Documents:Collect documents like bank statements showing the transfer from the joint account to your account, gift documents from your mother (if any), and land ownership/EMI payment proofs.Communication:Try to have an open conversation with your sister. Explain your perspective and show the documents. Perhaps you can reach an amicable agreement.Possible Outcomes:Agreement:Hopefully, with clear evidence and open communication, you and your sister can reach a mutually agreeable solution.Legal Battle:If no agreement is reached, a lawsuit might be necessary. A lawyer can represent you and fight for your ownership of the plot.Protecting Your Plot:Having a strong legal case with the documented financial trail and potentially involving a lawyer in communication with your sister can help deter her from taking legal action."

    "question": "OBC reservation during recruitment",
    "answer": "Dear clientThe possibility of submitting your OBC Non-Creamy Layer (NCL) certificate and being considered under the OBC category at this stage depends on the specific university's recruitment policies and how far along you are in the selection process. Here's a breakdown of the possibilities:Possible Scenarios:Early Stage of Selection:If you're shortlisted for the interview stage but haven't yet been interviewed, there might be a chance to submit your OBC NCL certificate and request to be considered under the OBC category.Action: Contact the university's recruitment department immediately. Explain your situation and inquire about the possibility of submitting the OBC NCL certificate for OBC category consideration.Later Stage of Selection:If you've already been interviewed under the Unreserved category, it's less likely they'll allow a category switch at this point. Selection processes are designed to be fair and consistent, and changing categories midway might disadvantage other candidates.University Policy:The key factor is the university's recruitment policy. Some universities might have a clause allowing category change at specific stages (before interview) with proper justification.Action: Review the university's recruitment notification or advertisement for Assistant Professor. Look for sections on category, reservation, and document submission. You might also find contact information for the recruitment department.General Recommendation:Contact the university's recruitment department as soon as possible. Explain your situation and inquire about the possibility of submitting the OBC NCL certificate. Be polite, professional, and highlight your qualifications for the position.Additional Tips:Even if they don't allow a category switch, attending the interview under the Unreserved category still showcases your skills and experience. You might still impress the selection committee and get shortlisted.If you don't get selected this time, keep an eye out for future openings at the university. By the next application round, you'll have your OBC NCL certificate ready and can apply under the OBC category from the beginning.Remember, this is general advice. The specific situation depends on the university's recruitment policy. By contacting them directly, you can get the most accurate and up-to-date information.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "The recent Madhya Pradesh High Court judgment (Writ Petition No. 2301 of 2024) you mentioned doesn't necessarily determine the absolute necessity of probate for mutation in all cases.Here's a breakdown:Probate vs. Mutation:Probate validates a will in court, granting legal recognition.Mutation updates land records with the new owner's name (in this case, the inheritor through the will).Relevance of the Judgment:Without access to the full judgment, it's difficult to say definitively.The court might have ruled based on specific facts of that case.General Scenario (assuming no dispute):In Madhya Pradesh, probate for mutation might not be mandatory if:The will is registered.There's no dispute about the will's authenticity.However, specific procedures for mutation might still be required.Additional Considerations:Some states in India might have different requirements for probate and mutation.Even if probate isn't mandatory, it can offer additional legal protection in case of future disputes.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It was feared that while applying for Visa by the girl submitting the marriage certificate, the Consulate will find from the records that the groom was not present in India at all to marry socially and she will be black listed for ever.4. An application was filed before the Registrar General of Marriage stating that their religious marriage was performed on 21.5.2019 which was told to the Registrar but he entered the year 2021 in place of 2019 in the on line form which is required to be rectified now.5.

Express your willingness to pay once the order is lifted. Emphasize that you're adhering to the court order.Important Considerations:Non-Payment Risks:Not paying as per the agreement could lead to the bank taking action like forfeiting your deposit or initiating further legal proceedings.Contempt of Court:It's unlikely depositing the remaining amount would be considered contempt if the bank is willing to accept it (verify with a lawyer).Sale Letter:The bank might be hesitant to issue a sale letter due to the court order.Leveraging the Status Quo:The Status Quo order might provide temporary protection from the bank taking action against your deposit if it's interpreted to include a freeze on payments. However, a lawyer can confirm this interpretation.Religion and Property Law:Generally, religious beliefs shouldn't affect property law in the UAE. The focus will be on the contract and court order."

Here are some options:Negotiate:Can they compromise? Maybe less frequent visits with clear communication.Counseling:Consider couples therapy to address communication and control issues.Leave:If negotiation fails, leaving might be necessary.2.

    "question": "Sharing investment",
    "answer": "Dear clientHere's a breakdown of the situation and potential legal consequences:Your Sister's Claim:Since your father died intestate (without a will), your mother and sister would likely inherit his share of the joint account equally (depending on state laws).Your sister argues that part of the money used for the plot belonged to your father, and therefore, she deserves a share in the land.Your Defense:You can argue that the money in the joint account became your mother's after your father's passing.You can demonstrate the financial trail: Show documents proving the money you used for the plot came from your mother's gift.Proof of EMI payments on the plot in your name strengthens your claim.Legal Considerations:Joint Account Ownership:In most cases, upon a joint owner's death, the surviving owner inherits the deceased's share. This could complicate identifying the source of funds used for the plot.Gift Documentation:A documented gift from your mother significantly strengthens your case.Intestacy Laws:Each state has its own laws regarding inheritance without a will. Knowing your state's laws is crucial.Recommendations:Consult a Lawyer:A lawyer specializing in property and inheritance law in your state can analyze your situation and advise on the best course of action.Gather Documents:Collect documents like bank statements showing the transfer from the joint account to your account, gift documents from your mother (if any), and land ownership/EMI payment proofs.Communication:Try to have an open conversation with your sister. Explain your perspective and show the documents. Perhaps you can reach an amicable agreement.Possible Outcomes:Agreement:Hopefully, with clear evidence and open communication, you and your sister can reach a mutually agreeable solution.Legal Battle:If no agreement is reached, a lawsuit might be necessary. A lawyer can represent you and fight for your ownership of the plot.Protecting Your Plot:Having a strong legal case with the documented financial trail and potentially involving a lawyer in communication with your sister can help deter her from taking legal action."

This could involve compensation for your share of the terrace or revised construction plans that respect your rights.Mediation: A mediator can help facilitate a mutually agreeable solution.Legal Action: If negotiations fail, you might consider legal action to enforce your co-ownership rights and prevent unauthorized construction. A lawyer can advise on the most suitable course of action.Additional Considerations:Review Deed & Building Documents: A lawyer can examine your property deed, building plans, and any relevant MCD regulations to determine the legalities of construction and your rights.Notice to New Terrace Owner & Co-Owners: Sending a formal notice outlining your concerns and referencing your co-ownership rights might be a good first step.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear clientYour situation is complex and involves property law, succession rights, and interpreting a will. Here's a breakdown of your questions and some general advice (consulting a lawyer specializing in property law is highly recommended):Your Rights as a Daughter:Claiming Share: You likely have a right to claim your share of the 26 acres. TheHindu Succession Act, 1956 (amended in Andhra Pradesh) grants daughters equal coparcenary rights in their deceased father's self-acquired property.New Suit: You can potentially file a new suit for partition or declaration to claim your share against the current landowners. However, there might be complexities due to the time elapsed since the sale (2005) and the High Court order.Mother & Brother's Sale: The sale deed without your signature might be challenged if you weren't informed or given due share.Will and Grandchildren:Will & Grandchildren: The will might be challenged on grounds that it cannot override your rights as a legal heir under theHindu Succession Act. Since the grandchildren are now adults, the will's provisions regarding their rights might be irrelevant.Challenging Will: You and your brothers can potentially challenge the will. Being a witness in the will doesn't prevent S2 from inheriting, but the court will consider the circumstances.Current Landowners:Landowners' Rights: The current landowners might have some protection under \"bona fide purchaser\" principles if they bought the land without knowledge of any dispute. However, the specifics depend on the details of each sale.Limitation Period:Claiming Sold Property: Limitation period for property claims can vary depending on the nature of the suit. Consulting a lawyer is crucial to determine the applicable limitation period in your case. It might start from 2005 (sale year) or potentially from 2019 (when you learned about the land).Recommendation:Consult a lawyer specializing in property law in Andhra Pradesh. They can analyze the specific details of your case, including the will, sale deeds, and partition suit documents. Based on that, they can advise on the most suitable type of suit to file (partition, declaration, or something else) and the legal arguments with the strongest chance of success.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "The recent Madhya Pradesh High Court judgment (Writ Petition No. 2301 of 2024) you mentioned doesn't necessarily determine the absolute necessity of probate for mutation in all cases.Here's a breakdown:Probate vs. Mutation:Probate validates a will in court, granting legal recognition.Mutation updates land records with the new owner's name (in this case, the inheritor through the will).Relevance of the Judgment:Without access to the full judgment, it's difficult to say definitively.The court might have ruled based on specific facts of that case.General Scenario (assuming no dispute):In Madhya Pradesh, probate for mutation might not be mandatory if:The will is registered.There's no dispute about the will's authenticity.However, specific procedures for mutation might still be required.Additional Considerations:Some states in India might have different requirements for probate and mutation.Even if probate isn't mandatory, it can offer additional legal protection in case of future disputes.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Liability of legal heirs on secured loan",
    "answer": "In the case of a secured loan, the legal heirs of the borrower generally have a more limited liability compared to unsecured loans. Here's a breakdown:Secured Loan and Repayment:A secured loan involves pledging an asset (like property) as collateral for the loan.Upon the borrower's passing, the lender has two options:Recover from the estate: The lender can approach the legal heirs to recover the outstanding amount. However, unlike unsecured loans, heirs are not personally liable for the entire debt.Seize the pledged asset: The lender can repossess the secured asset and sell it through auction to recover the loan amount.Liability of Heirs:Heirs are only liable for the secured loan to the extent of the inherited assets.This means if the inherited assets are worth less than the outstanding loan, the heirs are only responsible for the value of the assets, not the remaining debt.Important Points:Heirs can choose to repay the loan and keep the asset.They can also disclaim the inheritance, including the secured asset, to avoid any liability.In some cases, the loan agreement might have a clause stating the transfer of liability to heirs upon the borrower's death. It's important to review the loan documents carefully.Recommendation:If you're an heir inheriting assets with an outstanding secured loan, it's wise to:Review the loan agreement to understand the terms and conditions.Get a valuation of the inherited asset.Consult with a financial advisor to determine the best course of action, considering factors like repaying the loan, selling the asset, or disclaiming the inheritance.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It indicates shared ownership or usage rights over the terrace.MCD Regulations: Building codes and regulations in South Delhi by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) might restrict adding floors without proper approvals and adherence to structural safety standards.Potential Challenges to Construction:Co-Owner Consent: Since you're a 1/3 owner and have documented terrace rights, their construction on the terrace without your consent might be challenged.Building Codes: Adding a floor might violate local building codes or require specific permissions and structural assessments, potentially delaying or halting construction.Possible Courses of Action (Consult a Lawyer):Negotiation: Discuss a solution with the new terrace owner and other co-owners. This could involve compensation for your share of the terrace or revised construction plans that respect your rights.Mediation: A mediator can help facilitate a mutually agreeable solution.Legal Action: If negotiations fail, you might consider legal action to enforce your co-ownership rights and prevent unauthorized construction. A lawyer can advise on the most suitable course of action.Additional Considerations:Review Deed & Building Documents: A lawyer can examine your property deed, building plans, and any relevant MCD regulations to determine the legalities of construction and your rights.Notice to New Terrace Owner & Co-Owners: Sending a formal notice outlining your concerns and referencing your co-ownership rights might be a good first step.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear clientI understand this is a stressful situation. Here's a breakdown of your situation and some potential next steps:Repercussions for You:Since you were a minor when the loan was taken, you generally cannot be held personally liable for the debt. The bank's recourse would primarily be against the mortgaged property and your father's assets as guarantor.Outstanding Amount and Negotiations:The high claimed amount due to accrued interest is a common issue with NPAs. It's crucial to negotiate a settlement with the bank. Here's how you can approach it:Gather Documents: Collect all loan-related documents (agreement, repayment history, court order etc.)Dispute the Claimed Amount: You can contest the high interest amount with the bank. Present a clear breakdown of the original loan amount and any payments made.Settlement Offer: Propose a settlement offer that considers the property's current market value and your capacity to repay.Resolving the Debt:Auction and Settlement:If the auction proceeds cover the entire outstanding balance (including a negotiated settlement), the issue is resolved.If the auction proceeds fall short, the bank can pursue recovery from your father's assets as per the guarantor agreement.Personal Assets:As you were a minor when the loan was taken, your personal savings and properties are generally not at risk unless you used them as collateral for the loan or signed any guarantee agreements yourself.Communication with Bank: Maintain open communication with Canara Bank. Explain your situation and willingness to resolve the debt.Explore One-Time Settlement Schemes: Banks often offer one-time settlement (OTS) schemes for NPAs with a significant discount on the outstanding amount.

    "answer": "Dear clientThe possibility of submitting your OBC Non-Creamy Layer (NCL) certificate and being considered under the OBC category at this stage depends on the specific university's recruitment policies and how far along you are in the selection process. Here's a breakdown of the possibilities:Possible Scenarios:Early Stage of Selection:If you're shortlisted for the interview stage but haven't yet been interviewed, there might be a chance to submit your OBC NCL certificate and request to be considered under the OBC category.Action: Contact the university's recruitment department immediately. Explain your situation and inquire about the possibility of submitting the OBC NCL certificate for OBC category consideration.Later Stage of Selection:If you've already been interviewed under the Unreserved category, it's less likely they'll allow a category switch at this point. Selection processes are designed to be fair and consistent, and changing categories midway might disadvantage other candidates.University Policy:The key factor is the university's recruitment policy. Some universities might have a clause allowing category change at specific stages (before interview) with proper justification.Action: Review the university's recruitment notification or advertisement for Assistant Professor. Look for sections on category, reservation, and document submission. You might also find contact information for the recruitment department.General Recommendation:Contact the university's recruitment department as soon as possible. Explain your situation and inquire about the possibility of submitting the OBC NCL certificate. Be polite, professional, and highlight your qualifications for the position.Additional Tips:Even if they don't allow a category switch, attending the interview under the Unreserved category still showcases your skills and experience. You might still impress the selection committee and get shortlisted.If you don't get selected this time, keep an eye out for future openings at the university. By the next application round, you'll have your OBC NCL certificate ready and can apply under the OBC category from the beginning.Remember, this is general advice. The specific situation depends on the university's recruitment policy.

Here's some information to help you decide, but it's important to understand this isn't legal advice.Registering Flat with Pending Layout Plan:Potential Risk: Registering a flat where the layout plan for your specific floor (18th) is unavailable might be risky.Approval Uncertainties: Without the approved layout plan, there's no guarantee the 18th floor will be built as envisioned, impacting the flat's size, location, or configuration.Key Points to Consider:Developer's Assurance: While the developer might claim sufficient FSI (Floor Space Index) is available, rely only on official approvals, not verbal assurances.Sub-Registrar's Role: The sub-registrar might register the flat despite the missing layout plan, but it doesn't guarantee future approvals or the final configuration of your flat.Recommendations:Delay Registration: Consider waiting until the layout plan for the 18th floor is approved by the authorities. This provides clarity on the flat's specifics before registration.Consult Lawyer: A lawyer specializing in property law can review the agreement and advise on the risks and benefits of registering before the layout plan is finalized. They can also help negotiate terms that protect your interests in case of layout changes.Additional Considerations:Financial Implications: If the layout changes significantly after registration, you might have limited recourse, especially if the final flat size is smaller than what you envisioned.Time Factor: While waiting for the layout plan might delay registration, it could save you from potential issues later.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This likely applies to all parties, including you (the buyer), the bank, and the borrower.Payment Due Date:You have an agreement with the bank to pay the remaining 75% within 90 days.Conflicting Demands:The bank wants payment while the court order restricts actions.Possible Courses of Action:Seek Clarification:You could try contacting DRAT Allahabad to understand the specific implications of the Status Quo order on your payment obligation.Communicate with the Bank:Inform the bank (in writing) about the court order and your inability to pay due to it. Express your willingness to pay once the order is lifted. Emphasize that you're adhering to the court order.Important Considerations:Non-Payment Risks:Not paying as per the agreement could lead to the bank taking action like forfeiting your deposit or initiating further legal proceedings.Contempt of Court:It's unlikely depositing the remaining amount would be considered contempt if the bank is willing to accept it (verify with a lawyer).Sale Letter:The bank might be hesitant to issue a sale letter due to the court order.Leveraging the Status Quo:The Status Quo order might provide temporary protection from the bank taking action against your deposit if it's interpreted to include a freeze on payments. However, a lawyer can confirm this interpretation.Religion and Property Law:Generally, religious beliefs shouldn't affect property law in the UAE. The focus will be on the contract and court order."

    "question": "Liability of legal heirs on secured loan",
    "answer": "In the case of a secured loan, the legal heirs of the borrower generally have a more limited liability compared to unsecured loans. Here's a breakdown:Secured Loan and Repayment:A secured loan involves pledging an asset (like property) as collateral for the loan.Upon the borrower's passing, the lender has two options:Recover from the estate: The lender can approach the legal heirs to recover the outstanding amount. However, unlike unsecured loans, heirs are not personally liable for the entire debt.Seize the pledged asset: The lender can repossess the secured asset and sell it through auction to recover the loan amount.Liability of Heirs:Heirs are only liable for the secured loan to the extent of the inherited assets.This means if the inherited assets are worth less than the outstanding loan, the heirs are only responsible for the value of the assets, not the remaining debt.Important Points:Heirs can choose to repay the loan and keep the asset.They can also disclaim the inheritance, including the secured asset, to avoid any liability.In some cases, the loan agreement might have a clause stating the transfer of liability to heirs upon the borrower's death. It's important to review the loan documents carefully.Recommendation:If you're an heir inheriting assets with an outstanding secured loan, it's wise to:Review the loan agreement to understand the terms and conditions.Get a valuation of the inherited asset.Consult with a financial advisor to determine the best course of action, considering factors like repaying the loan, selling the asset, or disclaiming the inheritance.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Document for transfer of tenancy to family member staying with tenant at her time of death in Mumbai",
    "answer": "Dear clientIn your situation, a few things need to be considered:Tenancy Rights and Agreements:Rent Control Laws:Mumbai falls under the Rent Control Act, 1948. Since your mother has been occupying the flat since 1970, you and your sister likely have inherited tenancy rights. These rights are generally protected under the Act, and a formal tenancy agreement might not be mandatory, especially if rent has been paid continuously.Landlord's Insistence:However, the Parsi trust managing the building might still prefer a documented agreement for record-keeping purposes or to clarify terms of occupancy.Negotiate the Agreement:If a lawyer advises a tenancy agreement is best, work with the trust to draft a document outlining:Details of the parties involved (you, your sister & the trust)Description of the flatMonthly rent amountDeposit details (if any)Term of occupancy (if applicable)Rights and responsibilities of both parties (maintenance, repairs etc.)Stamp Duty and Registration:If a tenancy agreement is drafted, stamp duty will likely be applicable based on the rent amount and agreement duration. A lawyer can advise on the exact stamp duty amount applicable in Maharashtra.Registration of the agreement is generally not mandatory for leave and license agreements (common in trust buildings) with a term less than 12 months. However, registration offers stronger legal protection in case of disputes. A lawyer can advise on the benefits and costs involved in registration."

    "answer": "Dear clientbased on your situation, considering you're in the United Arab Emirates with Hindu religious beliefs:Understanding the Situation:Status Quo Order:A \"Status Quo\" order from DRAT Allahabad (assuming it's Debt Recovery Tribunal) freezes the situation until the next hearing. This likely applies to all parties, including you (the buyer), the bank, and the borrower.Payment Due Date:You have an agreement with the bank to pay the remaining 75% within 90 days.Conflicting Demands:The bank wants payment while the court order restricts actions.Possible Courses of Action:Seek Clarification:You could try contacting DRAT Allahabad to understand the specific implications of the Status Quo order on your payment obligation.Communicate with the Bank:Inform the bank (in writing) about the court order and your inability to pay due to it. Express your willingness to pay once the order is lifted. Emphasize that you're adhering to the court order.Important Considerations:Non-Payment Risks:Not paying as per the agreement could lead to the bank taking action like forfeiting your deposit or initiating further legal proceedings.Contempt of Court:It's unlikely depositing the remaining amount would be considered contempt if the bank is willing to accept it (verify with a lawyer).Sale Letter:The bank might be hesitant to issue a sale letter due to the court order.Leveraging the Status Quo:The Status Quo order might provide temporary protection from the bank taking action against your deposit if it's interpreted to include a freeze on payments. However, a lawyer can confirm this interpretation.Religion and Property Law:Generally, religious beliefs shouldn't affect property law in the UAE. The focus will be on the contract and court order."

    "question": "Mortgage loan repayment responsibilities and legal implications",
    "answer": "Dear clientI understand this is a stressful situation. Here's a breakdown of your situation and some potential next steps:Repercussions for You:Since you were a minor when the loan was taken, you generally cannot be held personally liable for the debt. The bank's recourse would primarily be against the mortgaged property and your father's assets as guarantor.Outstanding Amount and Negotiations:The high claimed amount due to accrued interest is a common issue with NPAs. It's crucial to negotiate a settlement with the bank. Here's how you can approach it:Gather Documents: Collect all loan-related documents (agreement, repayment history, court order etc.)Dispute the Claimed Amount: You can contest the high interest amount with the bank. Present a clear breakdown of the original loan amount and any payments made.Settlement Offer: Propose a settlement offer that considers the property's current market value and your capacity to repay.Resolving the Debt:Auction and Settlement:If the auction proceeds cover the entire outstanding balance (including a negotiated settlement), the issue is resolved.If the auction proceeds fall short, the bank can pursue recovery from your father's assets as per the guarantor agreement.Personal Assets:As you were a minor when the loan was taken, your personal savings and properties are generally not at risk unless you used them as collateral for the loan or signed any guarantee agreements yourself.Communication with Bank: Maintain open communication with Canara Bank. Explain your situation and willingness to resolve the debt.Explore One-Time Settlement Schemes: Banks often offer one-time settlement (OTS) schemes for NPAs with a significant discount on the outstanding amount.

    "answer": "Dear Sir,No. Not. As far as I know, it won't. A mere spelling mistake is not that a big issue until and unless it changes the entire name itself. Like for example if your father's name is Kumar for instance and in your documents it has been written as Komar then won't be a problem. This is a general fault which may occur at any stage in life. If you are an Indian Citizen, then it's automatically understood that you may have a hard time getting the right spelling of your name mentioned on the voter id card.So, as far as I know, it hardly matters.

Since the second accused is a woman, it applies in this case.34 IPC: This section refers to \"common intention\" where multiple people are involved in a crime.Points in Your Favor:Mutual Divorce: A healthy relationship post-divorce weakens the claim of harassment.Delay in Charge Sheet: The significant delay in filing the charge sheet can be questioned.No Confiscation of Devices: The lack of police investigation regarding your phone or laptop strengthens your case.Recommended Course of Action:Consult a New Lawyer: Consider seeking a second opinion from a criminal lawyer experienced in similar cases.Discuss Quashing the Case: Explore the possibility of filing a petition to quash the case before a higher court (High Court) due to lack of evidence and unreasonable delay.Gather Evidence: Collect documents like the divorce decree, communication records (if any) showing a cordial relationship with your ex-wife's family, and any proof of your alibi during the alleged harassment period.Consider Anticipatory Bail for Accused 2: If the second accused is apprehensive about appearing in court, discuss the possibility of filing anticipatory bail.Additional Tips:Maintain a Paper Trail: Document all communication with your lawyer and court proceedings.Be Patient & Persistent: The legal process can be slow, but persistence is key.Disclaimer:Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Need help on how to negotiate apartment price with builder",
    "answer": "Here's how you can approach negotiating the price for your desired 4-BHK duplex apartment:Before Negotiation:Research: Check similar projects in the area and their pricing for 4-BHK duplexes. This will give you a benchmark for negotiation.Feasibility: Confirm with the builder if combining two 2-BHK flats into a 4-BHK duplex is structurally possible. Get this confirmation in writing. There might be limitations due to load-bearing walls etc.Negotiation Points:Bulk Purchase Discount: Highlight that you're purchasing two units, generating a larger sale for them. Request a discount for this bulk purchase.Double Charges for Amenities: Point out that you're essentially paying double for amenities like water, STP, power backup, etc., by buying two flats. Negotiate a combined rate for these considering the shared usage.Structural Changes: Negotiate for the builder to absorb some or all the cost of structural changes needed for combining the flats. This is because it saves them the cost of finishing another separate unit.Payment Terms: If possible, offer a faster payment turnaround in exchange for a better price. This incentivizes the builder to close the deal quickly.Alternative: Express willingness to walk away if negotiations aren't satisfactory. However, ensure you have explored other options and are genuinely prepared to do so.Reaching Your Budget:With your budget of 1.6-1.7 Crore, aim for a price per square foot lower than the quoted 7000/sqft for the flats.Negotiate a combined price for the two flats that falls within your budget, considering the saved amenity charges and potential discount for structural changes.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

While the law protects women's property rights, social pressures regarding ancestral land might remain.Indian Christian Marriage Act (ICMA)Benefits:Religious Sanction: May hold religious significance for the Christian partner and their family.Drawbacks:Conversion Requirement: The non-Christian partner would need to convert to Christianity before marriage.Unequal Inheritance (Possible): In some Christian denominations, inheritance laws might favor male offspring. It's crucial to understand the specific denomination's practices.Rights to Consider:Property and Inheritance: Both SMA and ICMA provide women with inheritance rights. However, local customs and traditions regarding ancestral property, especially in the boy's case, might influence how inheritance is handled in practice. Open communication with both families is essential.Religious Freedom: The SMA safeguards the right to practice one's religion after marriage.

    "question": "Defamation and company law",
    "answer": ". Legal Notice for False Advertisement and Website Information:Yes, you can send a legal notice. In India, theConsumer Protection Act, 2019 protects consumers from misleading advertisements and unfair trade practices. A legal notice can be a first step to address the issue.Sections Applicable: The relevant sections of theConsumer Protection Actinclude:Section 2(14): Defines \"unfair trade practice\" which can include false or misleading advertisements.Section 12(1)(d): Prohibits misleading advertisements.Punishment: The Act empowers authorities to impose penalties on companies engaging in unfair trade practices. These can include:Issuing directions to stop the practice.Ordering refunds or compensation to consumers.Imposing penalties.2. Defamation Notice on Social Media (Son Over 18):Yes, the mother can send a legal notice on her son's behalf. In India, a person has the right to defend their reputation. Even though the son is an adult, the mother can act on his behalf with his authorization.Section Applicable: TheIndian Penal Code(IPC) Section 499 defines defamation. A legal notice can reference this section to highlight the offense.3. Legal Notice for Unfulfilled WhatsApp Assurance:Potentially, a legal notice can be sent. The enforceability of a WhatsApp assurance depends on the content and context.Section Applicable: The Indian Contract Act, 1872 lays the foundation for contracts. A well-crafted WhatsApp message might be considered a valid contract, especially if it contains specific details about the agreement. Section 10 of the Act mentions a written contract not required by law to be in any specific form.Important Considerations:Legal Notice is a Pre-litigation Step: A legal notice serves as a formal warning to the company. It doesn't guarantee a resolution but can be a starting point for negotiation or further legal action.Consult a Lawyer: For all these scenarios, consulting a lawyer specializing in consumer protection or contract law is recommended. They can assess the specifics of your situation and advise on the most effective course of action.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Refund for flat booking and registration",
    "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about your father's passing. Here's the general procedure to follow for getting a refund on a booked flat when the registered owner has passed away:1. Contact the Developer:The first step is to get in touch with the developer or builder you made the booking with.Inform them about your father's passing and your intention to seek a refund.Submit copies of the death certificate, booking documents, and payment slips as proof.2. Review the Agreement:Carefully examine the terms and conditions mentioned in the flat booking agreement.These documents often outline the process for refunds in case of unforeseen circumstances like death.3. Nomination Clause:Check if the booking agreement has a nomination clause. This clause allows the registered owner to nominate someone to inherit the booked flat in case of death.If a nominee is present, the refund process might be smoother as the nominee can take over the booking.4. Inherited Property:If there's no nominee and you intend to inherit the property, legalities might be involved. You might need to obtain a probate (court order) to establish yourself as the legal heir.A lawyer can guide you through the probate process.5. Developer's Policy:The developer might have a specific policy regarding refunds in case of death.Some developers might offer a full or partial refund, while others might allow you to transfer the booking to another person.Additional Tips:Stay Polite and Proactive: Maintain clear communication with the developer and keep following up on your request.Gather All Documentation: Ensure you have all relevant documents like death certificate, booking agreement, payment proofs, and any communication with the developer readily availableAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "I understand this is a sensitive situation involving the well-being of a young orphan and a financial dispute. Here's some guidance based on Islamic principles and Indian legal aspects:Custody and Guardianship (Hiranat and ولاية Wilaayah):Paternal Preference: Under Islamic law, the paternal uncle (Khal) usually has the preferential right to custody (Hiranat) and guardianship (Wilaayah) of the orphaned child, especially a girl, unless there are compelling reasons to the contrary.Court's Decision: Ultimately, the court will decide guardianship based on the child's best interests. Both sides can present their case regarding their suitability to raise the child.Financial Matters (Mal):Child's Money: The money from the father's LIC policy belongs to the orphaned child. It should be used for her benefit, including education, healthcare, and future needs.Dispute Resolution:Sharia Council: Consider approaching a Sharia Council affiliated with a local mosque for mediation. They can help resolve the financial dispute based on Islamic inheritance principles.Legal Action: If mediation fails, a lawsuit can be filed in the civil court to recover the funds. This can be a lengthy process.Minimal Resistance Path:Negotiation and Agreement: Open communication and a written agreement outlining how the money will be managed for the child's benefit could be a solution. A neutral third party, perhaps a respected member of the community, could mediate the agreement.Joint Account: Consider a joint bank account with representatives from both sides to manage the money for the child's well-being. This can build trust and ensure transparency.Here are some resources that might be helpful:Sharia Councils: Local mosques might have affiliated Sharia councils that offer mediation services.Lawyers: Look for lawyers with expertise in Islamic law and inheritance in West Bengal.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "1.  Assuming that the land was originally self acquired by your great grandfather (grandfather's father) and he gave a large piece of land to your grandfather through a registered deed, then in your grandfather's hands, it has to be treated as his seperate property having the characteristics of self acquired property and not his ancestral property. Then the registered Partition Deed dividing the land amongst his sons' is in order.Based on the partition deed, the land acquired by your father is his separate property and during your father's lifetime he will be independent to take any decision regarding this property including gifting or selling or executing WILL in favour of anyone.In case your great grandfather had given a large piece of land to your grandfather without a registered document and the name of your great grandfather still remains intact in the property documents, then the property qualifies to be ancestral property.2.  You and your sister may convince your father to execute registered Gift Deed/Partition Deed/WILL demarcating clearly the boundaries amongst siblings.3.  To stop/prevent construction on your father's owned land, let your father bring Injunction Order as the property is in your father's name, which has to be treated as his self acquired property and your brother, without your father's permission, can't unilaterally construct buildings, including school for poor kids.4.   Regarding the plot in your mother's name bought by your father, it's not clear as to whether your mother is dead or alive. If dead, then whether she died intestate (without executing a WILL) or testate (executed WILL) naming the beneficiaries to her property.5.  Assuming that your mother died intestate, then her property would devolve equally to her husband and children. In the instant case, 1/4th undivided share to your father, 1/4th undivided share to you, 1/4th undivided share to your sister and 1/4th undivided share to your brother.6.   If your brother tries to sell this plot to a prospective buyer, then send a legal notice to him so that the issue could be resolved.Shashidhar S.

    "question": "Plot division and inherited property division",
    "answer": "Here's some guidance on the property division situation:Regarding the Farm Land:Inheritance Rights: Since your grandfather divided the land and your father received a share, you and your siblings most likely have inheritance rights to that portion.Negotiation or Mediation: The ideal scenario would be to have an open and honest conversation with your father and brother about dividing the land fairly. Perhaps a mediator could facilitate a productive discussion to avoid putting stress on your parents.Legal Action: If communication fails, consider consulting a property lawyer specializing in inheritance. They can advise you on the legal options for partition, which might involve filing a lawsuit. However, legal action can be lengthy and expensive, so explore all possibilities before resorting to it.Your Brother's Construction Activities:Consent for Construction: If your brother hasn't obtained your consent for building on the property, it might be considered trespassing. A lawyer can advise on the legality of his actions.Impact on Land Value: Large-scale constructions might affect the land's future value when divided. It's crucial to document these constructions with photographs and receipts.The Plot Nominated to Your Brother:Nominee vs. Owner: Being a nominee on a plot doesn't necessarily grant ownership. Your mother likely remains the legal owner.Selling the Plot: If your father wants to sell and share the proceeds, but keeps delaying due to market fluctuations, it creates a complex situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "I understand you're in a difficult situation with your NRI husband who deserted you. Here's some information that might help, but it's important to remember this isn't legal advice.Understanding Your Situation:Desertion: Desertion is a ground for seeking divorce in India. You can file for divorce based on this.Domestic Violence: The photos and videos your husband might be using could be considered evidence ofdomestic violence. However, the act of taking a knife to defend yourself might be viewed differently in court.498A:Section 498Ais a law to protect women from cruelty by their husbands or in-laws. It's a serious offense, and filing a false case can have legal repercussions.Recommendations:Consult a Lawyer: A lawyer specializing in family law and NRI cases can advise you on the best course of action considering your specific situation, evidence, and desired outcome (divorce, reconciliation, etc.)Gather Evidence: Collect any proof you have of desertion,domestic violence, or any communication with your husband.Regarding 498A and Embassy:Filing 498A: Filing 498A can initiate a legal process against your husband in India. Whether it compels him to return or impacts his job depends on the case and US-India legal agreements.Embassy and Employer: Indian embassies typically don't get involved in domestic disputes. While informing his employer is an option, it's important to be aware of potential legal ramifications in the US for such actions.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about your father's passing. Here's the general procedure to follow for getting a refund on a booked flat when the registered owner has passed away:1. Contact the Developer:The first step is to get in touch with the developer or builder you made the booking with.Inform them about your father's passing and your intention to seek a refund.Submit copies of the death certificate, booking documents, and payment slips as proof.2. Review the Agreement:Carefully examine the terms and conditions mentioned in the flat booking agreement.These documents often outline the process for refunds in case of unforeseen circumstances like death.3. Nomination Clause:Check if the booking agreement has a nomination clause. This clause allows the registered owner to nominate someone to inherit the booked flat in case of death.If a nominee is present, the refund process might be smoother as the nominee can take over the booking.4. Inherited Property:If there's no nominee and you intend to inherit the property, legalities might be involved. You might need to obtain a probate (court order) to establish yourself as the legal heir.A lawyer can guide you through the probate process.5. Developer's Policy:The developer might have a specific policy regarding refunds in case of death.Some developers might offer a full or partial refund, while others might allow you to transfer the booking to another person.Additional Tips:Stay Polite and Proactive: Maintain clear communication with the developer and keep following up on your request.Gather All Documentation: Ensure you have all relevant documents like death certificate, booking agreement, payment proofs, and any communication with the developer readily availableAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client.The legality of charging parking fees in your co-operative housing society (CHS) depends on your location and the society's bylaws. Here's a breakdown:General Legality:In some regions, like Maharashtra, the Model Bye-laws (2014) of the Maharashtra Ownership of Flats Act (MOFA) allow societies to charge parking fees (https://www.thedigitel.com/s/charleston/top-stories-news-politics/charleston-dipping-reserves-hiking-parking-fees-[deleted]/). This applies to allotted parking spaces.Open Parking:The situation with open parking is less clear-cut.Societies might argue they can charge a fee for managing the space, even if it's first-come, first-served.However, courts have sometimes ruled against such charges if there's ample space and no designated allocation (https://library.municode.com/sc/charleston/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=CICO_CH19MOVETR_ARTVIIISTSTPA_DIV1GE).Recommendations:Review Your Bye-laws:Check your society's bylaws for specific clauses regarding parking charges.Check for Allotment:See if there's a system for allocating open parking spaces. If not, and there's ample space, a fee might be challenged.Reasonableness of Charge:Even if a fee is legal, it should be reasonable and not excessively high (https://parkingsociety.com/contact/).If you disagree with the charges, consider:Discussing the issue with the managing committee.Raising the concern at the next general body meeting."

    "answer": "I understand you're in a frustrating situation with the police case and considering going to the press. Here's a breakdown of your questions and some guidance:1. Challenging the Conviction:Reopening the case in the same court is unlikely. However, you can appeal the conviction to a higher court. A lawyer can advise on the best approach based on the specifics of your case.The inconsistencies in the police statements (SI vs. Constable) strengthen your case for appeal. A lawyer can highlight these discrepancies in the appeal.2. Press Interview:You can discuss the case with the press, but be mindful of what you say.Sticking to the facts in the charge sheet and court order is crucial. Avoid making unsubstantiated accusations.Defamation laws exist, but if you stay truthful and avoid personal attacks, the police filing a defamation case is less likely.3. Using Police Photos:Using the police officers' WhatsApp photos requires caution. Copyright laws might apply, and using them without permission could lead to legal trouble.4. Defamation Case Implications:If the police sue for defamation, the amount claimed can vary. The burden of proof lies on them to show your statements were false and caused them harm.5. Imprisonment:Since you paid the fine, you don't face imprisonment. Going to the press shouldn't change that.6. Other Legal Issues:There's a possibility of the police filing a counter-case for obstructing a public servant (original charge), but it depends on their actions.Consulting a lawyer specializing in media law can help you navigate the press conference and minimize legal risks.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

While the law protects women's property rights, social pressures regarding ancestral land might remain.Indian Christian Marriage Act (ICMA)Benefits:Religious Sanction: May hold religious significance for the Christian partner and their family.Drawbacks:Conversion Requirement: The non-Christian partner would need to convert to Christianity before marriage.Unequal Inheritance (Possible): In some Christian denominations, inheritance laws might favor male offspring. It's crucial to understand the specific denomination's practices.Rights to Consider:Property and Inheritance: Both SMA and ICMA provide women with inheritance rights. However, local customs and traditions regarding ancestral property, especially in the boy's case, might influence how inheritance is handled in practice. Open communication with both families is essential.Religious Freedom: The SMA safeguards the right to practice one's religion after marriage. ICMA doesn't restrict religious freedom, but social expectations within the Christian family might create pressure to conform to their practices.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about your father's passing. Here's the general procedure to follow for getting a refund on a booked flat when the registered owner has passed away:1. Contact the Developer:The first step is to get in touch with the developer or builder you made the booking with.Inform them about your father's passing and your intention to seek a refund.Submit copies of the death certificate, booking documents, and payment slips as proof.2. Review the Agreement:Carefully examine the terms and conditions mentioned in the flat booking agreement.These documents often outline the process for refunds in case of unforeseen circumstances like death.3. Nomination Clause:Check if the booking agreement has a nomination clause. This clause allows the registered owner to nominate someone to inherit the booked flat in case of death.If a nominee is present, the refund process might be smoother as the nominee can take over the booking.4. Inherited Property:If there's no nominee and you intend to inherit the property, legalities might be involved. You might need to obtain a probate (court order) to establish yourself as the legal heir.A lawyer can guide you through the probate process.5. Developer's Policy:The developer might have a specific policy regarding refunds in case of death.Some developers might offer a full or partial refund, while others might allow you to transfer the booking to another person.Additional Tips:Stay Polite and Proactive: Maintain clear communication with the developer and keep following up on your request.Gather All Documentation: Ensure you have all relevant documents like death certificate, booking agreement, payment proofs, and any communication with the developer readily availableAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "-  As per Section 90 of the IPC , When the accused gives promise to the victim to marry her, never had any intention to marry and the victim gave the consent for sexual intercourse on such an assurance by the accused that he would marry her, such a consent can be said to be a consent obtained on a misconception of fact and, in such a case, an offender can be said to have committed the rape as defined under Section 375 of IPC , and can be convicted for the offence under Section 376 of the IPC.- Hence, the consent for physical relation obtained by your boyfriend by giving false promise of marriage is amounts to rape.- Further , as per the Supreme Court,  When a man and a woman live together as husband and wife for a long term, the law will presume that they are legally married unless proved contrary.- Further, the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct 2005 provides for the protection, maintenance and right of palimony to a live-in partner, if she complains.- You should lodge a complaint against him before the police and higher official , after mentioning all the facts in details, and his message & phone talk recordings are enough evidence.- The age criteria is not a hurdle in such type of cases.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Parking charges",
    "answer": "Dear client.The legality of charging parking fees in your co-operative housing society (CHS) depends on your location and the society's bylaws. Here's a breakdown:General Legality:In some regions, like Maharashtra, the Model Bye-laws (2014) of the Maharashtra Ownership of Flats Act (MOFA) allow societies to charge parking fees (https://www.thedigitel.com/s/charleston/top-stories-news-politics/charleston-dipping-reserves-hiking-parking-fees-[deleted]/). This applies to allotted parking spaces.Open Parking:The situation with open parking is less clear-cut.Societies might argue they can charge a fee for managing the space, even if it's first-come, first-served.However, courts have sometimes ruled against such charges if there's ample space and no designated allocation (https://library.municode.com/sc/charleston/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=CICO_CH19MOVETR_ARTVIIISTSTPA_DIV1GE).Recommendations:Review Your Bye-laws:Check your society's bylaws for specific clauses regarding parking charges.Check for Allotment:See if there's a system for allocating open parking spaces. If not, and there's ample space, a fee might be challenged.Reasonableness of Charge:Even if a fee is legal, it should be reasonable and not excessively high (https://parkingsociety.com/contact/).If you disagree with the charges, consider:Discussing the issue with the managing committee.Raising the concern at the next general body meeting."

    "answer": "I understand you're in a frustrating situation with the police case and considering going to the press. Here's a breakdown of your questions and some guidance:1. Challenging the Conviction:Reopening the case in the same court is unlikely. However, you can appeal the conviction to a higher court. A lawyer can advise on the best approach based on the specifics of your case.The inconsistencies in the police statements (SI vs. Constable) strengthen your case for appeal. A lawyer can highlight these discrepancies in the appeal.2. Press Interview:You can discuss the case with the press, but be mindful of what you say.Sticking to the facts in the charge sheet and court order is crucial. Avoid making unsubstantiated accusations.Defamation laws exist, but if you stay truthful and avoid personal attacks, the police filing a defamation case is less likely.3. Using Police Photos:Using the police officers' WhatsApp photos requires caution. Copyright laws might apply, and using them without permission could lead to legal trouble.4. Defamation Case Implications:If the police sue for defamation, the amount claimed can vary. The burden of proof lies on them to show your statements were false and caused them harm.5. Imprisonment:Since you paid the fine, you don't face imprisonment. Going to the press shouldn't change that.6. Other Legal Issues:There's a possibility of the police filing a counter-case for obstructing a public servant (original charge), but it depends on their actions.Consulting a lawyer specializing in media law can help you navigate the press conference and minimize legal risks.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Parking charges",
    "answer": "Dear client.The legality of charging parking fees in your co-operative housing society (CHS) depends on your location and the society's bylaws. Here's a breakdown:General Legality:In some regions, like Maharashtra, the Model Bye-laws (2014) of the Maharashtra Ownership of Flats Act (MOFA) allow societies to charge parking fees (https://www.thedigitel.com/s/charleston/top-stories-news-politics/charleston-dipping-reserves-hiking-parking-fees-[deleted]/). This applies to allotted parking spaces.Open Parking:The situation with open parking is less clear-cut.Societies might argue they can charge a fee for managing the space, even if it's first-come, first-served.However, courts have sometimes ruled against such charges if there's ample space and no designated allocation (https://library.municode.com/sc/charleston/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=CICO_CH19MOVETR_ARTVIIISTSTPA_DIV1GE).Recommendations:Review Your Bye-laws:Check your society's bylaws for specific clauses regarding parking charges.Check for Allotment:See if there's a system for allocating open parking spaces. If not, and there's ample space, a fee might be challenged.Reasonableness of Charge:Even if a fee is legal, it should be reasonable and not excessively high (https://parkingsociety.com/contact/).If you disagree with the charges, consider:Discussing the issue with the managing committee.Raising the concern at the next general body meeting."

    "answer": "I understand you're in a frustrating situation with the police case and considering going to the press. Here's a breakdown of your questions and some guidance:1. Challenging the Conviction:Reopening the case in the same court is unlikely. However, you can appeal the conviction to a higher court. A lawyer can advise on the best approach based on the specifics of your case.The inconsistencies in the police statements (SI vs. Constable) strengthen your case for appeal. A lawyer can highlight these discrepancies in the appeal.2. Press Interview:You can discuss the case with the press, but be mindful of what you say.Sticking to the facts in the charge sheet and court order is crucial. Avoid making unsubstantiated accusations.Defamation laws exist, but if you stay truthful and avoid personal attacks, the police filing a defamation case is less likely.3. Using Police Photos:Using the police officers' WhatsApp photos requires caution. Copyright laws might apply, and using them without permission could lead to legal trouble.4. Defamation Case Implications:If the police sue for defamation, the amount claimed can vary. The burden of proof lies on them to show your statements were false and caused them harm.5. Imprisonment:Since you paid the fine, you don't face imprisonment. Going to the press shouldn't change that.6. Other Legal Issues:There's a possibility of the police filing a counter-case for obstructing a public servant (original charge), but it depends on their actions.Consulting a lawyer specializing in media law can help you navigate the press conference and minimize legal risks.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "I understand you're in a frustrating situation with the police case and considering going to the press. Here's a breakdown of your questions and some guidance:1. Challenging the Conviction:Reopening the case in the same court is unlikely. However, you can appeal the conviction to a higher court. A lawyer can advise on the best approach based on the specifics of your case.The inconsistencies in the police statements (SI vs. Constable) strengthen your case for appeal. A lawyer can highlight these discrepancies in the appeal.2. Press Interview:You can discuss the case with the press, but be mindful of what you say.Sticking to the facts in the charge sheet and court order is crucial. Avoid making unsubstantiated accusations.Defamation laws exist, but if you stay truthful and avoid personal attacks, the police filing a defamation case is less likely.3. Using Police Photos:Using the police officers' WhatsApp photos requires caution. Copyright laws might apply, and using them without permission could lead to legal trouble.4. Defamation Case Implications:If the police sue for defamation, the amount claimed can vary. The burden of proof lies on them to show your statements were false and caused them harm.5. Imprisonment:Since you paid the fine, you don't face imprisonment. Going to the press shouldn't change that.6. Other Legal Issues:There's a possibility of the police filing a counter-case for obstructing a public servant (original charge), but it depends on their actions.Consulting a lawyer specializing in media law can help you navigate the press conference and minimize legal risks.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "I understand you're in a difficult situation with your NRI husband who deserted you. Here's some information that might help, but it's important to remember this isn't legal advice.Understanding Your Situation:Desertion: Desertion is a ground for seeking divorce in India. You can file for divorce based on this.Domestic Violence: The photos and videos your husband might be using could be considered evidence ofdomestic violence. However, the act of taking a knife to defend yourself might be viewed differently in court.498A:Section 498Ais a law to protect women from cruelty by their husbands or in-laws. It's a serious offense, and filing a false case can have legal repercussions.Recommendations:Consult a Lawyer: A lawyer specializing in family law and NRI cases can advise you on the best course of action considering your specific situation, evidence, and desired outcome (divorce, reconciliation, etc.)Gather Evidence: Collect any proof you have of desertion,domestic violence, or any communication with your husband.Regarding 498A and Embassy:Filing 498A: Filing 498A can initiate a legal process against your husband in India. Whether it compels him to return or impacts his job depends on the case and US-India legal agreements.Embassy and Employer: Indian embassies typically don't get involved in domestic disputes. While informing his employer is an option, it's important to be aware of potential legal ramifications in the US for such actions.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Refund for flat booking and registration",
    "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about your father's passing. Here's the general procedure to follow for getting a refund on a booked flat when the registered owner has passed away:1. Contact the Developer:The first step is to get in touch with the developer or builder you made the booking with.Inform them about your father's passing and your intention to seek a refund.Submit copies of the death certificate, booking documents, and payment slips as proof.2. Review the Agreement:Carefully examine the terms and conditions mentioned in the flat booking agreement.These documents often outline the process for refunds in case of unforeseen circumstances like death.3. Nomination Clause:Check if the booking agreement has a nomination clause. This clause allows the registered owner to nominate someone to inherit the booked flat in case of death.If a nominee is present, the refund process might be smoother as the nominee can take over the booking.4. Inherited Property:If there's no nominee and you intend to inherit the property, legalities might be involved. You might need to obtain a probate (court order) to establish yourself as the legal heir.A lawyer can guide you through the probate process.5. Developer's Policy:The developer might have a specific policy regarding refunds in case of death.Some developers might offer a full or partial refund, while others might allow you to transfer the booking to another person.Additional Tips:Stay Polite and Proactive: Maintain clear communication with the developer and keep following up on your request.Gather All Documentation: Ensure you have all relevant documents like death certificate, booking agreement, payment proofs, and any communication with the developer readily availableAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": ". Legal Notice for False Advertisement and Website Information:Yes, you can send a legal notice. In India, theConsumer Protection Act, 2019 protects consumers from misleading advertisements and unfair trade practices. A legal notice can be a first step to address the issue.Sections Applicable: The relevant sections of theConsumer Protection Actinclude:Section 2(14): Defines \"unfair trade practice\" which can include false or misleading advertisements.Section 12(1)(d): Prohibits misleading advertisements.Punishment: The Act empowers authorities to impose penalties on companies engaging in unfair trade practices. These can include:Issuing directions to stop the practice.Ordering refunds or compensation to consumers.Imposing penalties.2. Defamation Notice on Social Media (Son Over 18):Yes, the mother can send a legal notice on her son's behalf. In India, a person has the right to defend their reputation. Even though the son is an adult, the mother can act on his behalf with his authorization.Section Applicable: TheIndian Penal Code(IPC) Section 499 defines defamation. A legal notice can reference this section to highlight the offense.3. Legal Notice for Unfulfilled WhatsApp Assurance:Potentially, a legal notice can be sent. The enforceability of a WhatsApp assurance depends on the content and context.Section Applicable: The Indian Contract Act, 1872 lays the foundation for contracts. A well-crafted WhatsApp message might be considered a valid contract, especially if it contains specific details about the agreement. Section 10 of the Act mentions a written contract not required by law to be in any specific form.Important Considerations:Legal Notice is a Pre-litigation Step: A legal notice serves as a formal warning to the company. It doesn't guarantee a resolution but can be a starting point for negotiation or further legal action.Consult a Lawyer: For all these scenarios, consulting a lawyer specializing in consumer protection or contract law is recommended. They can assess the specifics of your situation and advise on the most effective course of action.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Unlawful grab of orphan childs money by her maternal family",
    "answer": "I understand this is a sensitive situation involving the well-being of a young orphan and a financial dispute. Here's some guidance based on Islamic principles and Indian legal aspects:Custody and Guardianship (Hiranat and ولاية Wilaayah):Paternal Preference: Under Islamic law, the paternal uncle (Khal) usually has the preferential right to custody (Hiranat) and guardianship (Wilaayah) of the orphaned child, especially a girl, unless there are compelling reasons to the contrary.Court's Decision: Ultimately, the court will decide guardianship based on the child's best interests. Both sides can present their case regarding their suitability to raise the child.Financial Matters (Mal):Child's Money: The money from the father's LIC policy belongs to the orphaned child. It should be used for her benefit, including education, healthcare, and future needs.Dispute Resolution:Sharia Council: Consider approaching a Sharia Council affiliated with a local mosque for mediation. They can help resolve the financial dispute based on Islamic inheritance principles.Legal Action: If mediation fails, a lawsuit can be filed in the civil court to recover the funds. This can be a lengthy process.Minimal Resistance Path:Negotiation and Agreement: Open communication and a written agreement outlining how the money will be managed for the child's benefit could be a solution. A neutral third party, perhaps a respected member of the community, could mediate the agreement.Joint Account: Consider a joint bank account with representatives from both sides to manage the money for the child's well-being. This can build trust and ensure transparency.Here are some resources that might be helpful:Sharia Councils: Local mosques might have affiliated Sharia councils that offer mediation services.Lawyers: Look for lawyers with expertise in Islamic law and inheritance in West Bengal.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Refund for flat booking and registration",
    "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about your father's passing. Here's the general procedure to follow for getting a refund on a booked flat when the registered owner has passed away:1. Contact the Developer:The first step is to get in touch with the developer or builder you made the booking with.Inform them about your father's passing and your intention to seek a refund.Submit copies of the death certificate, booking documents, and payment slips as proof.2. Review the Agreement:Carefully examine the terms and conditions mentioned in the flat booking agreement.These documents often outline the process for refunds in case of unforeseen circumstances like death.3. Nomination Clause:Check if the booking agreement has a nomination clause. This clause allows the registered owner to nominate someone to inherit the booked flat in case of death.If a nominee is present, the refund process might be smoother as the nominee can take over the booking.4. Inherited Property:If there's no nominee and you intend to inherit the property, legalities might be involved. You might need to obtain a probate (court order) to establish yourself as the legal heir.A lawyer can guide you through the probate process.5. Developer's Policy:The developer might have a specific policy regarding refunds in case of death.Some developers might offer a full or partial refund, while others might allow you to transfer the booking to another person.Additional Tips:Stay Polite and Proactive: Maintain clear communication with the developer and keep following up on your request.Gather All Documentation: Ensure you have all relevant documents like death certificate, booking agreement, payment proofs, and any communication with the developer readily availableAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

While the law protects women's property rights, social pressures regarding ancestral land might remain.Indian Christian Marriage Act (ICMA)Benefits:Religious Sanction: May hold religious significance for the Christian partner and their family.Drawbacks:Conversion Requirement: The non-Christian partner would need to convert to Christianity before marriage.Unequal Inheritance (Possible): In some Christian denominations, inheritance laws might favor male offspring. It's crucial to understand the specific denomination's practices.Rights to Consider:Property and Inheritance: Both SMA and ICMA provide women with inheritance rights. However, local customs and traditions regarding ancestral property, especially in the boy's case, might influence how inheritance is handled in practice. Open communication with both families is essential.Religious Freedom: The SMA safeguards the right to practice one's religion after marriage. ICMA doesn't restrict religious freedom, but social expectations within the Christian family might create pressure to conform to their practices.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

A legal notice can be a first step to address the issue.Sections Applicable: The relevant sections of theConsumer Protection Actinclude:Section 2(14): Defines \"unfair trade practice\" which can include false or misleading advertisements.Section 12(1)(d): Prohibits misleading advertisements.Punishment: The Act empowers authorities to impose penalties on companies engaging in unfair trade practices. These can include:Issuing directions to stop the practice.Ordering refunds or compensation to consumers.Imposing penalties.2. Defamation Notice on Social Media (Son Over 18):Yes, the mother can send a legal notice on her son's behalf. In India, a person has the right to defend their reputation. Even though the son is an adult, the mother can act on his behalf with his authorization.Section Applicable: TheIndian Penal Code(IPC) Section 499 defines defamation. A legal notice can reference this section to highlight the offense.3. Legal Notice for Unfulfilled WhatsApp Assurance:Potentially, a legal notice can be sent.

A well-crafted WhatsApp message might be considered a valid contract, especially if it contains specific details about the agreement. Section 10 of the Act mentions a written contract not required by law to be in any specific form.Important Considerations:Legal Notice is a Pre-litigation Step: A legal notice serves as a formal warning to the company. It doesn't guarantee a resolution but can be a starting point for negotiation or further legal action.Consult a Lawyer: For all these scenarios, consulting a lawyer specializing in consumer protection or contract law is recommended. They can assess the specifics of your situation and advise on the most effective course of action.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

While the law protects women's property rights, social pressures regarding ancestral land might remain.Indian Christian Marriage Act (ICMA)Benefits:Religious Sanction: May hold religious significance for the Christian partner and their family.Drawbacks:Conversion Requirement: The non-Christian partner would need to convert to Christianity before marriage.Unequal Inheritance (Possible): In some Christian denominations, inheritance laws might favor male offspring. It's crucial to understand the specific denomination's practices.Rights to Consider:Property and Inheritance: Both SMA and ICMA provide women with inheritance rights. However, local customs and traditions regarding ancestral property, especially in the boy's case, might influence how inheritance is handled in practice. Open communication with both families is essential.Religious Freedom: The SMA safeguards the right to practice one's religion after marriage. ICMA doesn't restrict religious freedom, but social expectations within the Christian family might create pressure to conform to their practices.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "1.  Assuming that the land was originally self acquired by your great grandfather (grandfather's father) and he gave a large piece of land to your grandfather through a registered deed, then in your grandfather's hands, it has to be treated as his seperate property having the characteristics of self acquired property and not his ancestral property. Then the registered Partition Deed dividing the land amongst his sons' is in order.Based on the partition deed, the land acquired by your father is his separate property and during your father's lifetime he will be independent to take any decision regarding this property including gifting or selling or executing WILL in favour of anyone.In case your great grandfather had given a large piece of land to your grandfather without a registered document and the name of your great grandfather still remains intact in the property documents, then the property qualifies to be ancestral property.2.  You and your sister may convince your father to execute registered Gift Deed/Partition Deed/WILL demarcating clearly the boundaries amongst siblings.3.  To stop/prevent construction on your father's owned land, let your father bring Injunction Order as the property is in your father's name, which has to be treated as his self acquired property and your brother, without your father's permission, can't unilaterally construct buildings, including school for poor kids.4.   Regarding the plot in your mother's name bought by your father, it's not clear as to whether your mother is dead or alive. If dead, then whether she died intestate (without executing a WILL) or testate (executed WILL) naming the beneficiaries to her property.5.  Assuming that your mother died intestate, then her property would devolve equally to her husband and children. In the instant case, 1/4th undivided share to your father, 1/4th undivided share to you, 1/4th undivided share to your sister and 1/4th undivided share to your brother.6.   If your brother tries to sell this plot to a prospective buyer, then send a legal notice to him so that the issue could be resolved.Shashidhar S.

    "question": "Plot division and inherited property division",
    "answer": "Here's some guidance on the property division situation:Regarding the Farm Land:Inheritance Rights: Since your grandfather divided the land and your father received a share, you and your siblings most likely have inheritance rights to that portion.Negotiation or Mediation: The ideal scenario would be to have an open and honest conversation with your father and brother about dividing the land fairly. Perhaps a mediator could facilitate a productive discussion to avoid putting stress on your parents.Legal Action: If communication fails, consider consulting a property lawyer specializing in inheritance. They can advise you on the legal options for partition, which might involve filing a lawsuit. However, legal action can be lengthy and expensive, so explore all possibilities before resorting to it.Your Brother's Construction Activities:Consent for Construction: If your brother hasn't obtained your consent for building on the property, it might be considered trespassing. A lawyer can advise on the legality of his actions.Impact on Land Value: Large-scale constructions might affect the land's future value when divided. It's crucial to document these constructions with photographs and receipts.The Plot Nominated to Your Brother:Nominee vs. Owner: Being a nominee on a plot doesn't necessarily grant ownership. Your mother likely remains the legal owner.Selling the Plot: If your father wants to sell and share the proceeds, but keeps delaying due to market fluctuations, it creates a complex situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Is it legal to demand compensation for out of court settlement",
    "answer": "Yes, it is legal to demand compensation for an out-of-court settlement in India. This is a common practice in resolving disputes outside of the court system.Here's a breakdown of the legal aspects:Contractual Freedom:The Indian Contract Act allows parties involved in a dispute to enter into a settlement agreement. This agreement can involve one party offering compensation to the other in exchange for resolving the dispute and avoiding litigation.Mutual Agreement:The key element is that the compensation amount must be agreed upon by both parties willingly. There should be no coercion or undue influence.Settlement Documentation:It's advisable to have a lawyer draft a formal settlement agreement outlining the terms of the settlement, including the compensation amount and how it will be paid. This document serves as legal proof of the agreement.Benefits of Out-of-Court Settlements:Faster Resolution:Settling disputes outside of court can be significantly faster and less expensive compared to a full-blown lawsuit.Confidentiality:The terms of the settlement can be kept confidential, unlike court proceedings which are generally public.Control Over Outcome:Both parties have more control over the resolution compared to an uncertain court verdict.Seeking Legal Advice:While demanding compensation for an out-of-court settlement is legal, it's always recommended to consult a lawyer specializing in the specific area of your dispute (contract disputes, property disputes etc.). They can advise on:Reasonable Compensation:What constitutes a fair compensation amount in your situation.Settlement Agreement:Drafting a watertight settlement agreement that protects your interests.Negotiation Strategy:Negotiating effectively to reach a favorable agreement."

    "question": "Plot division and inherited property division",
    "answer": "1.  Assuming that the land was originally self acquired by your great grandfather (grandfather's father) and he gave a large piece of land to your grandfather through a registered deed, then in your grandfather's hands, it has to be treated as his seperate property having the characteristics of self acquired property and not his ancestral property. Then the registered Partition Deed dividing the land amongst his sons' is in order.Based on the partition deed, the land acquired by your father is his separate property and during your father's lifetime he will be independent to take any decision regarding this property including gifting or selling or executing WILL in favour of anyone.In case your great grandfather had given a large piece of land to your grandfather without a registered document and the name of your great grandfather still remains intact in the property documents, then the property qualifies to be ancestral property.2.  You and your sister may convince your father to execute registered Gift Deed/Partition Deed/WILL demarcating clearly the boundaries amongst siblings.3.  To stop/prevent construction on your father's owned land, let your father bring Injunction Order as the property is in your father's name, which has to be treated as his self acquired property and your brother, without your father's permission, can't unilaterally construct buildings, including school for poor kids.4.   Regarding the plot in your mother's name bought by your father, it's not clear as to whether your mother is dead or alive. If dead, then whether she died intestate (without executing a WILL) or testate (executed WILL) naming the beneficiaries to her property.5.  Assuming that your mother died intestate, then her property would devolve equally to her husband and children. In the instant case, 1/4th undivided share to your father, 1/4th undivided share to you, 1/4th undivided share to your sister and 1/4th undivided share to your brother.6.   If your brother tries to sell this plot to a prospective buyer, then send a legal notice to him so that the issue could be resolved.Shashidhar S.

    "question": "Plot division and inherited property division",
    "answer": "Here's some guidance on the property division situation:Regarding the Farm Land:Inheritance Rights: Since your grandfather divided the land and your father received a share, you and your siblings most likely have inheritance rights to that portion.Negotiation or Mediation: The ideal scenario would be to have an open and honest conversation with your father and brother about dividing the land fairly. Perhaps a mediator could facilitate a productive discussion to avoid putting stress on your parents.Legal Action: If communication fails, consider consulting a property lawyer specializing in inheritance. They can advise you on the legal options for partition, which might involve filing a lawsuit. However, legal action can be lengthy and expensive, so explore all possibilities before resorting to it.Your Brother's Construction Activities:Consent for Construction: If your brother hasn't obtained your consent for building on the property, it might be considered trespassing. A lawyer can advise on the legality of his actions.Impact on Land Value: Large-scale constructions might affect the land's future value when divided. It's crucial to document these constructions with photographs and receipts.The Plot Nominated to Your Brother:Nominee vs. Owner: Being a nominee on a plot doesn't necessarily grant ownership. Your mother likely remains the legal owner.Selling the Plot: If your father wants to sell and share the proceeds, but keeps delaying due to market fluctuations, it creates a complex situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

You can inform the court during the next hearing.NOC Requirement:In Tamil Nadu, a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the current lawyer might not be strictly necessary for changing lawyers in a district court case.However, it can smoothen the transition.Hiring Temporary Lawyer:Yes, you can hire another lawyer temporarily to manage the upcoming hearing. This lawyer can then file a substitution of attorney motion with the court to formally take over the case.Resolving the Situation:Here's a possible approach:Send the revised letter to your current lawyer requesting the case documents and informing him about termination.Contact the new lawyer and discuss the situation. They can advise on the best course of action, including potentially negotiating a lower fee with your current lawyer or filing a motion with the court to obtain the case documents.Additional Tips:Keep copies of all communication with your current lawyer.Be prepared to discuss the reasons for changing lawyers with the court if necessary."
