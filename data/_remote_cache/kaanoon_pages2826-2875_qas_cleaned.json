    "answer": "- As per Supreme court Judgment, provisions on adverse possession are made under the Limitation Act, 1963. In case an owner does not stake his claim over his property for 12 years, a squatter can acquire legal rights over the property.  The prescribed period in case of for government-owned properties is 30 years.- Further, to claim his ownership, this squatter has to prove that his occupancy of the property has been uninterrupted for the entire period. You cannot break the period into halves.- Further he will also have to prove that he has been the sole occupant of the property. There cannot be under the provisions of the law multiple claimants.- Further, adverse possession not applied within family members , whether the land was encroached for a period of more than 12 years or any long period.- Since, there is already owner in possession of the property , and hence you cannot claim the ownership on the ground of adverse possession.- Hence, you should firstly enquire whether the deceased aunt was the owner of the property or not , if not then you can claim the ownership.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "- As per Supreme court Judgment, provisions on adverse possession are made under the Limitation Act, 1963. In case an owner does not stake his claim over his property for 12 years, a squatter can acquire legal rights over the property.  The prescribed period in case of for government-owned properties is 30 years.- Further, to claim his ownership, this squatter has to prove that his occupancy of the property has been uninterrupted for the entire period. You cannot break the period into halves.- Further he will also have to prove that he has been the sole occupant of the property. There cannot be under the provisions of the law multiple claimants.- Further, adverse possession not applied within family members , whether the land was encroached for a period of more than 12 years or any long period.- Since, there is already owner in possession of the property , and hence you cannot claim the ownership on the ground of adverse possession.- Hence, you should firstly enquire whether the deceased aunt was the owner of the property or not , if not then you can claim the ownership.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "The law of adverse possession may not operate in this situation.Your narration about your past history may attract sympathy but law cannot come to your rescue because your stay or occupying the property is not adverse to the original owner as they have already filed an eviction suit which was decreed in their favor.This property was not compensated to you by the Indian government in ,lieu of the property your ancestors had left while leaving Pakistan for india as a refugee.The offer given to you to purchase the property was not utilised by you, hence who ever had an opportunity for this had availed the same.Therefore you cannot claim title to the property purchased by others.Just by remaining in the property may not entitle you the title, as a matter of fact, if you are sued for paying the monthly rental and to evict you from the property for not paying the rental amount, then the court may pass a decision against you.You can try through your sources for an out of court settlement which is the only option before you to solve this problem peacefully.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "The divorce decree even if it is by mutual consent,  granted by US courts would be valid in india only if it was  on the grounds that are recognized as per the provisions ofHindu Marriage Act, 1955.Generally the wording i the divorce decree even under mutual consent, the US courts will mention as 'no fault' divorce, and this is not recognised as legally valid divorce in India for the marriage solemnised in India as per Indian laws.The judge's signature or the parties signature are all technical terms which may or many not be considered as vital to recognise the decree in India.Since no system of private international law exists that can claim universal recognition on this issue, Indian courts have to decide the issue regarding the validity of the decree in accordance with the Indian law.Therefore according to the latest Supreme Court of India ruling the grounds for divorce should be recognized by the Indian law.

    "answer": "The Indian Legal System categorizes Foreign Judgments and Awards from all the quarters of the world into two groups Viz. (a) Judgments and Awards coming from the ‘Reciprocating Territories’ of India and (b) Judgments and awards coming from the ‘Non-Reciprocating Territories’ of India.If someone has accepted the authority of a court, it cannot be open to the person to later question the authority of the court.  For enforcing a foreign Judgment or an Award from a ‘Non-Reciprocating Territory’ of India,a fresh suitin an Indian Court with appropriate Jurisdiction needs to be instituted. Further, Judgments from a ‘Non-Reciprocating Territory’ only have evidentiary and persuasive value in the eyes of India Judiciary and they must be filed for enforcement withinthree years from the day when they were originally passed.  No doubt that Foreign Judgments from Non-Reciprocating Territories need to pass through the sieve of Indian Judiciary but the sieve used is broad and spacious enough to allow the sink in of ‘the cause of Justice’ upheld by the courts of Foreign Countries.Indian law recognizesmutual consent divorcedecree.

(a) Judgments and Awards coming from the ‘Reciprocating Territories’ of India and (b) Judgments and awards coming from the ‘Non-Reciprocating Territories’ of India.If someone has accepted the authority of a court, it cannot be open to the person to later question the authority of the court.  For enforcing a foreign Judgment or an Award from a ‘Non-Reciprocating Territory’ of India,a fresh suitin an Indian Court with appropriate Jurisdiction needs to be instituted. Further, Judgments from a ‘Non-Reciprocating Territory’ only have evidentiary and persuasive value in the eyes of India Judiciary and they must be filed for enforcement withinthree years from the day when they were originally passed.  No doubt that Foreign Judgments from Non-Reciprocating Territories need to pass through the sieve of Indian Judiciary but the sieve used is broad and spacious enough to allow the sink in of ‘the cause of Justice’ upheld by the courts of Foreign Countries.Indian law recognizesmutual consent divorcedecree.

    "question": "Mutually Divorced in USA. What is the process to validate that divorce in Indian court",
    "answer": "The divorce decree even if it is by mutual consent,  granted by US courts would be valid in india only if it was  on the grounds that are recognized as per the provisions ofHindu Marriage Act, 1955.Generally the wording i the divorce decree even under mutual consent, the US courts will mention as 'no fault' divorce, and this is not recognised as legally valid divorce in India for the marriage solemnised in India as per Indian laws.The judge's signature or the parties signature are all technical terms which may or many not be considered as vital to recognise the decree in India.Since no system of private international law exists that can claim universal recognition on this issue, Indian courts have to decide the issue regarding the validity of the decree in accordance with the Indian law.Therefore according to the latest Supreme Court of India ruling the grounds for divorce should be recognized by the Indian law. Indian courts will not recognize a divorce decree obtained in the US if the grounds are not recognized by the Indian divorce law.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Mutually Divorced in USA. What is the process to validate that divorce in Indian court",
    "answer": "The Indian Legal System categorizes Foreign Judgments and Awards from all the quarters of the world into two groups Viz. (a) Judgments and Awards coming from the ‘Reciprocating Territories’ of India and (b) Judgments and awards coming from the ‘Non-Reciprocating Territories’ of India.If someone has accepted the authority of a court, it cannot be open to the person to later question the authority of the court.  For enforcing a foreign Judgment or an Award from a ‘Non-Reciprocating Territory’ of India,a fresh suitin an Indian Court with appropriate Jurisdiction needs to be instituted. Further, Judgments from a ‘Non-Reciprocating Territory’ only have evidentiary and persuasive value in the eyes of India Judiciary and they must be filed for enforcement withinthree years from the day when they were originally passed.  No doubt that Foreign Judgments from Non-Reciprocating Territories need to pass through the sieve of Indian Judiciary but the sieve used is broad and spacious enough to allow the sink in of ‘the cause of Justice’ upheld by the courts of Foreign Countries.Indian law recognizesmutual consent divorcedecree.

    "answer": "The divorce decree even if it is by mutual consent,  granted by US courts would be valid in india only if it was  on the grounds that are recognized as per the provisions ofHindu Marriage Act, 1955.Generally the wording i the divorce decree even under mutual consent, the US courts will mention as 'no fault' divorce, and this is not recognised as legally valid divorce in India for the marriage solemnised in India as per Indian laws.The judge's signature or the parties signature are all technical terms which may or many not be considered as vital to recognise the decree in India.Since no system of private international law exists that can claim universal recognition on this issue, Indian courts have to decide the issue regarding the validity of the decree in accordance with the Indian law.Therefore according to the latest Supreme Court of India ruling the grounds for divorce should be recognized by the Indian law. Indian courts will not recognize a divorce decree obtained in the US if the grounds are not recognized by the Indian divorce law.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "The Indian Legal System categorizes Foreign Judgments and Awards from all the quarters of the world into two groups Viz. (a) Judgments and Awards coming from the ‘Reciprocating Territories’ of India and (b) Judgments and awards coming from the ‘Non-Reciprocating Territories’ of India.If someone has accepted the authority of a court, it cannot be open to the person to later question the authority of the court.  For enforcing a foreign Judgment or an Award from a ‘Non-Reciprocating Territory’ of India,a fresh suitin an Indian Court with appropriate Jurisdiction needs to be instituted. Further, Judgments from a ‘Non-Reciprocating Territory’ only have evidentiary and persuasive value in the eyes of India Judiciary and they must be filed for enforcement withinthree years from the day when they were originally passed.  No doubt that Foreign Judgments from Non-Reciprocating Territories need to pass through the sieve of Indian Judiciary but the sieve used is broad and spacious enough to allow the sink in of ‘the cause of Justice’ upheld by the courts of Foreign Countries.Indian law recognizesmutual consent divorcedecree.

    "question": "Mutually Divorced in USA. What is the process to validate that divorce in Indian court",
    "answer": "The divorce decree even if it is by mutual consent,  granted by US courts would be valid in india only if it was  on the grounds that are recognized as per the provisions ofHindu Marriage Act, 1955.Generally the wording i the divorce decree even under mutual consent, the US courts will mention as 'no fault' divorce, and this is not recognised as legally valid divorce in India for the marriage solemnised in India as per Indian laws.The judge's signature or the parties signature are all technical terms which may or many not be considered as vital to recognise the decree in India.Since no system of private international law exists that can claim universal recognition on this issue, Indian courts have to decide the issue regarding the validity of the decree in accordance with the Indian law.Therefore according to the latest Supreme Court of India ruling the grounds for divorce should be recognized by the Indian law. Indian courts will not recognize a divorce decree obtained in the US if the grounds are not recognized by the Indian divorce law.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "The Indian Legal System categorizes Foreign Judgments and Awards from all the quarters of the world into two groups Viz. (a) Judgments and Awards coming from the ‘Reciprocating Territories’ of India and (b) Judgments and awards coming from the ‘Non-Reciprocating Territories’ of India.If someone has accepted the authority of a court, it cannot be open to the person to later question the authority of the court.  For enforcing a foreign Judgment or an Award from a ‘Non-Reciprocating Territory’ of India,a fresh suitin an Indian Court with appropriate Jurisdiction needs to be instituted. Further, Judgments from a ‘Non-Reciprocating Territory’ only have evidentiary and persuasive value in the eyes of India Judiciary and they must be filed for enforcement withinthree years from the day when they were originally passed.  No doubt that Foreign Judgments from Non-Reciprocating Territories need to pass through the sieve of Indian Judiciary but the sieve used is broad and spacious enough to allow the sink in of ‘the cause of Justice’ upheld by the courts of Foreign Countries.Indian law recognizesmutual consent divorcedecree.

Therefore when there is no concept called 'ancestral property' the question of coparceners also do not arise.Since you have mentioned that your grandfather had made oral partition among his sons, then the share of property allotted to the sons shall become their self acquired property respectively.In that situation the allottee sons can transfer their share in the property to their next generation wards by known procedure of law, i.e., settlement deed or gift deed or sale deed.Thus the transfer of his share of property by a settlement deed by your father's brother in favor of his son is legally valid, the registrar or the RDO cannot stop your father's elder brother from transferring his share of property to the person of his choice.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Consultancy",
    "answer": "This is a public form and not an individual advocate's office or chamber that you are giving a call in this manner.If you desirous of availing the services of an advocate it would be better that you contact the chosen advocate and engage the services of the chosen advocate on his or her terms.Please  be aware that solicitation by an advocate is prohibited as per Advocates act.Section 49(1)(c) of the Advocates Act 1961 provides for the power of the Bar Council of India to make rules prescribing the standards of professional conduct and etiquette to be observed by advocates.Rule 36 as provided in Section IV (Chapter II of Part VI of BCI Rules) provides for the bar against advertising and soliciting work:It provides that an advocate shall not solicit work or advertise by direct or indirect means. Such solicitation and advertisement include circulars, advertisements, touts, personal communications, or interviews not warranted by personal relations.The Solicitors Act of 1933 empowered the Law Society Council to promulgate rules regulating the professional practice, conduct, and discipline of solicitors. Rule 1 of the Solicitor’s Practice Rules 1936 provided for a comprehensive ban on solicitor advertising prohibiting three types of behavior: touting, advertising, and unfairly attracting business.Rule 36 of Chapter II of Part VI of Bar Council Rules was amended by the Bar Council of India in 2008 to provide for some relaxation. It allowed the furnishing of website information by the advocates under intimation to and as approved by the Bar Council of India. However, only the particulars as approved by the BCI are to be provided. Any additional input would be deemed as a violation of Rule 36 and the advocate would be liable to punishment for misconduct under Section 35 of the Advocates Act 1961.Now can you understand the meaning of solicitation by advocates.Besides, you should be aware that you are paying to websites alone for clarifying the doubts and not to the advocates who answer your questions.the advocates of this forum render service at free of cost without any payment for their services, therefore better understand what you talk before talking.Reasons behind prohibition of legal advertising and solicitation of work isTo avoid commercialization of the legal profession.To uphold the integrity of the legal profession and maintain quality services.The misleading nature of advertisements may shake the faith of people in the legal profession.Allowing advertising will lead to unhealthy competition between lawyers who might resort to unfair practices to gain more clients thereby focussing less on the quality of services provided.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "First of all stop saying that this property is ancestral property, because there is no concept called ancestral property in Christians unlike Hindus.The Christians are covered under Indian Succession Act. Therefore when there is no concept called 'ancestral property' the question of coparceners also do not arise.Since you have mentioned that your grandfather had made oral partition among his sons, then the share of property allotted to the sons shall become their self acquired property respectively.In that situation the allottee sons can transfer their share in the property to their next generation wards by known procedure of law, i.e., settlement deed or gift deed or sale deed.Thus the transfer of his share of property by a settlement deed by your father's brother in favor of his son is legally valid, the registrar or the RDO cannot stop your father's elder brother from transferring his share of property to the person of his choice.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "This is a public form and not an individual advocate's office or chamber that you are giving a call in this manner.If you desirous of availing the services of an advocate it would be better that you contact the chosen advocate and engage the services of the chosen advocate on his or her terms.Please  be aware that solicitation by an advocate is prohibited as per Advocates act.Section 49(1)(c) of the Advocates Act 1961 provides for the power of the Bar Council of India to make rules prescribing the standards of professional conduct and etiquette to be observed by advocates.Rule 36 as provided in Section IV (Chapter II of Part VI of BCI Rules) provides for the bar against advertising and soliciting work:It provides that an advocate shall not solicit work or advertise by direct or indirect means. Such solicitation and advertisement include circulars, advertisements, touts, personal communications, or interviews not warranted by personal relations.The Solicitors Act of 1933 empowered the Law Society Council to promulgate rules regulating the professional practice, conduct, and discipline of solicitors. Rule 1 of the Solicitor’s Practice Rules 1936 provided for a comprehensive ban on solicitor advertising prohibiting three types of behavior: touting, advertising, and unfairly attracting business.Rule 36 of Chapter II of Part VI of Bar Council Rules was amended by the Bar Council of India in 2008 to provide for some relaxation. It allowed the furnishing of website information by the advocates under intimation to and as approved by the Bar Council of India. However, only the particulars as approved by the BCI are to be provided. Any additional input would be deemed as a violation of Rule 36 and the advocate would be liable to punishment for misconduct under Section 35 of the Advocates Act 1961.Now can you understand the meaning of solicitation by advocates.Besides, you should be aware that you are paying to websites alone for clarifying the doubts and not to the advocates who answer your questions.the advocates of this forum render service at free of cost without any payment for their services, therefore better understand what you talk before talking.Reasons behind prohibition of legal advertising and solicitation of work isTo avoid commercialization of the legal profession.To uphold the integrity of the legal profession and maintain quality services.The misleading nature of advertisements may shake the faith of people in the legal profession.Allowing advertising will lead to unhealthy competition between lawyers who might resort to unfair practices to gain more clients thereby focussing less on the quality of services provided.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

Therefore when there is no concept called 'ancestral property' the question of coparceners also do not arise.Since you have mentioned that your grandfather had made oral partition among his sons, then the share of property allotted to the sons shall become their self acquired property respectively.In that situation the allottee sons can transfer their share in the property to their next generation wards by known procedure of law, i.e., settlement deed or gift deed or sale deed.Thus the transfer of his share of property by a settlement deed by your father's brother in favor of his son is legally valid, the registrar or the RDO cannot stop your father's elder brother from transferring his share of property to the person of his choice.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

The prerequisite of an ancestral property is that an ancestral property should not have been divided or partitioned by the family members, as once a division of the ancestral property takes place, the share or portion which each coparcener gets after division becomes his or her self acquired property.2) SC held that, on partition an ancestral property remains in the hand of a single person, it has to be treated as a separate property and such a person shall be entitled to dispose of the coparcenary property treating it to be his separate property but if a son is subsequently born, the alienation made before the birth cannot be questioned.

This will extend from E the  F and further.X property is duly partitioned among A, B, C and D.

The essential feature of ancestral property is that if that person inheriting it has sons, grandsons or great grandsons, they become joint owners with him.Ancestral Property:This property should be four generation old.It should not have been divided by the users in the joint Hindu family as once a division of the property takes place, the share or portion which each Coparcener gets after the division becomes his or her self acquired property.The right to a share in ancestral or coparcenary property accrues by birth itself, unlike other forms of inheritance, where inheritance opens only on the death of the owner.The rights in ancestral property are determined per stripes and not per capita. Share of each generation is first determined and the successive generations in turn sub divide what has been inherited by their respective predecessor.Properties inherited from mother, grandmother, uncle and even brother is not ancestral property. Property inherited by will and gift are not ancestral properties.Self acquired property can become ancestral property if it is thrown into the pool of ancestral properties and enjoyed in common.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "This is a public form and not an individual advocate's office or chamber that you are giving a call in this manner.If you desirous of availing the services of an advocate it would be better that you contact the chosen advocate and engage the services of the chosen advocate on his or her terms.Please  be aware that solicitation by an advocate is prohibited as per Advocates act.Section 49(1)(c) of the Advocates Act 1961 provides for the power of the Bar Council of India to make rules prescribing the standards of professional conduct and etiquette to be observed by advocates.Rule 36 as provided in Section IV (Chapter II of Part VI of BCI Rules) provides for the bar against advertising and soliciting work:It provides that an advocate shall not solicit work or advertise by direct or indirect means. Such solicitation and advertisement include circulars, advertisements, touts, personal communications, or interviews not warranted by personal relations.The Solicitors Act of 1933 empowered the Law Society Council to promulgate rules regulating the professional practice, conduct, and discipline of solicitors. Rule 1 of the Solicitor’s Practice Rules 1936 provided for a comprehensive ban on solicitor advertising prohibiting three types of behavior: touting, advertising, and unfairly attracting business.Rule 36 of Chapter II of Part VI of Bar Council Rules was amended by the Bar Council of India in 2008 to provide for some relaxation. It allowed the furnishing of website information by the advocates under intimation to and as approved by the Bar Council of India. However, only the particulars as approved by the BCI are to be provided. Any additional input would be deemed as a violation of Rule 36 and the advocate would be liable to punishment for misconduct under Section 35 of the Advocates Act 1961.Now can you understand the meaning of solicitation by advocates.Besides, you should be aware that you are paying to websites alone for clarifying the doubts and not to the advocates who answer your questions.the advocates of this forum render service at free of cost without any payment for their services, therefore better understand what you talk before talking.Reasons behind prohibition of legal advertising and solicitation of work isTo avoid commercialization of the legal profession.To uphold the integrity of the legal profession and maintain quality services.The misleading nature of advertisements may shake the faith of people in the legal profession.Allowing advertising will lead to unhealthy competition between lawyers who might resort to unfair practices to gain more clients thereby focussing less on the quality of services provided.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

The prerequisite of an ancestral property is that an ancestral property should not have been divided or partitioned by the family members, as once a division of the ancestral property takes place, the share or portion which each coparcener gets after division becomes his or her self acquired property.2) SC held that, on partition an ancestral property remains in the hand of a single person, it has to be treated as a separate property and such a person shall be entitled to dispose of the coparcenary property treating it to be his separate property but if a son is subsequently born, the alienation made before the birth cannot be questioned.

Share of each generation is first determined and the successive generations in turn sub divide what has been inherited by their respective predecessor.Properties inherited from mother, grandmother, uncle and even brother is not ancestral property. Property inherited by will and gift are not ancestral properties.Self acquired property can become ancestral property if it is thrown into the pool of ancestral properties and enjoyed in common.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

The prerequisite of an ancestral property is that an ancestral property should not have been divided or partitioned by the family members, as once a division of the ancestral property takes place, the share or portion which each coparcener gets after division becomes his or her self acquired property.2) SC held that, on partition an ancestral property remains in the hand of a single person, it has to be treated as a separate property and such a person shall be entitled to dispose of the coparcenary property treating it to be his separate property but if a son is subsequently born, the alienation made before the birth cannot be questioned. But, the moment a son is born, the property becomes a coparcenary property and the son would acquire interest in that and become a coparcener.”Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "answer": "First scenario: Under Hindu law of inheritance, any immovable property remains ancestral up to three generations of legal heirs. Suppose there is property X acquired by common efforts of family members of A generation. Legal heirs of subsequent first generation B, second generation C and third generation D will have right to claim share in it but not the fourth generation E.Second scenario: Legal heirs of generation B also acquire some property and add to stock of property acquired by generation A, now the  generation E will have right  to share the  same being third generation from generation B. This will extend from E the  F and further.X property is duly partitioned among A, B, C and D. A & B have two sons each, property in A’s and B’s hands is not self-acquired as there are sharers at the time of partition.At the time of partition  there baby in the  womb of C’s wife, property in the  hand of C is ancestral with right  to share by child in the   D is not married or married but without any child.

    "question": "Ancestral property becomes self-acquired after partition or not? Need references",
    "answer": "The property inherited by a Hindu from his father's father and father'sis ancestral property. Property inherited by other relations is his separate property. The essential feature of ancestral property is that if that person inheriting it has sons, grandsons or great grandsons, they become joint owners with him.Ancestral Property:This property should be four generation old.It should not have been divided by the users in the joint Hindu family as once a division of the property takes place, the share or portion which each Coparcener gets after the division becomes his or her self acquired property.The right to a share in ancestral or coparcenary property accrues by birth itself, unlike other forms of inheritance, where inheritance opens only on the death of the owner.The rights in ancestral property are determined per stripes and not per capita. Share of each generation is first determined and the successive generations in turn sub divide what has been inherited by their respective predecessor.Properties inherited from mother, grandmother, uncle and even brother is not ancestral property. Property inherited by will and gift are not ancestral properties.Self acquired property can become ancestral property if it is thrown into the pool of ancestral properties and enjoyed in common.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "An ancestral property  partitioned through a partition deed, family arrangement, etc. loses its ancestral character. The prerequisite of an ancestral property is that an ancestral property should not have been divided or partitioned by the family members, as once a division of the ancestral property takes place, the share or portion which each coparcener gets after division becomes his or her self acquired property.2) SC held that, on partition an ancestral property remains in the hand of a single person, it has to be treated as a separate property and such a person shall be entitled to dispose of the coparcenary property treating it to be his separate property but if a son is subsequently born, the alienation made before the birth cannot be questioned. But, the moment a son is born, the property becomes a coparcenary property and the son would acquire interest in that and become a coparcener.”Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

Suppose there is property X acquired by common efforts of family members of A generation. Legal heirs of subsequent first generation B, second generation C and third generation D will have right to claim share in it but not the fourth generation E.Second scenario: Legal heirs of generation B also acquire some property and add to stock of property acquired by generation A, now the  generation E will have right  to share the  same being third generation from generation B. This will extend from E the  F and further.X property is duly partitioned among A, B, C and D. A & B have two sons each, property in A’s and B’s hands is not self-acquired as there are sharers at the time of partition.At the time of partition  there baby in the  womb of C’s wife, property in the  hand of C is ancestral with right  to share by child in the   D is not married or married but without any child.

    "answer": "The property inherited by a Hindu from his father's father and father'sis ancestral property. Property inherited by other relations is his separate property. The essential feature of ancestral property is that if that person inheriting it has sons, grandsons or great grandsons, they become joint owners with him.Ancestral Property:This property should be four generation old.It should not have been divided by the users in the joint Hindu family as once a division of the property takes place, the share or portion which each Coparcener gets after the division becomes his or her self acquired property.The right to a share in ancestral or coparcenary property accrues by birth itself, unlike other forms of inheritance, where inheritance opens only on the death of the owner.The rights in ancestral property are determined per stripes and not per capita. Share of each generation is first determined and the successive generations in turn sub divide what has been inherited by their respective predecessor.Properties inherited from mother, grandmother, uncle and even brother is not ancestral property. Property inherited by will and gift are not ancestral properties.Self acquired property can become ancestral property if it is thrown into the pool of ancestral properties and enjoyed in common.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

You will have to appear for the marriage registration process and return to the US immediately after the solemnisation of marriage registration. Only one partners presence is required for a period of 30 days. Your partners presence in Delhi would suffice. To register the marriage in India,Special Marriage Act,1954,  states that the parties should give written notice to the Marriage officer wherein at least “one of the parties the marriage has resided for not less than thirty days immediately preceding the date on which such notice is given.”2. You can get married on a tourist visa. No special visa would be required. A valid visa of more than thirty days for the foreign national is required.3.

    "question": "Marriage in India as US Citizen",
    "answer": "1. In India, civil weddings are governed by the provisions ofTheSpecial Marriage Act(1954). Under the Act, there’s a 30 day residency requirement, which means that either the bride or the groom has to be living in India for at least 30 days prior to applying to the local registry office to get married. For foreigners, this is evidenced by a certificate from the local police station.If no objections to the marriage are received within 30 days of the application, a civil ceremony at the registry office can then take place. Three witnesses are required, who have to provide passport sized photographs, as well as identification and proof of address2. Since you will be here on a tourist visa, you have to convert your visa from a tourist visa to a short visit visa (valid for one year). For this you may have to visit the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO). This will cover the extensive period of stay in India.3. Whether or not your marriage will be registered under the provisions ofSpecial marriage act. TheSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 is an Act of the Parliament of India with provision for civil marriage for people of India and all Indian nationals in foreign countries, irrespective of religion or faith followed by either party.4. By just observing the formal ceremony in India, it will not conclude that it to be a legally valid marriage between you both.Your marriage in India, if you are desirous of getting it legally recognised or valid, then you may have to follow the procedures/laws prescribed for the purpose without any exemption for whatever reason you may rely upon.The marriage without being registered before the Concerned authority i.e., the Marriage officer, is not legally valid as per Indian laws.Besides you being  foreign national, your marriage  will fall under the provisions ofspecial marriage actonly and it is mandatory to register the marriage unless it is not valid.If you want to skip the process in India and would be contended with the US marriage itself, then your fiancee may not be recognised as your legally wedded spouse by US immigration authorities if you do not produce the marriage certificate issued by government in India, hence it may create legal hassles at that stage when you apply for visa to your spouse.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

On adducing the registration certificate of marriage, it may be presumed by the law that marriage is deemed to has taken place.In case a marriage between an Indian and a foreign national is to take place in India, the marriage has to solemnize under theSpecial Marriage Actof 1954. Generally it is required to file a notice of intended marriage with a Marriage Registrar of your choice in India. That notice is required to be published within the stipulated 30 days. At the end of the 30 days the Marriage Registrar is free to perform the marriage.Notice of intended marriage can only be given in India if at least one partner is permanently and the other partner temporarily resident in India.If one partner is residing in a foreign country then the partner who is resident in India will have to fill out the “Marriage Notice”  collected from the Marriage Registration Office of his/her choice in India and send it to his/her partner in the foreign country who will also have to fill it out. This “Notice” should then be sent back to the partner in India who will have to re-submit it at the Marriage Registration Office. After the stipulated waiting period of 30 days the marriage can take place in India. Under theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 a certificate showing the signatures of the persons married, the registrar and the witnesses will be issued. This Certificate is required as proof of marriage and when applying for a visa to a foreign country.The requirement for this will be your age proof, (Passport, Birth Certificate) your address proof (Passport, Ration Card, Voters Identity card) and Martial status.

In any case, if an objection is raised against an intended marriage, the Marriage Registrar cannot solemnise the marriage until he has investigated the matter of objection and reached a decision that the earlier raised objection will not prevent the marriage from being solemnised, or the prior objection is withdrawn by the individual raising it. However, if the marriage officer validates the objection and refuses to solemnise the marriage, any of the intended parties may file an appeal with the district court within the local limits of the marriage officer’s office within thirty days, and the decision of the district court on such appeal will be binding, and the marriage officer must act in accordance with the court’s decision.Ajay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

At the outset, inspite of Aadhar Card copy in her possession, she can't produce the demonstrable evidence that your friend had spent the night with her.2.  Just because a woman has your friend's Aadhar Card copy, she may, at most blackmail your friend to extort money, threatening that she would expose his activities with her.3.  It's unlikely that she approaches your friend for child support and maintenance for her.4.  Being a prostitute, she might have collected copies of Aadhar card from many of her customers to blackmail them, if she finds them vulnerable.5.  Let your friend be free from worry as she may not have time to catch hold, in particular, your friend only,  to claim child support and maintenance from only him.Shashidhar S.

    "question": "DNA testing if prostitute get pregnant and child support",
    "answer": "Prostitution in India is the oldest profession. It is a general misconception that prostitution in India is illegal, rather prostitution is legal but pimping, owning and managing a brothel is illegal. Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata are the major cities in India where brothels are operating illegally in large numbers. Prostitution in itself is neither illegal nor punishable under the act.In the present scenario, private prostitution is not recognized as an offence. Thus a customer is not penalized and there is no provision under any statute to do the same.As per law child is the responsibility of both parents and both are liable to maintain the child. so if child is born to a sex worker then firstly parentage is to be required to be confirmed and only then portion of maintenance can be claimed from men. illegal child too is entitled to maintenance.However the prostitute has to prove that she was impregnated by your friend and a child was born due to their relationship that occurred on that eventful day, which may include DNA test too.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Marriage in India as US Citizen",
    "answer": "1. In India, civil weddings are governed by the provisions ofTheSpecial Marriage Act(1954). Under the Act, there’s a 30 day residency requirement, which means that either the bride or the groom has to be living in India for at least 30 days prior to applying to the local registry office to get married. For foreigners, this is evidenced by a certificate from the local police station.If no objections to the marriage are received within 30 days of the application, a civil ceremony at the registry office can then take place. Three witnesses are required, who have to provide passport sized photographs, as well as identification and proof of address2. Since you will be here on a tourist visa, you have to convert your visa from a tourist visa to a short visit visa (valid for one year). For this you may have to visit the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO). This will cover the extensive period of stay in India.3. Whether or not your marriage will be registered under the provisions ofSpecial marriage act. TheSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 is an Act of the Parliament of India with provision for civil marriage for people of India and all Indian nationals in foreign countries, irrespective of religion or faith followed by either party.4. By just observing the formal ceremony in India, it will not conclude that it to be a legally valid marriage between you both.Your marriage in India, if you are desirous of getting it legally recognised or valid, then you may have to follow the procedures/laws prescribed for the purpose without any exemption for whatever reason you may rely upon.The marriage without being registered before the Concerned authority i.e., the Marriage officer, is not legally valid as per Indian laws.Besides you being  foreign national, your marriage  will fall under the provisions ofspecial marriage actonly and it is mandatory to register the marriage unless it is not valid.If you want to skip the process in India and would be contended with the US marriage itself, then your fiancee may not be recognised as your legally wedded spouse by US immigration authorities if you do not produce the marriage certificate issued by government in India, hence it may create legal hassles at that stage when you apply for visa to your spouse.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Registration of marriage is a mode of proof of marriage. On adducing the registration certificate of marriage, it may be presumed by the law that marriage is deemed to has taken place.In case a marriage between an Indian and a foreign national is to take place in India, the marriage has to solemnize under theSpecial Marriage Actof 1954. Generally it is required to file a notice of intended marriage with a Marriage Registrar of your choice in India. That notice is required to be published within the stipulated 30 days. At the end of the 30 days the Marriage Registrar is free to perform the marriage.Notice of intended marriage can only be given in India if at least one partner is permanently and the other partner temporarily resident in India.If one partner is residing in a foreign country then the partner who is resident in India will have to fill out the “Marriage Notice”  collected from the Marriage Registration Office of his/her choice in India and send it to his/her partner in the foreign country who will also have to fill it out. This “Notice” should then be sent back to the partner in India who will have to re-submit it at the Marriage Registration Office. After the stipulated waiting period of 30 days the marriage can take place in India. Under theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 a certificate showing the signatures of the persons married, the registrar and the witnesses will be issued. This Certificate is required as proof of marriage and when applying for a visa to a foreign country.The requirement for this will be your age proof, (Passport, Birth Certificate) your address proof (Passport, Ration Card, Voters Identity card) and Martial status.

In any case, if an objection is raised against an intended marriage, the Marriage Registrar cannot solemnise the marriage until he has investigated the matter of objection and reached a decision that the earlier raised objection will not prevent the marriage from being solemnised, or the prior objection is withdrawn by the individual raising it. However, if the marriage officer validates the objection and refuses to solemnise the marriage, any of the intended parties may file an appeal with the district court within the local limits of the marriage officer’s office within thirty days, and the decision of the district court on such appeal will be binding, and the marriage officer must act in accordance with the court’s decision.Ajay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

It is a general misconception that prostitution in India is illegal, rather prostitution is legal but pimping, owning and managing a brothel is illegal. Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata are the major cities in India where brothels are operating illegally in large numbers. Prostitution in itself is neither illegal nor punishable under the act.In the present scenario, private prostitution is not recognized as an offence. Thus a customer is not penalized and there is no provision under any statute to do the same.As per law child is the responsibility of both parents and both are liable to maintain the child. so if child is born to a sex worker then firstly parentage is to be required to be confirmed and only then portion of maintenance can be claimed from men. illegal child too is entitled to maintenance.However the prostitute has to prove that she was impregnated by your friend and a child was born due to their relationship that occurred on that eventful day, which may include DNA test too.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Marriage in India as US Citizen",
    "answer": "1. In India, civil weddings are governed by the provisions ofTheSpecial Marriage Act(1954). Under the Act, there’s a 30 day residency requirement, which means that either the bride or the groom has to be living in India for at least 30 days prior to applying to the local registry office to get married. For foreigners, this is evidenced by a certificate from the local police station.If no objections to the marriage are received within 30 days of the application, a civil ceremony at the registry office can then take place. Three witnesses are required, who have to provide passport sized photographs, as well as identification and proof of address2. Since you will be here on a tourist visa, you have to convert your visa from a tourist visa to a short visit visa (valid for one year). For this you may have to visit the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO). This will cover the extensive period of stay in India.3. Whether or not your marriage will be registered under the provisions ofSpecial marriage act. TheSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 is an Act of the Parliament of India with provision for civil marriage for people of India and all Indian nationals in foreign countries, irrespective of religion or faith followed by either party.4. By just observing the formal ceremony in India, it will not conclude that it to be a legally valid marriage between you both.Your marriage in India, if you are desirous of getting it legally recognised or valid, then you may have to follow the procedures/laws prescribed for the purpose without any exemption for whatever reason you may rely upon.The marriage without being registered before the Concerned authority i.e., the Marriage officer, is not legally valid as per Indian laws.Besides you being  foreign national, your marriage  will fall under the provisions ofspecial marriage actonly and it is mandatory to register the marriage unless it is not valid.If you want to skip the process in India and would be contended with the US marriage itself, then your fiancee may not be recognised as your legally wedded spouse by US immigration authorities if you do not produce the marriage certificate issued by government in India, hence it may create legal hassles at that stage when you apply for visa to your spouse.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

On adducing the registration certificate of marriage, it may be presumed by the law that marriage is deemed to has taken place.In case a marriage between an Indian and a foreign national is to take place in India, the marriage has to solemnize under theSpecial Marriage Actof 1954. Generally it is required to file a notice of intended marriage with a Marriage Registrar of your choice in India. That notice is required to be published within the stipulated 30 days. At the end of the 30 days the Marriage Registrar is free to perform the marriage.Notice of intended marriage can only be given in India if at least one partner is permanently and the other partner temporarily resident in India.If one partner is residing in a foreign country then the partner who is resident in India will have to fill out the “Marriage Notice”  collected from the Marriage Registration Office of his/her choice in India and send it to his/her partner in the foreign country who will also have to fill it out. This “Notice” should then be sent back to the partner in India who will have to re-submit it at the Marriage Registration Office. After the stipulated waiting period of 30 days the marriage can take place in India. Under theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 a certificate showing the signatures of the persons married, the registrar and the witnesses will be issued. This Certificate is required as proof of marriage and when applying for a visa to a foreign country.The requirement for this will be your age proof, (Passport, Birth Certificate) your address proof (Passport, Ration Card, Voters Identity card) and Martial status.

In any case, if an objection is raised against an intended marriage, the Marriage Registrar cannot solemnise the marriage until he has investigated the matter of objection and reached a decision that the earlier raised objection will not prevent the marriage from being solemnised, or the prior objection is withdrawn by the individual raising it. However, if the marriage officer validates the objection and refuses to solemnise the marriage, any of the intended parties may file an appeal with the district court within the local limits of the marriage officer’s office within thirty days, and the decision of the district court on such appeal will be binding, and the marriage officer must act in accordance with the court’s decision.Ajay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata are the major cities in India where brothels are operating illegally in large numbers. Prostitution in itself is neither illegal nor punishable under the act.In the present scenario, private prostitution is not recognized as an offence. Thus a customer is not penalized and there is no provision under any statute to do the same.As per law child is the responsibility of both parents and both are liable to maintain the child. so if child is born to a sex worker then firstly parentage is to be required to be confirmed and only then portion of maintenance can be claimed from men. illegal child too is entitled to maintenance.However the prostitute has to prove that she was impregnated by your friend and a child was born due to their relationship that occurred on that eventful day, which may include DNA test too.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "1. If a Hindu male dies intestate (without executing WILL), his property would devolve equally to his mother (if alive), wife and children.2.  In the instant case, as per your narration, there are three persons who succeed to the estate of the deceased, i.e., your grandmother, your mother and you inheriting 1/3rd share each.3.  If your grandmother dies intestate only, her 1/3rd share in your deceased father's self acquired property would go to her legal heirs, which include your deceased father also ( your mother and you). In case your grandmother executes a WILL for her 1/3rd share of your deceased father's property in your favour, you would be getting total 1/3 + 1/3= 2/3 and if your mother bequeaths her 1/3rd share to you, then you would be cent percent absolute owner of your deceased father's property.Shashidhar S.

In case your grandmother executes a WILL for her 1/3rd share of your deceased father's property in your favour, you would be getting total 1/3 + 1/3= 2/3 and if your mother bequeaths her 1/3rd share to you, then you would be cent percent absolute owner of your deceased father's property.Shashidhar S.
