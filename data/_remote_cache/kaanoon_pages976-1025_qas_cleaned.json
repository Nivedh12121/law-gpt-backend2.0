    "answer": "Dear Client,Yes, a person with outstanding loans and credit card bills in the UAE from 2017 can generally travel to African countries, as such financial issues typically do not impact travel permissions outside the UAE. However, it is essential to ensure there are no international arrest warrants or travel bans issued by UAE authorities, which could potentially cause problems. It is advisable to check with the relevant embassies and possibly seek legal advice to confirm that there are no travel restrictions related to the unpaid debts before planning any international travel.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Yes, the technique of supplying a Power of Attorney (POA) in the desire of your mother, as attested through the Indian Embassy in the USA, is legally legitimate and typically used for such conditions. This permits your mother to behave on your behalf for the registry and other associated office work without requiring your physical presence in India. The attested POA has to explicitly state the powers granted to your mother, making sure it consists of all essential moves related to the asset registry.2. You will need separate General Power of Attorney (GPA) files for both you and your wife. Each of you need to personally authorise your mother in your very own GPA. Your spouse can legally authorise her mother-in-law or mother even without a blood courting, provided the GPA record is efficiently performed and attested through the Indian Embassy.

    "answer": "Dear Client,1. Since the home loan is in both your names and the original papers are with the bank, your wife can surrender or transfer her share of the property to you through a gift deed or relinquishment deed. However, this transfer is subject to the bank’s approval because the property is under a mortgage. You should first discuss your intentions with the bank to ensure they agree to the transfer and can provide guidance on their specific requirements.2. The bank can remove your wife's name from the loan if they approve the gift deed or relinquishment deed and you demonstrate your ability to repay the loan independently. The procedure generally involves submitting a formal request to the bank, along with the necessary documents, such as the gift deed, proof of your financial stability, and any additional documentation the bank requires. The bank will reassess the loan terms and may require you to refinance the loan solely in your name.3. Yes, you will need the bank's NOC (No Objection Certificate) to execute a gift deed or relinquishment deed while the property is under a mortgage. The bank must approve the transfer of property rights and ensure that their interests are protected. Once the gift deed is completed and approved by the bank, you can proceed with the transfer of the loan solely to your name, provided you meet the bank's criteria for the loan restructuring.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Mutual divorce but home loan on both names",
    "answer": "1. Transferring Ownership with an Ongoing Home Loan:It is possible to transfer ownership of a property even when a home loan is ongoing. There are two primary ways to do this:Gift Deed:Your wife can execute a gift deed in your favor, transferring her share of the property to you. This would need to be registered at the sub-registrar's office.Relinquishment Deed:Your wife can sign a relinquishment deed, giving up her rights to the property. This would also need to be registered.However, keep in mind that transferring ownership does not automatically remove your wife from the home loan. You'll need to address that separately with the bank.2. Removing a Co-Borrower from the Home Loan:The process for removing a co-borrower from a home loan varies depending on the bank's policies. Here's the general procedure:Inform the Bank:You'll need to notify IDBI Bank about your wife's desire to be removed from the loan.Documentation:You'll likely need to provide the bank with the gift deed or relinquishment deed as proof of ownership transfer.Assessment:The bank will assess your income and repayment capacity to ensure you can handle the loan alone. They may also consider factors like your credit score and the outstanding loan amount.Approval:If the bank approves the removal, they'll amend the loan agreement to reflect you as the sole borrower.Important Considerations:Bank's Consent:The bank's consent is crucial for any ownership transfer or co-borrower removal. They may have specific requirements or conditions you need to fulfill.Tax Implications:Transferring ownership through a gift deed or relinquishment deed may have tax implications. It's advisable to consult with a tax advisor to understand the potential tax liabilities.Romesh Pratap SinghAdvocate, Gwalior23 AnswersTalk to Advocate Romesh Pratap Singh"

    "answer": "There is no obligation on the part of the bank to give NOC during the pending home loan and you cannot claim it as a right to bank to furnish NOC especially if the loan has not been fully discharged.The bank has nothing to do with your divorce or continuing the married life, hence the bank cannot remove the name of one of the borrowers just because the couple have divorced each other.The bank will follow its own rules in this regard.It is again the discretion of the bank to relax the rules in the given situation especially if you are ready and willing to comply with the further instructions as instructed by the bank.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Mutual divorce but home loan on both names",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Banks have their own policies and procedures for handling requests to modify loan terms, including the removal of a co-applicant's name. The bank will assess the primary applicant's (your) ability to repay the loan independently before issuing an NOC. There is no specific law that prohibits banks from issuing an NOC for the transfer of property and modification of loan terms in cases like yours. It depends on the bank's terms and conditions. The bank is not mandated by law to remove a co-applicant’s name solely based on the divorce decree. It still depends on the bank's assessment of your ability to service the loan independently. Make sure all required documents are submitted accurately and seek legal assistance to ensure that all procedures are followed correctly.

Yes, the technique of supplying a Power of Attorney (POA) in the desire of your mother, as attested through the Indian Embassy in the USA, is legally legitimate and typically used for such conditions. This permits your mother to behave on your behalf for the registry and other associated office work without requiring your physical presence in India. The attested POA has to explicitly state the powers granted to your mother, making sure it consists of all essential moves related to the asset registry.2. You will need separate General Power of Attorney (GPA) files for both you and your wife. Each of you need to personally authorise your mother in your very own GPA. Your spouse can legally authorise her mother-in-law or mother even without a blood courting, provided the GPA record is efficiently performed and attested through the Indian Embassy.

    "question": "Complaint of insult the modesty, torture, mental harassment, criminal breach of trust and dowry",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. Possible Cases in the FIR: If your wife has filed a complaint, commonplace charges underneath the FIR can also consist ofdomestic violence(Section 498Aof the IPC), dowry harassment, and likely physical assault. The unique sections will depend upon her allegations and the evidence she affords.2. Strength of Your Case: Proof of your final conversation where she expressed a preference to retain the connection can be useful. It can suggest that the allegations of abuse or violence won't align with her previous stance, probably weakening her case.3. Mental Harassment: While'mental harassment' in step with se isn't a standalone offence inside the penal code, it's often taken into consideration beneathdomestic violenceor cruelty (Section 498A). If she accuses you of mental harassment, you need to reveal that no dowry demands have been made. Statements by way of your mother, while not the best,  no longer commonly meet the felony general for harassment unless they were abusive or threatening.4. FIR Quashing: The High Court quashes FIRs in the event that they discover the criticism lacks substance or is frivolous. It appears to be prima facie evidence of abuse of the legal method. Quashing differs from an ordeal in that it prevents useless litigation if the FIR is baseless.5. False Accusations Against Family: If family members are wrongly implicated, they are able to seek to have their names eliminated from the FIR. Post-acquittal or quashing, they are probably able to record a defamation suit against her for fake allegations.6. Stridhan Claims: To deal with the fake claims of Stridhan, accumulate and publish any evidence of her ownership of these gadgets. This may want to encompass pictures, receipts, or written communication indicating that she has them.7. WhatsApp Evidence: If she documented her circle of relatives' court cases about your own family in WhatsApp messages, it may be used as evidence. To counter, offer evidence showing a different narrative, inclusive of messages showing goodwill or agreements on different problems.8. Monetary Extraction Admission: If she admits throughout CAW periods that the criticism is to extract cash, record or file this admission. This could be pivotal in discrediting her claims and demonstrating a malafide purpose.9. DV Complaint with the Aid of Mother: Your mom can record a DV complaint against your spouse if she experienced abuse or harassment. This should encompass intellectual or emotional abuse at some point in your spouse’s stay, highlighting that harassment is not one-sided.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Complaint of insult the modesty, torture, mental harassment, criminal breach of trust and dowry",
    "answer": "It's important to understand that the specific charges and legal implications can vary depending on the laws in your jurisdiction and the details of your situation. However, here's some general information based on your questions:Potential Charges:Domestic Violence(DV):This is a broad term that can include physical, emotional, sexual, or economic abuse. In your case, she may allege physical abuse (which you deny) and mental harassment.Dowry Harassment:If she alleges dowry-related harassment, this could be a separate charge under specific laws in India.Criminal Intimidation:If she claims you threatened her, this could also be a charge.Proof of Willingness to Reconcile:Yes, evidence showing her willingness to reconcile in your last conversation could be helpful to your case. It may demonstrate that her accusations are not consistent with her earlier behavior.You can present text messages, call recordings, emails, or witness testimonies to support this claim.Mental Harassment:While \"mental harassment\" is not a specific crime in theIndian Penal Code(IPC), it can fall under cruelty (Section 498A) in the context ofdomestic violence.You don't need to prove you didn't take dowry unless she specifically accuses you of dowry harassment.If your mother's comments are presented as evidence of mental harassment, you could argue they were not intended to cause distress or that they were made in a private setting.Countering accusations of mental harassment might involve demonstrating your own good behavior, providing evidence of a healthy relationship, or highlighting any inconsistencies in her claims.FIR Quashing:FIR quashing is a legal procedure to get an FIR dismissed before trial. High courts can quash an FIR if it finds the case lacks merit, is frivolous, or is based on false allegations.The process involves filing a petition in the High Court, providing evidence to support your claims, and arguing why the FIR should be quashed.It differs from a normal trial as it focuses on the legality and validity of the FIR itself, rather than determining guilt or innocence.Falsely Implicated Family Members:If the police investigation finds that your family members were wrongly named, their names can be removed from the FIR.It may be difficult to take legal action against your wife for falsely implicating them, but you could consult a lawyer to explore any possible options.Stridhan (Woman's Property):You can provide evidence like photographs, videos, or witness statements to show that she already has her stridhan.You can also ask for a list of items she claims to be missing and try to prove they are already in her possession.WhatsApp Messages as Evidence:WhatsApp messages can be used as evidence in court, but their admissibility depends on factors like their authenticity and relevance to the case.If she admits to fabricating the complaint to extract money, this could be a strong point in your favor. Try to get this admission in writing or recorded, if possible.Mother Filing a DV Complaint:Yes, your mother can potentially file a DV complaint against your wife if she experienceddomestic violencefrom her. This would be a separate legal process.Romesh Pratap SinghAdvocate, Gwalior23 AnswersTalk to Advocate Romesh Pratap Singh"

    "question": "Amalgamation of plots and common passage",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Once the houses are merged and sold to an unmarried purchaser, the common  passage will generally emerge as part of the merged assets. This means it won't function in a separate access manner but can be incorporated into the general land parcel.Given that the purchaser is also purchasing the adjoining belongings, that is, subsequent to the not unusual passage, they need to be capable of amalgamating these types of plots collectively for an unmarried creation. This amalgamation might create a larger, unified plot, potentially bearing in mind greater extensive production or development and difficulty with neighbourhood zoning legal guidelines and regulations. However, it's far more critical to make certain that every prison method for merging the homes and incorporating the common passage into the brand new plot is correctly documented, which includes any vital updates to the land information and approvals from relevant authorities.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Amalgamation and Common Passage:Once you merge the three plots into a single property, the common passage legally becomes part of that amalgamated property. It loses its separate identity as a \"common passage.\"Buyer's Amalgamation Options:Yes, the buyer can potentially amalgamate all the plots together for a single construction, including the adjacent property they are buying and the formerly common passage. However, this would require:Approval from relevant authorities:They would need to obtain permission from the local municipal or planning authority for the amalgamation and construction. This usually involves submitting building plans and obtaining the necessary permits.Compliance with regulations:The construction must adhere to local building codes, zoning regulations, and any other applicable rules. This might include setbacks, height restrictions, etc.Technical feasibility:The amalgamation should be technically feasible, meaning there should be no legal or structural issues preventing it. For instance, there shouldn't be any easements or rights of way over the common passage that would prevent its incorporation into the new construction.Important Considerations:Clear documentation:Ensure that the sale agreement clearly defines the boundaries of the amalgamated property, including the former common passage. This will avoid any future disputes with the buyer of the adjacent property.Title clarity:It's crucial to have a clear title for all the properties involved in the amalgamation. Any existing encumbrances, mortgages, or legal disputes should be resolved before proceeding.Romesh Pratap SinghAdvocate, Gwalior23 AnswersTalk to Advocate Romesh Pratap Singh"

    "answer": "You and your wife may jointly execute a special (specific) PoA - not a GPA - in favour of your mother authorising her to sign the sale deed to be executed and registered by the flat-promoters on your behalf. The Special PoA needs to be properly drafted and signed by both of you, and EITHER notarised OR attested by the Indian Consulate in USA. Then, it needs to be sent to your mother in India. It needs to be adjudicated (meaning, assessed for stamp duty payable) at the land registry where the sale deed is to be registered. After adjudication, your mother can legally act on the special PoA on your behalf.

    "answer": "Dear Client,1. Yes, the technique of supplying a Power of Attorney (POA) in the desire of your mother, as attested through the Indian Embassy in the USA, is legally legitimate and typically used for such conditions. This permits your mother to behave on your behalf for the registry and other associated office work without requiring your physical presence in India. The attested POA has to explicitly state the powers granted to your mother, making sure it consists of all essential moves related to the asset registry.2. You will need separate General Power of Attorney (GPA) files for both you and your wife. Each of you need to personally authorise your mother in your very own GPA. Your spouse can legally authorise her mother-in-law or mother even without a blood courting, provided the GPA record is efficiently performed and attested through the Indian Embassy. This ensures readability and criminal standing for your mom to represent both of you within the belongings registry method.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Complaint of insult the modesty, torture, mental harassment, criminal breach of trust and dowry",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. Possible Cases in the FIR: If your wife has filed a complaint, commonplace charges underneath the FIR can also consist ofdomestic violence(Section 498Aof the IPC), dowry harassment, and likely physical assault. The unique sections will depend upon her allegations and the evidence she affords.2. Strength of Your Case: Proof of your final conversation where she expressed a preference to retain the connection can be useful. It can suggest that the allegations of abuse or violence won't align with her previous stance, probably weakening her case.3. Mental Harassment: While'mental harassment' in step with se isn't a standalone offence inside the penal code, it's often taken into consideration beneathdomestic violenceor cruelty (Section 498A). If she accuses you of mental harassment, you need to reveal that no dowry demands have been made. Statements by way of your mother, while not the best,  no longer commonly meet the felony general for harassment unless they were abusive or threatening.4. FIR Quashing: The High Court quashes FIRs in the event that they discover the criticism lacks substance or is frivolous. It appears to be prima facie evidence of abuse of the legal method. Quashing differs from an ordeal in that it prevents useless litigation if the FIR is baseless.5. False Accusations Against Family: If family members are wrongly implicated, they are able to seek to have their names eliminated from the FIR. Post-acquittal or quashing, they are probably able to record a defamation suit against her for fake allegations.6. Stridhan Claims: To deal with the fake claims of Stridhan, accumulate and publish any evidence of her ownership of these gadgets. This may want to encompass pictures, receipts, or written communication indicating that she has them.7. WhatsApp Evidence: If she documented her circle of relatives' court cases about your own family in WhatsApp messages, it may be used as evidence. To counter, offer evidence showing a different narrative, inclusive of messages showing goodwill or agreements on different problems.8. Monetary Extraction Admission: If she admits throughout CAW periods that the criticism is to extract cash, record or file this admission. This could be pivotal in discrediting her claims and demonstrating a malafide purpose.9. DV Complaint with the Aid of Mother: Your mom can record a DV complaint against your spouse if she experienced abuse or harassment. This should encompass intellectual or emotional abuse at some point in your spouse’s stay, highlighting that harassment is not one-sided.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Complaint of insult the modesty, torture, mental harassment, criminal breach of trust and dowry",
    "answer": "It's important to understand that the specific charges and legal implications can vary depending on the laws in your jurisdiction and the details of your situation. However, here's some general information based on your questions:Potential Charges:Domestic Violence(DV):This is a broad term that can include physical, emotional, sexual, or economic abuse. In your case, she may allege physical abuse (which you deny) and mental harassment.Dowry Harassment:If she alleges dowry-related harassment, this could be a separate charge under specific laws in India.Criminal Intimidation:If she claims you threatened her, this could also be a charge.Proof of Willingness to Reconcile:Yes, evidence showing her willingness to reconcile in your last conversation could be helpful to your case. It may demonstrate that her accusations are not consistent with her earlier behavior.You can present text messages, call recordings, emails, or witness testimonies to support this claim.Mental Harassment:While \"mental harassment\" is not a specific crime in theIndian Penal Code(IPC), it can fall under cruelty (Section 498A) in the context ofdomestic violence.You don't need to prove you didn't take dowry unless she specifically accuses you of dowry harassment.If your mother's comments are presented as evidence of mental harassment, you could argue they were not intended to cause distress or that they were made in a private setting.Countering accusations of mental harassment might involve demonstrating your own good behavior, providing evidence of a healthy relationship, or highlighting any inconsistencies in her claims.FIR Quashing:FIR quashing is a legal procedure to get an FIR dismissed before trial. High courts can quash an FIR if it finds the case lacks merit, is frivolous, or is based on false allegations.The process involves filing a petition in the High Court, providing evidence to support your claims, and arguing why the FIR should be quashed.It differs from a normal trial as it focuses on the legality and validity of the FIR itself, rather than determining guilt or innocence.Falsely Implicated Family Members:If the police investigation finds that your family members were wrongly named, their names can be removed from the FIR.It may be difficult to take legal action against your wife for falsely implicating them, but you could consult a lawyer to explore any possible options.Stridhan (Woman's Property):You can provide evidence like photographs, videos, or witness statements to show that she already has her stridhan.You can also ask for a list of items she claims to be missing and try to prove they are already in her possession.WhatsApp Messages as Evidence:WhatsApp messages can be used as evidence in court, but their admissibility depends on factors like their authenticity and relevance to the case.If she admits to fabricating the complaint to extract money, this could be a strong point in your favor. Try to get this admission in writing or recorded, if possible.Mother Filing a DV Complaint:Yes, your mother can potentially file a DV complaint against your wife if she experienceddomestic violencefrom her. This would be a separate legal process.Romesh Pratap SinghAdvocate, Gwalior23 AnswersTalk to Advocate Romesh Pratap Singh"

    "question": "If I go for cashless health insurance, hospital says they will not provide hospital bills",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Regarding the hospital’s not having bills ready with the authorities for cashless claims, it may be because of organisational internal billing and reimbursement policies of Tamil Nadu government pensioners insurance. This is because they have the flexibility of direct settlement with the insurance provider, although they don’t provide detailed bills for the patients. . Thus, when choosing the option of direct payment, they present bills as part of the essential observance of the procedure that is required if you consider receiving a refund. The actual fact that one has to pay an amount of 3 lakhs in advance shows that normally this coverage pays for 80% of the claim, leaving the actual bill amount to be paid by the patient; however, not providing a bill in a ‘cashless claim’ seems very non-transparent. To determine why such a policy is implemented, it would be more appropriate to press the hospital for answers or contact the insurer if those are the terms of payment.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "If I go for cashless health insurance, hospital says they will not provide hospital bills",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Regarding the hospital’s not having bills ready with the authorities for cashless claims, it may be because of organisational internal billing and reimbursement policies of Tamil Nadu government pensioners insurance. This is because they have the flexibility of direct settlement with the insurance provider, although they don’t provide detailed bills for the patients. . Thus, when choosing the option of direct payment, they present bills as part of the essential observance of the procedure that is required if you consider receiving a refund. The actual fact that one has to pay an amount of 3 lakhs in advance shows that normally this coverage pays for 80% of the claim, leaving the actual bill amount to be paid by the patient; however, not providing a bill in a ‘cashless claim’ seems very non-transparent. To determine why such a policy is implemented, it would be more appropriate to press the hospital for answers or contact the insurer if those are the terms of payment.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,1. If you have evidence of fabrication of a document, misrepresentation of the transaction, or breach of the agreement by the holder of the GPA or the mediator, you can always file another case of forgery or fraud against him.2. In order to know your portion of the land, it is advisable to seek an affirmation through the court of a detailed survey and subsequent partition of the land, which will enable you to understand your proportion of the whole piece of land.3. Indeed, one can still file another case for forgery or fraud against the person with the GPA and the mediator if there is ill intention or misleading information in the sale agreement.4. If you want to gain your share of the land, it is necessary to seek the partition of the properties that have not been divided, whereby the unpartioned property will be divided, and the court will decide which part is yours.5. Where the various parties possess a claim of fraudulent or negligent activity regarding the incurred financial losses, it is possible to seek damages after the civil court case through the GPA and the mediator.6. Yes, you can report the person to the authorities for fraud, especially if the money was taken with the intention of not passing the title deed of the land as agreed. Append to the claim all the correspondences and records of payment that can ever prove the legitimacy of the claim.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "If I go for cashless health insurance, hospital says they will not provide hospital bills",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Regarding the hospital’s not having bills ready with the authorities for cashless claims, it may be because of organisational internal billing and reimbursement policies of Tamil Nadu government pensioners insurance. This is because they have the flexibility of direct settlement with the insurance provider, although they don’t provide detailed bills for the patients. . Thus, when choosing the option of direct payment, they present bills as part of the essential observance of the procedure that is required if you consider receiving a refund. The actual fact that one has to pay an amount of 3 lakhs in advance shows that normally this coverage pays for 80% of the claim, leaving the actual bill amount to be paid by the patient; however, not providing a bill in a ‘cashless claim’ seems very non-transparent. To determine why such a policy is implemented, it would be more appropriate to press the hospital for answers or contact the insurer if those are the terms of payment.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Applying the points you pointed can in some way help your attempts at seeking dismissal of the FIR/charge sheet under Section 482 of the CrPC. Here's how-1. Vague Allegations: If the allegations are general and lack specific instances of harassment, it can be argued that the FIR is based on vague and unsubstantiated claims, which can be grounds for quashing.2. Two Police Complaints on the Same Date: Highlighting that two complaints were filed on the same date with the same CSR number, and one was used to file the FIR after the dowry prohibition officer's report cleared you, can indicate a possible fabrication or misuse of legal provisions. This discrepancy can be critical in showing inconsistencies and mala fide intentions.3. RCR Filing: The fact that your wife has filed aRestitution of Conjugal Rights(RCR) case asking you to live with her can be used to show that she has contradictory intentions. It is unusual for someone to seek reconciliation while simultaneously pursuing criminal charges underSection 498A, which can be portrayed as a strategy to pressurise you.4. Detention without 41A Notice: Being detained without prior notice under Section 41A CrPC and then being asked to sign it retrospectively can be a significant procedural violation.

    "answer": "- As per the RERA Act, if the Developer/builder is delaying in construction & delay in possession, then the builder will have to pay 10% interest on the value of the property for delayed possession of flats.- Hence, if builder fails to delivers the possession of the flat to you on time, then you can cancel the agreement due to his fault and you are liable to get full refund of paid amount with 10 percent interest.- Further, if you get the possession of the said flat lately, then also you can claim 10% compensation from the builder.- Since, you have already filed the complaint before the RERA , then RERA is bound to take legal action against the developer- You can move an application before the said MahaRERA for early disposal of the complaint , and if that application dismissed then you can approach the RERA Appellate Tribunal to pass the order within a fixed time frame.- Further, you can also file a complaint before the Consumer Forum as well for speedy trial , and can claim compensation for mental harassment caused due to delay.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "Dear client,You need to keep on sending reminders through email and registered mail to MahaRERA, referencing your prior communications and stressing the urgency due to your medical condition and financial strain. Additionally, visit the MahaRERA office in person or appoint a representative to do so on your behalf to obtain a direct response. Write directly to the head of MahaRERA, outlining the delays and lack of response, and request immediate intervention.If this problem impacts several buyers, think about submitting a Public Interest Litigation in the High Court, asking for orders to ensure timely possession and impose penalties on the developer. Collaborate with the Association of Purchasers to boost your collective negotiation power. Together, reach out to authorities, the media, and the courts. Make sure that any new contracts with the developer include strict penalty clauses for future delays and are legally binding.If everything fails, you might want to consider lodging a complaint with the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (CDRC) to seek compensation for the delay, interest on the amount you paid, and any extra rental costs you've incurred. It's advisable to hire a lawyer who specializes in real estate and consumer disputes to ensure your case is well-represented.Thank you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Since all 3 sisters are old, if one of the sister passes away, the matter will become  more complicated as their heirs/children will fight for their legal rights.It is better you get issued a strong legal notice first detailing your case and proposal of 50:50 sharing. This document will act as strong evidence in the court in your favor as you offered a practical and fair solution.Every legal notice issued through lawyer has a statutory period of 15 days timeline to reply . If no favorable reply is given, then you may initiate partition suit as you have a will from your grand mother . Legal notice can be issued through any lawyer which is feasible to your location as you need to sign it and process it.Usually 90% cases get resolved through legal notices as legal notice is a legal warning issued through a lawyer to settle dispute out of court, failing which,  case can be registered in court. Opposite side can act wisely by settling it after receiving legal notice if they want to avoid court battles.Since property is located in Nagpur, Maharashtra, You have to file a partition suit in Nagpur civil court.I would request you to contact me personally on phone or at my office for detailed consultation if any required..If you found my answer help , Please provide your valuable ratings.Thank you.

However, here are some points to consider:School Policy: Check the policy of the school or read the agreement signed when enrolling the child. Depending on the terms and conditions of the agreement, it may have clauses related to the fee payment and other terms on which T. C. will be issued.Negotiation: However, there are situations when the policy may be vague or something you consider unfair might be stated in it. There is usually an option to discuss the policy with the management of the school, stating your position and that your son did not attend any classes.Legal Rights: Indian law is quite fair to those who seek education; it requires that educational institutions be reasonable. If you think that the school is violating the law, you might consult an advocate or go to the office of education in your area for assistance.Documentation: Ensure that you maintain any correspondence with the school and/or any other supporting documentation for your request or claim (example: absence of your son during the term).Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Builder has declined to provide maintenance for apartment well before finishing project",
    "answer": "Dear client,If the builder does not fulfils his obligation and not completed his work within stipulation period, you can proceed by filing a complaint with Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA). And also you can send legal notice with help of lawyer stating the same facts. Until your cooperative society is formally registered, form an interim owners' association to join the residents and provide a collective voice. Approach the BBMP  authorities or urban development bodies to seek their intervention, especially concerning the non-issuance of the occupancy certificate and non-compliance with building standards. Work on drafting the bylaws and completing the necessary paperwork for registering your cooperative society under the Karnataka Co-operative Societies Act, 1959/1960. This will give you legal standing to manage your property collectively.  Everything fails you go file case against builder for incompletion work poor interior low quality work and substandard works before the consumer court.Thank youAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "- As per the RERA Act, if the builder is delaying in construction & delay in possession, then the builder will have to pay 10% interest on the value of the property for delayed possession of flats.- Further, the builder is not eligible to claim maintenance charge before the completion of the total facilities, and only after completing everything, the builder can ask for maintenance from the buyer, hence you can deny to pay the same.- You can lodge a complaint before the Consumer Forum or RERA against the builder , and thereby can also claim compensation for mental harassment with the possession of the flat with 10% interest.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

Many builder gives promises but find it difficult to fulfill.

Be on good records and try to negotiate with the builder .Firstly issue of a strong legal notice is recommended.I could discuss your case in detail if I  had the documents of the builder name , project etc and known more information about your case .

    "answer": "Dear client,You need to keep on sending reminders through email and registered mail to MahaRERA, referencing your prior communications and stressing the urgency due to your medical condition and financial strain. Additionally, visit the MahaRERA office in person or appoint a representative to do so on your behalf to obtain a direct response. Write directly to the head of MahaRERA, outlining the delays and lack of response, and request immediate intervention.If this problem impacts several buyers, think about submitting a Public Interest Litigation in the High Court, asking for orders to ensure timely possession and impose penalties on the developer. Collaborate with the Association of Purchasers to boost your collective negotiation power. Together, reach out to authorities, the media, and the courts. Make sure that any new contracts with the developer include strict penalty clauses for future delays and are legally binding.If everything fails, you might want to consider lodging a complaint with the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (CDRC) to seek compensation for the delay, interest on the amount you paid, and any extra rental costs you've incurred. It's advisable to hire a lawyer who specializes in real estate and consumer disputes to ensure your case is well-represented.Thank you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In India, defamation laws provide recourse for individuals and businesses whose reputation has been unjustly harmed by false statements. Given that the competitor's article contains false information about your services, which is demonstrably incorrect based on your website content and has likely impacted your business, you can take legal action.First, acquire all applicable proof. This consists of the thing in question, screenshots of your website showing the suitable facts, and any facts that may help quantify the economic impact, such as records of potential customers lost or a decrease in enterprise inquiries corresponding with the article's booklet. Documenting how the competitor's false claims have directly harmed your commercial enterprise is important.Consult with a prison professional focusing on commercial enterprise regulation and defamation. They can offer unique advice tailored in your state of affairs and help you decide the first-class direction of movement. Typically, the initial step might involve sending a cease-and-desist letter on your competitor, demanding that they remove the object and issue a retraction and public apology. This letter can also outline your purpose in trying to find damages in the event that they do not comply.If the competitor does not respond satisfactorily to the end-and-desist letter, you may proceed with submitting a lawsuit. You can claim compensation for the economic losses incurred due to the defamatory statements, in addition to are trying to find damages for the damage for your popularity. The legal method will involve offering your evidence and demonstrating the impact of the false records on your business.Additionally, you can explore treatments underneath the Competition Act, 2002, which addresses anti-competitive practices together with false and misleading advertising which could harm competition. Filing a grievance with the Competition Commission of India (CCI) is probably another avenue to seek redress.Given the complexity of your capability and the desire to precisely quantify your losses, an in-depth consultation with your attorney will be important.

    "answer": "Dear client,The landowner allows the land for lease for 99 years which commences from the date the allotment was conducted. Prior to moving forward, it's important to carefully examine the HOA's governing documents to confirm that there are no particular provisions that forbid or limit such arrangements. It's recommended to consult with legal experts to ensure that the lease agreement is legally valid and safeguards the interests of both the HOA and its residents. The agreement should receive approval from the HOA board and potentially from the HOA members, contingent upon the bylaws and regulations in place.After completion, it might be necessary to register the agreement in the property documents to inform future owners and safeguard the interests of all involved parties. Maintain transparent communication with the impacted residents and community members to ensure openness and handle any issues or disagreements that may arise.Thank you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Truth serves as a defense against defamation.Publication: The remark must be communicated to someone other than the person being defamed.Injury: The remark must harm the subject's reputation.Unprivileged: The remark must not be protected by any legal privilege (e.g., in some instances, statements made during legal proceedings are privileged).Although statements made during legal proceedings are typically protected by privilege, false allegations made outside of court may serve as grounds for a defamation claim.

Its important to understand the Laws relating to defamation to ensure that one's reputation is protected and also the freedom of speech is balanced.Courts have given great importance to truth as a defense in defamation cases. The defamation should be seen from the view of right thinking person.To exercise the rights, one should prove that there was publication of false statement, its impact on his reputation and it should be false and also not in public interest.Under a criminal suit, intention to defame is necessary. The allegation should be made with malice intent to defame another or at least the knowledge that the publication is likely to defame another is essential. It has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt that the act was being done to lower the reputation of another.Statements made about the character of character is not defamation if it is made in order to protect the interests of the person making it, or any other person, or for the public good.Reputation is an asset to each and every one.

This could include:Witness testimonies from people who heard the defamatory statements.Any written or recorded evidence of the statements.Proof that the statements are false (e.g., medical records to refute mental health claims).Civil vs. Criminal Defamation:You can file a civil defamation suit for damages or a criminal defamation complaint, seeking punishment for your wife.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In redevelopment projects, it's crucial to understand the difference between the MOFA (Maharashtra Ownership Flats Act) area and the RERA (Real Estate Regulatory Authority) area, as they can lead to confusion due to differing calculation methods. Here’s a breakdown:Initial Offer:600 sq ft MOFA: eligible area based on your current property.550 sq ft MOFA: Initially offered by the developer.575 sq ft RERA: Initially offered by the developer.Surrender Area: 50 sq ft, for which the developer pays at the relevant rate.Revised Offer:600 sq ft MOFA: Now offered by the developer.635 sq ft RERA: Now offered by the developer, including common areas.45 sq ft balcony: Added conditionally for some floors.Calculation:Previous Calculation: 600 (existing) - 600 (offered) + 45 (balcony) = 45 sq ft additional purchase.Current Calculation: 635 (offered) - 600 (existing) + 45 (balcony) = 75 sq ft additional purchase.Key Points:1. MOFA vs. RERA: Ensure clarity on what areas are included in the RERA area. RERA often includes common areas and balconies, which are not part of MOFA.2. Guidelines: MOFA mandates clear disclosure of carpet area, and any reduction must be compensated. RERA requires transparent communication of the carpet area and additional spaces.3. Balcony Condition: Ensure the conditional addition of the balcony is clearly agreed upon. If it feels forced or unfair, negotiate with the developer.4. Legal Advice: Consult a property lawyer familiar with MOFA and RERA regulations to review the offer and ensure compliance with legal standards.Additionally, seek advice from a property lawyer to ensure your interests are protected during negotiations.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

To compensate the builders for the loss, the government made a provision for additional built-up space in lieu of a premium.The premium levied is a percentage of the Ready Reckoner Rate (RRR) prevalent in an area. For instance, residential properties attract 60 percent of the RRR as a fungible FSI fee. Similarly, the fees for industrial and commercial developments are 80 percent and 100 percent of RRR, respectively. Further, developers can avail around 25 percent more parking space over the DCR limit free of cost, which is a respite to builders and home buyers.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Sir/MadamYou have to take quick action as your fear is right. Since all 3 sisters are old, if one of the sister passes away, the matter will become  more complicated as their heirs/children will fight for their legal rights.It is better you get issued a strong legal notice first detailing your case and proposal of 50:50 sharing. This document will act as strong evidence in the court in your favor as you offered a practical and fair solution.Every legal notice issued through lawyer has a statutory period of 15 days timeline to reply . If no favorable reply is given, then you may initiate partition suit as you have a will from your grand mother . Legal notice can be issued through any lawyer which is feasible to your location as you need to sign it and process it.Usually 90% cases get resolved through legal notices as legal notice is a legal warning issued through a lawyer to settle dispute out of court, failing which,  case can be registered in court. Opposite side can act wisely by settling it after receiving legal notice if they want to avoid court battles.Since property is located in Nagpur, Maharashtra, You have to file a partition suit in Nagpur civil court.I would request you to contact me personally on phone or at my office for detailed consultation if any required..If you found my answer help , Please provide your valuable ratings.Thank you.

    "context": "Asked 12 months ago in Property Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Father share on the deceased son property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. Under Hindu law, a father isn't considered a Class I legal heir when it comes to his deceased son's property. According to the law, only the wife, children, and mother are classified as Class I heirs. However, if Durai was included in the legal heir certificate and the patta (title) was transferred to his name alongside the other legal heirs, it suggests that Durai was recognised as a legal heir under specific circumstances. In the event that Durai's share of the property was legally recognised and he signed the lease deed, his portion would indeed become part of Durai's estate upon his death and would be distributed among his legal heirs, such as his wife and children.2. Now, if Durai's share was mistakenly considered his own personal property and distributed based on that assumption, then the release deed stating Poon's share as 1/4 instead of 1/5 would be inaccurate. Poon's actual share should be reassessed as 1/5 of Durai's inherited portion. This means that the release deed could potentially be invalid or require correction in order to accurately reflect the distribution of shares.3. According to Hindu law, a father isn't classified as a Class I legal heir to his deceased son's estate. However, the fact that Durai was included in the legal heir certificate and the subsequent actions, such as the transfer of the title and the signing of the lease deed, suggest that the legal procedures might not have strictly adhered to the legal heir classifications. This could be due to administrative or familial arrangements that were in place at that time. Legally speaking, Durai shouldn't have been included as a legal heir, but since he was, the transfer of the title and the lease deed were carried out with his involvement. It would be advisable to seek rectification or legal clarification in order to ensure compliance with theHindu Succession Act.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Meena can argue on following points:Meena could assert that Durai contributed financially towards acquiring the property in 1987, even if there isn't solid evidence presently available. She might argue on circumstantial evidence like family testimonies or documents indirectly suggesting Durai's involvement.Another point she could emphasize is the inclusion of Durai's name in the legal heir certificate following Ganesh's demise in 1989, indicating acknowledgment of Durai's stake in the property.Additionally, Meena could point out that Ganesh's family didn't oppose the transfer of the property's name in the patta document in 2009, implying recognition of Durai's rightful ownership.She could also argue that Durai's signature on the lease deed for the petrol pump property in 2009 suggests his acknowledged interest in ownership by the family.As for challenging the transfer of the patta name, Meena would need to consider the limitation period based on the relevant jurisdiction's laws, seeking legal counsel for clarification.Regarding the validity of the property sale deed signed by Ganeshan's wife without Ganeshan's mother's signature, this hinges on jurisdictional laws and specific transaction circumstances. Depending on the situation, spousal consent might be required for property transactions, necessitating legal examination of applicable laws.Thank you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

To prove a defamation case, specific criteria typically need to be satisfied.False Statement: The remark must be untrue. Truth serves as a defense against defamation.Publication: The remark must be communicated to someone other than the person being defamed.Injury: The remark must harm the subject's reputation.Unprivileged: The remark must not be protected by any legal privilege (e.g., in some instances, statements made during legal proceedings are privileged).Although statements made during legal proceedings are typically protected by privilege, false allegations made outside of court may serve as grounds for a defamation claim.

The allegation should be made with malice intent to defame another or at least the knowledge that the publication is likely to defame another is essential. It has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt that the act was being done to lower the reputation of another.Statements made about the character of character is not defamation if it is made in order to protect the interests of the person making it, or any other person, or for the public good.Reputation is an asset to each and every one.

    "answer": "- As per Section 8 of theHindu Succession Act, if a man leaves behind his parents , wife and children, all of them have an equal right on his property- However, the father is the second class legal heir whereas mother , wife and children of deceased son are first class legal heirs.1. Durai being father was not having any share in the property of his son- However , as already got a share in the property of son , then after the death of Durai his property would be devolved upon all his legal heirs equally.2. Yes , mothers share will become 1/5 after getting share from her husband- If the release deed was executed before the death of Durai then that deed is valid for 1/4 share3.

    "question": "Father share on the deceased son property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. Under Hindu law, a father isn't considered a Class I legal heir when it comes to his deceased son's property. According to the law, only the wife, children, and mother are classified as Class I heirs. However, if Durai was included in the legal heir certificate and the patta (title) was transferred to his name alongside the other legal heirs, it suggests that Durai was recognised as a legal heir under specific circumstances. In the event that Durai's share of the property was legally recognised and he signed the lease deed, his portion would indeed become part of Durai's estate upon his death and would be distributed among his legal heirs, such as his wife and children.2. Now, if Durai's share was mistakenly considered his own personal property and distributed based on that assumption, then the release deed stating Poon's share as 1/4 instead of 1/5 would be inaccurate. Poon's actual share should be reassessed as 1/5 of Durai's inherited portion. This means that the release deed could potentially be invalid or require correction in order to accurately reflect the distribution of shares.3. According to Hindu law, a father isn't classified as a Class I legal heir to his deceased son's estate. However, the fact that Durai was included in the legal heir certificate and the subsequent actions, such as the transfer of the title and the signing of the lease deed, suggest that the legal procedures might not have strictly adhered to the legal heir classifications. This could be due to administrative or familial arrangements that were in place at that time. Legally speaking, Durai shouldn't have been included as a legal heir, but since he was, the transfer of the title and the lease deed were carried out with his involvement. It would be advisable to seek rectification or legal clarification in order to ensure compliance with theHindu Succession Act.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Meena can argue on following points:Meena could assert that Durai contributed financially towards acquiring the property in 1987, even if there isn't solid evidence presently available. She might argue on circumstantial evidence like family testimonies or documents indirectly suggesting Durai's involvement.Another point she could emphasize is the inclusion of Durai's name in the legal heir certificate following Ganesh's demise in 1989, indicating acknowledgment of Durai's stake in the property.Additionally, Meena could point out that Ganesh's family didn't oppose the transfer of the property's name in the patta document in 2009, implying recognition of Durai's rightful ownership.She could also argue that Durai's signature on the lease deed for the petrol pump property in 2009 suggests his acknowledged interest in ownership by the family.As for challenging the transfer of the patta name, Meena would need to consider the limitation period based on the relevant jurisdiction's laws, seeking legal counsel for clarification.Regarding the validity of the property sale deed signed by Ganeshan's wife without Ganeshan's mother's signature, this hinges on jurisdictional laws and specific transaction circumstances. Depending on the situation, spousal consent might be required for property transactions, necessitating legal examination of applicable laws.Thank you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Disputing unfair dismissal procedures can be one of the most challenging tasks an employee can ever encounter in his/her life. Here are the steps you can take to address your termination from Muks Robotics AI Private Limited:1.Review Your Employment Contract: Some of the connected papers might be: First of all, read through your employment contract and any other documents that you signed when you joined the specific company. This is due to the fact that this clause will contain details on the periods of notice that can be given, the circumstances under which dismissals are allowed or even required, and when it is allowed for the contract to be terminated. This will assist in helping you determine the position of the law on your side as well as see if the company in question has violated any of your rights granted by the law.2.Document Everything:Therefore, ensure that you record any conversation held in person, on the phone, or in writing with the company such as emails, letters etc. In our contemporary society, people不知不知道 many tasks are performed online, and thus, document your work activities to show that you did not abuse company resources, for instance, by using your personal laptop for an interview.3.Seek Clarification:It may be required to write a polite and professional letter to the Human Resources department or to the director of the company to know the exact reasons for the dismissal more elaborately. Engaging you with the specific details of your misconduct, detail cases where you are accused of using the company’s property for personal gains as well as explaining how you were unable to meet the various compliance requirements while your brief tenure with the company.4.Legal Consultation:This is a good point to seek legal advice from an employment lawyer. They can give you legal services which are based on your specific case, explain your legal position and decide whether the termination was unlawful. The lawyer may also advise one on the procedures to follow when it comes to filing for reimbursement of losses, or even filing for a lawsuit.5.Request Compensation:In your dealing with the company, make sure to remember to ask for the two months’ pay that is deprived from you as a result of the said dismissal. Ensure that you have not been provided with an indication or chance to comment on any issues being levelled against you, which may amount to an unfair working environment.6.Explore Alternative Dispute Resolution: If direct communication with the company does not yield results, consider mediation or arbitration. These are less formal than court proceedings and can be effective in resolving employment disputes.7.File a Complaint: If the company refuses to cooperate, you can file a complaint with the appropriate labor authorities in your region. This could be the labor commissioner’s office or an employment tribunal. Provide them with all your documentation and evidence of unfair termination.8.Job Search and Support: While addressing the termination issue, continue your job search. Reach out to professional networks and consider temporary or freelance work to mitigate the impact of unemployment. Utilize support services, such as career counseling or employment agencies, to help find new opportunities.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,If the builder does not fulfils his obligation and not completed his work within stipulation period, you can proceed by filing a complaint with Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA). And also you can send legal notice with help of lawyer stating the same facts. Until your cooperative society is formally registered, form an interim owners' association to join the residents and provide a collective voice. Approach the BBMP  authorities or urban development bodies to seek their intervention, especially concerning the non-issuance of the occupancy certificate and non-compliance with building standards. Work on drafting the bylaws and completing the necessary paperwork for registering your cooperative society under the Karnataka Co-operative Societies Act, 1959/1960. This will give you legal standing to manage your property collectively.  Everything fails you go file case against builder for incompletion work poor interior low quality work and substandard works before the consumer court.Thank youAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,As per  sections 19 and 21 of the POCSO Act, it is mandatory for anyone aware of any instance of child sexual abuse to report it to the Special Juvenile Unit of the police. This report must be documented in writing. The POCSO Act permits anyone, not just the victim or their guardians, to file a complaint. The Act defines a child as a person below 18 years of age thereby fixes the age of consent at 18 years. Offence POCSO offenses are generally  non-bailable, meaning that bail is not guaranteed and is subject to the court's discretion. The court will evaluate the gravity of the charges, the evidence provided, and the potential danger to the child before deciding on bail. Effective legal representation can assist in making a case for bail, but it remains difficult due to the severity of the allegations.According to your second question there is chances to get bail on certain grounds The consistent delays by the state police department in filing chargesheets for cases under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act have led to the release of several accused individuals on bail. Investigating Officers often fail to arrest the accused or file the chargesheet within the mandatory 90-day period, indirectly benefiting the accused and delaying justice.chances of conviction: In a recent ruling, the Delhi High Court highlighted that according to Section 29 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act 2012 (POCSO Act), the presumption of guilt applies only once the prosecution has established the fundamental facts of the case beyond a reasonable doubt.Thank you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In your case, if your wife files a complaint, the police are legally obligated to investigate. However, the burden of proof lies with the prosecution to establish the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.Difficulty in getting bail:In POCSO cases, obtaining bail can be difficult, especially during the initial stages of investigation. The severity of the alleged offense, the risk of the accused fleeing or tampering with evidence, and the potential threat to the child's safety are all considered when deciding bail applications.Chances of conviction against father:The chances of conviction depend heavily on the evidence presented in court.

To correct a spelling, the following steps need to be followed, which include completing a name correction application online through the UIDAI website or going to an Aadhar enrollment centre to fill out the same with appropriate official documents, for example, passports and school marksheets that have the right spelling.The sequence of ID proof, PAN card, driving licence, bank accounts, bank post office, mutual fund investments, and income tax returns should be followed immediately after updating the Aadhar card. Every institution has its own process of changing names, and the name correction process often entails the use of a properly filled-out name correction form, identity proof reflecting the new name, and, in some cases, a copy of the new Aadhar card.However, this might take much time; though, it ensures consistency concerning competitors’ actions and legal issues.

    "answer": "Dear client,If the builder does not fulfils his obligation and not completed his work within stipulation period, you can proceed by filing a complaint with Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA). And also you can send legal notice with help of lawyer stating the same facts. Until your cooperative society is formally registered, form an interim owners' association to join the residents and provide a collective voice. Approach the BBMP  authorities or urban development bodies to seek their intervention, especially concerning the non-issuance of the occupancy certificate and non-compliance with building standards. Work on drafting the bylaws and completing the necessary paperwork for registering your cooperative society under the Karnataka Co-operative Societies Act, 1959/1960. This will give you legal standing to manage your property collectively.  Everything fails you go file case against builder for incompletion work poor interior low quality work and substandard works before the consumer court.Thank youAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "- As per the RERA Act, if the builder is delaying in construction & delay in possession, then the builder will have to pay 10% interest on the value of the property for delayed possession of flats.- Further, the builder is not eligible to claim maintenance charge before the completion of the total facilities, and only after completing everything, the builder can ask for maintenance from the buyer, hence you can deny to pay the same.- You can lodge a complaint before the Consumer Forum or RERA against the builder , and thereby can also claim compensation for mental harassment with the possession of the flat with 10% interest.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

Be on good records and try to negotiate with the builder .Firstly issue of a strong legal notice is recommended.I could discuss your case in detail if I  had the documents of the builder name , project etc and known more information about your case . But due to limitations, i would request you to contact me personally on phone or at my office for detailed consultation if any required..If you found my answer help , Please provide your valuable ratings.Thank you.

It's important to have an open and honest conversation with your husband alongwith your parents in laws regarding the situations and all possible consequences. it is inferred from your question that your husband age group is of 45-50s yrs.Your parent in laws are threatening you to be thrown out just because your husband drinks alot and your in laws held you being the main reason. so, If you want to work with the relationship, you have to make and convince your in laws that drinking habits of your husband is not because of you and you need to take him to good doctor to make him reformed and restrain from drinking. Mean whilst, your in laws also need to understand that as they are in their advance age, it would be detrimental for themselves too if both of you are dismissed from your home. The threatening decision of the in-laws is only to make both of you to work for relationship and support in their advance aged stage.so, dont worry, work with your relationship, try to convince your husband to visit to a good doctor, in this your in- laws and your family members might play some important role. also, from question, nothing is clear regarding your children and if they are within the vicinity they might play a very convincing role. you may also, seek and suggest to your in laws if you seek divorce, what would be future of your children?Notwithstanding above, harassment that you are facing from your in laws and husband is a kind ofdomestic Violenceand is a punishable offence underDomestic ViolenceAct, which may lend them into trouble and punitive action by the police/ court. yet, it's important to communicate openly and honestly about the issues regarding what is and isn't acceptable behavior. And, if you choose to work on your relationship, make sure that your husband is willing to take responsibility for her actions. From the question, it is not clear that what source of earning and who steers the family boat, as your comments suggest that your husband is not earning, this may be a big reason for his poor drinking habits in the given patriarchal societal norms. Wherein, you may also consider the following:Consider counseling: A trained counselor can help you and in laws effectively and work through any underlying issues.Don't blame each-other: It's important to remember that your husband behaviour may be some situation based or due to strong interference of your parents and no-earning of himself.Wouldn’t you want to know if your husband wants to continue in this marriage or not?Why your husband want divorce, what are reasons, if extra marital relations, of your interference in his drinking habits, or anything else, and hence, you should seek answer to these questions to resolve the problem. Any emotional triggers from your past relationship/ life ?- these questions need to be answered,so that both of you as mature adults can priorities what’s important and either work together for the marriage or move on with your lives going separate.your husband and family has to recognize that all that, if anything that happend in past, has happened is a matter of past and if you are fully emotionally, physically, financially and in all other aspect, are honestly committed to your family and want to make reform to your husband, your in-laws should support you rather than making your life miserable and hence, you should explain whatever problems persist and resolve mutually.Here, your husband may be worried about the financial independence, or he want some form of freedom in the married life and in the present patriarchal society the fabrics of responsibilities are nets around the father. so, both of you have to communicate with yourself and each-other. Try a fresh with focus on the present and try to build a more transparent and communicative relationship in the present. Take this opportunity to work together and strengthen your marriage.Try to follow these commandment answers for a lifetime of happiness and harmony:What are your personal values and beliefs?How do you envision our roles and responsibilities within the marriage?How do you envision the role of family in our relationship?What are your career aspirations, and how do you plan to achieve them?How do you handle stress or challenges in life?How do you handle conflicts or disagreements in a relationship?How do you manage finances and plan for the future?What are your hobbies and interests outside of work?How do you prioritize spending time with family and friends?What are your expectations regarding communication and openness in our relationship?What are your religious or cultural beliefs, and how do they influence your life?How do you see our relationship evolving over time, and what are your thoughts on starting a family?Are there any specific values or traditions that are important to you, and how do you envision incorporating them into our lives together?How do you prioritize personal growth and self-improvement in a relationship?How do you maintain a healthy work-life balance?How do you express love and affection in a relationship?How do you handle differences in opinions or cultural backgrounds?What are your expectations regarding household chores and responsibilities?How do you balance personal space and time with family responsibilities?What are your views on gender equality and mutual respect in marriage?How do you envision supporting each other through life's ups and downs?And if all this failed, then proceed for initiating a case fordomestic Violenceagainst your in-laws and your husband under DV Act, where, not only you will get relief from the domestic miseries but also, your husband has to be pay you maintenance. Also, your, parent in-laws can not absolve from their responsibility and if your husband is not earning, still they have to give some part of property as maintenance/ one time alimony in case of divorce as your husband is going to be heir of the property of your in-laws. Here, though the property (house) may not be an ancestral property, still court may decide in your favour and against wishes of your husband and in-laws and gives you your rightful shares in the property.However, it is suggested that the divorce may be used as matter of last resort. Some legal provisions on maintenance are as discussed below and hence, you can use Section125 Crpcand DV Act for remedy and maintenance from your husband and in-laws along with the right to Selter.The legal provisions are as appended below:-That, the legislations which have been framed on the issue of maintenance are theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, Section 125 of the Cr.P.C. ,1973; and the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005 which provide a statutory remedy to women, irrespective of the religious community to which they belong, apart from the personal laws applicable. theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 by invoking Sections 24 and 25 :Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 Sections 24 and 25 make provision for maintenance to a party who has no independent income sufficient for his or her support, and necessary expenses. This is a gender-neutral provision, where either the wife or the husband may claim maintenance. The prerequisite is that the applicant does not have independent income which is sufficient for her or his support, during the pendency of the lis.Section 24 of the HMA provides for maintenance pendente lite, where the Court may direct the respondent to pay the expenses of the proceeding, and pay such reasonable monthly amount, which is considered to be reasonable, having regard to the income of both the parties. The proviso to Section 24 providing a time line of 60 days for disposal of the application was inserted vide Act 49 of 2001 w.e.f. 24.09.2001.Section 18 provides that a Hindu wife shall be entitled to be maintained by her husband during her lifetime. She is entitled to make a claim for a separate residence, without forfeiting her right to maintenance. Section 18 read in conjunction with Section 23 states the factors required to be considered for deciding the quantum of maintenance to be paid.Under sub-section (2) of Section 18, the husband has the obligation to maintain his wife, even though she may be living separately. The right of separate residence and maintenance would however not be available if the wife has been unchaste, or has converted to another religion.Section 125 of the Cr.P.C The purpose and object of Section 125 Cr.P.C. is to provide immediate relief to an applicant.An application under Section 125 Cr.P.C. is predicated on two conditions : the husband has sufficient means; and “neglects” to maintain his wife, who is unable to maintain herself. In such a case, the husband may be directed by the Magistrate to pay such monthly sum to the wife, as deemed fit. Maintenance is awarded on the basis of the financial capacity of the husband and other relevant factors. Under sub-section (2) of Section 125, the Court is conferred with the discretion to award payment of maintenance either from the date of the order, or from the date of the application. Under the third proviso to the amended Section 125, the application for grant of interim maintenance must be disposed of as far as possible within sixty days’ from the date of service of notice on the respondent.Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005 The D.V. Act provides relief to an aggrieved woman who is subjected to “domestic violence.”1.Sections 17 and 19 grant an entitlement in favour of an aggrieved woman to the right of residence in a “shared household”, irrespective of her having any legal interest in the same or not. From the definition of “aggrieved person” and “respondent”, it is clear that : (a) it is not the requirement of law that the aggrieved person may either own the premises jointly or singly, or by tenanting it jointly or singly; (b) the household may belong to a joint family of which the respondent is a member, irrespective of whether the respondent or the aggrieved person has any right, title, or interest in the shared household; 24 (c) the shared household may either be owned, or tenanted by the respondent singly or jointly.The right to residence u/S. 19 is, however, not an indefeasible right, especially when a daughter-in-law is claiming a right against aged parents-in-law.While granting relief u/S. 12 of the D.V. Act, or in any civil proceeding, the court has to balance the rights between the aggrieved woman and the parents-in-law.Section 20(1)(d) provides that maintenance granted under the D.V. Act to an aggrieved woman and children, would be given effect to, in addition to an order of maintenance awarded under Section 125 of the Cr.P.C., or any other law in force.Under sub-section (6) of Section 20, the Magistrate may direct the employer or debtor of the respondent, to directly pay the aggrieved person, or deposit with the court a portion of the wages or salaries or debt due to or accrued to the credit of the respondent, which amount may be adjusted towards the monetary relief payable by the respondent.Section 22 provides that the Magistrate may pass an order directing the respondent to pay compensation and damages for the injuries, including mental torture and emotional distress, caused by the acts ofdomestic violenceperpetrated by the respondent.Section 26 of the D.V. Act provides that any relief available under Sections 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22 may also be sought in any legal proceeding before a Civil Court, Family Court or Criminal Court.Section 36 provides that the D.V. Act shall be in addition to, and not in derogation of the provisions of any other law for the time being in force. Analysis of the issues (a)Issue of overlapping jurisdiction The Court noticed that while it is true that a party is not precluded from approaching the Court under one or more enactments, since the nature and purpose of the relief under each Act is distinct and independent, it is equally true that the simultaneous operation of these Acts, would lead to multiplicity of proceedings and conflicting orders. This process requires to be streamlined, so that the respondent/husband is not obligated to comply with successive orders of maintenance passed under different enactments. “It is well settled that a wife can make a claim for maintenance under different statutes. For instance, there is no bar to seek maintenance both under the D.V. Act and Section 125 of the Cr.P.C., or under H.M.A. It would, however, be inequitable to direct the husband to pay maintenance under each of the proceedings, independent of the relief granted in a previous proceeding.” hence, that in a subsequent maintenance proceeding, the applicant shall disclose the previous maintenance proceeding, and the orders passed therein, so that the Court would take into consideration the maintenance already awarded in the previous proceeding, and grant an adjustment or set-off of the said amount. \"Note and Disclaimer:-The opinion given here is generic in nature and offered without considering the case on merit and any material facts, hence, if you are proceeding with divorce, or any legal action against your husband and in-laws, you should again consult a lawyer with all the material facts on the case, prior proceeding ahead in the legal battle.Thank you and best wishes for your future wellbeing, hope you resolve your problems at the earliest and come out of all the miseries/ painful life and live happily ever after.Regards,Vivek Bhai PatelAdvocate, New Delhi26 AnswersTalk to Advocate Vivek Bhai Patel"

Every institution has its own process of changing names, and the name correction process often entails the use of a properly filled-out name correction form, identity proof reflecting the new name, and, in some cases, a copy of the new Aadhar card.However, this might take much time; though, it ensures consistency concerning competitors’ actions and legal issues.

    "question": "Redevelopment project RERA MOFA area calculation",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In redevelopment projects, it's crucial to understand the difference between the MOFA (Maharashtra Ownership Flats Act) area and the RERA (Real Estate Regulatory Authority) area, as they can lead to confusion due to differing calculation methods. Here’s a breakdown:Initial Offer:600 sq ft MOFA: eligible area based on your current property.550 sq ft MOFA: Initially offered by the developer.575 sq ft RERA: Initially offered by the developer.Surrender Area: 50 sq ft, for which the developer pays at the relevant rate.Revised Offer:600 sq ft MOFA: Now offered by the developer.635 sq ft RERA: Now offered by the developer, including common areas.45 sq ft balcony: Added conditionally for some floors.Calculation:Previous Calculation: 600 (existing) - 600 (offered) + 45 (balcony) = 45 sq ft additional purchase.Current Calculation: 635 (offered) - 600 (existing) + 45 (balcony) = 75 sq ft additional purchase.Key Points:1. MOFA vs. RERA: Ensure clarity on what areas are included in the RERA area. RERA often includes common areas and balconies, which are not part of MOFA.2. Guidelines: MOFA mandates clear disclosure of carpet area, and any reduction must be compensated. RERA requires transparent communication of the carpet area and additional spaces.3. Balcony Condition: Ensure the conditional addition of the balcony is clearly agreed upon. If it feels forced or unfair, negotiate with the developer.4. Legal Advice: Consult a property lawyer familiar with MOFA and RERA regulations to review the offer and ensure compliance with legal standards.Additionally, seek advice from a property lawyer to ensure your interests are protected during negotiations.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "FSI includes balconies, but if the builder has not already provided them initially, then the balcony is no longer recognised as a part of the redevelopment process.The concept of ‘Fungible FSI’ was amended in the new Development Control Regulations (DCR) in 2012, where the areas, such as balconies, flower beds, terraces and niches, were included under the FSI. To compensate the builders for the loss, the government made a provision for additional built-up space in lieu of a premium.The premium levied is a percentage of the Ready Reckoner Rate (RRR) prevalent in an area. For instance, residential properties attract 60 percent of the RRR as a fungible FSI fee. Similarly, the fees for industrial and commercial developments are 80 percent and 100 percent of RRR, respectively. Further, developers can avail around 25 percent more parking space over the DCR limit free of cost, which is a respite to builders and home buyers.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Redevelopment project RERA MOFA area calculation",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In redevelopment projects, it's crucial to understand the difference between the MOFA (Maharashtra Ownership Flats Act) area and the RERA (Real Estate Regulatory Authority) area, as they can lead to confusion due to differing calculation methods. Here’s a breakdown:Initial Offer:600 sq ft MOFA: eligible area based on your current property.550 sq ft MOFA: Initially offered by the developer.575 sq ft RERA: Initially offered by the developer.Surrender Area: 50 sq ft, for which the developer pays at the relevant rate.Revised Offer:600 sq ft MOFA: Now offered by the developer.635 sq ft RERA: Now offered by the developer, including common areas.45 sq ft balcony: Added conditionally for some floors.Calculation:Previous Calculation: 600 (existing) - 600 (offered) + 45 (balcony) = 45 sq ft additional purchase.Current Calculation: 635 (offered) - 600 (existing) + 45 (balcony) = 75 sq ft additional purchase.Key Points:1. MOFA vs. RERA: Ensure clarity on what areas are included in the RERA area. RERA often includes common areas and balconies, which are not part of MOFA.2. Guidelines: MOFA mandates clear disclosure of carpet area, and any reduction must be compensated. RERA requires transparent communication of the carpet area and additional spaces.3. Balcony Condition: Ensure the conditional addition of the balcony is clearly agreed upon. If it feels forced or unfair, negotiate with the developer.4. Legal Advice: Consult a property lawyer familiar with MOFA and RERA regulations to review the offer and ensure compliance with legal standards.Additionally, seek advice from a property lawyer to ensure your interests are protected during negotiations.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Firstly, seek clarification on whether the additional area should be considered MOFA or RERA, as this distinction impacts calculations and costs. Additionally, understand the method used to calculate the change in area and ensure it aligns with your rights under the existing legal framework.Consider the balance between the developer's push for uniformity among tenants seeking extra area and your individual rights. Review the Developer Agreement registered under RERA provisions to ascertain your entitlements and obligations.

    "answer": "FSI includes balconies, but if the builder has not already provided them initially, then the balcony is no longer recognised as a part of the redevelopment process.The concept of ‘Fungible FSI’ was amended in the new Development Control Regulations (DCR) in 2012, where the areas, such as balconies, flower beds, terraces and niches, were included under the FSI. To compensate the builders for the loss, the government made a provision for additional built-up space in lieu of a premium.The premium levied is a percentage of the Ready Reckoner Rate (RRR) prevalent in an area. For instance, residential properties attract 60 percent of the RRR as a fungible FSI fee. Similarly, the fees for industrial and commercial developments are 80 percent and 100 percent of RRR, respectively. Further, developers can avail around 25 percent more parking space over the DCR limit free of cost, which is a respite to builders and home buyers.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Land Ownership:In India, ownership of land generally extends to anything permanently attached to it, including wells. Since you own the property where the well is located, it's likely that you have the legal right to control its use.Easement Rights:However, there are situations where your neighbor could claim an easement right to the well. This might happen if they have been using the well openly and continuously for a certain period (usually 20 years) without your objection.Local Laws:State-specific laws and local customs might also play a role in determining water rights and usage.Gather Evidence:Collect any documentation that supports your ownership of the well, such as land records, tax receipts, maintenance bills, or any agreements related to the well.Witnesses:If possible, identify witnesses who can testify to your exclusive use and maintenance of the well over the past 12 years.Mediation (Optional):Before escalating the legal battle, you could try mediation as a way to resolve the dispute amicably. A neutral third party can help facilitate a conversation and find a mutually agreeable solutionInjunction:You can seek a court injunction to restrain your neighbor from using the well until the matter is resolved.Declaration:You can file a lawsuit for a declaration from the court confirming your exclusive right to the well.Damages:If you have suffered financial losses due to your neighbor's actions, you may be able to claim compensation.Romesh Pratap SinghAdvocate, Gwalior23 AnswersTalk to Advocate Romesh Pratap Singh"

    "question": "Redevelopment project RERA MOFA area calculation",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In redevelopment projects, it's crucial to understand the difference between the MOFA (Maharashtra Ownership Flats Act) area and the RERA (Real Estate Regulatory Authority) area, as they can lead to confusion due to differing calculation methods. Here’s a breakdown:Initial Offer:600 sq ft MOFA: eligible area based on your current property.550 sq ft MOFA: Initially offered by the developer.575 sq ft RERA: Initially offered by the developer.Surrender Area: 50 sq ft, for which the developer pays at the relevant rate.Revised Offer:600 sq ft MOFA: Now offered by the developer.635 sq ft RERA: Now offered by the developer, including common areas.45 sq ft balcony: Added conditionally for some floors.Calculation:Previous Calculation: 600 (existing) - 600 (offered) + 45 (balcony) = 45 sq ft additional purchase.Current Calculation: 635 (offered) - 600 (existing) + 45 (balcony) = 75 sq ft additional purchase.Key Points:1. MOFA vs. RERA: Ensure clarity on what areas are included in the RERA area. RERA often includes common areas and balconies, which are not part of MOFA.2. Guidelines: MOFA mandates clear disclosure of carpet area, and any reduction must be compensated. RERA requires transparent communication of the carpet area and additional spaces.3. Balcony Condition: Ensure the conditional addition of the balcony is clearly agreed upon. If it feels forced or unfair, negotiate with the developer.4. Legal Advice: Consult a property lawyer familiar with MOFA and RERA regulations to review the offer and ensure compliance with legal standards.Additionally, seek advice from a property lawyer to ensure your interests are protected during negotiations.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Firstly, seek clarification on whether the additional area should be considered MOFA or RERA, as this distinction impacts calculations and costs. Additionally, understand the method used to calculate the change in area and ensure it aligns with your rights under the existing legal framework.Consider the balance between the developer's push for uniformity among tenants seeking extra area and your individual rights. Review the Developer Agreement registered under RERA provisions to ascertain your entitlements and obligations.

    "answer": "FSI includes balconies, but if the builder has not already provided them initially, then the balcony is no longer recognised as a part of the redevelopment process.The concept of ‘Fungible FSI’ was amended in the new Development Control Regulations (DCR) in 2012, where the areas, such as balconies, flower beds, terraces and niches, were included under the FSI. To compensate the builders for the loss, the government made a provision for additional built-up space in lieu of a premium.The premium levied is a percentage of the Ready Reckoner Rate (RRR) prevalent in an area. For instance, residential properties attract 60 percent of the RRR as a fungible FSI fee. Similarly, the fees for industrial and commercial developments are 80 percent and 100 percent of RRR, respectively. Further, developers can avail around 25 percent more parking space over the DCR limit free of cost, which is a respite to builders and home buyers.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

If no favorable reply is given, then you may initiate partition suit as you have a will from your grand mother . Legal notice can be issued through any lawyer which is feasible to your location as you need to sign it and process it.Usually 90% cases get resolved through legal notices as legal notice is a legal warning issued through a lawyer to settle dispute out of court, failing which,  case can be registered in court.

However, here are some points to consider:School Policy: Check the policy of the school or read the agreement signed when enrolling the child. Depending on the terms and conditions of the agreement, it may have clauses related to the fee payment and other terms on which T. C. will be issued.Negotiation: However, there are situations when the policy may be vague or something you consider unfair might be stated in it. There is usually an option to discuss the policy with the management of the school, stating your position and that your son did not attend any classes.Legal Rights: Indian law is quite fair to those who seek education; it requires that educational institutions be reasonable. If you think that the school is violating the law, you might consult an advocate or go to the office of education in your area for assistance.Documentation: Ensure that you maintain any correspondence with the school and/or any other supporting documentation for your request or claim (example: absence of your son during the term).Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "NRI concealed about his 'NRI status\" during the sale of property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1) As regards to the TDS Rs percentage amount would be higher for NRI therefore, the exact Rbs amount should be determined. For the properties sold by the NRIs, the TDS has been reportedly prevalent at 20% of the sale value; however, it can reach up to 30% if the value is undervalued intentionally. As for the TDS amount, the exact percentage depends on the selling price and you should consult a tax professional/ CA for the correct TDS percentage. It is advised that even if the seller provides the required documentation stating that he is declaring a capital loss, as the buyer, it becomes the buyer’s responsibility to deduct and deposit the TDS as required. Later on the seller is in a position to demand refund for any given product in case the need arises. If you have deducted and deposited the TDS, you can try to get the TDS certificate (Form 16A) either by checking with the Income Tax Department using your TAN (Tax Deduction and Collection Account Number) or intimation of such deposit.To pressurize the NRI into agreeing to pay the TDS, legal notice through an attorney should be given to the NRI to compel him/her to pay the TDS. This notice should indicate thegist of the fraud and insist on the payment of the outstanding taxes raised on the fraudster with any interests where applicable. The summons and threats of being locked out may force the seller to bring further issues to settlement to prevent complicating the legal process.3) The period within which TDS is required to be deposited of property transactions varies generally 30 days from the end of the month for which TDS has been deducted. In any case, you have not deducted TDS and thus you should immediately resolve this in order to refrain from future penalties and interests. It further does not become a legal offence if one continues to live in the house, once legal proceedings have been initiated against the NRI. However, relevant importance should be given to tax compliance as any disputing issue may arise between the organization and the Income Tax Department.4) While the embassy or consulate won't directly intervene in such matters, they could provide steering on the felony framework and obligations of NRIs. You can also are trying to find help from criminal professionals who focus on NRI belongings transactions and tax issues.5) The first step legally would be to discuss with a belongings lawyer or a tax consultant skilled in NRI transactions. They assist you to draft and ship a prison word to the NRI supplier, disturbing the TDS payment and necessary documentation. If the seller does now not comply, you could record a grievance with the local police for fraud and cheating, and simultaneously, provoke prison complaints in a civil court docket to recover the TDS amount and any related penalties. Keep all transaction records, communications, and criminal notices properly-documented to aid your case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,1.Private Complaint under Section 200 CrPC:The answer to this is yes, but a private complaint will be under Section 200 CrPC before the magistrate. It enables you to straightaway depone or narrate your side and evidence against top management involving grave offences that were not included in the FIR, such as IPC 467, 420, and 120B offences. The magistrate can issue summons to process the accused in accordance with the law of the complaint.2.Including Offences in the Prayer: Namely, the police will be authorised by the magistrate required by you in your private complaint to include omitted offences under IPC 467, 420, and 120B. You have to prove that, for mens rea purposes, those concerned in the top management of the company were involved in these serious offences, at the very least on the balance of probabilities.3.Requesting ED Investigation:Yes you may also pray in your prayer to the magistrate to direct the enforcement directorate ed, pursuant to the money laundering offences under the PMLA. Offer initial credible substantiation that money laundering offences have been committed so as to warrant an ED investigation to help in the recovery of the proceeds of the crimes.4.Approaching Sessions Court:In general, the section 200 CrPC complaints are lodged with a magistrate from private parties. However, because of the gravity of the mentioned offences (IPC 120B, 467, and the PMLA), you can ask the magistrate to transfer the case to the higher court if necessary, but first, the complaint has to be lodged before a magistrate, who then will decide whether to continue the trial at a lower court or transfer the case to a superior court.These steps can assist in the prevention of serious offences and the involvement of top management in investigations.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "BBMP notice",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. If your construction went overboard by an extra 1.5 feet, it can have different consequences. If the extra space was taken from site no. 51 or site no. 49, it means you've encroached on someone else's property. This can lead to legal issues, like potential disputes with the neighbouring property owners and possible penalties imposed by BBMP.2. Yes, BBMP has the authority to order the demolition of any unauthorised construction or encroachment. If it's determined that the additional 1.5 feet were illegally added, BBMP may send you a notice to remove the encroachment. That could involve tearing down the encroached part.3. In such cases, the court usually orders the property to be restored to its original boundaries according to the legal records. If the court finds that there has been an encroachment, it can order you to clear the encroached area and modify or demolish the structure to comply with the legal property boundaries.4. As a precaution, it's a good idea to hire a legal professional who can represent your interests and negotiate with BBMP and the court. Get a detailed survey done on your property to figure out the exact extent of the encroachment. If the encroachment is confirmed, you might have to vacate the encroached portion, which could mean partially tearing down the building.5. It's not clear why site no. 51 didn't check the dimensions when purchasing. It could be due to oversight or not verifying properly. In your case, it was definitely a mistake to not verify the exact dimensions before buying. To avoid such problems in the future, always conduct a thorough survey and verify the property boundaries against official records before finalising any purchase.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "School transfer certificate not issuing",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Generally, every school has its own rules and norms on fee charges and T.C. issues. However, here are some points to consider:School Policy: Check the policy of the school or read the agreement signed when enrolling the child. Depending on the terms and conditions of the agreement, it may have clauses related to the fee payment and other terms on which T. C. will be issued.Negotiation: However, there are situations when the policy may be vague or something you consider unfair might be stated in it. There is usually an option to discuss the policy with the management of the school, stating your position and that your son did not attend any classes.Legal Rights: Indian law is quite fair to those who seek education; it requires that educational institutions be reasonable. If you think that the school is violating the law, you might consult an advocate or go to the office of education in your area for assistance.Documentation: Ensure that you maintain any correspondence with the school and/or any other supporting documentation for your request or claim (example: absence of your son during the term).Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Competitor published article with fake information about us",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You appear to have a strong case against your competitor for defamation and unfair trade practices, which have potentially caused significant harm to your business. In India, defamation laws provide recourse for individuals and businesses whose reputation has been unjustly harmed by false statements. Given that the competitor's article contains false information about your services, which is demonstrably incorrect based on your website content and has likely impacted your business, you can take legal action.First, acquire all applicable proof. This consists of the thing in question, screenshots of your website showing the suitable facts, and any facts that may help quantify the economic impact, such as records of potential customers lost or a decrease in enterprise inquiries corresponding with the article's booklet. Documenting how the competitor's false claims have directly harmed your commercial enterprise is important.Consult with a prison professional focusing on commercial enterprise regulation and defamation. They can offer unique advice tailored in your state of affairs and help you decide the first-class direction of movement. Typically, the initial step might involve sending a cease-and-desist letter on your competitor, demanding that they remove the object and issue a retraction and public apology. This letter can also outline your purpose in trying to find damages in the event that they do not comply.If the competitor does not respond satisfactorily to the end-and-desist letter, you may proceed with submitting a lawsuit. You can claim compensation for the economic losses incurred due to the defamatory statements, in addition to are trying to find damages for the damage for your popularity. The legal method will involve offering your evidence and demonstrating the impact of the false records on your business.Additionally, you can explore treatments underneath the Competition Act, 2002, which addresses anti-competitive practices together with false and misleading advertising which could harm competition. Filing a grievance with the Competition Commission of India (CCI) is probably another avenue to seek redress.Given the complexity of your capability and the desire to precisely quantify your losses, an in-depth consultation with your attorney will be important. They can guide you through the legal tactics and help make sure that you have an excellent understanding of securities.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,1.Private Complaint under Section 200 CrPC:The answer to this is yes, but a private complaint will be under Section 200 CrPC before the magistrate. It enables you to straightaway depone or narrate your side and evidence against top management involving grave offences that were not included in the FIR, such as IPC 467, 420, and 120B offences. The magistrate can issue summons to process the accused in accordance with the law of the complaint.2.Including Offences in the Prayer: Namely, the police will be authorised by the magistrate required by you in your private complaint to include omitted offences under IPC 467, 420, and 120B. You have to prove that, for mens rea purposes, those concerned in the top management of the company were involved in these serious offences, at the very least on the balance of probabilities.3.Requesting ED Investigation:Yes you may also pray in your prayer to the magistrate to direct the enforcement directorate ed, pursuant to the money laundering offences under the PMLA. Offer initial credible substantiation that money laundering offences have been committed so as to warrant an ED investigation to help in the recovery of the proceeds of the crimes.4.Approaching Sessions Court:In general, the section 200 CrPC complaints are lodged with a magistrate from private parties. However, because of the gravity of the mentioned offences (IPC 120B, 467, and the PMLA), you can ask the magistrate to transfer the case to the higher court if necessary, but first, the complaint has to be lodged before a magistrate, who then will decide whether to continue the trial at a lower court or transfer the case to a superior court.These steps can assist in the prevention of serious offences and the involvement of top management in investigations.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Divorce settlement - Property transfer",
    "answer": "Dear Client,To transfer the property in Hyderabad to your name as part of the divorce settlement while both of you reside in the US and your wife cannot travel, follow these steps:Notarized Power of Attorney (POA):Your wife can engage in the preparation of a power of attorney in your favour, which acts as an instrument in handling property transfers. Notably, a notary public in the US must authenticate this POA. To avoid this, it is recommended that, in drafting the POA, it include an express reference to the power to convey the property in your name.Apostille or Consular Attestation:Since the notarized POA was issued in the United States of America, it has to get apostilled by the respective authorities. As an alternative, you may request the Indian Consulate or Embassy in the US to attest. These procedures keep the POA legal in India and uphold its authority.Registration in India:Once you have the apostilled or consular-attested POA, file it and send it to India. POA must be registered through the sub-register in Hyderabad since the property is located there, and the validity of this document must be approved. This step is essential to guaranteeing that for the POA to be legal and effective in India, it has to meet a variety of certain legal requirements.Transfer of Property:Finally, to transfer the property from the name of the wife to your own name, both of you (or your representative residing in India) can execute the transfer deed, sale deed, or gift deed based on the adjudicated POA. They must be registered with the Sub-Registrar Office of the respective region or country where the property is held.Mutation of Property Records:Assuming the transfer deed has been registered, apply for mutation of property records in the municipal and revenue departments for a change of ownership. This is relevant to ensure that the records are amended to reflect the current situation and enable the upcoming sale of the house.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "BBMP notice",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. If your construction went overboard by an extra 1.5 feet, it can have different consequences. If the extra space was taken from site no. 51 or site no. 49, it means you've encroached on someone else's property. This can lead to legal issues, like potential disputes with the neighbouring property owners and possible penalties imposed by BBMP.2. Yes, BBMP has the authority to order the demolition of any unauthorised construction or encroachment. If it's determined that the additional 1.5 feet were illegally added, BBMP may send you a notice to remove the encroachment. That could involve tearing down the encroached part.3. In such cases, the court usually orders the property to be restored to its original boundaries according to the legal records. If the court finds that there has been an encroachment, it can order you to clear the encroached area and modify or demolish the structure to comply with the legal property boundaries.4. As a precaution, it's a good idea to hire a legal professional who can represent your interests and negotiate with BBMP and the court. Get a detailed survey done on your property to figure out the exact extent of the encroachment. If the encroachment is confirmed, you might have to vacate the encroached portion, which could mean partially tearing down the building.5. It's not clear why site no. 51 didn't check the dimensions when purchasing. It could be due to oversight or not verifying properly. In your case, it was definitely a mistake to not verify the exact dimensions before buying. To avoid such problems in the future, always conduct a thorough survey and verify the property boundaries against official records before finalising any purchase.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Air India, IndiGo, and other notable airlines have been given a show-cause notice by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) for violating rules pertaining to providing amenities to passengers in the event of rejected boarding, flight cancellation, and flight delay. The notice emphasises how crucial it is for travellers to understand their legal rights in these circumstances.When an airline declines to carry a passenger who has arrived for boarding within the allotted time, the passenger has the right to know about denied boarding. It is crucial to remember that the airline has the right to prohibit boarding if they have valid reasons, such as concerns about security, health, or safety, or insufficient travel documentation. Overbooking flights by airlines is legal and may lead to rejected boarding. Airlines are required to request volunteers to give up their seats in such situations.The airline is required by DGCA guidelines to provide you with assistance such as meals, lodging, and transportation, as well as compensation and a confirmed seat on a another aircraft if you are forcibly denied boarding.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Supreme Court: In  a case where a citizen, who suffers from a writer’s cramp, was denied a scribe in the civil services’ examination, the 3-judge bench of Dr. DY Chandrachud*, Indira Banerjee and Sanjiv Khanna, JJ has held that writer’s cramp Forms part of Entry IV of the Schedule to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act 2016) and“To deny the facility of a scribe in a situation such as the present would negate the valuable rights and entitlements which are recognised by the RPwD Act 2016.”Part III of our Constitution does not explicitly include persons with disabilities within its protective fold. However, much like their able-bodied counterparts, the golden triangle of Articles 14, 19 and 21 applies with full force and vigour to the disabled. The RPwD Act 2016 seeks to operationalize and give concrete shape to the promise of full and equal citizenship held out by the Constitution to the disabled and to execute its ethos of inclusion and acceptance.”Section 3 casts an affirmative obligation on the government to ensure that persons with disabilities enjoy (i) the right to equality; (ii) a life with dignity; and (iii) respect for their integrity equally with others. By recognizing a statutory right and entitlement on the part of persons who are disabled, Section 3 seeks to implement and facilitate the fulfillment of the constitutional rights of persons with disabilities.You can give a representation based on supreme court judgmentT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Suffering from chronic neurological disorder and facing harassment at workplace",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Legally, you have several options to seek redress and accommodations. The Supreme Court's judgement in Vikash Kumar v. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) is indeed relevant to your situation. Here’s a detailed explanation:Facts and Decisions in Vikash Kumar v. UPSCIn Vikash Kumar v. UPSC (2021), the petitioner suffered from a similar neurological condition that impaired his writing ability. He requested reasonable accommodations to take a civil service examination, including the provision of a scribe. The UPSC rejected his request, prompting him to challenge their decision.The Supreme Court ruled in favour of Vikash Kumar, emphasising the following key points:1.Rights of Persons with Disabilities:The Court underscored the rights of individuals with disabilities to reasonable accommodations under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPWD Act). This Act mandates non-discrimination and provides for necessary accommodations to enable persons with disabilities to perform their roles effectively.2.Definition of Disability: The Court broadened the interpretation of “disability” to include conditions like writer's cramp, stressing that the impairment need not be visible or permanent as long as it hampers the individual’s ability to perform daily activities.3.Obligation of Employers:The Court held that employers, including public sector entities, have a duty to provide reasonable accommodations to employees with disabilities. This includes reassignment to suitable positions where the disability would not impede job performance.Legal Options and Steps for Your Case1. Request Reasonable Accommodations in Writing:Submit a formal, written request to your higher authorities and HR department, outlining your condition, its impact on your job performance, and the specific accommodations you are seeking. Reference is made to the RPWD Act and the Supreme Court judgement in Vikash Kumar v. UPSC.2. Consult with medical professionals:Obtain detailed medical documentation from your neurologist or other healthcare providers. These documents should describe your condition, its impact on your ability to write, and recommended accommodations.3. File a grievance:If your initial requests are ignored or denied, file a formal grievance through your bank’s internal grievance redressal mechanism. Make sure to document all instances of harassment and lack of accommodation.4. Approach the Equal Opportunity Cell (if available):Many public sector organisations have an Equal Opportunity Cell or a similar body responsible for addressing issues related to discrimination and accommodations for employees with disabilities. Approach this body with your complaint.5. Legal Action:If internal remedies fail, you can file a complaint with the Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities (CCPD) or the State Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities. These bodies have the authority to investigate and take action on complaints of non-compliance with the RPWD Act.You can also consider filing a writ petition in the High Court under Article 226 of theIndian Constitution, seeking a directive for your employer to provide reasonable accommodations and to stop the harassment.Relevant Case LawIn addition to Vikash Kumar v. UPSC, consider referencing these cases:Jeeja Ghosh & Anotherv.Union of India: This case reinforced the rights of persons with disabilities to equal treatment and accommodations.Bhavya Nainv.University of Delhi highlighted the need for reasonable accommodations in educational and employment settings for persons with disabilities.Your condition qualifies as a disability under the RPWD Act, and your employer is legally obligated to provide reasonable accommodations. The Supreme Court’s ruling in Vikash Kumar v. UPSC supports your case, emphasising the duty of employers to accommodate employees with disabilities. You have the right to request reassignment or other accommodations and to seek redress through internal grievance mechanisms or legal channels if necessary.Seek legal counsel to assist with drafting formal requests and potential legal actions. Your case highlights the need for compliance with disability rights legislation and the importance of creating an inclusive work environment.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Suffering from chronic neurological disorder and facing harassment at workplace",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The facts of the case:Vikash Kumar is the petitioner who gave the Civil Services Examination as organised by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). Specifically, he had the particularity of a certain type of learning disability that made him write significantly slowly.Due to his disability, Vikash Kumar had to write to the school principal, asking for permission for a scribe for the examination. However, his request was rejected by the UPSC on the basis that he failed to fulfil the regulatory requirements inevitably in regard to the availability of a scribe.Several pages offer an account of Vikash Kumar, who sought to appeal the UPSC refusal, arguing that his rights under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 had been violated. He argued that this piece of legislation required accommodations for individuals with disabilities to be reasonable to make necessary adjustments to prevent discrimination.High Court's Decision:The Honourable High Court of India endorsed the directives of the UPSC and dismissed the appeal of Vikash Kumar on the grounds that he did not fall under the criteria for scribe under the prevailing conditions and norms. Vikash Kumar appealed to S.C. of India; ultimately, the Honourable Apex Court took up the matter for consideration.Supreme Court's Decision:Some of the changes that were made included the reevaluation of the guidelines and criteria by the Supreme Court for providing scribes to persons with disabilities to do their writing for them with the intention of having a more inclusive approach. The Court underlined another key principle outlined in the RPwD Act, 2016, known as reasonable accommodation, which implies that it is necessary for the implementation of appropriate modifications and adjustments in order to ensure persons with disabilities exercise their rights.The judgement elucidated that the RPwD Act entitled Vikash Kumar to certain rights, including a scribe, if he were to request them, and Oudh had arbitrarily denied him that right. The Court added that the act requires one to be given an equal chance with no discrimination and to implement the act of reasonable accommodation as part of the mandate.Hence, the SC recommended that the UPSC reconsider its guidelines and provide candidature appropriate damages for disability that the UPSC deprives of disabled candidates by not letting them have a scribe and making it a criteria for examination so that their rights are being protected and they can also write their examinations in the best way possible.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,If you have provided representation along with a letter from NIMHANS Bengaluru about your condition when requesting reasonable accommodation from your branch manager but none has been responded to by the HR Department, it is wise to keep documentation of such communications. If a reasonable period has passed with no work being done or little progress is made for the student and myself,. Follow up with HR through a second email or letter if you do not receive a response to your initial message of introducing yourself. This should be done gently and diplomatically in an effort to remind them of your previous request. Emphasise its urgency. Enclose photocopies of previous communications along with the one received from NIMHANS.Furthermore, continue to remind the officer’s association of the absence of a reply from HR and enquire them to further support and fight for your rights. If you continue to be overwhelmed by your struggle, you should report the issue to the higher authorities of your organisation. Select a position at a higher level, such as senior HR manager or director. Obviously, describe actions that were taken beforehand that can contribute to the solution of the problem. Emphasise that you have received little or no response, especially with newer social media platforms.Correlatively, seek any legal advice that you would be in a position to take against any form of discrimination concerning medical conditions in the workplace with regard to reasonable accommodation. Although the study found that laws and regulations were weak and violated in food production, there is a need for research on the laws and regulations of different jurisdictions. For specific advice on this matter, it is advised to seek services from an employment lawyer.

    "answer": "Dear Client,You appear to have a strong case against your competitor for defamation and unfair trade practices, which have potentially caused significant harm to your business. In India, defamation laws provide recourse for individuals and businesses whose reputation has been unjustly harmed by false statements. Given that the competitor's article contains false information about your services, which is demonstrably incorrect based on your website content and has likely impacted your business, you can take legal action.First, acquire all applicable proof. This consists of the thing in question, screenshots of your website showing the suitable facts, and any facts that may help quantify the economic impact, such as records of potential customers lost or a decrease in enterprise inquiries corresponding with the article's booklet. Documenting how the competitor's false claims have directly harmed your commercial enterprise is important.Consult with a prison professional focusing on commercial enterprise regulation and defamation. They can offer unique advice tailored in your state of affairs and help you decide the first-class direction of movement. Typically, the initial step might involve sending a cease-and-desist letter on your competitor, demanding that they remove the object and issue a retraction and public apology. This letter can also outline your purpose in trying to find damages in the event that they do not comply.If the competitor does not respond satisfactorily to the end-and-desist letter, you may proceed with submitting a lawsuit. You can claim compensation for the economic losses incurred due to the defamatory statements, in addition to are trying to find damages for the damage for your popularity. The legal method will involve offering your evidence and demonstrating the impact of the false records on your business.Additionally, you can explore treatments underneath the Competition Act, 2002, which addresses anti-competitive practices together with false and misleading advertising which could harm competition. Filing a grievance with the Competition Commission of India (CCI) is probably another avenue to seek redress.Given the complexity of your capability and the desire to precisely quantify your losses, an in-depth consultation with your attorney will be important. They can guide you through the legal tactics and help make sure that you have an excellent understanding of securities.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Father share on the deceased son property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. Under Hindu law, a father isn't considered a Class I legal heir when it comes to his deceased son's property. According to the law, only the wife, children, and mother are classified as Class I heirs. However, if Durai was included in the legal heir certificate and the patta (title) was transferred to his name alongside the other legal heirs, it suggests that Durai was recognised as a legal heir under specific circumstances. In the event that Durai's share of the property was legally recognised and he signed the lease deed, his portion would indeed become part of Durai's estate upon his death and would be distributed among his legal heirs, such as his wife and children.2. Now, if Durai's share was mistakenly considered his own personal property and distributed based on that assumption, then the release deed stating Poon's share as 1/4 instead of 1/5 would be inaccurate. Poon's actual share should be reassessed as 1/5 of Durai's inherited portion. This means that the release deed could potentially be invalid or require correction in order to accurately reflect the distribution of shares.3. According to Hindu law, a father isn't classified as a Class I legal heir to his deceased son's estate. However, the fact that Durai was included in the legal heir certificate and the subsequent actions, such as the transfer of the title and the signing of the lease deed, suggest that the legal procedures might not have strictly adhered to the legal heir classifications. This could be due to administrative or familial arrangements that were in place at that time. Legally speaking, Durai shouldn't have been included as a legal heir, but since he was, the transfer of the title and the lease deed were carried out with his involvement. It would be advisable to seek rectification or legal clarification in order to ensure compliance with theHindu Succession Act.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Meena can argue on following points:Meena could assert that Durai contributed financially towards acquiring the property in 1987, even if there isn't solid evidence presently available. She might argue on circumstantial evidence like family testimonies or documents indirectly suggesting Durai's involvement.Another point she could emphasize is the inclusion of Durai's name in the legal heir certificate following Ganesh's demise in 1989, indicating acknowledgment of Durai's stake in the property.Additionally, Meena could point out that Ganesh's family didn't oppose the transfer of the property's name in the patta document in 2009, implying recognition of Durai's rightful ownership.She could also argue that Durai's signature on the lease deed for the petrol pump property in 2009 suggests his acknowledged interest in ownership by the family.As for challenging the transfer of the patta name, Meena would need to consider the limitation period based on the relevant jurisdiction's laws, seeking legal counsel for clarification.Regarding the validity of the property sale deed signed by Ganeshan's wife without Ganeshan's mother's signature, this hinges on jurisdictional laws and specific transaction circumstances. Depending on the situation, spousal consent might be required for property transactions, necessitating legal examination of applicable laws.Thank you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,To transfer the property in Hyderabad to your name as part of the divorce settlement while both of you reside in the US and your wife cannot travel, follow these steps:Notarized Power of Attorney (POA):Your wife can engage in the preparation of a power of attorney in your favour, which acts as an instrument in handling property transfers. Notably, a notary public in the US must authenticate this POA. To avoid this, it is recommended that, in drafting the POA, it include an express reference to the power to convey the property in your name.Apostille or Consular Attestation:Since the notarized POA was issued in the United States of America, it has to get apostilled by the respective authorities. As an alternative, you may request the Indian Consulate or Embassy in the US to attest. These procedures keep the POA legal in India and uphold its authority.Registration in India:Once you have the apostilled or consular-attested POA, file it and send it to India. POA must be registered through the sub-register in Hyderabad since the property is located there, and the validity of this document must be approved. This step is essential to guaranteeing that for the POA to be legal and effective in India, it has to meet a variety of certain legal requirements.Transfer of Property:Finally, to transfer the property from the name of the wife to your own name, both of you (or your representative residing in India) can execute the transfer deed, sale deed, or gift deed based on the adjudicated POA. They must be registered with the Sub-Registrar Office of the respective region or country where the property is held.Mutation of Property Records:Assuming the transfer deed has been registered, apply for mutation of property records in the municipal and revenue departments for a change of ownership.

    "question": "BBMP notice",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. If your construction went overboard by an extra 1.5 feet, it can have different consequences. If the extra space was taken from site no. 51 or site no. 49, it means you've encroached on someone else's property. This can lead to legal issues, like potential disputes with the neighbouring property owners and possible penalties imposed by BBMP.2. Yes, BBMP has the authority to order the demolition of any unauthorised construction or encroachment. If it's determined that the additional 1.5 feet were illegally added, BBMP may send you a notice to remove the encroachment. That could involve tearing down the encroached part.3. In such cases, the court usually orders the property to be restored to its original boundaries according to the legal records. If the court finds that there has been an encroachment, it can order you to clear the encroached area and modify or demolish the structure to comply with the legal property boundaries.4. As a precaution, it's a good idea to hire a legal professional who can represent your interests and negotiate with BBMP and the court. Get a detailed survey done on your property to figure out the exact extent of the encroachment. If the encroachment is confirmed, you might have to vacate the encroached portion, which could mean partially tearing down the building.5. It's not clear why site no. 51 didn't check the dimensions when purchasing. It could be due to oversight or not verifying properly. In your case, it was definitely a mistake to not verify the exact dimensions before buying. To avoid such problems in the future, always conduct a thorough survey and verify the property boundaries against official records before finalising any purchase.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Father share on the deceased son property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. Under Hindu law, a father isn't considered a Class I legal heir when it comes to his deceased son's property. According to the law, only the wife, children, and mother are classified as Class I heirs. However, if Durai was included in the legal heir certificate and the patta (title) was transferred to his name alongside the other legal heirs, it suggests that Durai was recognised as a legal heir under specific circumstances. In the event that Durai's share of the property was legally recognised and he signed the lease deed, his portion would indeed become part of Durai's estate upon his death and would be distributed among his legal heirs, such as his wife and children.2. Now, if Durai's share was mistakenly considered his own personal property and distributed based on that assumption, then the release deed stating Poon's share as 1/4 instead of 1/5 would be inaccurate. Poon's actual share should be reassessed as 1/5 of Durai's inherited portion. This means that the release deed could potentially be invalid or require correction in order to accurately reflect the distribution of shares.3. According to Hindu law, a father isn't classified as a Class I legal heir to his deceased son's estate. However, the fact that Durai was included in the legal heir certificate and the subsequent actions, such as the transfer of the title and the signing of the lease deed, suggest that the legal procedures might not have strictly adhered to the legal heir classifications. This could be due to administrative or familial arrangements that were in place at that time. Legally speaking, Durai shouldn't have been included as a legal heir, but since he was, the transfer of the title and the lease deed were carried out with his involvement. It would be advisable to seek rectification or legal clarification in order to ensure compliance with theHindu Succession Act.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Meena can argue on following points:Meena could assert that Durai contributed financially towards acquiring the property in 1987, even if there isn't solid evidence presently available. She might argue on circumstantial evidence like family testimonies or documents indirectly suggesting Durai's involvement.Another point she could emphasize is the inclusion of Durai's name in the legal heir certificate following Ganesh's demise in 1989, indicating acknowledgment of Durai's stake in the property.Additionally, Meena could point out that Ganesh's family didn't oppose the transfer of the property's name in the patta document in 2009, implying recognition of Durai's rightful ownership.She could also argue that Durai's signature on the lease deed for the petrol pump property in 2009 suggests his acknowledged interest in ownership by the family.As for challenging the transfer of the patta name, Meena would need to consider the limitation period based on the relevant jurisdiction's laws, seeking legal counsel for clarification.Regarding the validity of the property sale deed signed by Ganeshan's wife without Ganeshan's mother's signature, this hinges on jurisdictional laws and specific transaction circumstances. Depending on the situation, spousal consent might be required for property transactions, necessitating legal examination of applicable laws.Thank you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "BBMP notice",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. If your construction went overboard by an extra 1.5 feet, it can have different consequences. If the extra space was taken from site no. 51 or site no. 49, it means you've encroached on someone else's property. This can lead to legal issues, like potential disputes with the neighbouring property owners and possible penalties imposed by BBMP.2. Yes, BBMP has the authority to order the demolition of any unauthorised construction or encroachment. If it's determined that the additional 1.5 feet were illegally added, BBMP may send you a notice to remove the encroachment. That could involve tearing down the encroached part.3. In such cases, the court usually orders the property to be restored to its original boundaries according to the legal records. If the court finds that there has been an encroachment, it can order you to clear the encroached area and modify or demolish the structure to comply with the legal property boundaries.4. As a precaution, it's a good idea to hire a legal professional who can represent your interests and negotiate with BBMP and the court. Get a detailed survey done on your property to figure out the exact extent of the encroachment. If the encroachment is confirmed, you might have to vacate the encroached portion, which could mean partially tearing down the building.5. It's not clear why site no. 51 didn't check the dimensions when purchasing. It could be due to oversight or not verifying properly. In your case, it was definitely a mistake to not verify the exact dimensions before buying. To avoid such problems in the future, always conduct a thorough survey and verify the property boundaries against official records before finalising any purchase.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Legally, you have several options to seek redress and accommodations. The Supreme Court's judgement in Vikash Kumar v. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) is indeed relevant to your situation. Here’s a detailed explanation:Facts and Decisions in Vikash Kumar v. UPSCIn Vikash Kumar v. UPSC (2021), the petitioner suffered from a similar neurological condition that impaired his writing ability. He requested reasonable accommodations to take a civil service examination, including the provision of a scribe. The UPSC rejected his request, prompting him to challenge their decision.The Supreme Court ruled in favour of Vikash Kumar, emphasising the following key points:1.Rights of Persons with Disabilities:The Court underscored the rights of individuals with disabilities to reasonable accommodations under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPWD Act). This Act mandates non-discrimination and provides for necessary accommodations to enable persons with disabilities to perform their roles effectively.2.Definition of Disability: The Court broadened the interpretation of “disability” to include conditions like writer's cramp, stressing that the impairment need not be visible or permanent as long as it hampers the individual’s ability to perform daily activities.3.Obligation of Employers:The Court held that employers, including public sector entities, have a duty to provide reasonable accommodations to employees with disabilities. This includes reassignment to suitable positions where the disability would not impede job performance.Legal Options and Steps for Your Case1. Request Reasonable Accommodations in Writing:Submit a formal, written request to your higher authorities and HR department, outlining your condition, its impact on your job performance, and the specific accommodations you are seeking. Reference is made to the RPWD Act and the Supreme Court judgement in Vikash Kumar v. UPSC.2. Consult with medical professionals:Obtain detailed medical documentation from your neurologist or other healthcare providers. These documents should describe your condition, its impact on your ability to write, and recommended accommodations.3. File a grievance:If your initial requests are ignored or denied, file a formal grievance through your bank’s internal grievance redressal mechanism. Make sure to document all instances of harassment and lack of accommodation.4. Approach the Equal Opportunity Cell (if available):Many public sector organisations have an Equal Opportunity Cell or a similar body responsible for addressing issues related to discrimination and accommodations for employees with disabilities. Approach this body with your complaint.5. Legal Action:If internal remedies fail, you can file a complaint with the Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities (CCPD) or the State Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities. These bodies have the authority to investigate and take action on complaints of non-compliance with the RPWD Act.You can also consider filing a writ petition in the High Court under Article 226 of theIndian Constitution, seeking a directive for your employer to provide reasonable accommodations and to stop the harassment.Relevant Case LawIn addition to Vikash Kumar v. UPSC, consider referencing these cases:Jeeja Ghosh & Anotherv.Union of India: This case reinforced the rights of persons with disabilities to equal treatment and accommodations.Bhavya Nainv.University of Delhi highlighted the need for reasonable accommodations in educational and employment settings for persons with disabilities.Your condition qualifies as a disability under the RPWD Act, and your employer is legally obligated to provide reasonable accommodations. The Supreme Court’s ruling in Vikash Kumar v. UPSC supports your case, emphasising the duty of employers to accommodate employees with disabilities. You have the right to request reassignment or other accommodations and to seek redress through internal grievance mechanisms or legal channels if necessary.Seek legal counsel to assist with drafting formal requests and potential legal actions. Your case highlights the need for compliance with disability rights legislation and the importance of creating an inclusive work environment.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Suffering from chronic neurological disorder and facing harassment at workplace",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The facts of the case:Vikash Kumar is the petitioner who gave the Civil Services Examination as organised by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). Specifically, he had the particularity of a certain type of learning disability that made him write significantly slowly.Due to his disability, Vikash Kumar had to write to the school principal, asking for permission for a scribe for the examination. However, his request was rejected by the UPSC on the basis that he failed to fulfil the regulatory requirements inevitably in regard to the availability of a scribe.Several pages offer an account of Vikash Kumar, who sought to appeal the UPSC refusal, arguing that his rights under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 had been violated. He argued that this piece of legislation required accommodations for individuals with disabilities to be reasonable to make necessary adjustments to prevent discrimination.High Court's Decision:The Honourable High Court of India endorsed the directives of the UPSC and dismissed the appeal of Vikash Kumar on the grounds that he did not fall under the criteria for scribe under the prevailing conditions and norms. Vikash Kumar appealed to S.C. of India; ultimately, the Honourable Apex Court took up the matter for consideration.Supreme Court's Decision:Some of the changes that were made included the reevaluation of the guidelines and criteria by the Supreme Court for providing scribes to persons with disabilities to do their writing for them with the intention of having a more inclusive approach. The Court underlined another key principle outlined in the RPwD Act, 2016, known as reasonable accommodation, which implies that it is necessary for the implementation of appropriate modifications and adjustments in order to ensure persons with disabilities exercise their rights.The judgement elucidated that the RPwD Act entitled Vikash Kumar to certain rights, including a scribe, if he were to request them, and Oudh had arbitrarily denied him that right. The Court added that the act requires one to be given an equal chance with no discrimination and to implement the act of reasonable accommodation as part of the mandate.Hence, the SC recommended that the UPSC reconsider its guidelines and provide candidature appropriate damages for disability that the UPSC deprives of disabled candidates by not letting them have a scribe and making it a criteria for examination so that their rights are being protected and they can also write their examinations in the best way possible.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If a reasonable period has passed with no work being done or little progress is made for the student and myself,. Follow up with HR through a second email or letter if you do not receive a response to your initial message of introducing yourself. This should be done gently and diplomatically in an effort to remind them of your previous request. Emphasise its urgency. Enclose photocopies of previous communications along with the one received from NIMHANS.Furthermore, continue to remind the officer’s association of the absence of a reply from HR and enquire them to further support and fight for your rights. If you continue to be overwhelmed by your struggle, you should report the issue to the higher authorities of your organisation. Select a position at a higher level, such as senior HR manager or director. Obviously, describe actions that were taken beforehand that can contribute to the solution of the problem. Emphasise that you have received little or no response, especially with newer social media platforms.Correlatively, seek any legal advice that you would be in a position to take against any form of discrimination concerning medical conditions in the workplace with regard to reasonable accommodation. Although the study found that laws and regulations were weak and violated in food production, there is a need for research on the laws and regulations of different jurisdictions. For specific advice on this matter, it is advised to seek services from an employment lawyer.

    "answer": "- As per Section 8 of theHindu Succession Act, if a man leaves behind his parents , wife and children, all of them have an equal right on his property- However, the father is the second class legal heir whereas mother , wife and children of deceased son are first class legal heirs.1. Durai being father was not having any share in the property of his son- However , as already got a share in the property of son , then after the death of Durai his property would be devolved upon all his legal heirs equally.2. Yes , mothers share will become 1/5 after getting share from her husband- If the release deed was executed before the death of Durai then that deed is valid for 1/4 share3. The said Legal heir certificate was not valid.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Father share on the deceased son property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. Under Hindu law, a father isn't considered a Class I legal heir when it comes to his deceased son's property. According to the law, only the wife, children, and mother are classified as Class I heirs. However, if Durai was included in the legal heir certificate and the patta (title) was transferred to his name alongside the other legal heirs, it suggests that Durai was recognised as a legal heir under specific circumstances. In the event that Durai's share of the property was legally recognised and he signed the lease deed, his portion would indeed become part of Durai's estate upon his death and would be distributed among his legal heirs, such as his wife and children.2. Now, if Durai's share was mistakenly considered his own personal property and distributed based on that assumption, then the release deed stating Poon's share as 1/4 instead of 1/5 would be inaccurate. Poon's actual share should be reassessed as 1/5 of Durai's inherited portion. This means that the release deed could potentially be invalid or require correction in order to accurately reflect the distribution of shares.3. According to Hindu law, a father isn't classified as a Class I legal heir to his deceased son's estate. However, the fact that Durai was included in the legal heir certificate and the subsequent actions, such as the transfer of the title and the signing of the lease deed, suggest that the legal procedures might not have strictly adhered to the legal heir classifications. This could be due to administrative or familial arrangements that were in place at that time. Legally speaking, Durai shouldn't have been included as a legal heir, but since he was, the transfer of the title and the lease deed were carried out with his involvement. It would be advisable to seek rectification or legal clarification in order to ensure compliance with theHindu Succession Act.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Meena can argue on following points:Meena could assert that Durai contributed financially towards acquiring the property in 1987, even if there isn't solid evidence presently available. She might argue on circumstantial evidence like family testimonies or documents indirectly suggesting Durai's involvement.Another point she could emphasize is the inclusion of Durai's name in the legal heir certificate following Ganesh's demise in 1989, indicating acknowledgment of Durai's stake in the property.Additionally, Meena could point out that Ganesh's family didn't oppose the transfer of the property's name in the patta document in 2009, implying recognition of Durai's rightful ownership.She could also argue that Durai's signature on the lease deed for the petrol pump property in 2009 suggests his acknowledged interest in ownership by the family.As for challenging the transfer of the patta name, Meena would need to consider the limitation period based on the relevant jurisdiction's laws, seeking legal counsel for clarification.Regarding the validity of the property sale deed signed by Ganeshan's wife without Ganeshan's mother's signature, this hinges on jurisdictional laws and specific transaction circumstances. Depending on the situation, spousal consent might be required for property transactions, necessitating legal examination of applicable laws.Thank you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Custody decisions are typically made based on the best interests of the child, considering factors such as the child's age, the relationship with each parent, the ability of each parent to provide for the child's physical and emotional needs, and any history of abuse or neglect. If your wife is convicted in the FIR and it is deemed relevant to the custody decision, it could certainly impact the court's determination of what is in the best interests of the child. Regarding custody arrangements, \"joint custody\" can refer to joint legal custody, joint physical custody, or both. Joint legal custody typically means both parents share decision-making authority regarding important aspects of the child's life, such as education, healthcare, and religious upbringing. Joint physical custody involves the child spending significant time living with both parents. If you are awarded full custody of your child, it generally means that you have sole physical and legal custody, and your wife would likely be granted visitation rights or parenting time according to the court's determination of what is in the child's best interestsAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Time relief from money lenders",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You are right; your present position is worrisome, and it is a worrying indicator of your rights to food, to live with dignity, and to be protected from death. Under these circumstances, action based on legal procedures is inevitable in order to avoid further economic loss and to defend oneself.For that reason, it is necessary to rush to a lawyer for an application for an order to restrain the moneylenders and the bank from demanding and collecting interest and principal amounts until the Patna High Court furnishes its jurisdiction. It will help you avoid reaching a point where you have no money to pay your bills, and once you have a steady job, you should be able to minimise your spending and repay the money borrowed.Your lawyer can then appeal to the judge and explain that it is unfair and unreasonable for a moneylender to ask for exorbitant interest rates and other penalties given the circumstances surrounding the borrower’s debt trap. Emphasising your acknowledgment of the infringement of rights because of the money that you are expected to pay may help build your argument for the relief needed.Also, your lawyer should apply for a stay or grace period, which should be two years, as you suggested. As suggested, you should manage your factoring to evade debts. In this period, interest accrual and penalty charges are likely to put more pressure on your financial capability, but the court may agree to suspend these charges.Document collection is also critical, mainly loan agreements, bank statements, and any writing that the education department will have sent to either the lender or the debtor. Your legal counsellor, who will be assigned to your case, will then move for the appropriate legal redress in order to give you the relief you deserve.It is thus advised that you seek legal help as soon as you can so that your emergency financial situation can be addressed comprehensively and all your constitutional rights can be defended.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "- As per law, Money lending without a Money lending licence is an offence , and the person doing this without having a license can go behind the Bar , and fine uptoRs. 30,000/- .- Further, the Money Lending Act prohibits from charging interest rate more than 21% for unsecured loans for non-agriculture people and 18% for secured loans for non-agriculture people, The loan rate as per Money lending is simple interest per year.- Maximum a money lender can charge two percent more than the commercial bank rate of interest , and nothing more-  The Supreme Court of India has instructed the government to impose onerous conditions to restrict or even discourage people from entering into money lending business.- You can lodge a written complaint to the police after mentioning that that money lender is engaged into the business without having an license , and charging huge interest from the innocent persons like you , and further threatening for dire consequences and to file cases.- Further, as perRBI, the bank should give proper time and offers for the settlement of loan amount.,  on the ground of health and sudden loss- Hence you can send a legal notice to the bank after mentioning your poor financial conditions to waive the interest.- If bank official/people are harassing, then you canlodge a complaint at the police station for harassing & threatening , as law not permits anybody to take the law in his hand.You can contact me for further suggestion in this regard.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Time relief from money lenders",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You are right; your present position is worrisome, and it is a worrying indicator of your rights to food, to live with dignity, and to be protected from death. Under these circumstances, action based on legal procedures is inevitable in order to avoid further economic loss and to defend oneself.For that reason, it is necessary to rush to a lawyer for an application for an order to restrain the moneylenders and the bank from demanding and collecting interest and principal amounts until the Patna High Court furnishes its jurisdiction. It will help you avoid reaching a point where you have no money to pay your bills, and once you have a steady job, you should be able to minimise your spending and repay the money borrowed.Your lawyer can then appeal to the judge and explain that it is unfair and unreasonable for a moneylender to ask for exorbitant interest rates and other penalties given the circumstances surrounding the borrower’s debt trap. Emphasising your acknowledgment of the infringement of rights because of the money that you are expected to pay may help build your argument for the relief needed.Also, your lawyer should apply for a stay or grace period, which should be two years, as you suggested. As suggested, you should manage your factoring to evade debts. In this period, interest accrual and penalty charges are likely to put more pressure on your financial capability, but the court may agree to suspend these charges.Document collection is also critical, mainly loan agreements, bank statements, and any writing that the education department will have sent to either the lender or the debtor. Your legal counsellor, who will be assigned to your case, will then move for the appropriate legal redress in order to give you the relief you deserve.It is thus advised that you seek legal help as soon as you can so that your emergency financial situation can be addressed comprehensively and all your constitutional rights can be defended.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,First, the court would look for the car at the address you provided when registering as a member of that particular country. In the event that the car is not there, it can be ordered by the police to search for it and attach it wherever it is. If you transport the car from the address that is registered with the court, it is true that the court can send police to look for the car and order it to be impounded wherever you are.Answering your queries one by one,1. Under the terms of the special power of attorney, the mother can make a gift deed of her undivided share in the property right from when no formal division has occurred. The gift deed for her share will be okay, but it is necessary to physically partition the property so as to know the actual shares.2. Yes, one can avail of the gift deed with the pretext that it was a gift under duress or compulsion. This can be achieved by providing some form of evidence that there was prior coercion or undue influence when the gift deed was prepared.3. The daughter may also decline to assent to the partition deed or to complete it because she has a good reason not to execute the gift deed, such as the fact that the deed was made under force. Even the mother may challenge it, but it must be remembered that both the mother and the daughter have these rights. This is because the daughter can commence a suit in court and contest the deed on the grounds that the deed was not executed voluntarily or was executed under undue influence.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Buying a resale flat in an under construction building",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Marketing an apartment for resale in a building under construction that continues to have construction delays was undoubtedly fraught with some difficulties, particularly in relation to the concerns regarding the inability of an investor reluctant to sign the Tripartite Agreement. The primary concern for consideration here is that your interests are safeguarded, especially because this project has been experiencing some setbacks, and the investor's decision to back out and opt not to be part of the Tripartite Agreement makes the transaction more challenging.A potential solution is to work out with the investor that an initial payment will be made contingent on the agreed-upon amount of future revenue. In a spirit of negotiation, you could suggest a plan through which a part of the payment is made before the launch of the project and the rest of the amount is paid and retained in trust until ownership is handed over. This also ensures that the investor gets at least some funds upon the completion of the first part, and you are also shielded in case there are likely to be further delays. This arrangement would also call for a precise legal framework that would lay down various provisions in a bid to unlock the remaining balance. No doubt it is wise to consult a lawyer to draw up or at least to inspect this agreement in order to make sure that all such clauses are cogent and the interests of the parties are shielded.The other thing that can be done is to talk with the bank of your choice and possibly come to an agreement on how the loan is paid out in phases based on project progress or possession. Banks generally release funds with respect to construction work completed, and you can negotiate a specific payment schedule you feel would safeguard a part of the funds until you take possession. This might entail explanations with the bank and, with the help of records of the current situation and the manner in which the progress of the project is being slowed, getting consent.If the investor remains inflexible and the bank cannot accommodate your request for a conditional disbursement plan, you may need to reconsider the purchase. Paying the full amount without any assurance of possession exposes you to significant risks, especially in a delayed project. The investor's reluctance to pay GST again suggests they are looking to minimise their costs at your expense, which could indicate potential red flags in the transaction.It's essential to assess the potential for further delays and the overall credibility of the builder. If the delays seem likely to extend beyond the current RERA extension and there is no clear timeline for completion, it might be prudent to explore other options.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Buying a resale flat in an under construction building",
    "answer": "- As per the RERA Act, if the builder is delaying in construction & delay in possession, then the builder will have to pay 10% interest on the value of the property for delayed possession of flats.- Hence, if builder fails to delivers the possession of the flat to you on time, then you can cancel the agreement due to his fault and you are liable to get full refund of paid amount with 10 percent interest.- Further, if you get the possession of the said flat lately, then also you can claim 10% compensation from the builder.- How the bank sanctioned /disburse the loan in the absence of a Tripartite agreement.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "It would be a legal hassle if your investor does not want to enter into a Tripartite Agreement keeping the builder in a loop about about this transaction, otherwise the Builder would not recognize your transaction with the investor and would not hand over the physical possession to you. So its wise to keep everything transparent and builder well informed about your transaction. In case that is not done then take NOC from the Builder for First Transaction Free so that the Builder does not put additional cost for such Transfer.

It shows details on any claims or legal liens on the builder’s property that include the under-construction flat that you are planning to purchase. This assists in establishing that you are unaware of any pending legal or financial issues that may hinder your ability to own the property.Interpreting the Index of Charges involves checking:Whether there are any liabilities, such as loans or mortgages, that are still possibly owed against the builder’s property.If there are several charges, their sequence as well as the priority of the charges are mentioned. to make sure the particular project is not rendering the flat a security.If the index includes existing charges, then it is very crucial to confirm that the mentioned charges will be dropped at the time of payment only.

    "answer": "Dear Client,You appear to have a strong case against your competitor for defamation and unfair trade practices, which have potentially caused significant harm to your business. In India, defamation laws provide recourse for individuals and businesses whose reputation has been unjustly harmed by false statements. Given that the competitor's article contains false information about your services, which is demonstrably incorrect based on your website content and has likely impacted your business, you can take legal action.First, acquire all applicable proof. This consists of the thing in question, screenshots of your website showing the suitable facts, and any facts that may help quantify the economic impact, such as records of potential customers lost or a decrease in enterprise inquiries corresponding with the article's booklet. Documenting how the competitor's false claims have directly harmed your commercial enterprise is important.Consult with a prison professional focusing on commercial enterprise regulation and defamation. They can offer unique advice tailored in your state of affairs and help you decide the first-class direction of movement. Typically, the initial step might involve sending a cease-and-desist letter on your competitor, demanding that they remove the object and issue a retraction and public apology. This letter can also outline your purpose in trying to find damages in the event that they do not comply.If the competitor does not respond satisfactorily to the end-and-desist letter, you may proceed with submitting a lawsuit. You can claim compensation for the economic losses incurred due to the defamatory statements, in addition to are trying to find damages for the damage for your popularity. The legal method will involve offering your evidence and demonstrating the impact of the false records on your business.Additionally, you can explore treatments underneath the Competition Act, 2002, which addresses anti-competitive practices together with false and misleading advertising which could harm competition. Filing a grievance with the Competition Commission of India (CCI) is probably another avenue to seek redress.Given the complexity of your capability and the desire to precisely quantify your losses, an in-depth consultation with your attorney will be important. They can guide you through the legal tactics and help make sure that you have an excellent understanding of securities.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Gift deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Given your situation, a Registered Sale Deed would definitely be more appropriate and useful. Here’s why:Taking into consideration of the recent Supreme Court verdict on K. C. Laxmana vs K. C. Chandrappa Gowda (2022) Though it is authorised to give property to the Joint Hindu Family, the said power is limited and should not be exercised without the consent of all the coparceners. Since both sons are unfriendly, then a gift deed may be voidable depending on the results by the two sons.On the other hand, a sale deed is a stronger form of transfer in this context as it involves the actual sale of the property and the consideration paid by the buyer for the property. If your grandmother conveys her separate erected title by a registered sale deed in favor of the son of the daughter, then it would not be considered as a gift deed and therefore, it would be less potent to be challenged. This is because while a quit rent entails that the buyer pays a token amount for the property and holds it his titulary right, a sale deed has some monetary consideration attached to it; and thus more definitive in the transfer of ownership.In case the non-filing partner does not agree, executing the sale deed the next step is to file a partition suit. This would help to partition the asset and define the exact bits of each beneficiary, which would solve the problem of rights in common. This process even though time consuming will guarantee that the transfer of property rights is legally proper and prone to fewer litigations by other beneficiaries as compared to the traditional way.Thus, it is advised to execute a registered sale deed along with a partition suit to protect the interest of the elder son at the present legal position and the non-cooperative attitude of the two sons.Hope this helps!Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,First, the court would look for the car at the address you provided when registering as a member of that particular country. In the event that the car is not there, it can be ordered by the police to search for it and attach it wherever it is. If you transport the car from the address that is registered with the court, it is true that the court can send police to look for the car and order it to be impounded wherever you are.Answering your queries one by one,1. Under the terms of the special power of attorney, the mother can make a gift deed of her undivided share in the property right from when no formal division has occurred. The gift deed for her share will be okay, but it is necessary to physically partition the property so as to know the actual shares.2. Yes, one can avail of the gift deed with the pretext that it was a gift under duress or compulsion. This can be achieved by providing some form of evidence that there was prior coercion or undue influence when the gift deed was prepared.3. The daughter may also decline to assent to the partition deed or to complete it because she has a good reason not to execute the gift deed, such as the fact that the deed was made under force. Even the mother may challenge it, but it must be remembered that both the mother and the daughter have these rights. This is because the daughter can commence a suit in court and contest the deed on the grounds that the deed was not executed voluntarily or was executed under undue influence.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Based on the circumstances, it will be possible to respond to the issues raised by the bank lawyer up to the special power of attorney and its value on stamp. However, the original POA was not notarized and not registered, and in any case, if the stamp value of the document does not conform to the legal requirements of stamp duties in the State of Kerala, at least a registered affidavit or confirmation should be able to treat the wrong.If your mother and sister want to get over this, they can execute an affidavit in Delhi, where the particulars of producing the original power of attorney and the actual sale deed will be stated. This affidavit should particularly mention that you had the original power of attorney to do the following for the sale of property in Kerala. Moreover, there should be details concerning the sale deed, and all parties should have knowledge about the transaction beforehand.After the affidavit is drafted, it should be lodged with the registrar of the stated city. In the case of registration, the common-law partners, or your mother and sister in this case, will have to go to the registrar, who will then cause the affidavit to be sworn by them. This registered affidavit can then be procured from the office of the subregistrar and submitted to the bank in Kerala to meet the above requirement.Though it is a standard practice to follow while rectifying inconsistencies in title deeds across different states, it is wise to seek legal advice from an attorney with knowledge of real estate law in Delhi and Kerala. They can help determine whether all the legal requirements in the preparation of the affidavit have been met, not to mention issues related to registration. It will also assist in eschewing additional problems with the bank’s verification process and simplifying the process of acquiring the loan application.Lastly, it is for this reason that you can actually handle this at the registrar’s office in Delhi by preparing and forwarding an affidavit that will consist of the details in regard to the original POA and the sale deed. It will also involve consulting a legal professional to make sure that the responses in the affidavit are proper and that the affidavit is properly drafted and recorded to address the bank’s concerns.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Response to a defamation notice based on falsifications",
    "answer": "Dear Client,As the President of a Resident Welfare Association (RWA), your primary duty is to ensure the smooth functioning and maintenance of society. Facing a defamation notice, especially under such contentious circumstances, can be daunting. Here is a comprehensive approach to address the defamation notice and tackle ongoing harassment, with relevant legal provisions and strategies.Understanding Defamation and Relevant Legal ProvisionsDefamation Law in India:Defamation, under Indian law, is addressed under Section 499 of theIndian Penal Code(IPC), 1860, which defines defamation and Section 500 of the IPC which prescribes punishment for defamation.Section 499 IPC: Defamation involves making or publishing any imputation concerning any person, intending to harm, or knowing or having reason to believe that such imputation will harm the reputation of such person.Section 500 of the IPCProvides for punishment with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, with a fine, or with both.To constitute defamation, three elements must be established:1. Imputation: There must be an imputation made or published.2. Harm: The imputation must be made with the intention of harming the reputation of the person.3. Knowledge: The imputation must be known or reasonably believed to harm the person’s reputation.Civil Defamation: The person aggrieved can also file a civil suit claiming damages for defamation.Steps to Respond to the Defamation Notice1. Engage Legal Counsel:Immediately consult a lawyer experienced in defamation cases. They will help you draft a formal response to the defamation notice and guide you through the legal intricacies.2. Prepare a Detailed response:Your response should clarify the context in which the statements were made. Emphasise the ongoing issues with maintenance dues and the obstruction of entry and exit points. Highlight that the statements made in the WhatsApp group were in response to the disruptive behaviour, not intended to defame but to inform and manage the situation.3. Evidence Collection:Compile all evidence that supports your claims, including video footage of the entry/exit blockade, records of bounced checks, and any communications related to the maintenance dues.Document the sequence of events, including the interaction with the police and any witness statements from other residents.4. Justification and Truth Defence:Under Section 499 IPC, truth is a defence to defamation if the statement was made for the public good. Emphasise that your statement was true and made in the interest of the society's members’ welfare.Addressing the Ongoing Harassment1. File a Police complaint:lodge a detailed complaint against the defaulter for harassment, obstruction, and disruption of peace. Since there is already a bias, ensure the complaint is comprehensive and includes all supporting evidence.If the local police are unresponsive, escalate the matter to higher authorities, such as the District Superintendent of Police or the State Human Rights Commission.2. Civil Suit for Injunction:Consider filing a civil suit seeking an injunction against the defaulter from harassing you and other society members. This can include an order to restrain him from blocking entry and exit points and interfering with society’s functioning.3. Society’s Legal Framework:Ensure the society’s rules and regulations are documented and followed. The RWA can impose penalties on defaulters as per the society’s bylaws. Seek legal advice on enforcing these bylaws effectively.Case Law on Defamation and Public Good:Subramanian Swamyv.Union of India, Ministry of Law (2016): The Supreme Court upheld that truth and public good are valid defences against defamation.Consumer Protection Act, 2019:If the defaulter’s actions are severely affecting the living conditions in society, the RWA may file a complaint under theConsumer Protection Actfor unfair trade practices, if applicable.Responding to a defamation notice and addressing ongoing harassment requires a strategic and legally sound approach. By engaging legal counsel, preparing a robust response, collecting evidence, and leveraging relevant legal provisions, you can effectively counter the defamation claims and protect your rights and reputation. Simultaneously, taking steps to mitigate ongoing harassment through legal channels will ensure the smooth functioning of society and uphold the rule of law.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This can include alimony, property distribution, and compensation for the trauma you have endured. Your attorney can help you get the right result. In the meantime, you should avoid arguing with your mother-in-law or husband."

    "question": "Threatened of divorce and being asked to move out",
    "answer": "I am sorry to hear that you are facing such matrimonial issues. Alcohol is very destructive in a relationship. It's important to have an open and honest conversation with your husband alongwith your parents in laws regarding the situations and all possible consequences. it is inferred from your question that your husband age group is of 45-50s yrs.Your parent in laws are threatening you to be thrown out just because your husband drinks alot and your in laws held you being the main reason. so, If you want to work with the relationship, you have to make and convince your in laws that drinking habits of your husband is not because of you and you need to take him to good doctor to make him reformed and restrain from drinking. Mean whilst, your in laws also need to understand that as they are in their advance age, it would be detrimental for themselves too if both of you are dismissed from your home. The threatening decision of the in-laws is only to make both of you to work for relationship and support in their advance aged stage.so, dont worry, work with your relationship, try to convince your husband to visit to a good doctor, in this your in- laws and your family members might play some important role. also, from question, nothing is clear regarding your children and if they are within the vicinity they might play a very convincing role. you may also, seek and suggest to your in laws if you seek divorce, what would be future of your children?Notwithstanding above, harassment that you are facing from your in laws and husband is a kind ofdomestic Violenceand is a punishable offence underDomestic ViolenceAct, which may lend them into trouble and punitive action by the police/ court. yet, it's important to communicate openly and honestly about the issues regarding what is and isn't acceptable behavior. And, if you choose to work on your relationship, make sure that your husband is willing to take responsibility for her actions. From the question, it is not clear that what source of earning and who steers the family boat, as your comments suggest that your husband is not earning, this may be a big reason for his poor drinking habits in the given patriarchal societal norms. Wherein, you may also consider the following:Consider counseling: A trained counselor can help you and in laws effectively and work through any underlying issues.Don't blame each-other: It's important to remember that your husband behaviour may be some situation based or due to strong interference of your parents and no-earning of himself.Wouldn’t you want to know if your husband wants to continue in this marriage or not?Why your husband want divorce, what are reasons, if extra marital relations, of your interference in his drinking habits, or anything else, and hence, you should seek answer to these questions to resolve the problem. Any emotional triggers from your past relationship/ life ?- these questions need to be answered,so that both of you as mature adults can priorities what’s important and either work together for the marriage or move on with your lives going separate.your husband and family has to recognize that all that, if anything that happend in past, has happened is a matter of past and if you are fully emotionally, physically, financially and in all other aspect, are honestly committed to your family and want to make reform to your husband, your in-laws should support you rather than making your life miserable and hence, you should explain whatever problems persist and resolve mutually.Here, your husband may be worried about the financial independence, or he want some form of freedom in the married life and in the present patriarchal society the fabrics of responsibilities are nets around the father. so, both of you have to communicate with yourself and each-other. Try a fresh with focus on the present and try to build a more transparent and communicative relationship in the present. Take this opportunity to work together and strengthen your marriage.Try to follow these commandment answers for a lifetime of happiness and harmony:What are your personal values and beliefs?How do you envision our roles and responsibilities within the marriage?How do you envision the role of family in our relationship?What are your career aspirations, and how do you plan to achieve them?How do you handle stress or challenges in life?How do you handle conflicts or disagreements in a relationship?How do you manage finances and plan for the future?What are your hobbies and interests outside of work?How do you prioritize spending time with family and friends?What are your expectations regarding communication and openness in our relationship?What are your religious or cultural beliefs, and how do they influence your life?How do you see our relationship evolving over time, and what are your thoughts on starting a family?Are there any specific values or traditions that are important to you, and how do you envision incorporating them into our lives together?How do you prioritize personal growth and self-improvement in a relationship?How do you maintain a healthy work-life balance?How do you express love and affection in a relationship?How do you handle differences in opinions or cultural backgrounds?What are your expectations regarding household chores and responsibilities?How do you balance personal space and time with family responsibilities?What are your views on gender equality and mutual respect in marriage?How do you envision supporting each other through life's ups and downs?And if all this failed, then proceed for initiating a case fordomestic Violenceagainst your in-laws and your husband under DV Act, where, not only you will get relief from the domestic miseries but also, your husband has to be pay you maintenance. Also, your, parent in-laws can not absolve from their responsibility and if your husband is not earning, still they have to give some part of property as maintenance/ one time alimony in case of divorce as your husband is going to be heir of the property of your in-laws. Here, though the property (house) may not be an ancestral property, still court may decide in your favour and against wishes of your husband and in-laws and gives you your rightful shares in the property.However, it is suggested that the divorce may be used as matter of last resort. Some legal provisions on maintenance are as discussed below and hence, you can use Section125 Crpcand DV Act for remedy and maintenance from your husband and in-laws along with the right to Selter.The legal provisions are as appended below:-That, the legislations which have been framed on the issue of maintenance are theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, Section 125 of the Cr.P.C. ,1973; and the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005 which provide a statutory remedy to women, irrespective of the religious community to which they belong, apart from the personal laws applicable. theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 by invoking Sections 24 and 25 :Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 Sections 24 and 25 make provision for maintenance to a party who has no independent income sufficient for his or her support, and necessary expenses. This is a gender-neutral provision, where either the wife or the husband may claim maintenance. The prerequisite is that the applicant does not have independent income which is sufficient for her or his support, during the pendency of the lis.Section 24 of the HMA provides for maintenance pendente lite, where the Court may direct the respondent to pay the expenses of the proceeding, and pay such reasonable monthly amount, which is considered to be reasonable, having regard to the income of both the parties. The proviso to Section 24 providing a time line of 60 days for disposal of the application was inserted vide Act 49 of 2001 w.e.f. 24.09.2001.Section 18 provides that a Hindu wife shall be entitled to be maintained by her husband during her lifetime. She is entitled to make a claim for a separate residence, without forfeiting her right to maintenance. Section 18 read in conjunction with Section 23 states the factors required to be considered for deciding the quantum of maintenance to be paid.Under sub-section (2) of Section 18, the husband has the obligation to maintain his wife, even though she may be living separately. The right of separate residence and maintenance would however not be available if the wife has been unchaste, or has converted to another religion.Section 125 of the Cr.P.C The purpose and object of Section 125 Cr.P.C. is to provide immediate relief to an applicant.An application under Section 125 Cr.P.C. is predicated on two conditions : the husband has sufficient means; and “neglects” to maintain his wife, who is unable to maintain herself. In such a case, the husband may be directed by the Magistrate to pay such monthly sum to the wife, as deemed fit. Maintenance is awarded on the basis of the financial capacity of the husband and other relevant factors. Under sub-section (2) of Section 125, the Court is conferred with the discretion to award payment of maintenance either from the date of the order, or from the date of the application. Under the third proviso to the amended Section 125, the application for grant of interim maintenance must be disposed of as far as possible within sixty days’ from the date of service of notice on the respondent.Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005 The D.V. Act provides relief to an aggrieved woman who is subjected to “domestic violence.”1.Sections 17 and 19 grant an entitlement in favour of an aggrieved woman to the right of residence in a “shared household”, irrespective of her having any legal interest in the same or not. From the definition of “aggrieved person” and “respondent”, it is clear that : (a) it is not the requirement of law that the aggrieved person may either own the premises jointly or singly, or by tenanting it jointly or singly; (b) the household may belong to a joint family of which the respondent is a member, irrespective of whether the respondent or the aggrieved person has any right, title, or interest in the shared household; 24 (c) the shared household may either be owned, or tenanted by the respondent singly or jointly.The right to residence u/S. 19 is, however, not an indefeasible right, especially when a daughter-in-law is claiming a right against aged parents-in-law.While granting relief u/S. 12 of the D.V. Act, or in any civil proceeding, the court has to balance the rights between the aggrieved woman and the parents-in-law.Section 20(1)(d) provides that maintenance granted under the D.V. Act to an aggrieved woman and children, would be given effect to, in addition to an order of maintenance awarded under Section 125 of the Cr.P.C., or any other law in force.Under sub-section (6) of Section 20, the Magistrate may direct the employer or debtor of the respondent, to directly pay the aggrieved person, or deposit with the court a portion of the wages or salaries or debt due to or accrued to the credit of the respondent, which amount may be adjusted towards the monetary relief payable by the respondent.Section 22 provides that the Magistrate may pass an order directing the respondent to pay compensation and damages for the injuries, including mental torture and emotional distress, caused by the acts ofdomestic violenceperpetrated by the respondent.Section 26 of the D.V. Act provides that any relief available under Sections 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22 may also be sought in any legal proceeding before a Civil Court, Family Court or Criminal Court.Section 36 provides that the D.V. Act shall be in addition to, and not in derogation of the provisions of any other law for the time being in force. Analysis of the issues (a)Issue of overlapping jurisdiction The Court noticed that while it is true that a party is not precluded from approaching the Court under one or more enactments, since the nature and purpose of the relief under each Act is distinct and independent, it is equally true that the simultaneous operation of these Acts, would lead to multiplicity of proceedings and conflicting orders. This process requires to be streamlined, so that the respondent/husband is not obligated to comply with successive orders of maintenance passed under different enactments. “It is well settled that a wife can make a claim for maintenance under different statutes. For instance, there is no bar to seek maintenance both under the D.V. Act and Section 125 of the Cr.P.C., or under H.M.A. It would, however, be inequitable to direct the husband to pay maintenance under each of the proceedings, independent of the relief granted in a previous proceeding.” hence, that in a subsequent maintenance proceeding, the applicant shall disclose the previous maintenance proceeding, and the orders passed therein, so that the Court would take into consideration the maintenance already awarded in the previous proceeding, and grant an adjustment or set-off of the said amount. \"Note and Disclaimer:-The opinion given here is generic in nature and offered without considering the case on merit and any material facts, hence, if you are proceeding with divorce, or any legal action against your husband and in-laws, you should again consult a lawyer with all the material facts on the case, prior proceeding ahead in the legal battle.Thank you and best wishes for your future wellbeing, hope you resolve your problems at the earliest and come out of all the miseries/ painful life and live happily ever after.Regards,Vivek Bhai PatelAdvocate, New Delhi26 AnswersTalk to Advocate Vivek Bhai Patel"

    "context": "Asked 12 months ago in Property Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Gift deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Given your situation, a Registered Sale Deed would definitely be more appropriate and useful. Here’s why:Taking into consideration of the recent Supreme Court verdict on K. C. Laxmana vs K. C. Chandrappa Gowda (2022) Though it is authorised to give property to the Joint Hindu Family, the said power is limited and should not be exercised without the consent of all the coparceners. Since both sons are unfriendly, then a gift deed may be voidable depending on the results by the two sons.On the other hand, a sale deed is a stronger form of transfer in this context as it involves the actual sale of the property and the consideration paid by the buyer for the property. If your grandmother conveys her separate erected title by a registered sale deed in favor of the son of the daughter, then it would not be considered as a gift deed and therefore, it would be less potent to be challenged. This is because while a quit rent entails that the buyer pays a token amount for the property and holds it his titulary right, a sale deed has some monetary consideration attached to it; and thus more definitive in the transfer of ownership.In case the non-filing partner does not agree, executing the sale deed the next step is to file a partition suit. This would help to partition the asset and define the exact bits of each beneficiary, which would solve the problem of rights in common. This process even though time consuming will guarantee that the transfer of property rights is legally proper and prone to fewer litigations by other beneficiaries as compared to the traditional way.Thus, it is advised to execute a registered sale deed along with a partition suit to protect the interest of the elder son at the present legal position and the non-cooperative attitude of the two sons.Hope this helps!Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,First, the court would look for the car at the address you provided when registering as a member of that particular country. In the event that the car is not there, it can be ordered by the police to search for it and attach it wherever it is. If you transport the car from the address that is registered with the court, it is true that the court can send police to look for the car and order it to be impounded wherever you are.Answering your queries one by one,1. Under the terms of the special power of attorney, the mother can make a gift deed of her undivided share in the property right from when no formal division has occurred. The gift deed for her share will be okay, but it is necessary to physically partition the property so as to know the actual shares.2. Yes, one can avail of the gift deed with the pretext that it was a gift under duress or compulsion. This can be achieved by providing some form of evidence that there was prior coercion or undue influence when the gift deed was prepared.3. The daughter may also decline to assent to the partition deed or to complete it because she has a good reason not to execute the gift deed, such as the fact that the deed was made under force. Even the mother may challenge it, but it must be remembered that both the mother and the daughter have these rights. This is because the daughter can commence a suit in court and contest the deed on the grounds that the deed was not executed voluntarily or was executed under undue influence.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It is correct that daughter in law does not have any right in the properties of her in laws ands even your husband too do not have any right in such property of your in laws. Since you are earning then you are not entitled to maintenance rather legally you are liable to provide maintenance to your husband.

    "question": "Threatened of divorce and being asked to move out",
    "answer": "I am sorry to hear that you are facing such matrimonial issues. Alcohol is very destructive in a relationship. It's important to have an open and honest conversation with your husband alongwith your parents in laws regarding the situations and all possible consequences. it is inferred from your question that your husband age group is of 45-50s yrs.Your parent in laws are threatening you to be thrown out just because your husband drinks alot and your in laws held you being the main reason. so, If you want to work with the relationship, you have to make and convince your in laws that drinking habits of your husband is not because of you and you need to take him to good doctor to make him reformed and restrain from drinking. Mean whilst, your in laws also need to understand that as they are in their advance age, it would be detrimental for themselves too if both of you are dismissed from your home. The threatening decision of the in-laws is only to make both of you to work for relationship and support in their advance aged stage.so, dont worry, work with your relationship, try to convince your husband to visit to a good doctor, in this your in- laws and your family members might play some important role. also, from question, nothing is clear regarding your children and if they are within the vicinity they might play a very convincing role. you may also, seek and suggest to your in laws if you seek divorce, what would be future of your children?Notwithstanding above, harassment that you are facing from your in laws and husband is a kind ofdomestic Violenceand is a punishable offence underDomestic ViolenceAct, which may lend them into trouble and punitive action by the police/ court. yet, it's important to communicate openly and honestly about the issues regarding what is and isn't acceptable behavior. And, if you choose to work on your relationship, make sure that your husband is willing to take responsibility for her actions. From the question, it is not clear that what source of earning and who steers the family boat, as your comments suggest that your husband is not earning, this may be a big reason for his poor drinking habits in the given patriarchal societal norms. Wherein, you may also consider the following:Consider counseling: A trained counselor can help you and in laws effectively and work through any underlying issues.Don't blame each-other: It's important to remember that your husband behaviour may be some situation based or due to strong interference of your parents and no-earning of himself.Wouldn’t you want to know if your husband wants to continue in this marriage or not?Why your husband want divorce, what are reasons, if extra marital relations, of your interference in his drinking habits, or anything else, and hence, you should seek answer to these questions to resolve the problem. Any emotional triggers from your past relationship/ life ?- these questions need to be answered,so that both of you as mature adults can priorities what’s important and either work together for the marriage or move on with your lives going separate.your husband and family has to recognize that all that, if anything that happend in past, has happened is a matter of past and if you are fully emotionally, physically, financially and in all other aspect, are honestly committed to your family and want to make reform to your husband, your in-laws should support you rather than making your life miserable and hence, you should explain whatever problems persist and resolve mutually.Here, your husband may be worried about the financial independence, or he want some form of freedom in the married life and in the present patriarchal society the fabrics of responsibilities are nets around the father. so, both of you have to communicate with yourself and each-other. Try a fresh with focus on the present and try to build a more transparent and communicative relationship in the present. Take this opportunity to work together and strengthen your marriage.Try to follow these commandment answers for a lifetime of happiness and harmony:What are your personal values and beliefs?How do you envision our roles and responsibilities within the marriage?How do you envision the role of family in our relationship?What are your career aspirations, and how do you plan to achieve them?How do you handle stress or challenges in life?How do you handle conflicts or disagreements in a relationship?How do you manage finances and plan for the future?What are your hobbies and interests outside of work?How do you prioritize spending time with family and friends?What are your expectations regarding communication and openness in our relationship?What are your religious or cultural beliefs, and how do they influence your life?How do you see our relationship evolving over time, and what are your thoughts on starting a family?Are there any specific values or traditions that are important to you, and how do you envision incorporating them into our lives together?How do you prioritize personal growth and self-improvement in a relationship?How do you maintain a healthy work-life balance?How do you express love and affection in a relationship?How do you handle differences in opinions or cultural backgrounds?What are your expectations regarding household chores and responsibilities?How do you balance personal space and time with family responsibilities?What are your views on gender equality and mutual respect in marriage?How do you envision supporting each other through life's ups and downs?And if all this failed, then proceed for initiating a case fordomestic Violenceagainst your in-laws and your husband under DV Act, where, not only you will get relief from the domestic miseries but also, your husband has to be pay you maintenance. Also, your, parent in-laws can not absolve from their responsibility and if your husband is not earning, still they have to give some part of property as maintenance/ one time alimony in case of divorce as your husband is going to be heir of the property of your in-laws. Here, though the property (house) may not be an ancestral property, still court may decide in your favour and against wishes of your husband and in-laws and gives you your rightful shares in the property.However, it is suggested that the divorce may be used as matter of last resort. Some legal provisions on maintenance are as discussed below and hence, you can use Section125 Crpcand DV Act for remedy and maintenance from your husband and in-laws along with the right to Selter.The legal provisions are as appended below:-That, the legislations which have been framed on the issue of maintenance are theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, Section 125 of the Cr.P.C. ,1973; and the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005 which provide a statutory remedy to women, irrespective of the religious community to which they belong, apart from the personal laws applicable. theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 by invoking Sections 24 and 25 :Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 Sections 24 and 25 make provision for maintenance to a party who has no independent income sufficient for his or her support, and necessary expenses. This is a gender-neutral provision, where either the wife or the husband may claim maintenance. The prerequisite is that the applicant does not have independent income which is sufficient for her or his support, during the pendency of the lis.Section 24 of the HMA provides for maintenance pendente lite, where the Court may direct the respondent to pay the expenses of the proceeding, and pay such reasonable monthly amount, which is considered to be reasonable, having regard to the income of both the parties. The proviso to Section 24 providing a time line of 60 days for disposal of the application was inserted vide Act 49 of 2001 w.e.f. 24.09.2001.Section 18 provides that a Hindu wife shall be entitled to be maintained by her husband during her lifetime. She is entitled to make a claim for a separate residence, without forfeiting her right to maintenance. Section 18 read in conjunction with Section 23 states the factors required to be considered for deciding the quantum of maintenance to be paid.Under sub-section (2) of Section 18, the husband has the obligation to maintain his wife, even though she may be living separately. The right of separate residence and maintenance would however not be available if the wife has been unchaste, or has converted to another religion.Section 125 of the Cr.P.C The purpose and object of Section 125 Cr.P.C. is to provide immediate relief to an applicant.An application under Section 125 Cr.P.C. is predicated on two conditions : the husband has sufficient means; and “neglects” to maintain his wife, who is unable to maintain herself. In such a case, the husband may be directed by the Magistrate to pay such monthly sum to the wife, as deemed fit. Maintenance is awarded on the basis of the financial capacity of the husband and other relevant factors. Under sub-section (2) of Section 125, the Court is conferred with the discretion to award payment of maintenance either from the date of the order, or from the date of the application. Under the third proviso to the amended Section 125, the application for grant of interim maintenance must be disposed of as far as possible within sixty days’ from the date of service of notice on the respondent.Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005 The D.V. Act provides relief to an aggrieved woman who is subjected to “domestic violence.”1.Sections 17 and 19 grant an entitlement in favour of an aggrieved woman to the right of residence in a “shared household”, irrespective of her having any legal interest in the same or not. From the definition of “aggrieved person” and “respondent”, it is clear that : (a) it is not the requirement of law that the aggrieved person may either own the premises jointly or singly, or by tenanting it jointly or singly; (b) the household may belong to a joint family of which the respondent is a member, irrespective of whether the respondent or the aggrieved person has any right, title, or interest in the shared household; 24 (c) the shared household may either be owned, or tenanted by the respondent singly or jointly.The right to residence u/S. 19 is, however, not an indefeasible right, especially when a daughter-in-law is claiming a right against aged parents-in-law.While granting relief u/S. 12 of the D.V. Act, or in any civil proceeding, the court has to balance the rights between the aggrieved woman and the parents-in-law.Section 20(1)(d) provides that maintenance granted under the D.V. Act to an aggrieved woman and children, would be given effect to, in addition to an order of maintenance awarded under Section 125 of the Cr.P.C., or any other law in force.Under sub-section (6) of Section 20, the Magistrate may direct the employer or debtor of the respondent, to directly pay the aggrieved person, or deposit with the court a portion of the wages or salaries or debt due to or accrued to the credit of the respondent, which amount may be adjusted towards the monetary relief payable by the respondent.Section 22 provides that the Magistrate may pass an order directing the respondent to pay compensation and damages for the injuries, including mental torture and emotional distress, caused by the acts ofdomestic violenceperpetrated by the respondent.Section 26 of the D.V. Act provides that any relief available under Sections 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22 may also be sought in any legal proceeding before a Civil Court, Family Court or Criminal Court.Section 36 provides that the D.V. Act shall be in addition to, and not in derogation of the provisions of any other law for the time being in force. Analysis of the issues (a)Issue of overlapping jurisdiction The Court noticed that while it is true that a party is not precluded from approaching the Court under one or more enactments, since the nature and purpose of the relief under each Act is distinct and independent, it is equally true that the simultaneous operation of these Acts, would lead to multiplicity of proceedings and conflicting orders. This process requires to be streamlined, so that the respondent/husband is not obligated to comply with successive orders of maintenance passed under different enactments. “It is well settled that a wife can make a claim for maintenance under different statutes. For instance, there is no bar to seek maintenance both under the D.V. Act and Section 125 of the Cr.P.C., or under H.M.A. It would, however, be inequitable to direct the husband to pay maintenance under each of the proceedings, independent of the relief granted in a previous proceeding.” hence, that in a subsequent maintenance proceeding, the applicant shall disclose the previous maintenance proceeding, and the orders passed therein, so that the Court would take into consideration the maintenance already awarded in the previous proceeding, and grant an adjustment or set-off of the said amount. \"Note and Disclaimer:-The opinion given here is generic in nature and offered without considering the case on merit and any material facts, hence, if you are proceeding with divorce, or any legal action against your husband and in-laws, you should again consult a lawyer with all the material facts on the case, prior proceeding ahead in the legal battle.Thank you and best wishes for your future wellbeing, hope you resolve your problems at the earliest and come out of all the miseries/ painful life and live happily ever after.Regards,Vivek Bhai PatelAdvocate, New Delhi26 AnswersTalk to Advocate Vivek Bhai Patel"

    "answer": "Dear Client,First, the court would look for the car at the address you provided when registering as a member of that particular country. In the event that the car is not there, it can be ordered by the police to search for it and attach it wherever it is. If you transport the car from the address that is registered with the court, it is true that the court can send police to look for the car and order it to be impounded wherever you are.Answering your queries one by one,1. Under the terms of the special power of attorney, the mother can make a gift deed of her undivided share in the property right from when no formal division has occurred. The gift deed for her share will be okay, but it is necessary to physically partition the property so as to know the actual shares.2. Yes, one can avail of the gift deed with the pretext that it was a gift under duress or compulsion. This can be achieved by providing some form of evidence that there was prior coercion or undue influence when the gift deed was prepared.3. The daughter may also decline to assent to the partition deed or to complete it because she has a good reason not to execute the gift deed, such as the fact that the deed was made under force. Even the mother may challenge it, but it must be remembered that both the mother and the daughter have these rights. This is because the daughter can commence a suit in court and contest the deed on the grounds that the deed was not executed voluntarily or was executed under undue influence.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Gift deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Given your situation, a Registered Sale Deed would definitely be more appropriate and useful. Here’s why:Taking into consideration of the recent Supreme Court verdict on K. C. Laxmana vs K. C. Chandrappa Gowda (2022) Though it is authorised to give property to the Joint Hindu Family, the said power is limited and should not be exercised without the consent of all the coparceners. Since both sons are unfriendly, then a gift deed may be voidable depending on the results by the two sons.On the other hand, a sale deed is a stronger form of transfer in this context as it involves the actual sale of the property and the consideration paid by the buyer for the property. If your grandmother conveys her separate erected title by a registered sale deed in favor of the son of the daughter, then it would not be considered as a gift deed and therefore, it would be less potent to be challenged. This is because while a quit rent entails that the buyer pays a token amount for the property and holds it his titulary right, a sale deed has some monetary consideration attached to it; and thus more definitive in the transfer of ownership.In case the non-filing partner does not agree, executing the sale deed the next step is to file a partition suit. This would help to partition the asset and define the exact bits of each beneficiary, which would solve the problem of rights in common. This process even though time consuming will guarantee that the transfer of property rights is legally proper and prone to fewer litigations by other beneficiaries as compared to the traditional way.Thus, it is advised to execute a registered sale deed along with a partition suit to protect the interest of the elder son at the present legal position and the non-cooperative attitude of the two sons.Hope this helps!Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Therefore, a deed of gift in regard to the ancestral property executed ‘out of love and affection’ does not come within the scope of the term ‘pious purpose’.  It is irrelevant if such gift or settlement was made by a donor, i.e. the first defendant, in favour of a donee who was raised by the donor without any relationship, i.e. the second defendant.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Fraud in property sale",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. It is unusual to issue a General Power of Attorney (GPA) for an ancestral estate without the consent of all legal heirs. Ancestral property generally passes equally to descendants unless a legal document, such as a will, specifies otherwise. If the great-grandfather did not distribute the property to all of his sons, questions may arise about the validity of the GPA.2. Later, if the cousin’s grandfather submitted an undocumented GPA to his child, the legal situation could be more complicated. To avoid disputes in any ancestral property transaction, ensure that property transactions are transparent and include all legal heirs.3. The fact that household taxes were still paid in your grandfather’s real name despite your GPA and sales contract can be used as evidence to challenge the authenticity of these documents. Home tax records can be critical to proving ownership of the property and supporting your legal claims to the property.4. Your real ancestor may legally have the right to claim ownership of the property if the house tax is registered in his name and he can prove his connection to the property for the past 40 years. He can challenge the GPA and the sale deed based on the property’s recorded ownership.In summary, a GPA deed of sale of ancestral property is unacceptable to all legal heirs and can be challenged based on differences in household tax records and your ancestor’s personal property rights. You should consult with a legal professional to explore your options."

    "answer": "Dear Client,It is worthwhile to submit a lawsuit against the registered will of your great-grandfather, both for the properties that he declared as self-acquired and for the properties that he declared as ancestral according to the Hindu ancestral properties act. The basis for your appeal will be that your grandfather failed to divide the properties that rightfully belonged to him, and you think the property stated and described as self-acquired is ancestral in nature.In the case of the ancestral properties, you may claim that the will is unlawful, particularly the distribution of the properties of the deceased, and that your grandfather rightfully deserves a portion of the share in the property.To prove its status as ancestral property, which you believe it to be in this case, you need to bring evidence to court to show that it was wrongly declared self-acquired property in that will and that the testator had an interest in it. This means that inherited property can be challenged only if the claim is made that the property was not, in fact, ancestral as per the will.As with most legal disputes, both parties should produce documents and other relevant evidence that the accuser is telling the truth. To have a strong case on your side, hire a lawyer that focuses on the laws governing inheritances and properties. They will help you with the legal procedure and ensure the possibility of a challenge is high.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Tenant not vacating the property, not paying rent, nor responding to calls",
    "answer": "Dear Client,answering both your queries, here are the steps and considerations:1. Police Complaint: You can take the tenant to police station for the criminal intimidation of your mother as threatened by the tenant. That being said, even without a recording, the incident can still be reported. Trespass could also be another reason because the tenancy has come to an end, and the tenant still occupies the premises without lawful authority.2. Legal Recourse: This pact was notarized rather than being registered and thus it would most probably not be as effective in court. Yet, it is possible to file an eviction suit as a response to the tenant not paying rent along with aggressive behavior.3. Leave and License vs. Rental Agreement:- Leave and License Agreement: Usually provides more control of and to the property to the owner and less time for tenants to the latter. It is a common choice for configuration that is usually temporary, while it can be registered to enhance the obligation’s robustness.- Rental Agreement: Usually grants the tenant more privileges and is best suited for long term use like in leasing.4. Religion: Religion and customs, in general, have no place in justice and legal processes. Focus on the facts: the withdrawal from the agreement, failure to make payments for the rent, and threatening messages.5. Stamp Paper: Scriping an agreement on ₹100 stamp paper is not unusual; however, registering the agreement would help in giving it a better legal protection.In conclusion, do file a complaint to police regarding intimidation and trespassing and also consult a legal expert to commence eviction process.Hope this helps!Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Tenant not vacating the property, not paying rent, nor responding to calls",
    "answer": "The definition of the leave and license agreement can be found in the Indian Easements Act, 1882. Section 52 of the Indian Easements Act states:Where one person grants to another, or to a definite number of other persons, a right to do, or continue to do, in or upon the immovable property of the grantor, something which would, in the absence of such right, be unlawful and such right does not amount to an easement or an interest in the property, the right is called a license.According to the Supreme Court (SC), if a leave and license agreement permits only the usage of a property in a specific way or under specific terms, while it is in the possession and control of the owner, it will be a license. This means that no interest in the property is transferred to the tenant.So the owner of the property still maintains legal possession of his or her property. The Supreme Court states, “The legal possession, thereof, continues to be with the owner of the property but the licensee is permitted to make use of the premises for a particular purpose. But for this permission, his occupation would be unlawful. It does not create in his favor any estate or interest in the property.’As there is no easement right granted, the landlord of the property can revoke the permission granted to the tenant at any time. The landlord can choose to let out his property for short periods by working out a leave and license rental agreement. This benefits tenants as well as they will not have to give extended notice periods when they want to vacate a property.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Tenant not vacating the property, not paying rent, nor responding to calls",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Although a Leave and License (L&L) agreement does not give the licensee legal possession or interest in the property, taking a unilateral action such as closing the store can cause legal complications Reason Here are a few reasons:1. RISK OF CLAIMS: The licensee may file a criminal complaint for wrongful imprisonment, trespassing, or intimidation. This could lead to police action and legal trouble for you.2. State law action: The licensee may seek relief from the court, such as an order to remove the device and restore access. This could lead to a prolonged legal battle and damage to any claimed losses.3. Court Approach: Courts generally dislike self-help arrangements and prefer to resolve disputes through legal means. Unilateral actions could be viewed as taking the law into their own hands, which the courts would not look kindly upon.4. Evidence and Procedure: Although the L&L Agreement is clear, you must pursue legal eviction to avoid any charges of eviction which is illegal. For these reasons, legal removal through the courts is necessary to avoid these potential issues."

Attachment Order: You, the financier, and the court are informed of the attachment order in relation to your property.2. Hypothecation: Since the car is hypothecated with the financier taking the risk, the financier’s interest will be considered. It nullifies any other interest the financier may have on the vehicle because of the loan granted.3. Auction: The court can sell the car, but what is usually realised must be paid to the financier in the balance of the loan. The balance will be used to pay the maintenance dues if, at all, there is a remaining balance out of the total amounts gained.The court will liaise with the financier for confirmation of the remaining balance of the loan and then seek to be certain that the financier’s claim is sorted out before establishing that of the maintenance payment.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Fraud in property sale",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. It is unusual to issue a General Power of Attorney (GPA) for an ancestral estate without the consent of all legal heirs. Ancestral property generally passes equally to descendants unless a legal document, such as a will, specifies otherwise. If the great-grandfather did not distribute the property to all of his sons, questions may arise about the validity of the GPA.2. Later, if the cousin’s grandfather submitted an undocumented GPA to his child, the legal situation could be more complicated. To avoid disputes in any ancestral property transaction, ensure that property transactions are transparent and include all legal heirs.3. The fact that household taxes were still paid in your grandfather’s real name despite your GPA and sales contract can be used as evidence to challenge the authenticity of these documents. Home tax records can be critical to proving ownership of the property and supporting your legal claims to the property.4. Your real ancestor may legally have the right to claim ownership of the property if the house tax is registered in his name and he can prove his connection to the property for the past 40 years. He can challenge the GPA and the sale deed based on the property’s recorded ownership.In summary, a GPA deed of sale of ancestral property is unacceptable to all legal heirs and can be challenged based on differences in household tax records and your ancestor’s personal property rights. You should consult with a legal professional to explore your options."

    "answer": "Dear Client,It is worthwhile to submit a lawsuit against the registered will of your great-grandfather, both for the properties that he declared as self-acquired and for the properties that he declared as ancestral according to the Hindu ancestral properties act. The basis for your appeal will be that your grandfather failed to divide the properties that rightfully belonged to him, and you think the property stated and described as self-acquired is ancestral in nature.In the case of the ancestral properties, you may claim that the will is unlawful, particularly the distribution of the properties of the deceased, and that your grandfather rightfully deserves a portion of the share in the property.To prove its status as ancestral property, which you believe it to be in this case, you need to bring evidence to court to show that it was wrongly declared self-acquired property in that will and that the testator had an interest in it. This means that inherited property can be challenged only if the claim is made that the property was not, in fact, ancestral as per the will.As with most legal disputes, both parties should produce documents and other relevant evidence that the accuser is telling the truth. To have a strong case on your side, hire a lawyer that focuses on the laws governing inheritances and properties. They will help you with the legal procedure and ensure the possibility of a challenge is high.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Threatened of divorce and being asked to move out",
    "answer": "I am sorry to hear that you are facing such matrimonial issues. Alcohol is very destructive in a relationship. It's important to have an open and honest conversation with your husband alongwith your parents in laws regarding the situations and all possible consequences. it is inferred from your question that your husband age group is of 45-50s yrs.Your parent in laws are threatening you to be thrown out just because your husband drinks alot and your in laws held you being the main reason. so, If you want to work with the relationship, you have to make and convince your in laws that drinking habits of your husband is not because of you and you need to take him to good doctor to make him reformed and restrain from drinking. Mean whilst, your in laws also need to understand that as they are in their advance age, it would be detrimental for themselves too if both of you are dismissed from your home. The threatening decision of the in-laws is only to make both of you to work for relationship and support in their advance aged stage.so, dont worry, work with your relationship, try to convince your husband to visit to a good doctor, in this your in- laws and your family members might play some important role. also, from question, nothing is clear regarding your children and if they are within the vicinity they might play a very convincing role. you may also, seek and suggest to your in laws if you seek divorce, what would be future of your children?Notwithstanding above, harassment that you are facing from your in laws and husband is a kind ofdomestic Violenceand is a punishable offence underDomestic ViolenceAct, which may lend them into trouble and punitive action by the police/ court. yet, it's important to communicate openly and honestly about the issues regarding what is and isn't acceptable behavior. And, if you choose to work on your relationship, make sure that your husband is willing to take responsibility for her actions. From the question, it is not clear that what source of earning and who steers the family boat, as your comments suggest that your husband is not earning, this may be a big reason for his poor drinking habits in the given patriarchal societal norms. Wherein, you may also consider the following:Consider counseling: A trained counselor can help you and in laws effectively and work through any underlying issues.Don't blame each-other: It's important to remember that your husband behaviour may be some situation based or due to strong interference of your parents and no-earning of himself.Wouldn’t you want to know if your husband wants to continue in this marriage or not?Why your husband want divorce, what are reasons, if extra marital relations, of your interference in his drinking habits, or anything else, and hence, you should seek answer to these questions to resolve the problem. Any emotional triggers from your past relationship/ life ?- these questions need to be answered,so that both of you as mature adults can priorities what’s important and either work together for the marriage or move on with your lives going separate.your husband and family has to recognize that all that, if anything that happend in past, has happened is a matter of past and if you are fully emotionally, physically, financially and in all other aspect, are honestly committed to your family and want to make reform to your husband, your in-laws should support you rather than making your life miserable and hence, you should explain whatever problems persist and resolve mutually.Here, your husband may be worried about the financial independence, or he want some form of freedom in the married life and in the present patriarchal society the fabrics of responsibilities are nets around the father. so, both of you have to communicate with yourself and each-other. Try a fresh with focus on the present and try to build a more transparent and communicative relationship in the present. Take this opportunity to work together and strengthen your marriage.Try to follow these commandment answers for a lifetime of happiness and harmony:What are your personal values and beliefs?How do you envision our roles and responsibilities within the marriage?How do you envision the role of family in our relationship?What are your career aspirations, and how do you plan to achieve them?How do you handle stress or challenges in life?How do you handle conflicts or disagreements in a relationship?How do you manage finances and plan for the future?What are your hobbies and interests outside of work?How do you prioritize spending time with family and friends?What are your expectations regarding communication and openness in our relationship?What are your religious or cultural beliefs, and how do they influence your life?How do you see our relationship evolving over time, and what are your thoughts on starting a family?Are there any specific values or traditions that are important to you, and how do you envision incorporating them into our lives together?How do you prioritize personal growth and self-improvement in a relationship?How do you maintain a healthy work-life balance?How do you express love and affection in a relationship?How do you handle differences in opinions or cultural backgrounds?What are your expectations regarding household chores and responsibilities?How do you balance personal space and time with family responsibilities?What are your views on gender equality and mutual respect in marriage?How do you envision supporting each other through life's ups and downs?And if all this failed, then proceed for initiating a case fordomestic Violenceagainst your in-laws and your husband under DV Act, where, not only you will get relief from the domestic miseries but also, your husband has to be pay you maintenance. Also, your, parent in-laws can not absolve from their responsibility and if your husband is not earning, still they have to give some part of property as maintenance/ one time alimony in case of divorce as your husband is going to be heir of the property of your in-laws. Here, though the property (house) may not be an ancestral property, still court may decide in your favour and against wishes of your husband and in-laws and gives you your rightful shares in the property.However, it is suggested that the divorce may be used as matter of last resort. Some legal provisions on maintenance are as discussed below and hence, you can use Section125 Crpcand DV Act for remedy and maintenance from your husband and in-laws along with the right to Selter.The legal provisions are as appended below:-That, the legislations which have been framed on the issue of maintenance are theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, Section 125 of the Cr.P.C. ,1973; and the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005 which provide a statutory remedy to women, irrespective of the religious community to which they belong, apart from the personal laws applicable. theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 by invoking Sections 24 and 25 :Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 Sections 24 and 25 make provision for maintenance to a party who has no independent income sufficient for his or her support, and necessary expenses. This is a gender-neutral provision, where either the wife or the husband may claim maintenance. The prerequisite is that the applicant does not have independent income which is sufficient for her or his support, during the pendency of the lis.Section 24 of the HMA provides for maintenance pendente lite, where the Court may direct the respondent to pay the expenses of the proceeding, and pay such reasonable monthly amount, which is considered to be reasonable, having regard to the income of both the parties. The proviso to Section 24 providing a time line of 60 days for disposal of the application was inserted vide Act 49 of 2001 w.e.f. 24.09.2001.Section 18 provides that a Hindu wife shall be entitled to be maintained by her husband during her lifetime. She is entitled to make a claim for a separate residence, without forfeiting her right to maintenance. Section 18 read in conjunction with Section 23 states the factors required to be considered for deciding the quantum of maintenance to be paid.Under sub-section (2) of Section 18, the husband has the obligation to maintain his wife, even though she may be living separately. The right of separate residence and maintenance would however not be available if the wife has been unchaste, or has converted to another religion.Section 125 of the Cr.P.C The purpose and object of Section 125 Cr.P.C. is to provide immediate relief to an applicant.An application under Section 125 Cr.P.C. is predicated on two conditions : the husband has sufficient means; and “neglects” to maintain his wife, who is unable to maintain herself. In such a case, the husband may be directed by the Magistrate to pay such monthly sum to the wife, as deemed fit. Maintenance is awarded on the basis of the financial capacity of the husband and other relevant factors. Under sub-section (2) of Section 125, the Court is conferred with the discretion to award payment of maintenance either from the date of the order, or from the date of the application. Under the third proviso to the amended Section 125, the application for grant of interim maintenance must be disposed of as far as possible within sixty days’ from the date of service of notice on the respondent.Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005 The D.V. Act provides relief to an aggrieved woman who is subjected to “domestic violence.”1.Sections 17 and 19 grant an entitlement in favour of an aggrieved woman to the right of residence in a “shared household”, irrespective of her having any legal interest in the same or not. From the definition of “aggrieved person” and “respondent”, it is clear that : (a) it is not the requirement of law that the aggrieved person may either own the premises jointly or singly, or by tenanting it jointly or singly; (b) the household may belong to a joint family of which the respondent is a member, irrespective of whether the respondent or the aggrieved person has any right, title, or interest in the shared household; 24 (c) the shared household may either be owned, or tenanted by the respondent singly or jointly.The right to residence u/S. 19 is, however, not an indefeasible right, especially when a daughter-in-law is claiming a right against aged parents-in-law.While granting relief u/S. 12 of the D.V. Act, or in any civil proceeding, the court has to balance the rights between the aggrieved woman and the parents-in-law.Section 20(1)(d) provides that maintenance granted under the D.V. Act to an aggrieved woman and children, would be given effect to, in addition to an order of maintenance awarded under Section 125 of the Cr.P.C., or any other law in force.Under sub-section (6) of Section 20, the Magistrate may direct the employer or debtor of the respondent, to directly pay the aggrieved person, or deposit with the court a portion of the wages or salaries or debt due to or accrued to the credit of the respondent, which amount may be adjusted towards the monetary relief payable by the respondent.Section 22 provides that the Magistrate may pass an order directing the respondent to pay compensation and damages for the injuries, including mental torture and emotional distress, caused by the acts ofdomestic violenceperpetrated by the respondent.Section 26 of the D.V. Act provides that any relief available under Sections 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22 may also be sought in any legal proceeding before a Civil Court, Family Court or Criminal Court.Section 36 provides that the D.V. Act shall be in addition to, and not in derogation of the provisions of any other law for the time being in force. Analysis of the issues (a)Issue of overlapping jurisdiction The Court noticed that while it is true that a party is not precluded from approaching the Court under one or more enactments, since the nature and purpose of the relief under each Act is distinct and independent, it is equally true that the simultaneous operation of these Acts, would lead to multiplicity of proceedings and conflicting orders. This process requires to be streamlined, so that the respondent/husband is not obligated to comply with successive orders of maintenance passed under different enactments. “It is well settled that a wife can make a claim for maintenance under different statutes. For instance, there is no bar to seek maintenance both under the D.V. Act and Section 125 of the Cr.P.C., or under H.M.A. It would, however, be inequitable to direct the husband to pay maintenance under each of the proceedings, independent of the relief granted in a previous proceeding.” hence, that in a subsequent maintenance proceeding, the applicant shall disclose the previous maintenance proceeding, and the orders passed therein, so that the Court would take into consideration the maintenance already awarded in the previous proceeding, and grant an adjustment or set-off of the said amount. \"Note and Disclaimer:-The opinion given here is generic in nature and offered without considering the case on merit and any material facts, hence, if you are proceeding with divorce, or any legal action against your husband and in-laws, you should again consult a lawyer with all the material facts on the case, prior proceeding ahead in the legal battle.Thank you and best wishes for your future wellbeing, hope you resolve your problems at the earliest and come out of all the miseries/ painful life and live happily ever after.Regards,Vivek Bhai PatelAdvocate, New Delhi26 AnswersTalk to Advocate Vivek Bhai Patel"

    "question": "Gift deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Given your situation, a Registered Sale Deed would definitely be more appropriate and useful. Here’s why:Taking into consideration of the recent Supreme Court verdict on K. C. Laxmana vs K. C. Chandrappa Gowda (2022) Though it is authorised to give property to the Joint Hindu Family, the said power is limited and should not be exercised without the consent of all the coparceners. Since both sons are unfriendly, then a gift deed may be voidable depending on the results by the two sons.On the other hand, a sale deed is a stronger form of transfer in this context as it involves the actual sale of the property and the consideration paid by the buyer for the property. If your grandmother conveys her separate erected title by a registered sale deed in favor of the son of the daughter, then it would not be considered as a gift deed and therefore, it would be less potent to be challenged. This is because while a quit rent entails that the buyer pays a token amount for the property and holds it his titulary right, a sale deed has some monetary consideration attached to it; and thus more definitive in the transfer of ownership.In case the non-filing partner does not agree, executing the sale deed the next step is to file a partition suit. This would help to partition the asset and define the exact bits of each beneficiary, which would solve the problem of rights in common. This process even though time consuming will guarantee that the transfer of property rights is legally proper and prone to fewer litigations by other beneficiaries as compared to the traditional way.Thus, it is advised to execute a registered sale deed along with a partition suit to protect the interest of the elder son at the present legal position and the non-cooperative attitude of the two sons.Hope this helps!Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,answering both your queries, here are the steps and considerations:1. Police Complaint: You can take the tenant to police station for the criminal intimidation of your mother as threatened by the tenant. That being said, even without a recording, the incident can still be reported. Trespass could also be another reason because the tenancy has come to an end, and the tenant still occupies the premises without lawful authority.2. Legal Recourse: This pact was notarized rather than being registered and thus it would most probably not be as effective in court. Yet, it is possible to file an eviction suit as a response to the tenant not paying rent along with aggressive behavior.3. Leave and License vs. Rental Agreement:- Leave and License Agreement: Usually provides more control of and to the property to the owner and less time for tenants to the latter. It is a common choice for configuration that is usually temporary, while it can be registered to enhance the obligation’s robustness.- Rental Agreement: Usually grants the tenant more privileges and is best suited for long term use like in leasing.4. Religion: Religion and customs, in general, have no place in justice and legal processes. Focus on the facts: the withdrawal from the agreement, failure to make payments for the rent, and threatening messages.5. Stamp Paper: Scriping an agreement on ₹100 stamp paper is not unusual; however, registering the agreement would help in giving it a better legal protection.In conclusion, do file a complaint to police regarding intimidation and trespassing and also consult a legal expert to commence eviction process.Hope this helps!Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Tenant not vacating the property, not paying rent, nor responding to calls",
    "answer": "The definition of the leave and license agreement can be found in the Indian Easements Act, 1882. Section 52 of the Indian Easements Act states:Where one person grants to another, or to a definite number of other persons, a right to do, or continue to do, in or upon the immovable property of the grantor, something which would, in the absence of such right, be unlawful and such right does not amount to an easement or an interest in the property, the right is called a license.According to the Supreme Court (SC), if a leave and license agreement permits only the usage of a property in a specific way or under specific terms, while it is in the possession and control of the owner, it will be a license. This means that no interest in the property is transferred to the tenant.So the owner of the property still maintains legal possession of his or her property. The Supreme Court states, “The legal possession, thereof, continues to be with the owner of the property but the licensee is permitted to make use of the premises for a particular purpose. But for this permission, his occupation would be unlawful. It does not create in his favor any estate or interest in the property.’As there is no easement right granted, the landlord of the property can revoke the permission granted to the tenant at any time. The landlord can choose to let out his property for short periods by working out a leave and license rental agreement. This benefits tenants as well as they will not have to give extended notice periods when they want to vacate a property.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Although a Leave and License (L&L) agreement does not give the licensee legal possession or interest in the property, taking a unilateral action such as closing the store can cause legal complications Reason Here are a few reasons:1. RISK OF CLAIMS: The licensee may file a criminal complaint for wrongful imprisonment, trespassing, or intimidation. This could lead to police action and legal trouble for you.2. State law action: The licensee may seek relief from the court, such as an order to remove the device and restore access. This could lead to a prolonged legal battle and damage to any claimed losses.3. Court Approach: Courts generally dislike self-help arrangements and prefer to resolve disputes through legal means. Unilateral actions could be viewed as taking the law into their own hands, which the courts would not look kindly upon.4. Evidence and Procedure: Although the L&L Agreement is clear, you must pursue legal eviction to avoid any charges of eviction which is illegal. For these reasons, legal removal through the courts is necessary to avoid these potential issues."

If the tenant is wiling to purchase the land, the Tribunal will determine according to the provisions of Sections 32-H and 63-A(3) the purchase price of the land after holding an enquiry and after hearing the parties concerned. The value of the land fixed by taking into consideration all the prescribed factors will be scaled down to the maximum, if it exceeds the maximum, or scaled up to the minimum, if it is less than the minimum.8. Provision is made in Section 32-K for payment of the purchase price. A permanent tenant has to deposit the entire amount with the Agricultural Lands Tribunal within one year from such date as may be fixed by the Tribunal. A tenant, other than a permanent tenant, can pay the price in one lump sum within one year or the price may be paid with simple interest at 4 1/2 per cent in annual instalments net exceeding 12 as may be fixed by the Tribunal. In the meanwhile, payment of rent to the landlord is stopped from the year In which the first instalment becomes payable, and if during any year the payment of rent is suspended or remitted, a tenant is not to be liable to pay the purchase price in lump sum or the amount of instalments or any interest thereon during that yearAjay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98558 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "question": "How much % does a landlord gets and tenants get according to Kul Kayda law",
    "answer": "Tenants are those who pay rent to the owner of the land and lease it to them under certain mutually agreed conditions. The tenant’s name appears in the Mahabhulekh 7/12 as a protected “Kul,” and with the farmer’s consent, they are able to cultivate the land..Some of the significant provisions of the Kul Kayda law are as follows:Landlord's right to terminate the tenancyTransfer of pending proceedings to the Collector and State GovernmentTenant's right to purchase land from the landlordSpecial provisions for lands held on lease by industrial or commercial undertakingsEstablishment of reasonable rent for land covered by section 43-AIn conclusion, the Kul Kayda law is a pivotal piece of legislation aimed at safeguarding tenants' rights within the agricultural sector.

However, it is common to note that the 7/12 extract does not present percentages per se; instead, these extracts depict the area and rights attached to the land.Here’s how you can calculate the percentage:Identify Your Possession Area: Identifying the total area of the land in 7/12 extract and to identify the area of the land parcel which you claimed under your possession. This area is usually shown in acres or hectares.Calculate the Percentage:In case the area under your possession is in another unit other than the total area (example: square kilometers and square miles convert the area under your possession to the same unit as the total area - acres if the total area is in acres and vice versa).Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Fraud in property sale",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. It is unusual to issue a General Power of Attorney (GPA) for an ancestral estate without the consent of all legal heirs. Ancestral property generally passes equally to descendants unless a legal document, such as a will, specifies otherwise. If the great-grandfather did not distribute the property to all of his sons, questions may arise about the validity of the GPA.2. Later, if the cousin’s grandfather submitted an undocumented GPA to his child, the legal situation could be more complicated. To avoid disputes in any ancestral property transaction, ensure that property transactions are transparent and include all legal heirs.3. The fact that household taxes were still paid in your grandfather’s real name despite your GPA and sales contract can be used as evidence to challenge the authenticity of these documents. Home tax records can be critical to proving ownership of the property and supporting your legal claims to the property.4. Your real ancestor may legally have the right to claim ownership of the property if the house tax is registered in his name and he can prove his connection to the property for the past 40 years. He can challenge the GPA and the sale deed based on the property’s recorded ownership.In summary, a GPA deed of sale of ancestral property is unacceptable to all legal heirs and can be challenged based on differences in household tax records and your ancestor’s personal property rights. You should consult with a legal professional to explore your options."

    "answer": "Dear Client,It is worthwhile to submit a lawsuit against the registered will of your great-grandfather, both for the properties that he declared as self-acquired and for the properties that he declared as ancestral according to the Hindu ancestral properties act. The basis for your appeal will be that your grandfather failed to divide the properties that rightfully belonged to him, and you think the property stated and described as self-acquired is ancestral in nature.In the case of the ancestral properties, you may claim that the will is unlawful, particularly the distribution of the properties of the deceased, and that your grandfather rightfully deserves a portion of the share in the property.To prove its status as ancestral property, which you believe it to be in this case, you need to bring evidence to court to show that it was wrongly declared self-acquired property in that will and that the testator had an interest in it. This means that inherited property can be challenged only if the claim is made that the property was not, in fact, ancestral as per the will.As with most legal disputes, both parties should produce documents and other relevant evidence that the accuser is telling the truth. To have a strong case on your side, hire a lawyer that focuses on the laws governing inheritances and properties.

It is correct that daughter in law does not have any right in the properties of her in laws ands even your husband too do not have any right in such property of your in laws. Since you are earning then you are not entitled to maintenance rather legally you are liable to provide maintenance to your husband. So it is best for you to get rid from such marriage and opt fordivorce by mutual consenton best available terms.Siddharth SrivastavaAdvocate, Delhi1537 AnswersTalk to Advocate Siddharth Srivastava"

    "question": "Threatened of divorce and being asked to move out",
    "answer": "I am sorry to hear that you are facing such matrimonial issues. Alcohol is very destructive in a relationship. It's important to have an open and honest conversation with your husband alongwith your parents in laws regarding the situations and all possible consequences. it is inferred from your question that your husband age group is of 45-50s yrs.Your parent in laws are threatening you to be thrown out just because your husband drinks alot and your in laws held you being the main reason. so, If you want to work with the relationship, you have to make and convince your in laws that drinking habits of your husband is not because of you and you need to take him to good doctor to make him reformed and restrain from drinking. Mean whilst, your in laws also need to understand that as they are in their advance age, it would be detrimental for themselves too if both of you are dismissed from your home. The threatening decision of the in-laws is only to make both of you to work for relationship and support in their advance aged stage.so, dont worry, work with your relationship, try to convince your husband to visit to a good doctor, in this your in- laws and your family members might play some important role. also, from question, nothing is clear regarding your children and if they are within the vicinity they might play a very convincing role. you may also, seek and suggest to your in laws if you seek divorce, what would be future of your children?Notwithstanding above, harassment that you are facing from your in laws and husband is a kind ofdomestic Violenceand is a punishable offence underDomestic ViolenceAct, which may lend them into trouble and punitive action by the police/ court. yet, it's important to communicate openly and honestly about the issues regarding what is and isn't acceptable behavior. And, if you choose to work on your relationship, make sure that your husband is willing to take responsibility for her actions. From the question, it is not clear that what source of earning and who steers the family boat, as your comments suggest that your husband is not earning, this may be a big reason for his poor drinking habits in the given patriarchal societal norms. Wherein, you may also consider the following:Consider counseling: A trained counselor can help you and in laws effectively and work through any underlying issues.Don't blame each-other: It's important to remember that your husband behaviour may be some situation based or due to strong interference of your parents and no-earning of himself.Wouldn’t you want to know if your husband wants to continue in this marriage or not?Why your husband want divorce, what are reasons, if extra marital relations, of your interference in his drinking habits, or anything else, and hence, you should seek answer to these questions to resolve the problem. Any emotional triggers from your past relationship/ life ?- these questions need to be answered,so that both of you as mature adults can priorities what’s important and either work together for the marriage or move on with your lives going separate.your husband and family has to recognize that all that, if anything that happend in past, has happened is a matter of past and if you are fully emotionally, physically, financially and in all other aspect, are honestly committed to your family and want to make reform to your husband, your in-laws should support you rather than making your life miserable and hence, you should explain whatever problems persist and resolve mutually.Here, your husband may be worried about the financial independence, or he want some form of freedom in the married life and in the present patriarchal society the fabrics of responsibilities are nets around the father. so, both of you have to communicate with yourself and each-other. Try a fresh with focus on the present and try to build a more transparent and communicative relationship in the present. Take this opportunity to work together and strengthen your marriage.Try to follow these commandment answers for a lifetime of happiness and harmony:What are your personal values and beliefs?How do you envision our roles and responsibilities within the marriage?How do you envision the role of family in our relationship?What are your career aspirations, and how do you plan to achieve them?How do you handle stress or challenges in life?How do you handle conflicts or disagreements in a relationship?How do you manage finances and plan for the future?What are your hobbies and interests outside of work?How do you prioritize spending time with family and friends?What are your expectations regarding communication and openness in our relationship?What are your religious or cultural beliefs, and how do they influence your life?How do you see our relationship evolving over time, and what are your thoughts on starting a family?Are there any specific values or traditions that are important to you, and how do you envision incorporating them into our lives together?How do you prioritize personal growth and self-improvement in a relationship?How do you maintain a healthy work-life balance?How do you express love and affection in a relationship?How do you handle differences in opinions or cultural backgrounds?What are your expectations regarding household chores and responsibilities?How do you balance personal space and time with family responsibilities?What are your views on gender equality and mutual respect in marriage?How do you envision supporting each other through life's ups and downs?And if all this failed, then proceed for initiating a case fordomestic Violenceagainst your in-laws and your husband under DV Act, where, not only you will get relief from the domestic miseries but also, your husband has to be pay you maintenance. Also, your, parent in-laws can not absolve from their responsibility and if your husband is not earning, still they have to give some part of property as maintenance/ one time alimony in case of divorce as your husband is going to be heir of the property of your in-laws. Here, though the property (house) may not be an ancestral property, still court may decide in your favour and against wishes of your husband and in-laws and gives you your rightful shares in the property.However, it is suggested that the divorce may be used as matter of last resort. Some legal provisions on maintenance are as discussed below and hence, you can use Section125 Crpcand DV Act for remedy and maintenance from your husband and in-laws along with the right to Selter.The legal provisions are as appended below:-That, the legislations which have been framed on the issue of maintenance are theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, Section 125 of the Cr.P.C. ,1973; and the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005 which provide a statutory remedy to women, irrespective of the religious community to which they belong, apart from the personal laws applicable. theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 by invoking Sections 24 and 25 :Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 Sections 24 and 25 make provision for maintenance to a party who has no independent income sufficient for his or her support, and necessary expenses. This is a gender-neutral provision, where either the wife or the husband may claim maintenance. The prerequisite is that the applicant does not have independent income which is sufficient for her or his support, during the pendency of the lis.Section 24 of the HMA provides for maintenance pendente lite, where the Court may direct the respondent to pay the expenses of the proceeding, and pay such reasonable monthly amount, which is considered to be reasonable, having regard to the income of both the parties. The proviso to Section 24 providing a time line of 60 days for disposal of the application was inserted vide Act 49 of 2001 w.e.f. 24.09.2001.Section 18 provides that a Hindu wife shall be entitled to be maintained by her husband during her lifetime. She is entitled to make a claim for a separate residence, without forfeiting her right to maintenance. Section 18 read in conjunction with Section 23 states the factors required to be considered for deciding the quantum of maintenance to be paid.Under sub-section (2) of Section 18, the husband has the obligation to maintain his wife, even though she may be living separately. The right of separate residence and maintenance would however not be available if the wife has been unchaste, or has converted to another religion.Section 125 of the Cr.P.C The purpose and object of Section 125 Cr.P.C. is to provide immediate relief to an applicant.An application under Section 125 Cr.P.C. is predicated on two conditions : the husband has sufficient means; and “neglects” to maintain his wife, who is unable to maintain herself. In such a case, the husband may be directed by the Magistrate to pay such monthly sum to the wife, as deemed fit. Maintenance is awarded on the basis of the financial capacity of the husband and other relevant factors. Under sub-section (2) of Section 125, the Court is conferred with the discretion to award payment of maintenance either from the date of the order, or from the date of the application. Under the third proviso to the amended Section 125, the application for grant of interim maintenance must be disposed of as far as possible within sixty days’ from the date of service of notice on the respondent.Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005 The D.V. Act provides relief to an aggrieved woman who is subjected to “domestic violence.”1.Sections 17 and 19 grant an entitlement in favour of an aggrieved woman to the right of residence in a “shared household”, irrespective of her having any legal interest in the same or not. From the definition of “aggrieved person” and “respondent”, it is clear that : (a) it is not the requirement of law that the aggrieved person may either own the premises jointly or singly, or by tenanting it jointly or singly; (b) the household may belong to a joint family of which the respondent is a member, irrespective of whether the respondent or the aggrieved person has any right, title, or interest in the shared household; 24 (c) the shared household may either be owned, or tenanted by the respondent singly or jointly.The right to residence u/S. 19 is, however, not an indefeasible right, especially when a daughter-in-law is claiming a right against aged parents-in-law.While granting relief u/S. 12 of the D.V. Act, or in any civil proceeding, the court has to balance the rights between the aggrieved woman and the parents-in-law.Section 20(1)(d) provides that maintenance granted under the D.V. Act to an aggrieved woman and children, would be given effect to, in addition to an order of maintenance awarded under Section 125 of the Cr.P.C., or any other law in force.Under sub-section (6) of Section 20, the Magistrate may direct the employer or debtor of the respondent, to directly pay the aggrieved person, or deposit with the court a portion of the wages or salaries or debt due to or accrued to the credit of the respondent, which amount may be adjusted towards the monetary relief payable by the respondent.Section 22 provides that the Magistrate may pass an order directing the respondent to pay compensation and damages for the injuries, including mental torture and emotional distress, caused by the acts ofdomestic violenceperpetrated by the respondent.Section 26 of the D.V. Act provides that any relief available under Sections 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22 may also be sought in any legal proceeding before a Civil Court, Family Court or Criminal Court.Section 36 provides that the D.V. Act shall be in addition to, and not in derogation of the provisions of any other law for the time being in force. Analysis of the issues (a)Issue of overlapping jurisdiction The Court noticed that while it is true that a party is not precluded from approaching the Court under one or more enactments, since the nature and purpose of the relief under each Act is distinct and independent, it is equally true that the simultaneous operation of these Acts, would lead to multiplicity of proceedings and conflicting orders. This process requires to be streamlined, so that the respondent/husband is not obligated to comply with successive orders of maintenance passed under different enactments. “It is well settled that a wife can make a claim for maintenance under different statutes. For instance, there is no bar to seek maintenance both under the D.V. Act and Section 125 of the Cr.P.C., or under H.M.A. It would, however, be inequitable to direct the husband to pay maintenance under each of the proceedings, independent of the relief granted in a previous proceeding.” hence, that in a subsequent maintenance proceeding, the applicant shall disclose the previous maintenance proceeding, and the orders passed therein, so that the Court would take into consideration the maintenance already awarded in the previous proceeding, and grant an adjustment or set-off of the said amount. \"Note and Disclaimer:-The opinion given here is generic in nature and offered without considering the case on merit and any material facts, hence, if you are proceeding with divorce, or any legal action against your husband and in-laws, you should again consult a lawyer with all the material facts on the case, prior proceeding ahead in the legal battle.Thank you and best wishes for your future wellbeing, hope you resolve your problems at the earliest and come out of all the miseries/ painful life and live happily ever after.Regards,Vivek Bhai PatelAdvocate, New Delhi26 AnswersTalk to Advocate Vivek Bhai Patel"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The investigating officer is correct that offences that are triable only for imprisonment for a term of less than seven years sometimes come as a category of offences that fall under Section 41A of the CrPC, where a notice to appear can be given instead of a warrant of arrest. However, problems come with the delay in such action and the implications of bias arising from the fact that the accused is the police.First, there is a need to clarify the existence of the accused on the list of individuals who have been declared absconding. This should, of course, be recorded in the police force documents, and there should be attempts to apprehend them if they are indeed fugitives.If you have not been served, then take advantage of the fact that it has been 11 months since the FIR was filed, and you can tackle the issue of the chargesheet not being filed. It could also mean sheer neglect or maybe deliberate tarpitting by the police in presenting the charge sheet.To address the situation:Present an affidavit of complaint and/or representation to the superior officer that the investigating officer has not initiated proper action as per the court order and the superior officer’s direction.Go to the High Court either with a contempt petition or a writ petition for direction to the investigating officer to do his job under the law, as it is in regard to the investigation and any subsequent arrests, which should not be made with any prejudice.Indicate that the investigation can be supervised by the court, especially on occasions where police officers are the accused.It is important to note that all telephone and face-to-face communications should be recorded, and there should be an official record of the communication to support the case being presented to the higher authorities and court.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Instead of arresting the accused, the police will now be obliged to issue a \"notice of appearance\" for any offence punishable with imprisonment up to seven years.the notice of appearance casts a duty on the accused person to appear before the police and \"cooperate\" with the investigation.

Legally, to declare someone absconding, the officer must show that a notice was served and the accused failed to comply. If the accused were working at a police station, the claim of their absconding is questionable.For offences with less than seven years of imprisonment, the officer can issue a notice to appear (Section 41A of the CrPC). If the accused don't comply, they can be arrested without a warrant if necessary.When you meet the superior officer, highlight the inconsistencies in the investigating officer's actions and request clear, written instructions for the arrest. Document the superior officer's order and follow up to ensure compliance. If the investigating officer still doesn't comply, consider escalating the matter to higher authorities or the judiciary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,answering both your queries, here are the steps and considerations:1. Police Complaint: You can take the tenant to police station for the criminal intimidation of your mother as threatened by the tenant. That being said, even without a recording, the incident can still be reported. Trespass could also be another reason because the tenancy has come to an end, and the tenant still occupies the premises without lawful authority.2. Legal Recourse: This pact was notarized rather than being registered and thus it would most probably not be as effective in court. Yet, it is possible to file an eviction suit as a response to the tenant not paying rent along with aggressive behavior.3. Leave and License vs. Rental Agreement:- Leave and License Agreement: Usually provides more control of and to the property to the owner and less time for tenants to the latter. It is a common choice for configuration that is usually temporary, while it can be registered to enhance the obligation’s robustness.- Rental Agreement: Usually grants the tenant more privileges and is best suited for long term use like in leasing.4. Religion: Religion and customs, in general, have no place in justice and legal processes. Focus on the facts: the withdrawal from the agreement, failure to make payments for the rent, and threatening messages.5. Stamp Paper: Scriping an agreement on ₹100 stamp paper is not unusual; however, registering the agreement would help in giving it a better legal protection.In conclusion, do file a complaint to police regarding intimidation and trespassing and also consult a legal expert to commence eviction process.Hope this helps!Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Tenant not vacating the property, not paying rent, nor responding to calls",
    "answer": "The definition of the leave and license agreement can be found in the Indian Easements Act, 1882. Section 52 of the Indian Easements Act states:Where one person grants to another, or to a definite number of other persons, a right to do, or continue to do, in or upon the immovable property of the grantor, something which would, in the absence of such right, be unlawful and such right does not amount to an easement or an interest in the property, the right is called a license.According to the Supreme Court (SC), if a leave and license agreement permits only the usage of a property in a specific way or under specific terms, while it is in the possession and control of the owner, it will be a license. This means that no interest in the property is transferred to the tenant.So the owner of the property still maintains legal possession of his or her property. The Supreme Court states, “The legal possession, thereof, continues to be with the owner of the property but the licensee is permitted to make use of the premises for a particular purpose. But for this permission, his occupation would be unlawful. It does not create in his favor any estate or interest in the property.’As there is no easement right granted, the landlord of the property can revoke the permission granted to the tenant at any time. The landlord can choose to let out his property for short periods by working out a leave and license rental agreement. This benefits tenants as well as they will not have to give extended notice periods when they want to vacate a property.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Although a Leave and License (L&L) agreement does not give the licensee legal possession or interest in the property, taking a unilateral action such as closing the store can cause legal complications Reason Here are a few reasons:1. RISK OF CLAIMS: The licensee may file a criminal complaint for wrongful imprisonment, trespassing, or intimidation. This could lead to police action and legal trouble for you.2. State law action: The licensee may seek relief from the court, such as an order to remove the device and restore access. This could lead to a prolonged legal battle and damage to any claimed losses.3. Court Approach: Courts generally dislike self-help arrangements and prefer to resolve disputes through legal means. Unilateral actions could be viewed as taking the law into their own hands, which the courts would not look kindly upon.4. Evidence and Procedure: Although the L&L Agreement is clear, you must pursue legal eviction to avoid any charges of eviction which is illegal. For these reasons, legal removal through the courts is necessary to avoid these potential issues."

    "answer": "Dear Client,The investigating officer is correct that offences that are triable only for imprisonment for a term of less than seven years sometimes come as a category of offences that fall under Section 41A of the CrPC, where a notice to appear can be given instead of a warrant of arrest. However, problems come with the delay in such action and the implications of bias arising from the fact that the accused is the police.First, there is a need to clarify the existence of the accused on the list of individuals who have been declared absconding. This should, of course, be recorded in the police force documents, and there should be attempts to apprehend them if they are indeed fugitives.If you have not been served, then take advantage of the fact that it has been 11 months since the FIR was filed, and you can tackle the issue of the chargesheet not being filed. It could also mean sheer neglect or maybe deliberate tarpitting by the police in presenting the charge sheet.To address the situation:Present an affidavit of complaint and/or representation to the superior officer that the investigating officer has not initiated proper action as per the court order and the superior officer’s direction.Go to the High Court either with a contempt petition or a writ petition for direction to the investigating officer to do his job under the law, as it is in regard to the investigation and any subsequent arrests, which should not be made with any prejudice.Indicate that the investigation can be supervised by the court, especially on occasions where police officers are the accused.It is important to note that all telephone and face-to-face communications should be recorded, and there should be an official record of the communication to support the case being presented to the higher authorities and court.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Instead of arresting the accused, the police will now be obliged to issue a \"notice of appearance\" for any offence punishable with imprisonment up to seven years.the notice of appearance casts a duty on the accused person to appear before the police and \"cooperate\" with the investigation. It is only if he fails to comply with the terms of the notice that the question of arresting him will arise.Under the if authorities are still particular about arresting somebody in the first instance, then the police will specially have to give reasons for that in writing in court.This is how the new law liberalizes the arrest provisions:* Section 41A (1) says that in all cases punishable with imprisonment up to seven years, \"the police officer may, instead of arresting the person concerned, issue to him a notice of appearance.\"* Section 41A (3) conveys the import of this far-reaching devise by saying, \"Where such person complies and continues to comply with the notice, he shall not be arrested in respect of the offence referred to in the notice unless, for reasons to be recorded, the police are of the opinion that he ought to be arrested.\"Since notice of appearance is now stipulated in the investigation of all the offences punishable with imprisonment up to seven years, arrest will cease to be an inevitable fallout for accused persons in a wide variety of cognizable cases, including even those that were traditionally classified as  non bailable offences\" ..If the IO is intentionally delaying the arrest with some invalid reason, you can lodge a complaint against the IO before the higher police officer about his conduct and seek intervention....T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Sir,The investigating officer's actions and statements appear inconsistent. Legally, to declare someone absconding, the officer must show that a notice was served and the accused failed to comply. If the accused were working at a police station, the claim of their absconding is questionable.For offences with less than seven years of imprisonment, the officer can issue a notice to appear (Section 41A of the CrPC). If the accused don't comply, they can be arrested without a warrant if necessary.When you meet the superior officer, highlight the inconsistencies in the investigating officer's actions and request clear, written instructions for the arrest. Document the superior officer's order and follow up to ensure compliance.

The balance will be used to pay the maintenance dues if, at all, there is a remaining balance out of the total amounts gained.The court will liaise with the financier for confirmation of the remaining balance of the loan and then seek to be certain that the financier’s claim is sorted out before establishing that of the maintenance payment.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "context": "Asked 12 months ago in Property Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Fraud in property sale",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. It is unusual to issue a General Power of Attorney (GPA) for an ancestral estate without the consent of all legal heirs. Ancestral property generally passes equally to descendants unless a legal document, such as a will, specifies otherwise. If the great-grandfather did not distribute the property to all of his sons, questions may arise about the validity of the GPA.2. Later, if the cousin’s grandfather submitted an undocumented GPA to his child, the legal situation could be more complicated. To avoid disputes in any ancestral property transaction, ensure that property transactions are transparent and include all legal heirs.3. The fact that household taxes were still paid in your grandfather’s real name despite your GPA and sales contract can be used as evidence to challenge the authenticity of these documents. Home tax records can be critical to proving ownership of the property and supporting your legal claims to the property.4. Your real ancestor may legally have the right to claim ownership of the property if the house tax is registered in his name and he can prove his connection to the property for the past 40 years. He can challenge the GPA and the sale deed based on the property’s recorded ownership.In summary, a GPA deed of sale of ancestral property is unacceptable to all legal heirs and can be challenged based on differences in household tax records and your ancestor’s personal property rights. You should consult with a legal professional to explore your options."

    "answer": "Dear Client,It is worthwhile to submit a lawsuit against the registered will of your great-grandfather, both for the properties that he declared as self-acquired and for the properties that he declared as ancestral according to the Hindu ancestral properties act. The basis for your appeal will be that your grandfather failed to divide the properties that rightfully belonged to him, and you think the property stated and described as self-acquired is ancestral in nature.In the case of the ancestral properties, you may claim that the will is unlawful, particularly the distribution of the properties of the deceased, and that your grandfather rightfully deserves a portion of the share in the property.To prove its status as ancestral property, which you believe it to be in this case, you need to bring evidence to court to show that it was wrongly declared self-acquired property in that will and that the testator had an interest in it. This means that inherited property can be challenged only if the claim is made that the property was not, in fact, ancestral as per the will.As with most legal disputes, both parties should produce documents and other relevant evidence that the accuser is telling the truth. To have a strong case on your side, hire a lawyer that focuses on the laws governing inheritances and properties.

    "answer": "How can you continue with such relation? can you force your husband to live with your husband against his wishes and desire? So you cannot continue or can uphold your marriage. It is correct that daughter in law does not have any right in the properties of her in laws ands even your husband too do not have any right in such property of your in laws. Since you are earning then you are not entitled to maintenance rather legally you are liable to provide maintenance to your husband. So it is best for you to get rid from such marriage and opt fordivorce by mutual consenton best available terms.Siddharth SrivastavaAdvocate, Delhi1537 AnswersTalk to Advocate Siddharth Srivastava"

    "question": "Threatened of divorce and being asked to move out",
    "answer": "I am sorry to hear that you are facing such matrimonial issues. Alcohol is very destructive in a relationship. It's important to have an open and honest conversation with your husband alongwith your parents in laws regarding the situations and all possible consequences. it is inferred from your question that your husband age group is of 45-50s yrs.Your parent in laws are threatening you to be thrown out just because your husband drinks alot and your in laws held you being the main reason. so, If you want to work with the relationship, you have to make and convince your in laws that drinking habits of your husband is not because of you and you need to take him to good doctor to make him reformed and restrain from drinking. Mean whilst, your in laws also need to understand that as they are in their advance age, it would be detrimental for themselves too if both of you are dismissed from your home. The threatening decision of the in-laws is only to make both of you to work for relationship and support in their advance aged stage.so, dont worry, work with your relationship, try to convince your husband to visit to a good doctor, in this your in- laws and your family members might play some important role. also, from question, nothing is clear regarding your children and if they are within the vicinity they might play a very convincing role. you may also, seek and suggest to your in laws if you seek divorce, what would be future of your children?Notwithstanding above, harassment that you are facing from your in laws and husband is a kind ofdomestic Violenceand is a punishable offence underDomestic ViolenceAct, which may lend them into trouble and punitive action by the police/ court. yet, it's important to communicate openly and honestly about the issues regarding what is and isn't acceptable behavior. And, if you choose to work on your relationship, make sure that your husband is willing to take responsibility for her actions. From the question, it is not clear that what source of earning and who steers the family boat, as your comments suggest that your husband is not earning, this may be a big reason for his poor drinking habits in the given patriarchal societal norms. Wherein, you may also consider the following:Consider counseling: A trained counselor can help you and in laws effectively and work through any underlying issues.Don't blame each-other: It's important to remember that your husband behaviour may be some situation based or due to strong interference of your parents and no-earning of himself.Wouldn’t you want to know if your husband wants to continue in this marriage or not?Why your husband want divorce, what are reasons, if extra marital relations, of your interference in his drinking habits, or anything else, and hence, you should seek answer to these questions to resolve the problem. Any emotional triggers from your past relationship/ life ?- these questions need to be answered,so that both of you as mature adults can priorities what’s important and either work together for the marriage or move on with your lives going separate.your husband and family has to recognize that all that, if anything that happend in past, has happened is a matter of past and if you are fully emotionally, physically, financially and in all other aspect, are honestly committed to your family and want to make reform to your husband, your in-laws should support you rather than making your life miserable and hence, you should explain whatever problems persist and resolve mutually.Here, your husband may be worried about the financial independence, or he want some form of freedom in the married life and in the present patriarchal society the fabrics of responsibilities are nets around the father. so, both of you have to communicate with yourself and each-other. Try a fresh with focus on the present and try to build a more transparent and communicative relationship in the present. Take this opportunity to work together and strengthen your marriage.Try to follow these commandment answers for a lifetime of happiness and harmony:What are your personal values and beliefs?How do you envision our roles and responsibilities within the marriage?How do you envision the role of family in our relationship?What are your career aspirations, and how do you plan to achieve them?How do you handle stress or challenges in life?How do you handle conflicts or disagreements in a relationship?How do you manage finances and plan for the future?What are your hobbies and interests outside of work?How do you prioritize spending time with family and friends?What are your expectations regarding communication and openness in our relationship?What are your religious or cultural beliefs, and how do they influence your life?How do you see our relationship evolving over time, and what are your thoughts on starting a family?Are there any specific values or traditions that are important to you, and how do you envision incorporating them into our lives together?How do you prioritize personal growth and self-improvement in a relationship?How do you maintain a healthy work-life balance?How do you express love and affection in a relationship?How do you handle differences in opinions or cultural backgrounds?What are your expectations regarding household chores and responsibilities?How do you balance personal space and time with family responsibilities?What are your views on gender equality and mutual respect in marriage?How do you envision supporting each other through life's ups and downs?And if all this failed, then proceed for initiating a case fordomestic Violenceagainst your in-laws and your husband under DV Act, where, not only you will get relief from the domestic miseries but also, your husband has to be pay you maintenance. Also, your, parent in-laws can not absolve from their responsibility and if your husband is not earning, still they have to give some part of property as maintenance/ one time alimony in case of divorce as your husband is going to be heir of the property of your in-laws. Here, though the property (house) may not be an ancestral property, still court may decide in your favour and against wishes of your husband and in-laws and gives you your rightful shares in the property.However, it is suggested that the divorce may be used as matter of last resort. Some legal provisions on maintenance are as discussed below and hence, you can use Section125 Crpcand DV Act for remedy and maintenance from your husband and in-laws along with the right to Selter.The legal provisions are as appended below:-That, the legislations which have been framed on the issue of maintenance are theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, Section 125 of the Cr.P.C. ,1973; and the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005 which provide a statutory remedy to women, irrespective of the religious community to which they belong, apart from the personal laws applicable. theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 by invoking Sections 24 and 25 :Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 Sections 24 and 25 make provision for maintenance to a party who has no independent income sufficient for his or her support, and necessary expenses. This is a gender-neutral provision, where either the wife or the husband may claim maintenance. The prerequisite is that the applicant does not have independent income which is sufficient for her or his support, during the pendency of the lis.Section 24 of the HMA provides for maintenance pendente lite, where the Court may direct the respondent to pay the expenses of the proceeding, and pay such reasonable monthly amount, which is considered to be reasonable, having regard to the income of both the parties. The proviso to Section 24 providing a time line of 60 days for disposal of the application was inserted vide Act 49 of 2001 w.e.f. 24.09.2001.Section 18 provides that a Hindu wife shall be entitled to be maintained by her husband during her lifetime. She is entitled to make a claim for a separate residence, without forfeiting her right to maintenance. Section 18 read in conjunction with Section 23 states the factors required to be considered for deciding the quantum of maintenance to be paid.Under sub-section (2) of Section 18, the husband has the obligation to maintain his wife, even though she may be living separately. The right of separate residence and maintenance would however not be available if the wife has been unchaste, or has converted to another religion.Section 125 of the Cr.P.C The purpose and object of Section 125 Cr.P.C. is to provide immediate relief to an applicant.An application under Section 125 Cr.P.C. is predicated on two conditions : the husband has sufficient means; and “neglects” to maintain his wife, who is unable to maintain herself. In such a case, the husband may be directed by the Magistrate to pay such monthly sum to the wife, as deemed fit. Maintenance is awarded on the basis of the financial capacity of the husband and other relevant factors. Under sub-section (2) of Section 125, the Court is conferred with the discretion to award payment of maintenance either from the date of the order, or from the date of the application. Under the third proviso to the amended Section 125, the application for grant of interim maintenance must be disposed of as far as possible within sixty days’ from the date of service of notice on the respondent.Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005 The D.V. Act provides relief to an aggrieved woman who is subjected to “domestic violence.”1.Sections 17 and 19 grant an entitlement in favour of an aggrieved woman to the right of residence in a “shared household”, irrespective of her having any legal interest in the same or not. From the definition of “aggrieved person” and “respondent”, it is clear that : (a) it is not the requirement of law that the aggrieved person may either own the premises jointly or singly, or by tenanting it jointly or singly; (b) the household may belong to a joint family of which the respondent is a member, irrespective of whether the respondent or the aggrieved person has any right, title, or interest in the shared household; 24 (c) the shared household may either be owned, or tenanted by the respondent singly or jointly.The right to residence u/S. 19 is, however, not an indefeasible right, especially when a daughter-in-law is claiming a right against aged parents-in-law.While granting relief u/S. 12 of the D.V. Act, or in any civil proceeding, the court has to balance the rights between the aggrieved woman and the parents-in-law.Section 20(1)(d) provides that maintenance granted under the D.V. Act to an aggrieved woman and children, would be given effect to, in addition to an order of maintenance awarded under Section 125 of the Cr.P.C., or any other law in force.Under sub-section (6) of Section 20, the Magistrate may direct the employer or debtor of the respondent, to directly pay the aggrieved person, or deposit with the court a portion of the wages or salaries or debt due to or accrued to the credit of the respondent, which amount may be adjusted towards the monetary relief payable by the respondent.Section 22 provides that the Magistrate may pass an order directing the respondent to pay compensation and damages for the injuries, including mental torture and emotional distress, caused by the acts ofdomestic violenceperpetrated by the respondent.Section 26 of the D.V. Act provides that any relief available under Sections 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22 may also be sought in any legal proceeding before a Civil Court, Family Court or Criminal Court.Section 36 provides that the D.V. Act shall be in addition to, and not in derogation of the provisions of any other law for the time being in force. Analysis of the issues (a)Issue of overlapping jurisdiction The Court noticed that while it is true that a party is not precluded from approaching the Court under one or more enactments, since the nature and purpose of the relief under each Act is distinct and independent, it is equally true that the simultaneous operation of these Acts, would lead to multiplicity of proceedings and conflicting orders. This process requires to be streamlined, so that the respondent/husband is not obligated to comply with successive orders of maintenance passed under different enactments. “It is well settled that a wife can make a claim for maintenance under different statutes. For instance, there is no bar to seek maintenance both under the D.V. Act and Section 125 of the Cr.P.C., or under H.M.A. It would, however, be inequitable to direct the husband to pay maintenance under each of the proceedings, independent of the relief granted in a previous proceeding.” hence, that in a subsequent maintenance proceeding, the applicant shall disclose the previous maintenance proceeding, and the orders passed therein, so that the Court would take into consideration the maintenance already awarded in the previous proceeding, and grant an adjustment or set-off of the said amount. \"Note and Disclaimer:-The opinion given here is generic in nature and offered without considering the case on merit and any material facts, hence, if you are proceeding with divorce, or any legal action against your husband and in-laws, you should again consult a lawyer with all the material facts on the case, prior proceeding ahead in the legal battle.Thank you and best wishes for your future wellbeing, hope you resolve your problems at the earliest and come out of all the miseries/ painful life and live happily ever after.Regards,Vivek Bhai PatelAdvocate, New Delhi26 AnswersTalk to Advocate Vivek Bhai Patel"

    "answer": "Dear Client,If you wish to change your daughter’s birth record and ensure that your name is mentioned as the biological father, you will have to go through the proper legal channels. First, visit the Indian Embassy in Bahrain to report the mishap and seek forms, as well as directions on how to go about changing the mentioned birth certificate. Depending on the birth registration process of the Indian mission, they will assist you with the documentary requirement, which normally consists of an affidavit, conclusive DNA results if available, a mother's consent, and her husband's consent, among other documents if need be. After making the first changes in Bahrain, take your daughter to India on an out-pass. After reaching India, it is necessary to go to the registrar of births and deaths with the documents, including the admissible birth certificate obtained from Bahrain, which has to be inscribed with the alterations in Indian records. In this process, you will be able to get her passport with the right parentage information.

    "question": "NOC and Technical Resignation",
    "answer": "Dear Client,When addressing concerns about attending the interview without NOC and joining the new office without proper clearance, you can respond as follows:1. Legal Right to Apply Outside Recruitment: It is stated in the DOPT guidelines that an employee is free to write or apply for any outside recruitment, and the provision is made for four tries in a year. This particular provision makes the reality come through in ways that allow the person to have the chance to look for advancement and training in other organizations.2. Violation of Procedure by Regional Office: Regional office did not approve the NOC because it is a procedural mistake since they are supposed to relay such application to the headquarters. Such a failure does not in any way dampen your rightful authority to seek an application for the position and attend the interview.3. Compliance with Interview Process: Although there was no NOC from previous employer you also appeared for the interview in bonafide and submitted all demanded documents such as experience certificate and vigilance clearance etc. Your contribution to the interview was informed by the perception that you had a right to job as deemed by the legislations.4. Resolution through Technical Resignation: The problem with NOC you rightly pointed out is in line with the local office reason for accepting personal resignation. But now you want technical resignation in order to be compensated fairly for your service in the new office and your service tenure to be correctly calculated in terms of career advancement.5. Request for Fair Consideration: In light of the foregoing, you kindly appeal to the headquarters for a favorable consideration to avail yourself of technical resignation, so that your service in the new company would be acknowledged. This request can be made on the basis of the rights of the employees as listed in the article and which holds salary and other benefits in relation to career advancement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,answering both your queries, here are the steps and considerations:1. Police Complaint: You can take the tenant to police station for the criminal intimidation of your mother as threatened by the tenant. That being said, even without a recording, the incident can still be reported. Trespass could also be another reason because the tenancy has come to an end, and the tenant still occupies the premises without lawful authority.2. Legal Recourse: This pact was notarized rather than being registered and thus it would most probably not be as effective in court. Yet, it is possible to file an eviction suit as a response to the tenant not paying rent along with aggressive behavior.3. Leave and License vs. Rental Agreement:- Leave and License Agreement: Usually provides more control of and to the property to the owner and less time for tenants to the latter. It is a common choice for configuration that is usually temporary, while it can be registered to enhance the obligation’s robustness.- Rental Agreement: Usually grants the tenant more privileges and is best suited for long term use like in leasing.4. Religion: Religion and customs, in general, have no place in justice and legal processes. Focus on the facts: the withdrawal from the agreement, failure to make payments for the rent, and threatening messages.5. Stamp Paper: Scriping an agreement on ₹100 stamp paper is not unusual; however, registering the agreement would help in giving it a better legal protection.In conclusion, do file a complaint to police regarding intimidation and trespassing and also consult a legal expert to commence eviction process.Hope this helps!Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Tenant not vacating the property, not paying rent, nor responding to calls",
    "answer": "The definition of the leave and license agreement can be found in the Indian Easements Act, 1882. Section 52 of the Indian Easements Act states:Where one person grants to another, or to a definite number of other persons, a right to do, or continue to do, in or upon the immovable property of the grantor, something which would, in the absence of such right, be unlawful and such right does not amount to an easement or an interest in the property, the right is called a license.According to the Supreme Court (SC), if a leave and license agreement permits only the usage of a property in a specific way or under specific terms, while it is in the possession and control of the owner, it will be a license. This means that no interest in the property is transferred to the tenant.So the owner of the property still maintains legal possession of his or her property. The Supreme Court states, “The legal possession, thereof, continues to be with the owner of the property but the licensee is permitted to make use of the premises for a particular purpose. But for this permission, his occupation would be unlawful. It does not create in his favor any estate or interest in the property.’As there is no easement right granted, the landlord of the property can revoke the permission granted to the tenant at any time. The landlord can choose to let out his property for short periods by working out a leave and license rental agreement. This benefits tenants as well as they will not have to give extended notice periods when they want to vacate a property.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Although a Leave and License (L&L) agreement does not give the licensee legal possession or interest in the property, taking a unilateral action such as closing the store can cause legal complications Reason Here are a few reasons:1. RISK OF CLAIMS: The licensee may file a criminal complaint for wrongful imprisonment, trespassing, or intimidation. This could lead to police action and legal trouble for you.2. State law action: The licensee may seek relief from the court, such as an order to remove the device and restore access. This could lead to a prolonged legal battle and damage to any claimed losses.3. Court Approach: Courts generally dislike self-help arrangements and prefer to resolve disputes through legal means. Unilateral actions could be viewed as taking the law into their own hands, which the courts would not look kindly upon.4. Evidence and Procedure: Although the L&L Agreement is clear, you must pursue legal eviction to avoid any charges of eviction which is illegal. For these reasons, legal removal through the courts is necessary to avoid these potential issues."

    "question": "Car being attached for not paying maintenance to wife under DV act",
    "answer": "Dear Client,If the court orders the attachment of your car for non-payment of interim maintenance, the procedure is as follows:1. Attachment Order: You, the financier, and the court are informed of the attachment order in relation to your property.2. Hypothecation: Since the car is hypothecated with the financier taking the risk, the financier’s interest will be considered. It nullifies any other interest the financier may have on the vehicle because of the loan granted.3. Auction: The court can sell the car, but what is usually realised must be paid to the financier in the balance of the loan. The balance will be used to pay the maintenance dues if, at all, there is a remaining balance out of the total amounts gained.The court will liaise with the financier for confirmation of the remaining balance of the loan and then seek to be certain that the financier’s claim is sorted out before establishing that of the maintenance payment.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Fraud in property sale",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. It is unusual to issue a General Power of Attorney (GPA) for an ancestral estate without the consent of all legal heirs. Ancestral property generally passes equally to descendants unless a legal document, such as a will, specifies otherwise. If the great-grandfather did not distribute the property to all of his sons, questions may arise about the validity of the GPA.2. Later, if the cousin’s grandfather submitted an undocumented GPA to his child, the legal situation could be more complicated. To avoid disputes in any ancestral property transaction, ensure that property transactions are transparent and include all legal heirs.3. The fact that household taxes were still paid in your grandfather’s real name despite your GPA and sales contract can be used as evidence to challenge the authenticity of these documents. Home tax records can be critical to proving ownership of the property and supporting your legal claims to the property.4. Your real ancestor may legally have the right to claim ownership of the property if the house tax is registered in his name and he can prove his connection to the property for the past 40 years. He can challenge the GPA and the sale deed based on the property’s recorded ownership.In summary, a GPA deed of sale of ancestral property is unacceptable to all legal heirs and can be challenged based on differences in household tax records and your ancestor’s personal property rights. You should consult with a legal professional to explore your options."

    "answer": "Dear Client,It is worthwhile to submit a lawsuit against the registered will of your great-grandfather, both for the properties that he declared as self-acquired and for the properties that he declared as ancestral according to the Hindu ancestral properties act. The basis for your appeal will be that your grandfather failed to divide the properties that rightfully belonged to him, and you think the property stated and described as self-acquired is ancestral in nature.In the case of the ancestral properties, you may claim that the will is unlawful, particularly the distribution of the properties of the deceased, and that your grandfather rightfully deserves a portion of the share in the property.To prove its status as ancestral property, which you believe it to be in this case, you need to bring evidence to court to show that it was wrongly declared self-acquired property in that will and that the testator had an interest in it. This means that inherited property can be challenged only if the claim is made that the property was not, in fact, ancestral as per the will.As with most legal disputes, both parties should produce documents and other relevant evidence that the accuser is telling the truth. To have a strong case on your side, hire a lawyer that focuses on the laws governing inheritances and properties. They will help you with the legal procedure and ensure the possibility of a challenge is high.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Legal Right to Apply Outside Recruitment: It is stated in the DOPT guidelines that an employee is free to write or apply for any outside recruitment, and the provision is made for four tries in a year. This particular provision makes the reality come through in ways that allow the person to have the chance to look for advancement and training in other organizations.2. Violation of Procedure by Regional Office: Regional office did not approve the NOC because it is a procedural mistake since they are supposed to relay such application to the headquarters. Such a failure does not in any way dampen your rightful authority to seek an application for the position and attend the interview.3. Compliance with Interview Process: Although there was no NOC from previous employer you also appeared for the interview in bonafide and submitted all demanded documents such as experience certificate and vigilance clearance etc. Your contribution to the interview was informed by the perception that you had a right to job as deemed by the legislations.4. Resolution through Technical Resignation: The problem with NOC you rightly pointed out is in line with the local office reason for accepting personal resignation. But now you want technical resignation in order to be compensated fairly for your service in the new office and your service tenure to be correctly calculated in terms of career advancement.5. Request for Fair Consideration: In light of the foregoing, you kindly appeal to the headquarters for a favorable consideration to avail yourself of technical resignation, so that your service in the new company would be acknowledged.

    "answer": "Dear Client,answering both your queries, here are the steps and considerations:1. Police Complaint: You can take the tenant to police station for the criminal intimidation of your mother as threatened by the tenant. That being said, even without a recording, the incident can still be reported. Trespass could also be another reason because the tenancy has come to an end, and the tenant still occupies the premises without lawful authority.2. Legal Recourse: This pact was notarized rather than being registered and thus it would most probably not be as effective in court. Yet, it is possible to file an eviction suit as a response to the tenant not paying rent along with aggressive behavior.3. Leave and License vs. Rental Agreement:- Leave and License Agreement: Usually provides more control of and to the property to the owner and less time for tenants to the latter. It is a common choice for configuration that is usually temporary, while it can be registered to enhance the obligation’s robustness.- Rental Agreement: Usually grants the tenant more privileges and is best suited for long term use like in leasing.4. Religion: Religion and customs, in general, have no place in justice and legal processes. Focus on the facts: the withdrawal from the agreement, failure to make payments for the rent, and threatening messages.5. Stamp Paper: Scriping an agreement on ₹100 stamp paper is not unusual; however, registering the agreement would help in giving it a better legal protection.In conclusion, do file a complaint to police regarding intimidation and trespassing and also consult a legal expert to commence eviction process.Hope this helps!Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Tenant not vacating the property, not paying rent, nor responding to calls",
    "answer": "The definition of the leave and license agreement can be found in the Indian Easements Act, 1882. Section 52 of the Indian Easements Act states:Where one person grants to another, or to a definite number of other persons, a right to do, or continue to do, in or upon the immovable property of the grantor, something which would, in the absence of such right, be unlawful and such right does not amount to an easement or an interest in the property, the right is called a license.According to the Supreme Court (SC), if a leave and license agreement permits only the usage of a property in a specific way or under specific terms, while it is in the possession and control of the owner, it will be a license. This means that no interest in the property is transferred to the tenant.So the owner of the property still maintains legal possession of his or her property. The Supreme Court states, “The legal possession, thereof, continues to be with the owner of the property but the licensee is permitted to make use of the premises for a particular purpose. But for this permission, his occupation would be unlawful. It does not create in his favor any estate or interest in the property.’As there is no easement right granted, the landlord of the property can revoke the permission granted to the tenant at any time. The landlord can choose to let out his property for short periods by working out a leave and license rental agreement. This benefits tenants as well as they will not have to give extended notice periods when they want to vacate a property.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Although a Leave and License (L&L) agreement does not give the licensee legal possession or interest in the property, taking a unilateral action such as closing the store can cause legal complications Reason Here are a few reasons:1. RISK OF CLAIMS: The licensee may file a criminal complaint for wrongful imprisonment, trespassing, or intimidation. This could lead to police action and legal trouble for you.2. State law action: The licensee may seek relief from the court, such as an order to remove the device and restore access. This could lead to a prolonged legal battle and damage to any claimed losses.3. Court Approach: Courts generally dislike self-help arrangements and prefer to resolve disputes through legal means. Unilateral actions could be viewed as taking the law into their own hands, which the courts would not look kindly upon.4. Evidence and Procedure: Although the L&L Agreement is clear, you must pursue legal eviction to avoid any charges of eviction which is illegal. For these reasons, legal removal through the courts is necessary to avoid these potential issues."

    "question": "Index of charges for builder",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Yes, it is very important to download the index of charges for the builder, Sobha Limited, from the Registrar of Companies. It shows details on any claims or legal liens on the builder’s property that include the under-construction flat that you are planning to purchase. This assists in establishing that you are unaware of any pending legal or financial issues that may hinder your ability to own the property.Interpreting the Index of Charges involves checking:Whether there are any liabilities, such as loans or mortgages, that are still possibly owed against the builder’s property.If there are several charges, their sequence as well as the priority of the charges are mentioned. to make sure the particular project is not rendering the flat a security.If the index includes existing charges, then it is very crucial to confirm that the mentioned charges will be dropped at the time of payment only. It is important to do this so that if any legal or financial problems occur in the future, they can be addressed before it’s too late.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,If the court orders the attachment of your car for non-payment of interim maintenance, the procedure is as follows:1. Attachment Order: You, the financier, and the court are informed of the attachment order in relation to your property.2. Hypothecation: Since the car is hypothecated with the financier taking the risk, the financier’s interest will be considered. It nullifies any other interest the financier may have on the vehicle because of the loan granted.3. Auction: The court can sell the car, but what is usually realised must be paid to the financier in the balance of the loan. The balance will be used to pay the maintenance dues if, at all, there is a remaining balance out of the total amounts gained.The court will liaise with the financier for confirmation of the remaining balance of the loan and then seek to be certain that the financier’s claim is sorted out before establishing that of the maintenance payment.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Fraud in property sale",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. It is unusual to issue a General Power of Attorney (GPA) for an ancestral estate without the consent of all legal heirs. Ancestral property generally passes equally to descendants unless a legal document, such as a will, specifies otherwise. If the great-grandfather did not distribute the property to all of his sons, questions may arise about the validity of the GPA.2. Later, if the cousin’s grandfather submitted an undocumented GPA to his child, the legal situation could be more complicated. To avoid disputes in any ancestral property transaction, ensure that property transactions are transparent and include all legal heirs.3. The fact that household taxes were still paid in your grandfather’s real name despite your GPA and sales contract can be used as evidence to challenge the authenticity of these documents. Home tax records can be critical to proving ownership of the property and supporting your legal claims to the property.4. Your real ancestor may legally have the right to claim ownership of the property if the house tax is registered in his name and he can prove his connection to the property for the past 40 years. He can challenge the GPA and the sale deed based on the property’s recorded ownership.In summary, a GPA deed of sale of ancestral property is unacceptable to all legal heirs and can be challenged based on differences in household tax records and your ancestor’s personal property rights. You should consult with a legal professional to explore your options."

    "question": "Fraud in property sale",
    "answer": "Dear Client,It is worthwhile to submit a lawsuit against the registered will of your great-grandfather, both for the properties that he declared as self-acquired and for the properties that he declared as ancestral according to the Hindu ancestral properties act. The basis for your appeal will be that your grandfather failed to divide the properties that rightfully belonged to him, and you think the property stated and described as self-acquired is ancestral in nature.In the case of the ancestral properties, you may claim that the will is unlawful, particularly the distribution of the properties of the deceased, and that your grandfather rightfully deserves a portion of the share in the property.To prove its status as ancestral property, which you believe it to be in this case, you need to bring evidence to court to show that it was wrongly declared self-acquired property in that will and that the testator had an interest in it. This means that inherited property can be challenged only if the claim is made that the property was not, in fact, ancestral as per the will.As with most legal disputes, both parties should produce documents and other relevant evidence that the accuser is telling the truth. To have a strong case on your side, hire a lawyer that focuses on the laws governing inheritances and properties. They will help you with the legal procedure and ensure the possibility of a challenge is high.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The investigating officer is correct that offences that are triable only for imprisonment for a term of less than seven years sometimes come as a category of offences that fall under Section 41A of the CrPC, where a notice to appear can be given instead of a warrant of arrest. However, problems come with the delay in such action and the implications of bias arising from the fact that the accused is the police.First, there is a need to clarify the existence of the accused on the list of individuals who have been declared absconding. This should, of course, be recorded in the police force documents, and there should be attempts to apprehend them if they are indeed fugitives.If you have not been served, then take advantage of the fact that it has been 11 months since the FIR was filed, and you can tackle the issue of the chargesheet not being filed. It could also mean sheer neglect or maybe deliberate tarpitting by the police in presenting the charge sheet.To address the situation:Present an affidavit of complaint and/or representation to the superior officer that the investigating officer has not initiated proper action as per the court order and the superior officer’s direction.Go to the High Court either with a contempt petition or a writ petition for direction to the investigating officer to do his job under the law, as it is in regard to the investigation and any subsequent arrests, which should not be made with any prejudice.Indicate that the investigation can be supervised by the court, especially on occasions where police officers are the accused.It is important to note that all telephone and face-to-face communications should be recorded, and there should be an official record of the communication to support the case being presented to the higher authorities and court.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Sir,The investigating officer's actions and statements appear inconsistent. Legally, to declare someone absconding, the officer must show that a notice was served and the accused failed to comply. If the accused were working at a police station, the claim of their absconding is questionable.For offences with less than seven years of imprisonment, the officer can issue a notice to appear (Section 41A of the CrPC). If the accused don't comply, they can be arrested without a warrant if necessary.When you meet the superior officer, highlight the inconsistencies in the investigating officer's actions and request clear, written instructions for the arrest. Document the superior officer's order and follow up to ensure compliance. If the investigating officer still doesn't comply, consider escalating the matter to higher authorities or the judiciary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Yes, the investigating officer needs to take steps to arrest the two accused who have been identified as absconding. As per theIndian Penal Code(IPC) and Criminal Code (CrPC), the investigating officer is responsible for ensuring the arrest and prosecution of all the accused.Aspects of the FIR are serious and call for thorough investigation and arrest of all the accused. In the case of an accused who is absconding but not cooperating, the investigating officer should also consider arrest if non-cooperation hampers the investigation, as provided under CrPC. Failure to cooperate to ensure the smooth running of the investigation may be valid grounds for arrest.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The investigating officer is correct that offences that are triable only for imprisonment for a term of less than seven years sometimes come as a category of offences that fall under Section 41A of the CrPC, where a notice to appear can be given instead of a warrant of arrest. However, problems come with the delay in such action and the implications of bias arising from the fact that the accused is the police.First, there is a need to clarify the existence of the accused on the list of individuals who have been declared absconding. This should, of course, be recorded in the police force documents, and there should be attempts to apprehend them if they are indeed fugitives.If you have not been served, then take advantage of the fact that it has been 11 months since the FIR was filed, and you can tackle the issue of the chargesheet not being filed. It could also mean sheer neglect or maybe deliberate tarpitting by the police in presenting the charge sheet.To address the situation:Present an affidavit of complaint and/or representation to the superior officer that the investigating officer has not initiated proper action as per the court order and the superior officer’s direction.Go to the High Court either with a contempt petition or a writ petition for direction to the investigating officer to do his job under the law, as it is in regard to the investigation and any subsequent arrests, which should not be made with any prejudice.Indicate that the investigation can be supervised by the court, especially on occasions where police officers are the accused.It is important to note that all telephone and face-to-face communications should be recorded, and there should be an official record of the communication to support the case being presented to the higher authorities and court.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Instead of arresting the accused, the police will now be obliged to issue a \"notice of appearance\" for any offence punishable with imprisonment up to seven years.the notice of appearance casts a duty on the accused person to appear before the police and \"cooperate\" with the investigation. It is only if he fails to comply with the terms of the notice that the question of arresting him will arise.Under the if authorities are still particular about arresting somebody in the first instance, then the police will specially have to give reasons for that in writing in court.This is how the new law liberalizes the arrest provisions:* Section 41A (1) says that in all cases punishable with imprisonment up to seven years, \"the police officer may, instead of arresting the person concerned, issue to him a notice of appearance.\"* Section 41A (3) conveys the import of this far-reaching devise by saying, \"Where such person complies and continues to comply with the notice, he shall not be arrested in respect of the offence referred to in the notice unless, for reasons to be recorded, the police are of the opinion that he ought to be arrested.\"Since notice of appearance is now stipulated in the investigation of all the offences punishable with imprisonment up to seven years, arrest will cease to be an inevitable fallout for accused persons in a wide variety of cognizable cases, including even those that were traditionally classified as  non bailable offences\" ..If the IO is intentionally delaying the arrest with some invalid reason, you can lodge a complaint against the IO before the higher police officer about his conduct and seek intervention....T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "NOC and Technical Resignation",
    "answer": "Dear Client,When addressing concerns about attending the interview without NOC and joining the new office without proper clearance, you can respond as follows:1. Legal Right to Apply Outside Recruitment: It is stated in the DOPT guidelines that an employee is free to write or apply for any outside recruitment, and the provision is made for four tries in a year. This particular provision makes the reality come through in ways that allow the person to have the chance to look for advancement and training in other organizations.2. Violation of Procedure by Regional Office: Regional office did not approve the NOC because it is a procedural mistake since they are supposed to relay such application to the headquarters. Such a failure does not in any way dampen your rightful authority to seek an application for the position and attend the interview.3. Compliance with Interview Process: Although there was no NOC from previous employer you also appeared for the interview in bonafide and submitted all demanded documents such as experience certificate and vigilance clearance etc. Your contribution to the interview was informed by the perception that you had a right to job as deemed by the legislations.4. Resolution through Technical Resignation: The problem with NOC you rightly pointed out is in line with the local office reason for accepting personal resignation. But now you want technical resignation in order to be compensated fairly for your service in the new office and your service tenure to be correctly calculated in terms of career advancement.5. Request for Fair Consideration: In light of the foregoing, you kindly appeal to the headquarters for a favorable consideration to avail yourself of technical resignation, so that your service in the new company would be acknowledged. This request can be made on the basis of the rights of the employees as listed in the article and which holds salary and other benefits in relation to career advancement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The balance will be used to pay the maintenance dues if, at all, there is a remaining balance out of the total amounts gained.The court will liaise with the financier for confirmation of the remaining balance of the loan and then seek to be certain that the financier’s claim is sorted out before establishing that of the maintenance payment.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "- As per law, after the expiry of the leave and license agreement , then tenancy will be considered as month to month basis, and the tenant is under obligation to pay the rent regularly every month.- Further, if the tenant not pay the rent , then the landlord having his right to evict him from the tenanted premises and to recover the arrears of rent.- Your mother can issue a legal notice to him for the termination of the tenancy , and further mention that after getting the notice if he not vacated , then his possession in the property would be considered as trespasser.- Further, she can lodge a complaint before the police for the offence of trespassing , however the police has no power to evict him being a civil dispute.- The said leave and license agreement is valid as it was 11 months.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Tenant not vacating the property, not paying rent, nor responding to calls",
    "answer": "Dear Client,answering both your queries, here are the steps and considerations:1. Police Complaint: You can take the tenant to police station for the criminal intimidation of your mother as threatened by the tenant. That being said, even without a recording, the incident can still be reported. Trespass could also be another reason because the tenancy has come to an end, and the tenant still occupies the premises without lawful authority.2. Legal Recourse: This pact was notarized rather than being registered and thus it would most probably not be as effective in court. Yet, it is possible to file an eviction suit as a response to the tenant not paying rent along with aggressive behavior.3. Leave and License vs. Rental Agreement:- Leave and License Agreement: Usually provides more control of and to the property to the owner and less time for tenants to the latter. It is a common choice for configuration that is usually temporary, while it can be registered to enhance the obligation’s robustness.- Rental Agreement: Usually grants the tenant more privileges and is best suited for long term use like in leasing.4. Religion: Religion and customs, in general, have no place in justice and legal processes. Focus on the facts: the withdrawal from the agreement, failure to make payments for the rent, and threatening messages.5. Stamp Paper: Scriping an agreement on ₹100 stamp paper is not unusual; however, registering the agreement would help in giving it a better legal protection.In conclusion, do file a complaint to police regarding intimidation and trespassing and also consult a legal expert to commence eviction process.Hope this helps!Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Tenant not vacating the property, not paying rent, nor responding to calls",
    "answer": "The definition of the leave and license agreement can be found in the Indian Easements Act, 1882. Section 52 of the Indian Easements Act states:Where one person grants to another, or to a definite number of other persons, a right to do, or continue to do, in or upon the immovable property of the grantor, something which would, in the absence of such right, be unlawful and such right does not amount to an easement or an interest in the property, the right is called a license.According to the Supreme Court (SC), if a leave and license agreement permits only the usage of a property in a specific way or under specific terms, while it is in the possession and control of the owner, it will be a license. This means that no interest in the property is transferred to the tenant.So the owner of the property still maintains legal possession of his or her property. The Supreme Court states, “The legal possession, thereof, continues to be with the owner of the property but the licensee is permitted to make use of the premises for a particular purpose. But for this permission, his occupation would be unlawful. It does not create in his favor any estate or interest in the property.’As there is no easement right granted, the landlord of the property can revoke the permission granted to the tenant at any time. The landlord can choose to let out his property for short periods by working out a leave and license rental agreement. This benefits tenants as well as they will not have to give extended notice periods when they want to vacate a property.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Although a Leave and License (L&L) agreement does not give the licensee legal possession or interest in the property, taking a unilateral action such as closing the store can cause legal complications Reason Here are a few reasons:1. RISK OF CLAIMS: The licensee may file a criminal complaint for wrongful imprisonment, trespassing, or intimidation. This could lead to police action and legal trouble for you.2. State law action: The licensee may seek relief from the court, such as an order to remove the device and restore access. This could lead to a prolonged legal battle and damage to any claimed losses.3. Court Approach: Courts generally dislike self-help arrangements and prefer to resolve disputes through legal means. Unilateral actions could be viewed as taking the law into their own hands, which the courts would not look kindly upon.4. Evidence and Procedure: Although the L&L Agreement is clear, you must pursue legal eviction to avoid any charges of eviction which is illegal. For these reasons, legal removal through the courts is necessary to avoid these potential issues."

    "answer": "Dear Client,The investigating officer is correct that offences that are triable only for imprisonment for a term of less than seven years sometimes come as a category of offences that fall under Section 41A of the CrPC, where a notice to appear can be given instead of a warrant of arrest. However, problems come with the delay in such action and the implications of bias arising from the fact that the accused is the police.First, there is a need to clarify the existence of the accused on the list of individuals who have been declared absconding. This should, of course, be recorded in the police force documents, and there should be attempts to apprehend them if they are indeed fugitives.If you have not been served, then take advantage of the fact that it has been 11 months since the FIR was filed, and you can tackle the issue of the chargesheet not being filed. It could also mean sheer neglect or maybe deliberate tarpitting by the police in presenting the charge sheet.To address the situation:Present an affidavit of complaint and/or representation to the superior officer that the investigating officer has not initiated proper action as per the court order and the superior officer’s direction.Go to the High Court either with a contempt petition or a writ petition for direction to the investigating officer to do his job under the law, as it is in regard to the investigation and any subsequent arrests, which should not be made with any prejudice.Indicate that the investigation can be supervised by the court, especially on occasions where police officers are the accused.It is important to note that all telephone and face-to-face communications should be recorded, and there should be an official record of the communication to support the case being presented to the higher authorities and court.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Instead of arresting the accused, the police will now be obliged to issue a \"notice of appearance\" for any offence punishable with imprisonment up to seven years.the notice of appearance casts a duty on the accused person to appear before the police and \"cooperate\" with the investigation. It is only if he fails to comply with the terms of the notice that the question of arresting him will arise.Under the if authorities are still particular about arresting somebody in the first instance, then the police will specially have to give reasons for that in writing in court.This is how the new law liberalizes the arrest provisions:* Section 41A (1) says that in all cases punishable with imprisonment up to seven years, \"the police officer may, instead of arresting the person concerned, issue to him a notice of appearance.\"* Section 41A (3) conveys the import of this far-reaching devise by saying, \"Where such person complies and continues to comply with the notice, he shall not be arrested in respect of the offence referred to in the notice unless, for reasons to be recorded, the police are of the opinion that he ought to be arrested.\"Since notice of appearance is now stipulated in the investigation of all the offences punishable with imprisonment up to seven years, arrest will cease to be an inevitable fallout for accused persons in a wide variety of cognizable cases, including even those that were traditionally classified as  non bailable offences\" ..If the IO is intentionally delaying the arrest with some invalid reason, you can lodge a complaint against the IO before the higher police officer about his conduct and seek intervention....T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Sir,The investigating officer's actions and statements appear inconsistent. Legally, to declare someone absconding, the officer must show that a notice was served and the accused failed to comply. If the accused were working at a police station, the claim of their absconding is questionable.For offences with less than seven years of imprisonment, the officer can issue a notice to appear (Section 41A of the CrPC). If the accused don't comply, they can be arrested without a warrant if necessary.When you meet the superior officer, highlight the inconsistencies in the investigating officer's actions and request clear, written instructions for the arrest. Document the superior officer's order and follow up to ensure compliance. If the investigating officer still doesn't comply, consider escalating the matter to higher authorities or the judiciary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Yes, the investigating officer needs to take steps to arrest the two accused who have been identified as absconding. As per theIndian Penal Code(IPC) and Criminal Code (CrPC), the investigating officer is responsible for ensuring the arrest and prosecution of all the accused.Aspects of the FIR are serious and call for thorough investigation and arrest of all the accused. In the case of an accused who is absconding but not cooperating, the investigating officer should also consider arrest if non-cooperation hampers the investigation, as provided under CrPC.

    "answer": "Dear Client,The investigating officer is correct that offences that are triable only for imprisonment for a term of less than seven years sometimes come as a category of offences that fall under Section 41A of the CrPC, where a notice to appear can be given instead of a warrant of arrest. However, problems come with the delay in such action and the implications of bias arising from the fact that the accused is the police.First, there is a need to clarify the existence of the accused on the list of individuals who have been declared absconding. This should, of course, be recorded in the police force documents, and there should be attempts to apprehend them if they are indeed fugitives.If you have not been served, then take advantage of the fact that it has been 11 months since the FIR was filed, and you can tackle the issue of the chargesheet not being filed. It could also mean sheer neglect or maybe deliberate tarpitting by the police in presenting the charge sheet.To address the situation:Present an affidavit of complaint and/or representation to the superior officer that the investigating officer has not initiated proper action as per the court order and the superior officer’s direction.Go to the High Court either with a contempt petition or a writ petition for direction to the investigating officer to do his job under the law, as it is in regard to the investigation and any subsequent arrests, which should not be made with any prejudice.Indicate that the investigation can be supervised by the court, especially on occasions where police officers are the accused.It is important to note that all telephone and face-to-face communications should be recorded, and there should be an official record of the communication to support the case being presented to the higher authorities and court.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Instead of arresting the accused, the police will now be obliged to issue a \"notice of appearance\" for any offence punishable with imprisonment up to seven years.the notice of appearance casts a duty on the accused person to appear before the police and \"cooperate\" with the investigation. It is only if he fails to comply with the terms of the notice that the question of arresting him will arise.Under the if authorities are still particular about arresting somebody in the first instance, then the police will specially have to give reasons for that in writing in court.This is how the new law liberalizes the arrest provisions:* Section 41A (1) says that in all cases punishable with imprisonment up to seven years, \"the police officer may, instead of arresting the person concerned, issue to him a notice of appearance.\"* Section 41A (3) conveys the import of this far-reaching devise by saying, \"Where such person complies and continues to comply with the notice, he shall not be arrested in respect of the offence referred to in the notice unless, for reasons to be recorded, the police are of the opinion that he ought to be arrested.\"Since notice of appearance is now stipulated in the investigation of all the offences punishable with imprisonment up to seven years, arrest will cease to be an inevitable fallout for accused persons in a wide variety of cognizable cases, including even those that were traditionally classified as  non bailable offences\" ..If the IO is intentionally delaying the arrest with some invalid reason, you can lodge a complaint against the IO before the higher police officer about his conduct and seek intervention....T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Sir,The investigating officer's actions and statements appear inconsistent. Legally, to declare someone absconding, the officer must show that a notice was served and the accused failed to comply. If the accused were working at a police station, the claim of their absconding is questionable.For offences with less than seven years of imprisonment, the officer can issue a notice to appear (Section 41A of the CrPC). If the accused don't comply, they can be arrested without a warrant if necessary.When you meet the superior officer, highlight the inconsistencies in the investigating officer's actions and request clear, written instructions for the arrest. Document the superior officer's order and follow up to ensure compliance.

    "answer": "- There is no provision in CrPC that for the offence whose punishment is less than 7 years is bailable i.e. Police cannot arrest- It is looking that the I.O. is malafidely avoiding arresting of the accused, hence in stead of approaching the higher police official , you should approach the court of law.- You can move an application before the judicial magistrate for know the status of investigation and to arrest the remaining two accused in the case.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Firstly, it is important to understand that the best course of action is to realise that one has most likely, however, become a staking victim of a scam. The famous tendency that scammers use is to ask for a small amount of money compared to the promised sum, and after that, they vanish. In light of the services discussed in this paper, this complicates the problem as we try to find a solution for it.From a legal point of view, web-based selling of sexual services, including cam shows, is completely legal and may be unlawful in some contexts or in certain countries or states. In many places, such transactions remain either unlawful or, at the very least, are vague and without a clearly defined legal status, which often makes it almost impossible for a buyer to seek compensation for the alleged fraud through legal means.Filing a Complaint and Chargeback:Filing a Complaint and Chargeback:NPCI and Bank Chargeback: You can apply for a chargeback with NPCI or apply directly with the bank However, one must note that banks often need a valid reason for processing chargebacks or reversing a transaction. Specifically for the type of payment you received and the service being offered, it can be challenging without jeopardising the legal aspects of the case to defend your stand, let alone admit to prostitution.Consumer Forums: There are solutions available for reporting instances of online fraud the consumer forums or the helpline number, but these may not be the most effective option for challenging issues related to adult services because of said legal ambiguities.Reporting the Scam:This way, you have to be careful when reporting the scam, considering the legal consequences of doing so. However, returning the money to the person is the main focus, and the revelation of the details of the transaction can have negative repercussions. In some jurisdictions, just confessing to attempt to access such services or participating in such a service supplier.Alternative Steps:Cease Further Contact: It means that one should cut any ties to the individual to avoid further financial losses or getting caught up in such a situation.Privacy and Security: However, it is recommended to use the slot at the hotel or any other private location that will guarantee the privacy and security of the individuals involved. If the scammer has any of your details, then even you might be at risk of identity theft or more attempts to con you.Awareness and Caution: To do this, one may argue that it is pertinent to draw lessons from this experience for future occurrences to be more careful. Do not buy or seek services from company or persons whose legal nature of business is questionable or not well defined.Consult a Legal Advisor: Before proceeding any further with the steps outlined on this web site to report the issue or to file for a chargeback, one must seek the advice of a lawyer. They can then recommend which legal route to take with the case while taking into consideration your own circumstances.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Yes, the investigating officer needs to take steps to arrest the two accused who have been identified as absconding. As per theIndian Penal Code(IPC) and Criminal Code (CrPC), the investigating officer is responsible for ensuring the arrest and prosecution of all the accused.Aspects of the FIR are serious and call for thorough investigation and arrest of all the accused. In the case of an accused who is absconding but not cooperating, the investigating officer should also consider arrest if non-cooperation hampers the investigation, as provided under CrPC. Failure to cooperate to ensure the smooth running of the investigation may be valid grounds for arrest.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The investigating officer is correct that offences that are triable only for imprisonment for a term of less than seven years sometimes come as a category of offences that fall under Section 41A of the CrPC, where a notice to appear can be given instead of a warrant of arrest. However, problems come with the delay in such action and the implications of bias arising from the fact that the accused is the police.First, there is a need to clarify the existence of the accused on the list of individuals who have been declared absconding. This should, of course, be recorded in the police force documents, and there should be attempts to apprehend them if they are indeed fugitives.If you have not been served, then take advantage of the fact that it has been 11 months since the FIR was filed, and you can tackle the issue of the chargesheet not being filed. It could also mean sheer neglect or maybe deliberate tarpitting by the police in presenting the charge sheet.To address the situation:Present an affidavit of complaint and/or representation to the superior officer that the investigating officer has not initiated proper action as per the court order and the superior officer’s direction.Go to the High Court either with a contempt petition or a writ petition for direction to the investigating officer to do his job under the law, as it is in regard to the investigation and any subsequent arrests, which should not be made with any prejudice.Indicate that the investigation can be supervised by the court, especially on occasions where police officers are the accused.It is important to note that all telephone and face-to-face communications should be recorded, and there should be an official record of the communication to support the case being presented to the higher authorities and court.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Instead of arresting the accused, the police will now be obliged to issue a \"notice of appearance\" for any offence punishable with imprisonment up to seven years.the notice of appearance casts a duty on the accused person to appear before the police and \"cooperate\" with the investigation. It is only if he fails to comply with the terms of the notice that the question of arresting him will arise.Under the if authorities are still particular about arresting somebody in the first instance, then the police will specially have to give reasons for that in writing in court.This is how the new law liberalizes the arrest provisions:* Section 41A (1) says that in all cases punishable with imprisonment up to seven years, \"the police officer may, instead of arresting the person concerned, issue to him a notice of appearance.\"* Section 41A (3) conveys the import of this far-reaching devise by saying, \"Where such person complies and continues to comply with the notice, he shall not be arrested in respect of the offence referred to in the notice unless, for reasons to be recorded, the police are of the opinion that he ought to be arrested.\"Since notice of appearance is now stipulated in the investigation of all the offences punishable with imprisonment up to seven years, arrest will cease to be an inevitable fallout for accused persons in a wide variety of cognizable cases, including even those that were traditionally classified as  non bailable offences\" ..If the IO is intentionally delaying the arrest with some invalid reason, you can lodge a complaint against the IO before the higher police officer about his conduct and seek intervention....T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Sir,The investigating officer's actions and statements appear inconsistent. Legally, to declare someone absconding, the officer must show that a notice was served and the accused failed to comply. If the accused were working at a police station, the claim of their absconding is questionable.For offences with less than seven years of imprisonment, the officer can issue a notice to appear (Section 41A of the CrPC). If the accused don't comply, they can be arrested without a warrant if necessary.When you meet the superior officer, highlight the inconsistencies in the investigating officer's actions and request clear, written instructions for the arrest. Document the superior officer's order and follow up to ensure compliance. If the investigating officer still doesn't comply, consider escalating the matter to higher authorities or the judiciary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "- There is no provision in CrPC that for the offence whose punishment is less than 7 years is bailable i.e. Police cannot arrest- It is looking that the I.O. is malafidely avoiding arresting of the accused, hence in stead of approaching the higher police official , you should approach the court of law.- You can move an application before the judicial magistrate for know the status of investigation and to arrest the remaining two accused in the case.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

If the tenant fails to appear on the date fixed or gives a statement that he is not willing to purchase the land, the Tribunal shall make a declaration accordingly in writing. If the tenant is wiling to purchase the land, the Tribunal will determine according to the provisions of Sections 32-H and 63-A(3) the purchase price of the land after holding an enquiry and after hearing the parties concerned. The value of the land fixed by taking into consideration all the prescribed factors will be scaled down to the maximum, if it exceeds the maximum, or scaled up to the minimum, if it is less than the minimum.8. Provision is made in Section 32-K for payment of the purchase price. A permanent tenant has to deposit the entire amount with the Agricultural Lands Tribunal within one year from such date as may be fixed by the Tribunal. A tenant, other than a permanent tenant, can pay the price in one lump sum within one year or the price may be paid with simple interest at 4 1/2 per cent in annual instalments net exceeding 12 as may be fixed by the Tribunal.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Yes, the investigating officer needs to take steps to arrest the two accused who have been identified as absconding. As per theIndian Penal Code(IPC) and Criminal Code (CrPC), the investigating officer is responsible for ensuring the arrest and prosecution of all the accused.Aspects of the FIR are serious and call for thorough investigation and arrest of all the accused. In the case of an accused who is absconding but not cooperating, the investigating officer should also consider arrest if non-cooperation hampers the investigation, as provided under CrPC. Failure to cooperate to ensure the smooth running of the investigation may be valid grounds for arrest.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The investigating officer is correct that offences that are triable only for imprisonment for a term of less than seven years sometimes come as a category of offences that fall under Section 41A of the CrPC, where a notice to appear can be given instead of a warrant of arrest. However, problems come with the delay in such action and the implications of bias arising from the fact that the accused is the police.First, there is a need to clarify the existence of the accused on the list of individuals who have been declared absconding. This should, of course, be recorded in the police force documents, and there should be attempts to apprehend them if they are indeed fugitives.If you have not been served, then take advantage of the fact that it has been 11 months since the FIR was filed, and you can tackle the issue of the chargesheet not being filed. It could also mean sheer neglect or maybe deliberate tarpitting by the police in presenting the charge sheet.To address the situation:Present an affidavit of complaint and/or representation to the superior officer that the investigating officer has not initiated proper action as per the court order and the superior officer’s direction.Go to the High Court either with a contempt petition or a writ petition for direction to the investigating officer to do his job under the law, as it is in regard to the investigation and any subsequent arrests, which should not be made with any prejudice.Indicate that the investigation can be supervised by the court, especially on occasions where police officers are the accused.It is important to note that all telephone and face-to-face communications should be recorded, and there should be an official record of the communication to support the case being presented to the higher authorities and court.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Instead of arresting the accused, the police will now be obliged to issue a \"notice of appearance\" for any offence punishable with imprisonment up to seven years.the notice of appearance casts a duty on the accused person to appear before the police and \"cooperate\" with the investigation. It is only if he fails to comply with the terms of the notice that the question of arresting him will arise.Under the if authorities are still particular about arresting somebody in the first instance, then the police will specially have to give reasons for that in writing in court.This is how the new law liberalizes the arrest provisions:* Section 41A (1) says that in all cases punishable with imprisonment up to seven years, \"the police officer may, instead of arresting the person concerned, issue to him a notice of appearance.\"* Section 41A (3) conveys the import of this far-reaching devise by saying, \"Where such person complies and continues to comply with the notice, he shall not be arrested in respect of the offence referred to in the notice unless, for reasons to be recorded, the police are of the opinion that he ought to be arrested.\"Since notice of appearance is now stipulated in the investigation of all the offences punishable with imprisonment up to seven years, arrest will cease to be an inevitable fallout for accused persons in a wide variety of cognizable cases, including even those that were traditionally classified as  non bailable offences\" ..If the IO is intentionally delaying the arrest with some invalid reason, you can lodge a complaint against the IO before the higher police officer about his conduct and seek intervention....T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Sir,The investigating officer's actions and statements appear inconsistent. Legally, to declare someone absconding, the officer must show that a notice was served and the accused failed to comply. If the accused were working at a police station, the claim of their absconding is questionable.For offences with less than seven years of imprisonment, the officer can issue a notice to appear (Section 41A of the CrPC). If the accused don't comply, they can be arrested without a warrant if necessary.When you meet the superior officer, highlight the inconsistencies in the investigating officer's actions and request clear, written instructions for the arrest. Document the superior officer's order and follow up to ensure compliance. If the investigating officer still doesn't comply, consider escalating the matter to higher authorities or the judiciary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "- There is no provision in CrPC that for the offence whose punishment is less than 7 years is bailable i.e. Police cannot arrest- It is looking that the I.O. is malafidely avoiding arresting of the accused, hence in stead of approaching the higher police official , you should approach the court of law.- You can move an application before the judicial magistrate for know the status of investigation and to arrest the remaining two accused in the case.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Termination from employer",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Disputing unfair dismissal procedures can be one of the most challenging tasks an employee can ever encounter in his/her life. Here are the steps you can take to address your termination from Muks Robotics AI Private Limited:1.Review Your Employment Contract: Some of the connected papers might be: First of all, read through your employment contract and any other documents that you signed when you joined the specific company. This is due to the fact that this clause will contain details on the periods of notice that can be given, the circumstances under which dismissals are allowed or even required, and when it is allowed for the contract to be terminated. This will assist in helping you determine the position of the law on your side as well as see if the company in question has violated any of your rights granted by the law.2.Document Everything:Therefore, ensure that you record any conversation held in person, on the phone, or in writing with the company such as emails, letters etc. In our contemporary society, people不知不知道 many tasks are performed online, and thus, document your work activities to show that you did not abuse company resources, for instance, by using your personal laptop for an interview.3.Seek Clarification:It may be required to write a polite and professional letter to the Human Resources department or to the director of the company to know the exact reasons for the dismissal more elaborately. Engaging you with the specific details of your misconduct, detail cases where you are accused of using the company’s property for personal gains as well as explaining how you were unable to meet the various compliance requirements while your brief tenure with the company.4.Legal Consultation:This is a good point to seek legal advice from an employment lawyer. They can give you legal services which are based on your specific case, explain your legal position and decide whether the termination was unlawful. The lawyer may also advise one on the procedures to follow when it comes to filing for reimbursement of losses, or even filing for a lawsuit.5.Request Compensation:In your dealing with the company, make sure to remember to ask for the two months’ pay that is deprived from you as a result of the said dismissal. Ensure that you have not been provided with an indication or chance to comment on any issues being levelled against you, which may amount to an unfair working environment.6.Explore Alternative Dispute Resolution: If direct communication with the company does not yield results, consider mediation or arbitration. These are less formal than court proceedings and can be effective in resolving employment disputes.7.File a Complaint: If the company refuses to cooperate, you can file a complaint with the appropriate labor authorities in your region. This could be the labor commissioner’s office or an employment tribunal. Provide them with all your documentation and evidence of unfair termination.8.Job Search and Support: While addressing the termination issue, continue your job search. Reach out to professional networks and consider temporary or freelance work to mitigate the impact of unemployment. Utilize support services, such as career counseling or employment agencies, to help find new opportunities.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Need to know the Kul Kayda law %",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The particular legal rights and obligations in situations involving \"Kul Kayda\" (tenant-farmer or tenant-rights legislation) are determined by the state and local laws controlling tenancy and land rights. Nonetheless, the following broad ideas will assist you in comprehending your stance and bolstering your argument:Familiarize yourself on the legal provisions under the specific legal jurisdiction of your state with reference to tenancy and land rights – “Kul” (Tenant Farmers). These laws can offer safeguard as far as eviction is concerned and even certain procedures in split of land are present.Documentation: The buyer should make sure he/she has all the necessary documents to support title deed and demonstrate physical possession of the land for an extended period. This means tenancy receipts, rent receipts, tax receipts or any other communication with the land lord over the period of letting .Land Records: Go to the registrar of local land transfer to ensure your name and current tenure are correct. The longer the possession is, especially if continuous, the better the chance of presenting a valid pretense to the property.Legal Precedents: Consult a lawyer if there are any legal backing that can be used to argue the case or do a research on the legal framework. This is particularly true since prior examples are compelling in establishing different arguments in other similar kinds of matters.Municipal Regulations: This means that the land may be located in a municipal area hence implying that there may be some other laws or tenancy protection. Search for tenant protection laws along with other matters related to land division in the specific municipality or city.Legal Assistance: Seek the services of a lawyer who has knowledge in the area of law concerning property ownership and occupancy. This includes legal advice that can be given to a specific context and assist in understanding one’s legal position.Negotiation: If possible and if you have the time, sit down with the landowner and discuss. It is important to hire an attorney to assist as a middleman and possibly come up with an agreement acceptable to both parties Other than that, there can be legal advice on how to handle the termination of employment without going to court.Strengthening Your Case: Gather proof of your property possession and utilisation in the land over time, this may include giving out testimonies from neighbouring community members or individuals who have testified on your behalf of your utilisation of the land, and oddments made on the land.Government Assistance: It is also important to find out whether there is a way to legally self help especially in the event the tenant farmers are on the receiving end of such injustices. There are those states where there are particular bodies or boards that focus on the cases of the tenants and the landlords.Hope this helps!Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If the tenant fails to appear on the date fixed or gives a statement that he is not willing to purchase the land, the Tribunal shall make a declaration accordingly in writing. If the tenant is wiling to purchase the land, the Tribunal will determine according to the provisions of Sections 32-H and 63-A(3) the purchase price of the land after holding an enquiry and after hearing the parties concerned.

    "question": "Buying a resale flat in an under construction building",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Marketing an apartment for resale in a building under construction that continues to have construction delays was undoubtedly fraught with some difficulties, particularly in relation to the concerns regarding the inability of an investor reluctant to sign the Tripartite Agreement. The primary concern for consideration here is that your interests are safeguarded, especially because this project has been experiencing some setbacks, and the investor's decision to back out and opt not to be part of the Tripartite Agreement makes the transaction more challenging.A potential solution is to work out with the investor that an initial payment will be made contingent on the agreed-upon amount of future revenue. In a spirit of negotiation, you could suggest a plan through which a part of the payment is made before the launch of the project and the rest of the amount is paid and retained in trust until ownership is handed over. This also ensures that the investor gets at least some funds upon the completion of the first part, and you are also shielded in case there are likely to be further delays. This arrangement would also call for a precise legal framework that would lay down various provisions in a bid to unlock the remaining balance. No doubt it is wise to consult a lawyer to draw up or at least to inspect this agreement in order to make sure that all such clauses are cogent and the interests of the parties are shielded.The other thing that can be done is to talk with the bank of your choice and possibly come to an agreement on how the loan is paid out in phases based on project progress or possession. Banks generally release funds with respect to construction work completed, and you can negotiate a specific payment schedule you feel would safeguard a part of the funds until you take possession. This might entail explanations with the bank and, with the help of records of the current situation and the manner in which the progress of the project is being slowed, getting consent.If the investor remains inflexible and the bank cannot accommodate your request for a conditional disbursement plan, you may need to reconsider the purchase. Paying the full amount without any assurance of possession exposes you to significant risks, especially in a delayed project. The investor's reluctance to pay GST again suggests they are looking to minimise their costs at your expense, which could indicate potential red flags in the transaction.It's essential to assess the potential for further delays and the overall credibility of the builder. If the delays seem likely to extend beyond the current RERA extension and there is no clear timeline for completion, it might be prudent to explore other options.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "- As per the RERA Act, if the builder is delaying in construction & delay in possession, then the builder will have to pay 10% interest on the value of the property for delayed possession of flats.- Hence, if builder fails to delivers the possession of the flat to you on time, then you can cancel the agreement due to his fault and you are liable to get full refund of paid amount with 10 percent interest.- Further, if you get the possession of the said flat lately, then also you can claim 10% compensation from the builder.- How the bank sanctioned /disburse the loan in the absence of a Tripartite agreement.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

In case that is not done then take NOC from the Builder for First Transaction Free so that the Builder does not put additional cost for such Transfer.

    "question": "Need to know the Kul Kayda law %",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The particular legal rights and obligations in situations involving \"Kul Kayda\" (tenant-farmer or tenant-rights legislation) are determined by the state and local laws controlling tenancy and land rights. Nonetheless, the following broad ideas will assist you in comprehending your stance and bolstering your argument:Familiarize yourself on the legal provisions under the specific legal jurisdiction of your state with reference to tenancy and land rights – “Kul” (Tenant Farmers). These laws can offer safeguard as far as eviction is concerned and even certain procedures in split of land are present.Documentation: The buyer should make sure he/she has all the necessary documents to support title deed and demonstrate physical possession of the land for an extended period. This means tenancy receipts, rent receipts, tax receipts or any other communication with the land lord over the period of letting .Land Records: Go to the registrar of local land transfer to ensure your name and current tenure are correct. The longer the possession is, especially if continuous, the better the chance of presenting a valid pretense to the property.Legal Precedents: Consult a lawyer if there are any legal backing that can be used to argue the case or do a research on the legal framework. This is particularly true since prior examples are compelling in establishing different arguments in other similar kinds of matters.Municipal Regulations: This means that the land may be located in a municipal area hence implying that there may be some other laws or tenancy protection. Search for tenant protection laws along with other matters related to land division in the specific municipality or city.Legal Assistance: Seek the services of a lawyer who has knowledge in the area of law concerning property ownership and occupancy. This includes legal advice that can be given to a specific context and assist in understanding one’s legal position.Negotiation: If possible and if you have the time, sit down with the landowner and discuss. It is important to hire an attorney to assist as a middleman and possibly come up with an agreement acceptable to both parties Other than that, there can be legal advice on how to handle the termination of employment without going to court.Strengthening Your Case: Gather proof of your property possession and utilisation in the land over time, this may include giving out testimonies from neighbouring community members or individuals who have testified on your behalf of your utilisation of the land, and oddments made on the land.Government Assistance: It is also important to find out whether there is a way to legally self help especially in the event the tenant farmers are on the receiving end of such injustices. There are those states where there are particular bodies or boards that focus on the cases of the tenants and the landlords.Hope this helps!Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Disputing unfair dismissal procedures can be one of the most challenging tasks an employee can ever encounter in his/her life. Here are the steps you can take to address your termination from Muks Robotics AI Private Limited:1.Review Your Employment Contract: Some of the connected papers might be: First of all, read through your employment contract and any other documents that you signed when you joined the specific company. This is due to the fact that this clause will contain details on the periods of notice that can be given, the circumstances under which dismissals are allowed or even required, and when it is allowed for the contract to be terminated. This will assist in helping you determine the position of the law on your side as well as see if the company in question has violated any of your rights granted by the law.2.Document Everything:Therefore, ensure that you record any conversation held in person, on the phone, or in writing with the company such as emails, letters etc. In our contemporary society, people不知不知道 many tasks are performed online, and thus, document your work activities to show that you did not abuse company resources, for instance, by using your personal laptop for an interview.3.Seek Clarification:It may be required to write a polite and professional letter to the Human Resources department or to the director of the company to know the exact reasons for the dismissal more elaborately. Engaging you with the specific details of your misconduct, detail cases where you are accused of using the company’s property for personal gains as well as explaining how you were unable to meet the various compliance requirements while your brief tenure with the company.4.Legal Consultation:This is a good point to seek legal advice from an employment lawyer. They can give you legal services which are based on your specific case, explain your legal position and decide whether the termination was unlawful. The lawyer may also advise one on the procedures to follow when it comes to filing for reimbursement of losses, or even filing for a lawsuit.5.Request Compensation:In your dealing with the company, make sure to remember to ask for the two months’ pay that is deprived from you as a result of the said dismissal. Ensure that you have not been provided with an indication or chance to comment on any issues being levelled against you, which may amount to an unfair working environment.6.Explore Alternative Dispute Resolution: If direct communication with the company does not yield results, consider mediation or arbitration. These are less formal than court proceedings and can be effective in resolving employment disputes.7.File a Complaint: If the company refuses to cooperate, you can file a complaint with the appropriate labor authorities in your region. This could be the labor commissioner’s office or an employment tribunal. Provide them with all your documentation and evidence of unfair termination.8.Job Search and Support: While addressing the termination issue, continue your job search. Reach out to professional networks and consider temporary or freelance work to mitigate the impact of unemployment. Utilize support services, such as career counseling or employment agencies, to help find new opportunities.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Builder not agreeing to register  sale  agreement",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Coming to the point, I suggest that you write to the builder and the bank formally and request that they remove the said clause from the tripartite agreement. When making your disapproval pertaining to the clause that may bar one from claiming an opportunity to sue or sue the other in relation to the property, it is crucial to be assertively clear. So cast a spell on a clause as highly prejudicial, unfair and unviable and state how its enforcement can actually have a negative effect on that particular contractual party.In the event that the builder and bank are not in a position to respond to your request to delete the clause, then it is time to seek a legal opinion. To overcome this issue, you better talk with the provider and try to negotiate with them or find another legal way to solve the issue with the help of an attorney. If those negotiations are never to yield any results or if they are to produce results which are not in good proportions for better negotiation, then perhaps it is time to rethink about the agreement in such terms since, during and after the construction phase, one will not have many channels to seek legal redress in case of any eventuality.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The particular legal rights and obligations in situations involving \"Kul Kayda\" (tenant-farmer or tenant-rights legislation) are determined by the state and local laws controlling tenancy and land rights. Nonetheless, the following broad ideas will assist you in comprehending your stance and bolstering your argument:Familiarize yourself on the legal provisions under the specific legal jurisdiction of your state with reference to tenancy and land rights – “Kul” (Tenant Farmers). These laws can offer safeguard as far as eviction is concerned and even certain procedures in split of land are present.Documentation: The buyer should make sure he/she has all the necessary documents to support title deed and demonstrate physical possession of the land for an extended period. This means tenancy receipts, rent receipts, tax receipts or any other communication with the land lord over the period of letting .Land Records: Go to the registrar of local land transfer to ensure your name and current tenure are correct. The longer the possession is, especially if continuous, the better the chance of presenting a valid pretense to the property.Legal Precedents: Consult a lawyer if there are any legal backing that can be used to argue the case or do a research on the legal framework. This is particularly true since prior examples are compelling in establishing different arguments in other similar kinds of matters.Municipal Regulations: This means that the land may be located in a municipal area hence implying that there may be some other laws or tenancy protection. Search for tenant protection laws along with other matters related to land division in the specific municipality or city.Legal Assistance: Seek the services of a lawyer who has knowledge in the area of law concerning property ownership and occupancy. This includes legal advice that can be given to a specific context and assist in understanding one’s legal position.Negotiation: If possible and if you have the time, sit down with the landowner and discuss. It is important to hire an attorney to assist as a middleman and possibly come up with an agreement acceptable to both parties Other than that, there can be legal advice on how to handle the termination of employment without going to court.Strengthening Your Case: Gather proof of your property possession and utilisation in the land over time, this may include giving out testimonies from neighbouring community members or individuals who have testified on your behalf of your utilisation of the land, and oddments made on the land.Government Assistance: It is also important to find out whether there is a way to legally self help especially in the event the tenant farmers are on the receiving end of such injustices. There are those states where there are particular bodies or boards that focus on the cases of the tenants and the landlords.Hope this helps!Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Disputing unfair dismissal procedures can be one of the most challenging tasks an employee can ever encounter in his/her life. Here are the steps you can take to address your termination from Muks Robotics AI Private Limited:1.Review Your Employment Contract: Some of the connected papers might be: First of all, read through your employment contract and any other documents that you signed when you joined the specific company. This is due to the fact that this clause will contain details on the periods of notice that can be given, the circumstances under which dismissals are allowed or even required, and when it is allowed for the contract to be terminated. This will assist in helping you determine the position of the law on your side as well as see if the company in question has violated any of your rights granted by the law.2.Document Everything:Therefore, ensure that you record any conversation held in person, on the phone, or in writing with the company such as emails, letters etc. In our contemporary society, people不知不知道 many tasks are performed online, and thus, document your work activities to show that you did not abuse company resources, for instance, by using your personal laptop for an interview.3.Seek Clarification:It may be required to write a polite and professional letter to the Human Resources department or to the director of the company to know the exact reasons for the dismissal more elaborately. Engaging you with the specific details of your misconduct, detail cases where you are accused of using the company’s property for personal gains as well as explaining how you were unable to meet the various compliance requirements while your brief tenure with the company.4.Legal Consultation:This is a good point to seek legal advice from an employment lawyer. They can give you legal services which are based on your specific case, explain your legal position and decide whether the termination was unlawful. The lawyer may also advise one on the procedures to follow when it comes to filing for reimbursement of losses, or even filing for a lawsuit.5.Request Compensation:In your dealing with the company, make sure to remember to ask for the two months’ pay that is deprived from you as a result of the said dismissal. Ensure that you have not been provided with an indication or chance to comment on any issues being levelled against you, which may amount to an unfair working environment.6.Explore Alternative Dispute Resolution: If direct communication with the company does not yield results, consider mediation or arbitration. These are less formal than court proceedings and can be effective in resolving employment disputes.7.File a Complaint: If the company refuses to cooperate, you can file a complaint with the appropriate labor authorities in your region. This could be the labor commissioner’s office or an employment tribunal. Provide them with all your documentation and evidence of unfair termination.8.Job Search and Support: While addressing the termination issue, continue your job search. Reach out to professional networks and consider temporary or freelance work to mitigate the impact of unemployment. Utilize support services, such as career counseling or employment agencies, to help find new opportunities.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If the tenant is wiling to purchase the land, the Tribunal will determine according to the provisions of Sections 32-H and 63-A(3) the purchase price of the land after holding an enquiry and after hearing the parties concerned. The value of the land fixed by taking into consideration all the prescribed factors will be scaled down to the maximum, if it exceeds the maximum, or scaled up to the minimum, if it is less than the minimum.8. Provision is made in Section 32-K for payment of the purchase price.

A tenant, other than a permanent tenant, can pay the price in one lump sum within one year or the price may be paid with simple interest at 4 1/2 per cent in annual instalments net exceeding 12 as may be fixed by the Tribunal. In the meanwhile, payment of rent to the landlord is stopped from the year In which the first instalment becomes payable, and if during any year the payment of rent is suspended or remitted, a tenant is not to be liable to pay the purchase price in lump sum or the amount of instalments or any interest thereon during that yearAjay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98558 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "question": "NRI concealed about his 'NRI status\" during the sale of property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1) As regards to the TDS Rs percentage amount would be higher for NRI therefore, the exact Rbs amount should be determined. For the properties sold by the NRIs, the TDS has been reportedly prevalent at 20% of the sale value; however, it can reach up to 30% if the value is undervalued intentionally. As for the TDS amount, the exact percentage depends on the selling price and you should consult a tax professional/ CA for the correct TDS percentage. It is advised that even if the seller provides the required documentation stating that he is declaring a capital loss, as the buyer, it becomes the buyer’s responsibility to deduct and deposit the TDS as required. Later on the seller is in a position to demand refund for any given product in case the need arises. If you have deducted and deposited the TDS, you can try to get the TDS certificate (Form 16A) either by checking with the Income Tax Department using your TAN (Tax Deduction and Collection Account Number) or intimation of such deposit.To pressurize the NRI into agreeing to pay the TDS, legal notice through an attorney should be given to the NRI to compel him/her to pay the TDS. This notice should indicate thegist of the fraud and insist on the payment of the outstanding taxes raised on the fraudster with any interests where applicable. The summons and threats of being locked out may force the seller to bring further issues to settlement to prevent complicating the legal process.3) The period within which TDS is required to be deposited of property transactions varies generally 30 days from the end of the month for which TDS has been deducted. In any case, you have not deducted TDS and thus you should immediately resolve this in order to refrain from future penalties and interests. It further does not become a legal offence if one continues to live in the house, once legal proceedings have been initiated against the NRI. However, relevant importance should be given to tax compliance as any disputing issue may arise between the organization and the Income Tax Department.4) While the embassy or consulate won't directly intervene in such matters, they could provide steering on the felony framework and obligations of NRIs. You can also are trying to find help from criminal professionals who focus on NRI belongings transactions and tax issues.5) The first step legally would be to discuss with a belongings lawyer or a tax consultant skilled in NRI transactions. They assist you to draft and ship a prison word to the NRI supplier, disturbing the TDS payment and necessary documentation. If the seller does now not comply, you could record a grievance with the local police for fraud and cheating, and simultaneously, provoke prison complaints in a civil court docket to recover the TDS amount and any related penalties. Keep all transaction records, communications, and criminal notices properly-documented to aid your case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Based on the circumstances, it will be possible to respond to the issues raised by the bank lawyer up to the special power of attorney and its value on stamp. However, the original POA was not notarized and not registered, and in any case, if the stamp value of the document does not conform to the legal requirements of stamp duties in the State of Kerala, at least a registered affidavit or confirmation should be able to treat the wrong.If your mother and sister want to get over this, they can execute an affidavit in Delhi, where the particulars of producing the original power of attorney and the actual sale deed will be stated. This affidavit should particularly mention that you had the original power of attorney to do the following for the sale of property in Kerala. Moreover, there should be details concerning the sale deed, and all parties should have knowledge about the transaction beforehand.After the affidavit is drafted, it should be lodged with the registrar of the stated city. In the case of registration, the common-law partners, or your mother and sister in this case, will have to go to the registrar, who will then cause the affidavit to be sworn by them. This registered affidavit can then be procured from the office of the subregistrar and submitted to the bank in Kerala to meet the above requirement.Though it is a standard practice to follow while rectifying inconsistencies in title deeds across different states, it is wise to seek legal advice from an attorney with knowledge of real estate law in Delhi and Kerala. They can help determine whether all the legal requirements in the preparation of the affidavit have been met, not to mention issues related to registration. It will also assist in eschewing additional problems with the bank’s verification process and simplifying the process of acquiring the loan application.Lastly, it is for this reason that you can actually handle this at the registrar’s office in Delhi by preparing and forwarding an affidavit that will consist of the details in regard to the original POA and the sale deed. It will also involve consulting a legal professional to make sure that the responses in the affidavit are proper and that the affidavit is properly drafted and recorded to address the bank’s concerns.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Legally, you have several options to seek redress and accommodations. The Supreme Court's judgement in Vikash Kumar v. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) is indeed relevant to your situation. Here’s a detailed explanation:Facts and Decisions in Vikash Kumar v. UPSCIn Vikash Kumar v. UPSC (2021), the petitioner suffered from a similar neurological condition that impaired his writing ability. He requested reasonable accommodations to take a civil service examination, including the provision of a scribe. The UPSC rejected his request, prompting him to challenge their decision.The Supreme Court ruled in favour of Vikash Kumar, emphasising the following key points:1.Rights of Persons with Disabilities:The Court underscored the rights of individuals with disabilities to reasonable accommodations under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPWD Act). This Act mandates non-discrimination and provides for necessary accommodations to enable persons with disabilities to perform their roles effectively.2.Definition of Disability: The Court broadened the interpretation of “disability” to include conditions like writer's cramp, stressing that the impairment need not be visible or permanent as long as it hampers the individual’s ability to perform daily activities.3.Obligation of Employers:The Court held that employers, including public sector entities, have a duty to provide reasonable accommodations to employees with disabilities. This includes reassignment to suitable positions where the disability would not impede job performance.Legal Options and Steps for Your Case1. Request Reasonable Accommodations in Writing:Submit a formal, written request to your higher authorities and HR department, outlining your condition, its impact on your job performance, and the specific accommodations you are seeking. Reference is made to the RPWD Act and the Supreme Court judgement in Vikash Kumar v. UPSC.2. Consult with medical professionals:Obtain detailed medical documentation from your neurologist or other healthcare providers. These documents should describe your condition, its impact on your ability to write, and recommended accommodations.3. File a grievance:If your initial requests are ignored or denied, file a formal grievance through your bank’s internal grievance redressal mechanism. Make sure to document all instances of harassment and lack of accommodation.4. Approach the Equal Opportunity Cell (if available):Many public sector organisations have an Equal Opportunity Cell or a similar body responsible for addressing issues related to discrimination and accommodations for employees with disabilities. Approach this body with your complaint.5. Legal Action:If internal remedies fail, you can file a complaint with the Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities (CCPD) or the State Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities. These bodies have the authority to investigate and take action on complaints of non-compliance with the RPWD Act.You can also consider filing a writ petition in the High Court under Article 226 of theIndian Constitution, seeking a directive for your employer to provide reasonable accommodations and to stop the harassment.Relevant Case LawIn addition to Vikash Kumar v. UPSC, consider referencing these cases:Jeeja Ghosh & Anotherv.Union of India: This case reinforced the rights of persons with disabilities to equal treatment and accommodations.Bhavya Nainv.University of Delhi highlighted the need for reasonable accommodations in educational and employment settings for persons with disabilities.Your condition qualifies as a disability under the RPWD Act, and your employer is legally obligated to provide reasonable accommodations. The Supreme Court’s ruling in Vikash Kumar v. UPSC supports your case, emphasising the duty of employers to accommodate employees with disabilities. You have the right to request reassignment or other accommodations and to seek redress through internal grievance mechanisms or legal channels if necessary.Seek legal counsel to assist with drafting formal requests and potential legal actions. Your case highlights the need for compliance with disability rights legislation and the importance of creating an inclusive work environment.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Suffering from chronic neurological disorder and facing harassment at workplace",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The facts of the case:Vikash Kumar is the petitioner who gave the Civil Services Examination as organised by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). Specifically, he had the particularity of a certain type of learning disability that made him write significantly slowly.Due to his disability, Vikash Kumar had to write to the school principal, asking for permission for a scribe for the examination. However, his request was rejected by the UPSC on the basis that he failed to fulfil the regulatory requirements inevitably in regard to the availability of a scribe.Several pages offer an account of Vikash Kumar, who sought to appeal the UPSC refusal, arguing that his rights under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 had been violated. He argued that this piece of legislation required accommodations for individuals with disabilities to be reasonable to make necessary adjustments to prevent discrimination.High Court's Decision:The Honourable High Court of India endorsed the directives of the UPSC and dismissed the appeal of Vikash Kumar on the grounds that he did not fall under the criteria for scribe under the prevailing conditions and norms. Vikash Kumar appealed to S.C. of India; ultimately, the Honourable Apex Court took up the matter for consideration.Supreme Court's Decision:Some of the changes that were made included the reevaluation of the guidelines and criteria by the Supreme Court for providing scribes to persons with disabilities to do their writing for them with the intention of having a more inclusive approach. The Court underlined another key principle outlined in the RPwD Act, 2016, known as reasonable accommodation, which implies that it is necessary for the implementation of appropriate modifications and adjustments in order to ensure persons with disabilities exercise their rights.The judgement elucidated that the RPwD Act entitled Vikash Kumar to certain rights, including a scribe, if he were to request them, and Oudh had arbitrarily denied him that right. The Court added that the act requires one to be given an equal chance with no discrimination and to implement the act of reasonable accommodation as part of the mandate.Hence, the SC recommended that the UPSC reconsider its guidelines and provide candidature appropriate damages for disability that the UPSC deprives of disabled candidates by not letting them have a scribe and making it a criteria for examination so that their rights are being protected and they can also write their examinations in the best way possible.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,If you have provided representation along with a letter from NIMHANS Bengaluru about your condition when requesting reasonable accommodation from your branch manager but none has been responded to by the HR Department, it is wise to keep documentation of such communications. If a reasonable period has passed with no work being done or little progress is made for the student and myself,. Follow up with HR through a second email or letter if you do not receive a response to your initial message of introducing yourself. This should be done gently and diplomatically in an effort to remind them of your previous request. Emphasise its urgency. Enclose photocopies of previous communications along with the one received from NIMHANS.Furthermore, continue to remind the officer’s association of the absence of a reply from HR and enquire them to further support and fight for your rights. If you continue to be overwhelmed by your struggle, you should report the issue to the higher authorities of your organisation. Select a position at a higher level, such as senior HR manager or director. Obviously, describe actions that were taken beforehand that can contribute to the solution of the problem. Emphasise that you have received little or no response, especially with newer social media platforms.Correlatively, seek any legal advice that you would be in a position to take against any form of discrimination concerning medical conditions in the workplace with regard to reasonable accommodation. Although the study found that laws and regulations were weak and violated in food production, there is a need for research on the laws and regulations of different jurisdictions. For specific advice on this matter, it is advised to seek services from an employment lawyer.

    "answer": "Dear Sir,I understand your challenging situation. According to the facts as narrated by you, your marital relationship is at a stage from where it can be saved, nothing would be better than mediation with help of common family/friend. I would suggest you to try to save your relationship as far as possible as you have a child too.But if you think that the situation is somewhere which is out of your hand and you may get trapped into false accusation by your partner then I would suggest you to:Keep a detailed record of all financial transactions, including the EMI payments you have made, personal loans, and any expenses related to the household and your wife’s personal needs.Maintain copies of all communications(chats or recordings) with your wife and in-laws, especially any threats or demands made.Communicate with your wifeCalculations of your total liabilities and financial burden, including home loan EMI, personal loans, and monthly expenses. Keep in mind that basic necessary expenses of child and wife are covered.As you pointed out that there was verbal agreement regarding sharing of Loan EMI but same has not been complied by your wife and only you are paying those EMIs thentry to document those verbal agreement regarding the EMI paymentsand her failure to contribute (if possibletry to communicate this thing with her on whatsapp chat so that she may respond (admit or deny or give any explanation)and keep screenshot of every communication before she delete same)Abandonment anddomestic violenceare serious allegations. Since you left Bangalore due to financial strain and conflicts, not with the intention to abandon, this context is crucial. You have to keep all the documents ready which shows that you left Bangalore in different circumstances. Try to communicate her over chats / calls and document/record same. Be calm and talk to her politely even if she instigates you.You have to gather evidences such as messages or witnesses to counter such false allegations. Restaurant bills / shopping bills etc also are good evidences.Talk to her and try for mediation through a neutral third party or mediator (if possible). This could help resolve issues without escalating to legal battles. Emphasize your willingness to support your wife and child but also explain your financial crunch.But keep copy/record of all the communication that you are doing.Before any interaction with police try to consult a lawyer(family and criminal cases), but before police officer remain calm and provide clear evidence to support your position.But the most important and crucial point here is:-If you have clear anticipation that your wife may file complaint against you then---Consult a lawyer immediately for taking legal recourse before she initiate any formal legal action or files any FIR.You should keep your family and close friends in loop and informed about your situation for emotional and practical support.It is crucial to handle the situation with a calm and strategic approachYou may consult me if you need further legal assistance.

    "question": "My wife is not willing to come to my place",
    "answer": "Dear Client,This is particularly paramount bearing in mind the above complications, which make it necessary to avoid haphazard advancement in this methodical approach to defend your interests and address the concerns adequately.To begin with, all the records should be kept in order, paying extra attention to your financial activities and the verbal agreements concluded with your wife. Documents to be compiled include the bank statements of EMI payments on the credit cards, written communications of the financial arrangements taken, and loan records incurred for household or personal reasons. It is useful in the event that there is a need to go to court due to some illegality. It is also important that any external influence, especially from in-laws, that has influenced your marriage in a negative way be included.Next, it is recommended to contact an attorney as soon as possible. If you’re unsure about your rights when going through the process, it would be wise to engage the services of a lawyer who focuses on family law. They can assist you in dealing with the notice that your wife has issued and can make you ready for any legal battle she might launch against you or any accusations she may make, such as abandonment, domestic abuse, and violence, among others. Your lawyer can also explain the legal consequences of your financial agreements and how they can be resolved, for example, by obtaining a legal resolution, continuing the legal process by obtaining legal separation, or seeking legal advice for an out-of-court settlement.Lastly, in this legal environment, it is the best if you keep talking to your wife calmly and in an understanding manner if you wish to reach a common agreement. You may wish to urge the suggestion to employ mediation as an option to address your disagreements without resorting to litigation. Should the situation worsen and legal processes are the only solution, your attorney will assist you with appropriate defence strategies and, possibly, claims for compensation for the monetary and, respectively, the emotional loss you have suffered.Hope this helps!Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Fell for a cam girl (escort) fraud",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Firstly, it is important to understand that the best course of action is to realise that one has most likely, however, become a staking victim of a scam. The famous tendency that scammers use is to ask for a small amount of money compared to the promised sum, and after that, they vanish. In light of the services discussed in this paper, this complicates the problem as we try to find a solution for it.From a legal point of view, web-based selling of sexual services, including cam shows, is completely legal and may be unlawful in some contexts or in certain countries or states. In many places, such transactions remain either unlawful or, at the very least, are vague and without a clearly defined legal status, which often makes it almost impossible for a buyer to seek compensation for the alleged fraud through legal means.Filing a Complaint and Chargeback:Filing a Complaint and Chargeback:NPCI and Bank Chargeback: You can apply for a chargeback with NPCI or apply directly with the bank However, one must note that banks often need a valid reason for processing chargebacks or reversing a transaction. Specifically for the type of payment you received and the service being offered, it can be challenging without jeopardising the legal aspects of the case to defend your stand, let alone admit to prostitution.Consumer Forums: There are solutions available for reporting instances of online fraud the consumer forums or the helpline number, but these may not be the most effective option for challenging issues related to adult services because of said legal ambiguities.Reporting the Scam:This way, you have to be careful when reporting the scam, considering the legal consequences of doing so. However, returning the money to the person is the main focus, and the revelation of the details of the transaction can have negative repercussions. In some jurisdictions, just confessing to attempt to access such services or participating in such a service supplier.Alternative Steps:Cease Further Contact: It means that one should cut any ties to the individual to avoid further financial losses or getting caught up in such a situation.Privacy and Security: However, it is recommended to use the slot at the hotel or any other private location that will guarantee the privacy and security of the individuals involved. If the scammer has any of your details, then even you might be at risk of identity theft or more attempts to con you.Awareness and Caution: To do this, one may argue that it is pertinent to draw lessons from this experience for future occurrences to be more careful. Do not buy or seek services from company or persons whose legal nature of business is questionable or not well defined.Consult a Legal Advisor: Before proceeding any further with the steps outlined on this web site to report the issue or to file for a chargeback, one must seek the advice of a lawyer. They can then recommend which legal route to take with the case while taking into consideration your own circumstances.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Termination from employer",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Disputing unfair dismissal procedures can be one of the most challenging tasks an employee can ever encounter in his/her life. Here are the steps you can take to address your termination from Muks Robotics AI Private Limited:1.Review Your Employment Contract: Some of the connected papers might be: First of all, read through your employment contract and any other documents that you signed when you joined the specific company. This is due to the fact that this clause will contain details on the periods of notice that can be given, the circumstances under which dismissals are allowed or even required, and when it is allowed for the contract to be terminated. This will assist in helping you determine the position of the law on your side as well as see if the company in question has violated any of your rights granted by the law.2.Document Everything:Therefore, ensure that you record any conversation held in person, on the phone, or in writing with the company such as emails, letters etc. In our contemporary society, people不知不知道 many tasks are performed online, and thus, document your work activities to show that you did not abuse company resources, for instance, by using your personal laptop for an interview.3.Seek Clarification:It may be required to write a polite and professional letter to the Human Resources department or to the director of the company to know the exact reasons for the dismissal more elaborately. Engaging you with the specific details of your misconduct, detail cases where you are accused of using the company’s property for personal gains as well as explaining how you were unable to meet the various compliance requirements while your brief tenure with the company.4.Legal Consultation:This is a good point to seek legal advice from an employment lawyer. They can give you legal services which are based on your specific case, explain your legal position and decide whether the termination was unlawful. The lawyer may also advise one on the procedures to follow when it comes to filing for reimbursement of losses, or even filing for a lawsuit.5.Request Compensation:In your dealing with the company, make sure to remember to ask for the two months’ pay that is deprived from you as a result of the said dismissal. Ensure that you have not been provided with an indication or chance to comment on any issues being levelled against you, which may amount to an unfair working environment.6.Explore Alternative Dispute Resolution: If direct communication with the company does not yield results, consider mediation or arbitration. These are less formal than court proceedings and can be effective in resolving employment disputes.7.File a Complaint: If the company refuses to cooperate, you can file a complaint with the appropriate labor authorities in your region. This could be the labor commissioner’s office or an employment tribunal. Provide them with all your documentation and evidence of unfair termination.8.Job Search and Support: While addressing the termination issue, continue your job search. Reach out to professional networks and consider temporary or freelance work to mitigate the impact of unemployment. Utilize support services, such as career counseling or employment agencies, to help find new opportunities.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Termination from employer",
    "answer": "Dear client,When you faced with resource limitations and weekend work demands, it can be beneficial to discuss these challenges with either your company's director or the Human Resources department. Expressing the challenges you're facing due to insufficient resources and the expectation to work weekends could be helpful. Offering alternative solutions, like obtaining better hardware for machine learning projects or investigating additional cloud computing options beyond Google Colab, may also prove productive.If your initial training experience didn't meet your expectations and you're now at risk of termination during your probationary period, it's advisable to rephrase your concerns in a different manner. It's important to make well-informed choices and proactively safeguard your rights as an employee.Thank youAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, the prenuptial agreement can be made binding of properly drafted without transcending the boundaries of the marriage itself.It is not all about documents being being submitted at the time of registration of marriage. There are a set of documents that are required to be provided for registration of marriage and they include documents proving identity of the couple, age proof and photographs.

    "question": "Marriage registration under Special Marriage Act and validity of prenuptial agreement",
    "answer": "Dear Client,To ensure the felony binding of a prenuptial agreement under theSpecial Marriage Actin India, each event has to publish complete documentation through the registration system. This includes valid identity proofs, start certificates, passport-sized pix, and a testimony affirming the marital repute of each event. The prenuptial agreement itself must be in writing, signed at each event, and preferably notarized. Additionally, it needs to be performed before the wedding takes place and ought to be honest and equitable, voluntarily entered into by using both events without any duress or coercion. Legal consultation and the presence of impartial prison counsel for both parties are fantastically advocated to ensure the agreement's validity.Despite those precautions, certain clauses in prenuptial agreements can be considered null and void by Indian courts. Any clauses that are in opposition to public coverage, together with people who inspire divorce, waive the right to child aid, or include provisions that might be deemed unfair or unconscionable, will no longer be enforceable. Additionally, any conditions that try to predetermine child custody or parenting time, as these subjects are exclusively beneath the jurisdiction of the courts and are determined based totally on the best interests of the kid, can also be invalid. Ensuring the agreement complies with Indian laws and does not contain these sorts of clauses is crucial for its enforceability.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can I travel abroad with court order",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Communication from the SP Office to ImmigrationThe communication from the SP Office to the immigration authorities likely clarified your legal status and confirmed that no arrest warrant was issued against you. This would have reassured the immigration officials that, while an LOC was active, it did not necessitate immediate detention or arrest. The SP Office might have also communicated any specific instructions, such as your requirement to attend court hearings, which allowed the immigration officials to proceed accordingly.Eligibility to Travel with Court OrderSince the court order explicitly states that you should attend all court hearings and does not impose any travel restrictions, you are generally eligible to travel. The court's lack of mention regarding travel restrictions implies that you are free to travel, provided you return for your court hearings. Always carry a copy of this court order when traveling to demonstrate your compliance with legal requirements.Status of Your LOCThe fact that you were allowed to travel after the SP Office communicated with the immigration officials suggests that the immediate concerns of the LOC were addressed, at least temporarily. However, this does not necessarily mean the LOC is revoked or lifted permanently. The LOC may still be active, and its enforcement could vary depending on the specifics of your case and the instructions from the SP Office.-Travel Preparations: Keep Documentation: Always take a copy of the court mandate with you when traveling. This will be important in demonstrating that you are following the court's orders. Legal Disclaimer: Check with your attorney before traveling to make sure you do not have anything pending that may interfere with your travel plans.-If Stopped by Immigration: Court Order: A court order which says that no implied order not to travel Inform them all you are doing is complying with the court order by going to all court hearing-Talking: You ask for immigration staff members to check in with the SP Office or elsewhere to confirm your status.Hope this helps!Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"
