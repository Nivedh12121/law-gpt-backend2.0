    "question": "Clarification on Partition Deed procedure",
    "answer": "1.  As far as the properties left behind by your deceased father, it devolves equally on all his legal heirs, i.e., your mother, you and your siblings.Your mother cannot become the successor in interest to succeed to the entire estates left behind by your father.Since the said properties devolve equally on all the three, you may enter into a formal partition among yourselves to divide the said properties among yourselves on the basis of amicably agreed conditions. The partition deed may be drawn and get it registered..You can divide the properties into three schedule of properties with one schedule allotted to each.2. The property purchase jointly by you and your brother belongs only to two of you and your mother or anyone do not have any rights in it, you can divide the property by a mutually agreed partition deed and the so drawn partition may be recorded in a registered deed.3.  The property transferred by your grandmother to both of you becomes your absolute property. Please note that the grandmother's property is not ancestral proeprty, hence the property transferred to both your names by a registered gift deed becomes your own and absolute property hence neither your mother nor any other person can claim any share in it as a right.You can divide the said property also by a mutually agreed partition and the same may be drawn by a registered partition deed into two schedule of property.4. After having done with all the above three registered deeds, you and your brother  can decide about exchanging each other's share in the said  properties to each other and draw an exchange deed, get it registered.After this process is completed yo may get the revenue records transferred to your respective names accordinlgy.5. The proposed registered release deeds will actually confuse and if not done properly then the title will be defective in all the properties, therefore you can better do it patiently by deciding the proper mode of transfer instead of suffering the legal hassles at a later stage.You can discuss with an experienced lawyer before taking any further concrete steps in this regard.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Legal options post reversal of divorce decree by High Court",
    "answer": "1.When a High Court sets aside a divorce decree in an appeal, and the respondent has remarried, the remarriage is generally considered invalid, and the first marriage is restored.However, the situation can be complex, and the specific outcome depends on various factors, including the timing of the remarriage and the specific grounds for setting aside the divorce decree.2.. It will be possible to file a defamation case if the High Court overturns a divorce decree based on allegations of cruelty, and you believe the wife's claims were defamatory.A defamation case would need to demonstrate that the wife's statements were false, published, and caused you harm, and that she acted with malice or negligence.To prove defamation, you would need to show thata) The statement must be factually incorrect.b)Thestatement must have been communicated to a third party.c)The statement must have caused damage to your reputation.d)In many cases, you would need to demonstrate that the defendant made the statement with knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard for its truth.The High Court's decision overturning the divorce decree based on the lack of cruelty is relevant evidence that the allegations made against you were potentially false.This evidence can be used to support a claim that the statements were defamatory.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Legal options post reversal of divorce decree by High Court",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India. I can understand your concern. It is unfortunate that you could not lead a happy married life. There are some incidents that happen in your life and those incidents are so strong that they change your DNA. They say marriages are made in heaven. But so is thunder and lightning. At times, despite our best efforts, life takes a turn for the worst. We may have wanted different things from life, but life’s got its own plan as well. A bad marriage is something which nobody hopes for, but at times, that’s exactly what we are given and forced to face head on. As you know that marriage doesn't guarantee that you will be together forever, it's only paper. It takes trust, respect, faith, friendship and understanding to make it last. Moreover a relationship without trust is like a car without gas, you can stay in it as long as you want but it won't go anywhere. Marriages are hard. Divorces…even harder. Nobody enters marriage thinking about a divorce in the end. If some are unable to cope with the harsh realities of marriage, the only viable option in front of them is to approach the Court and seek legal separation.The divorce was granted on 30th May 2024 and she remarried around 21st November 2024. Section 15 ofHindu Marriage Actsays when a marriage has been dissolved by a decree of divorce and either there is no right of appeal against the decree or, if there is such a right of appeal, the time for appealing has expired without an appeal having been presented, or an appeal has been presented but has been dismissed, it shall be lawful for either party to the marriage to marry again.She was deliberately avoiding the service of summons and you have filed the appeal within the limitation period. Therefore, Court may set aside the marriage, however, the burden of proof is on you to state that she was deliberately avoid service. The \"burden of proof\" in the context of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, essentially means the obligation of a party in a legal case to prove a particular fact in order for the court to consider it and potentially render a decision in their favor. You can initiate civil suit for recovery of damages. There are various cases in which Courts have granted compensation/damages to the husbands as well. Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client, the following points are to be noted.The stay order issued \"until the next date of hearing\" continues in force indefinitely unless specifically vacated by the High Court. The 2024 SC judgment (cited in sources) made it clear that stay orders do not automatically expire after six months. It is to be noted that even if the opposite party does nothing regarding the stay order, the stay order in the case would still remain effective until the High Court rules on the issue at hand. Stay orders are not automatically vacated or ineffective. You are advised to submit a certified copy of the stay order from the High Court in the lower court. You can further also ask the lower court to recall the NBW and update the records by filing an application, quoting the stay. You can take proactive follow-up from the registry of the High Court to schedule the case for hearing in order to prevent open-ended delays in the case. In case the lower court disobeys the stay, you can choose to prosecute a contempt petition in the High Court for disobedience.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Kindly note the following points,Entitlement to 1/3 Share in the PropertyAccording to Section 6 of theHindu Succession Act, 1956, your mother's property goes to her husband and children equally if she passed away intestate (without a will). As you and your sister were minors in 1997, the transmission of the whole property to your father through revenue records can be held invalid if it did not include your shares.Cancellation of Registered Sale AgreementThe contract specifically requires pahani correction and your signatures to complete sales. As such conditions are yet to be completed, the buyer cannot enforce the contract. Omission of mentioning pahani correction in the contract and hurriedly getting your father to register it may amount to fraud. The lack of a timeline in your case further also diminishes the claim of the buyer since courts typically expect reasonable timeframes for execution.Options for CancellationPrepare a cancellation deed (registered before the same sub-registrar). This can take 2–4 weeks if the buyer is willing to cooperate.Lodge a civil suit under Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act for cancellation. Possibility of success is high because of non-fulfilment of pre-conditions (pahani correction, your signatures) and the potential fraud in execution.3. Lawsuit Timeline and ProcessKarnataka civil suits normally take 2–5 years for settlement, subject to court backlog. The Interim injunctions may restrain the buyer from selling during the pendency of litigation.Steps:You can institute a suit for cancellation and declaration of your shares.You may obtain an interim injunction restraining the buyer.You can Exhibit proof of pahani defects and non-consent.Validity of Agreement After 3 YearsUnder the Section 59 of the Limitation Act, a cancellation suit should be instituted primarily within 3 years from the date of discovery of fraud/defect. No time limit having been provided, the agreement will not automatically lapse after 3 years. Yet, the inability of the buyer to complete conditions (pahani correction, your signatures) makes it unenforceable.Critical RecommendationsSend a legal notice to the buyer pointing out breaches.File mutation request in revenue records to rectify pahani and establish your shares.The Failure to sign the sale deed cancels the transaction as per the terms of the agreement.Get a property attorney in Karnataka to prepare the cancellation deed/lawsuit and pursue your father's rights.Note: Safeguard your father from undue influence by the buyer. Keep a record of all interactions and maintain copies of the sale agreement, pahani records, and communication. This strategy focuses on safeguarding your inheritance rights and using the defective terms of the agreement to invalidate the sale. Pre-emptive legal action is needed to avoid causing irreparable damage.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Association evicting my unmarried tenants",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The decision of the building association to admit only families as their tenants is not legally valid reason for eviction. The Kerala Buildings (Lease and Rent Control) Act, 1965, it states that no landlord or association can arbitrarily evict tenants these subjective grounds. Eviction is only justified by the Rent Control Court on certain reasons such as non-payment of rent, abuse of the property, bona fide requirement of the landlord, subletting without authorization, or abandonment of the property. As your tenants are working women and hopefully paying rent and not causing any misuse of the property, the association's resolution by itself cannot be a valid ground for eviction. The association cannot circumvent legal eviction proceedings by adopting a resolution passed in the AGM. Eviction can only be directed by the Rent Control Court after due process. Additionally, moral policing or limitations through tenant profiles (e.g., admitting only families) has been challenged and criticized in Kerala since it violates the rights of tenants to privacy and freedom. You may safeguard your tenants by asserting their legal tenancy rights and resisting attempts at eviction that do not meet the provisions of the Rent Control Act.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Registered sale of agreement cancellation",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Kindly note the following points,Entitlement to 1/3 Share in the PropertyAccording to Section 6 of theHindu Succession Act, 1956, your mother's property goes to her husband and children equally if she passed away intestate (without a will). As you and your sister were minors in 1997, the transmission of the whole property to your father through revenue records can be held invalid if it did not include your shares.Cancellation of Registered Sale AgreementThe contract specifically requires pahani correction and your signatures to complete sales. As such conditions are yet to be completed, the buyer cannot enforce the contract. Omission of mentioning pahani correction in the contract and hurriedly getting your father to register it may amount to fraud. The lack of a timeline in your case further also diminishes the claim of the buyer since courts typically expect reasonable timeframes for execution.Options for CancellationPrepare a cancellation deed (registered before the same sub-registrar). This can take 2–4 weeks if the buyer is willing to cooperate.Lodge a civil suit under Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act for cancellation. Possibility of success is high because of non-fulfilment of pre-conditions (pahani correction, your signatures) and the potential fraud in execution.3. Lawsuit Timeline and ProcessKarnataka civil suits normally take 2–5 years for settlement, subject to court backlog. The Interim injunctions may restrain the buyer from selling during the pendency of litigation.Steps:You can institute a suit for cancellation and declaration of your shares.You may obtain an interim injunction restraining the buyer.You can Exhibit proof of pahani defects and non-consent.Validity of Agreement After 3 YearsUnder the Section 59 of the Limitation Act, a cancellation suit should be instituted primarily within 3 years from the date of discovery of fraud/defect. No time limit having been provided, the agreement will not automatically lapse after 3 years. Yet, the inability of the buyer to complete conditions (pahani correction, your signatures) makes it unenforceable.Critical RecommendationsSend a legal notice to the buyer pointing out breaches.File mutation request in revenue records to rectify pahani and establish your shares.The Failure to sign the sale deed cancels the transaction as per the terms of the agreement.Get a property attorney in Karnataka to prepare the cancellation deed/lawsuit and pursue your father's rights.Note: Safeguard your father from undue influence by the buyer. Keep a record of all interactions and maintain copies of the sale agreement, pahani records, and communication. This strategy focuses on safeguarding your inheritance rights and using the defective terms of the agreement to invalidate the sale. Pre-emptive legal action is needed to avoid causing irreparable damage.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "This agreement is burdened with conditions (conditional agreement)…All children signing thePahani corrections.Only the registered owner is entitled to seek correction of pahani. If the vendor refuses to seek correction of pahani by revenue authority, there is no question of execution of sale deed.If the children refuse to sign, there cannot be execution of sale deed.All family members are shares in the property as it is purchased in the  name of mother.

    "question": "Association evicting my unmarried tenants",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The decision of the building association to admit only families as their tenants is not legally valid reason for eviction. The Kerala Buildings (Lease and Rent Control) Act, 1965, it states that no landlord or association can arbitrarily evict tenants these subjective grounds. Eviction is only justified by the Rent Control Court on certain reasons such as non-payment of rent, abuse of the property, bona fide requirement of the landlord, subletting without authorization, or abandonment of the property. As your tenants are working women and hopefully paying rent and not causing any misuse of the property, the association's resolution by itself cannot be a valid ground for eviction. The association cannot circumvent legal eviction proceedings by adopting a resolution passed in the AGM. Eviction can only be directed by the Rent Control Court after due process. Additionally, moral policing or limitations through tenant profiles (e.g., admitting only families) has been challenged and criticized in Kerala since it violates the rights of tenants to privacy and freedom.

    "answer": "1.When a High Court sets aside a divorce decree in an appeal, and the respondent has remarried, the remarriage is generally considered invalid, and the first marriage is restored.However, the situation can be complex, and the specific outcome depends on various factors, including the timing of the remarriage and the specific grounds for setting aside the divorce decree.2.. It will be possible to file a defamation case if the High Court overturns a divorce decree based on allegations of cruelty, and you believe the wife's claims were defamatory.A defamation case would need to demonstrate that the wife's statements were false, published, and caused you harm, and that she acted with malice or negligence.To prove defamation, you would need to show thata) The statement must be factually incorrect.b)Thestatement must have been communicated to a third party.c)The statement must have caused damage to your reputation.d)In many cases, you would need to demonstrate that the defendant made the statement with knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard for its truth.The High Court's decision overturning the divorce decree based on the lack of cruelty is relevant evidence that the allegations made against you were potentially false.This evidence can be used to support a claim that the statements were defamatory.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Legal options post reversal of divorce decree by High Court",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India. I can understand your concern. It is unfortunate that you could not lead a happy married life. There are some incidents that happen in your life and those incidents are so strong that they change your DNA. They say marriages are made in heaven. But so is thunder and lightning. At times, despite our best efforts, life takes a turn for the worst. We may have wanted different things from life, but life’s got its own plan as well. A bad marriage is something which nobody hopes for, but at times, that’s exactly what we are given and forced to face head on. As you know that marriage doesn't guarantee that you will be together forever, it's only paper. It takes trust, respect, faith, friendship and understanding to make it last. Moreover a relationship without trust is like a car without gas, you can stay in it as long as you want but it won't go anywhere. Marriages are hard. Divorces…even harder. Nobody enters marriage thinking about a divorce in the end. If some are unable to cope with the harsh realities of marriage, the only viable option in front of them is to approach the Court and seek legal separation.The divorce was granted on 30th May 2024 and she remarried around 21st November 2024. Section 15 ofHindu Marriage Actsays when a marriage has been dissolved by a decree of divorce and either there is no right of appeal against the decree or, if there is such a right of appeal, the time for appealing has expired without an appeal having been presented, or an appeal has been presented but has been dismissed, it shall be lawful for either party to the marriage to marry again.She was deliberately avoiding the service of summons and you have filed the appeal within the limitation period. Therefore, Court may set aside the marriage, however, the burden of proof is on you to state that she was deliberately avoid service. The \"burden of proof\" in the context of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, essentially means the obligation of a party in a legal case to prove a particular fact in order for the court to consider it and potentially render a decision in their favor. You can initiate civil suit for recovery of damages. There are various cases in which Courts have granted compensation/damages to the husbands as well.

The sale of the property is not possible without everyone's consent in the said case.

You are directed to consult a lawyer and draft a sale agreement executed by all co-owners and the buyer, indicating terms of sale and proportion of proceeds. Register the sale deed before the local sub-registrar office with signatures by all co-owners. Transfer the sale proceeds among co-owners proportionate to their respective shareholdings.

    "question": "Association evicting my unmarried tenants",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The decision of the building association to admit only families as their tenants is not legally valid reason for eviction. The Kerala Buildings (Lease and Rent Control) Act, 1965, it states that no landlord or association can arbitrarily evict tenants these subjective grounds. Eviction is only justified by the Rent Control Court on certain reasons such as non-payment of rent, abuse of the property, bona fide requirement of the landlord, subletting without authorization, or abandonment of the property. As your tenants are working women and hopefully paying rent and not causing any misuse of the property, the association's resolution by itself cannot be a valid ground for eviction. The association cannot circumvent legal eviction proceedings by adopting a resolution passed in the AGM. Eviction can only be directed by the Rent Control Court after due process. Additionally, moral policing or limitations through tenant profiles (e.g., admitting only families) has been challenged and criticized in Kerala since it violates the rights of tenants to privacy and freedom. You may safeguard your tenants by asserting their legal tenancy rights and resisting attempts at eviction that do not meet the provisions of the Rent Control Act.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It will be possible to file a defamation case if the High Court overturns a divorce decree based on allegations of cruelty, and you believe the wife's claims were defamatory.A defamation case would need to demonstrate that the wife's statements were false, published, and caused you harm, and that she acted with malice or negligence.To prove defamation, you would need to show thata) The statement must be factually incorrect.b)Thestatement must have been communicated to a third party.c)The statement must have caused damage to your reputation.d)In many cases, you would need to demonstrate that the defendant made the statement with knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard for its truth.The High Court's decision overturning the divorce decree based on the lack of cruelty is relevant evidence that the allegations made against you were potentially false.This evidence can be used to support a claim that the statements were defamatory.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Legal options post reversal of divorce decree by High Court",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India. I can understand your concern. It is unfortunate that you could not lead a happy married life. There are some incidents that happen in your life and those incidents are so strong that they change your DNA. They say marriages are made in heaven. But so is thunder and lightning. At times, despite our best efforts, life takes a turn for the worst. We may have wanted different things from life, but life’s got its own plan as well. A bad marriage is something which nobody hopes for, but at times, that’s exactly what we are given and forced to face head on. As you know that marriage doesn't guarantee that you will be together forever, it's only paper. It takes trust, respect, faith, friendship and understanding to make it last. Moreover a relationship without trust is like a car without gas, you can stay in it as long as you want but it won't go anywhere. Marriages are hard. Divorces…even harder. Nobody enters marriage thinking about a divorce in the end. If some are unable to cope with the harsh realities of marriage, the only viable option in front of them is to approach the Court and seek legal separation.The divorce was granted on 30th May 2024 and she remarried around 21st November 2024. Section 15 ofHindu Marriage Actsays when a marriage has been dissolved by a decree of divorce and either there is no right of appeal against the decree or, if there is such a right of appeal, the time for appealing has expired without an appeal having been presented, or an appeal has been presented but has been dismissed, it shall be lawful for either party to the marriage to marry again.She was deliberately avoiding the service of summons and you have filed the appeal within the limitation period. Therefore, Court may set aside the marriage, however, the burden of proof is on you to state that she was deliberately avoid service. The \"burden of proof\" in the context of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, essentially means the obligation of a party in a legal case to prove a particular fact in order for the court to consider it and potentially render a decision in their favor. You can initiate civil suit for recovery of damages. There are various cases in which Courts have granted compensation/damages to the husbands as well.

    "answer": "Dear Client, the following points are to be noted.The stay order issued \"until the next date of hearing\" continues in force indefinitely unless specifically vacated by the High Court. The 2024 SC judgment (cited in sources) made it clear that stay orders do not automatically expire after six months. It is to be noted that even if the opposite party does nothing regarding the stay order, the stay order in the case would still remain effective until the High Court rules on the issue at hand. Stay orders are not automatically vacated or ineffective. You are advised to submit a certified copy of the stay order from the High Court in the lower court. You can further also ask the lower court to recall the NBW and update the records by filing an application, quoting the stay. You can take proactive follow-up from the registry of the High Court to schedule the case for hearing in order to prevent open-ended delays in the case.

    "answer": "Dear Client,For the renovation of the house and conversion of the electricity connection from residential to commercial, you can go ahead if the tenant has been evacuated already, or if you have a court order to do so. As you have recently provided the tenant with a final notice to quit the rented premises because of the current rental court case is close to being determined you have the authority to carry out the renovation work. But make sure that you do not infringe any court order regarding the status of the tenant during the eviction process to avert any legal hurt. If rental arrears cross ₹2 lakh, you can get a vacate order in your favour. If the court has granted you an ex parte order then you can enforce it to regain possession of the property. It is always wise to seek legal advice and help in order to conduct all actions without a violation of law and to help in the proper implementation of the court order.Hope you find this answer helpful in resolving your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Non-financial contribution of an adult son in father's self-acquired property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In Indian Hindu law, a Hindu adult son cannot have any legal entitlement or interest in his father's self-acquired property just because he made non-financial contributions in his lifetime. The father alone has complete ownership and freedom to dispose of his self-acquired property in any manner he desires, including donating or leaving it to any person regardless of the son's non-financial or other contributions. Self-acquired property is the property that a father himself acquires through his own efforts and is not ancestral property. Sons do not automatically have any right or interest in such property in the lifetime of the father. The term \"non-financial contribution\" (like care, labor, or any other non-monetary contribution) can be identified primarily in women's rights during the time of divorce or maintenance proceedings under acts like theHindu Marriage Actbut not in entitling inheritance or claims by sons on self-acquired property of their father. When the father dies intestate, the self-acquired property goes to Class I heirs (sons and daughters) equally in accordance with theHindu Succession Act, 1956. Sons are then legally entitled to an equal share irrespective of any contribution made earlier. If a father makes a will or gift of his self-acquired property, sons cannot have any share unless they establish actual money contribution in the acquisition and co-ownership, which is unlikely and rare. The law differentiates very clearly between ancestral property where sons have coparcenary rights by birth and self-acquired property where sons have no rights during their father's lifetimeAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Land Sale deed executed by court on which bank loan exists",
    "answer": "If a borrower defaults on their loan, the NBFC can initiate SARFAESI proceedings, which can include taking possession of the secured asset and selling it through auction.A registered sale deed normally signifies that the property has been transferred to a new owner.However, if the NBFC holds a valid security interest on the property and the borrower has defaulted, the NBFC's claim takes precedence.However, in your case, it was not the owner who had executed the registered sale deed in your favor but it was by an order of court.Moreover, since the property was mortgaged but the NBFC has registered only the memorandum of title deeds alone, you may not find a reflection of this transaction in the encumbrance certificate.In all the probabilities, you were not in the knowledge of the so called mortgage loan even at the time of getting the property registered to your name through a court order.The suppression of the fact of the registration of property to your name by the owner to the NBFC  and suppression of the fact of the property being mortgaged to NBFC  after entering into an agreement with you, is a criminal offence and both you as well as the NBFC can initiate criminal actions also against him, but for now you have to defend your interest by stating that the property was already transferred to your name by a registered sale deed through court especially even before the NBFC had declared the account as NPS and before invoking the sarfaesi act , hence you may take shelter on this point and defend your interest properly in the court proceedings.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

Gopala Rao vs UBI).But in Your Case:Thesequence is reversed: your agreement predates the mortgage.Thecourt has already ruled in your favour, and thesale deed is judicially executed, not by the seller.You can cite principles ofequity and prior possession, and thedoctrine of lis pendensunder Section 52 of theTransfer of Property Act.Suggested Action:File adetailed objection before DRTunderSection 17 of SARFAESI Act.Include:Your court order,Possession certificate,Tax payments,Timeline proving your claim precedes the mortgage.Case Law That May Support You:K.J. Nathan v. Maruthi Rao– SC emphasizedequitable ownership via possession and payment.Vidhyadhar v. Manikrao– reinforces validity of court-decreed sale even if against third-party claims.Final Note:You have astrong case to retain the property, provided you act quickly and legally challenge the NBFC's claim in the DRT.

    "answer": "Recently the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a warning note highlighting the risks associated with retail unsecured loans. Validating the RBI’s concernsThe RBI guidelines have definitely brought some relief to defaulters. They allow defaulters to restructure their loans and make smaller payments, which can help them get back on their feet financially. The guidelines also provide for a longer repayment period, which can make it easier for defaulters to manage their debt.In India, the legal rights of defaulters are widely protected by legislation and regulatory frameworks. In a recent communication, The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) directed banks and finance companies to undertake compromise settlements or technical write-offs on accounts categorized as wilful defaulters or fraud. This implies that a wilful offender or a company involved in fraud will no longer face prejudice by lenders, on account of criminal proceedings against them.If nothing works out then you can file an insolvency petition with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). .As asalaried individual who defaults on a personal loan can apply for insolvency proceedings.The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) of 2016 allows individuals, including salaried employees, to file for bankruptcy if they are unable to repay their debts.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Unable to pay EMI on unsecured loans",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Urgent measures are needed in order to prevent defaults and avoid any form of legal issues. To begin with, you are advised to negotiate with your lenders for restructuring or rescheduling of loans, that may involve stretching the tenure, or decreasing EMIs, or decreasing the interest rates to ensure repayment ease. Consolidation of debt bundling several loans into one loan with a lower rate of interest can also make payments easier and that may be an easier way to the burden lower. Refrain from taking fresh loans or speculative investments to settle debts, as this can deepen your financial situation. Pay the minimum EMIs at least to avoid defaulting and adverse credit reporting. If restructuring cannot be done, get advice from a financial advisor or credit counselling agency for a repayment schedule. In extreme situations, one can go in for legal insolvency under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, but that should be a last resort. Being proactive and talking to lenders is the best way to avoid future entanglements.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The mother in law is reported to have transferred the property by a testamentary disposition in favor of son of brother of her deceased husband by creating a Will. Even though the Will was an unregistered instrument, there was no necessity for the legatee to get a probate to the Will. However since he had approached court for grant of probate, the daughter in law would be respondent, hence she had filed her objections.  However it is not understood that how the daughter inn law had sold the entire property especially when she had already relinquished her rights in the proeprty, and it appears to be a fraudulent sale if my guess is correct.Any further opinion depends after close scrutiny of the property related papers.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Land Sale deed executed by court on which bank loan exists",
    "answer": "If a borrower defaults on their loan, the NBFC can initiate SARFAESI proceedings, which can include taking possession of the secured asset and selling it through auction.A registered sale deed normally signifies that the property has been transferred to a new owner.However, if the NBFC holds a valid security interest on the property and the borrower has defaulted, the NBFC's claim takes precedence.However, in your case, it was not the owner who had executed the registered sale deed in your favor but it was by an order of court.Moreover, since the property was mortgaged but the NBFC has registered only the memorandum of title deeds alone, you may not find a reflection of this transaction in the encumbrance certificate.In all the probabilities, you were not in the knowledge of the so called mortgage loan even at the time of getting the property registered to your name through a court order.The suppression of the fact of the registration of property to your name by the owner to the NBFC  and suppression of the fact of the property being mortgaged to NBFC  after entering into an agreement with you, is a criminal offence and both you as well as the NBFC can initiate criminal actions also against him, but for now you have to defend your interest by stating that the property was already transferred to your name by a registered sale deed through court especially even before the NBFC had declared the account as NPS and before invoking the sarfaesi act , hence you may take shelter on this point and defend your interest properly in the court proceedings.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Land Sale deed executed by court on which bank loan exists",
    "answer": "Based on the facts you provided,you have a stronger claimthan the NBFC, because:Key Points in Your Favour:Your sale agreement (2017) is prior to the bank’s mortgage (2019).You filed acivil case before the mortgage, and thecourt executed the sale deedin your favour in 2023.You havepossession, tax receipts, and court-backed sale deed.The bank did not verify encumbrances properly or inform the court.What the Bank May Argue:Theirmortgage was registered, while yourinitial sale agreement was unregistered.UnderSARFAESI, registered security interest often gets priority (as seen inSri G. Gopala Rao vs UBI).But in Your Case:Thesequence is reversed: your agreement predates the mortgage.Thecourt has already ruled in your favour, and thesale deed is judicially executed, not by the seller.You can cite principles ofequity and prior possession, and thedoctrine of lis pendensunder Section 52 of theTransfer of Property Act.Suggested Action:File adetailed objection before DRTunderSection 17 of SARFAESI Act.Include:Your court order,Possession certificate,Tax payments,Timeline proving your claim precedes the mortgage.Case Law That May Support You:K.J. Nathan v. Maruthi Rao– SC emphasizedequitable ownership via possession and payment.Vidhyadhar v. Manikrao– reinforces validity of court-decreed sale even if against third-party claims.Final Note:You have astrong case to retain the property, provided you act quickly and legally challenge the NBFC's claim in the DRT. A property lawyer experienced in SARFAESI cases can help you frame the right objection."

    "answer": "You can have solutions to your problem only through legal sources and not otherwise.If you will not be able to take any legal action then you may have to continue to suffer in the same manner.Dealing with toxic in-laws requires setting clear boundaries, communicating openly with your partner, and practicing self-care.It's also crucial to recognize that their behavior is often a reflection of their own issues and not necessarily about you.You may first block their numbers and install antivirus apps in your mobile as well as in your laptop.Block them everywhere and don't be worried about they blocking your friend's mobile, it is their problemIf necessary you can file a divorce case on the grounds ow mental cruelty for the acts of harassment and other issues created by her parents making your married life miserable.You may please note thatunwarranted interference from a wife's parents can be a ground for divorce, particularly if it leads to cruelty or mental distress that makes it impossible for the couple to continue living together.The Delhi High Court granted divorce to a man on the ground of cruelty as it found that there was unwarranted interference of his wife’s parents in their matrimonial life.A Division Bench comprising Justice Suresh Kumar Kait and Justice Neena Bansal Krishna said, “From the evidence of the parties, it is evident that there was an unwarranted interference of the parents and the family members of the respondent in the matrimonial life of the appellant, as has been asserted by him. Such parental interference reached an extent of causing immense harassment to the appellant, who was even made to face multiple complaints before the different agencies. The parties are residing separately since 2001 i.e. for about 13 years, during which the appellant has been deprived of his conjugal relationship for no fault of his. It needs no reiteration that the bedrock of any matrimonial relationship is cohabitation and conjugal relationships.” The Bench added that for a spouse to be deprived of his wife’s company proves that the marriage cannot survive, and such deprivation of conjugal relationships is an act of extreme cruelty.Therefore you may have to take decision at least now in this regard or else you may not find any solution to this.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "You are facing a serious case of harassment and defamation by your in-laws, made worse by your health condition. Since you're bedbound and unable to take direct legal action, you can still protect yourself in key ways. First, reset your phone and change all passwords to stop potential tracking or hacking, and report this to the cybercrime portal at cybercrime.gov.in. Second, gather and save any evidence of defamation or threats, including messages or witness accounts. You can ask a lawyer to send a legal notice on your behalf and file a police complaint through a representative, explaining your medical situation. Do not give in to any pressure for divorce or money—such demands are illegal. If needed, seek free legal aid through the State Legal Services Authority, which may offer home-based support.

    "answer": "You can typically claim a parking place in the apartment association after purchasing a flat, especially if the parking space was included in the purchase price or mentioned in the sale agreement.If parking spaces were sold separately by the developer, the Supreme Court has ruled that these are common areas and cannot be sold independently.In such cases, you may be entitled to a refund.However, if the society has a lottery system or other method for managing parking, you may need to follow the society's rules.If you purchased a flat and the sale agreement includes parking, you generally have the right to use that parking space.You may verify from your registered sale deed about this and then plan to fight for it legally.If the society's rules do not accommodate your specific needs, you may need to negotiate with the association or consider legal options.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Can stilt parking area be sold to individual flat owners?",
    "answer": "As per RERA guidelines, stilt parking spaces cannot be sold separately from the property. They fall under the common areas shared by all property owners in the building. According to the Supreme Court, stilt parking areas cannot be sold to individual flat owners. The court has ruled that stilt parking spaces, along with open parking areas, are considered common areas and are part of the \"common areas and facilities\" included in the sale price of a flat. This means that residents have the right to use these parking spaces without paying additional charges.You can send a legal notice concerned builder and the society in charge i.e. the President/Chairman. A legal notice is a formal communication to a person or entity informing them that you intend to undertake legal proceedings against him/her. It is a step taken before filing a suit, and is meant to warn the other party that legal action may be taken against him/her, if they fail to comply with some specified condition. The most common cases where I have engaged with my clients in sending legal notices is in cases of property disputes, builder-buyer disputes, dishonour of Cheques, family disputes pertaining to asset distributions, husband-wife conflicts, consumer complaints and cases where salary/wage commitments are not met. The dispute therefore, can be resolved before going to the Court which generally involves time, effort and money. Legal Notice through Advocate can be sent with a warning to comply with the rules/laws within 15 days.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete facts/documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Shri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "answer": "- As per Supreme Court, Builder has no right to sell parking to apartment-owners, including stilt parking or garages; .the car parking is a part of the society's common area- Further, if the buyer -seller agreement mentions car parking as a separate item, or the buyer can produce other evidence of having purchased it, he can challenge the developer, and can get refund from the builder legally.- Further, a builder has no right to sell stilt parking or open parking, both of which are part of common amenities. , and only the housing society's general body could make the allotment of space to flat occupiers.- After forming the society and registered , it becomes the owner of all the common spaces of the apartment complex including the parking spots, and society can make new rule for allotting the parking to its members.- Hence, the society cannot refuse you on the ground of selling the same by the builder- You can lodge your complaint against the society before the Registrar , and even can file a complaint before the Consumer Forum as well.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Can stilt parking area be sold to individual flat owners?",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Legally, the price of such parking spaces is already accounted for in the sale price of the flat. Hence, the society's argument that all the parking spaces were sold by the builder at first instance is legally debatable. You are entitled to utilize the parking spaces as collective property and the society owes it to ensure fair distribution. If the society denies granting parking, you can initially go to the managing committee or Residents' Welfare Association (RWA) of the society for redressal. Failing that, you can file a complaint before the Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, which is quicker and cheaper for such real estate grievances. Alternatively, you can go to the civil court, but that is generally more time-consuming and costly. When it comes to legal expenses, a consumer complaint usually entails nominal charges (a couple of thousand rupees based on the amount of claim), but civil litigation may mean more than ₹50,000 or even more based on complexity as well as attorney charges.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

First, support the investigation by the police so that you are not arrested or taken action against but assert that the FIR is uncalled for. You must consult a criminal lawyer at once who can assist you in presenting a petition under the BNSS in the High Court for quashing of the FIR on the merits that it is frivolous, malicious, and devoid of evidence. The High Court can set aside such FIRs to avoid abuse of the legal process. Also, if the police try to arrest without procedure, you may plead wrongful arrest. Presenting evidence the that refutes your lorry's involvement, like that of toll records, GPS information, or witness statements will also further improve your case. If you find that the FIR was lodged with any form of malicious intent, then can also choose to file a defamation or malicious prosecution case against the complainant.

    "answer": "If a borrower defaults on their loan, the NBFC can initiate SARFAESI proceedings, which can include taking possession of the secured asset and selling it through auction.A registered sale deed normally signifies that the property has been transferred to a new owner.However, if the NBFC holds a valid security interest on the property and the borrower has defaulted, the NBFC's claim takes precedence.However, in your case, it was not the owner who had executed the registered sale deed in your favor but it was by an order of court.Moreover, since the property was mortgaged but the NBFC has registered only the memorandum of title deeds alone, you may not find a reflection of this transaction in the encumbrance certificate.In all the probabilities, you were not in the knowledge of the so called mortgage loan even at the time of getting the property registered to your name through a court order.The suppression of the fact of the registration of property to your name by the owner to the NBFC  and suppression of the fact of the property being mortgaged to NBFC  after entering into an agreement with you, is a criminal offence and both you as well as the NBFC can initiate criminal actions also against him, but for now you have to defend your interest by stating that the property was already transferred to your name by a registered sale deed through court especially even before the NBFC had declared the account as NPS and before invoking the sarfaesi act , hence you may take shelter on this point and defend your interest properly in the court proceedings.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

If the property was self-acquired by your father, he can bequeath it according to his wishes. However, if it is ancestral, his will cannot disinherit or diminish your share without your permission. Because the will is not registered but valid if signed properly (thumb impression is valid according to Supreme Court), it can be challenged but cannot override inheritance rights in ancestral property by default.

    "answer": "- As per the RBI, the bank should give proper time and offers for the settlement of loan amount.,  on the ground of health and sudden loss- If, the bank is not agreed to give time, then let them to start legal action against you.- Firstly, the bank will issue demand notice prior to take legal action from the court. You can reply the same after narrating the whole story of business failure or loss.- Even, if the bank filed a case before the Court, you will have much time to repay the said loan amount and to settle the matter according to your present situation.- If bank official/people are harassing, then even you can lodge a complaint to the police , as they are not allowed to take law in their hand.You can contact me, if further suggestion needed.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Unable to pay EMI on unsecured loans",
    "answer": "Recently the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a warning note highlighting the risks associated with retail unsecured loans. Validating the RBI’s concernsThe RBI guidelines have definitely brought some relief to defaulters. They allow defaulters to restructure their loans and make smaller payments, which can help them get back on their feet financially. The guidelines also provide for a longer repayment period, which can make it easier for defaulters to manage their debt.In India, the legal rights of defaulters are widely protected by legislation and regulatory frameworks. In a recent communication, The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) directed banks and finance companies to undertake compromise settlements or technical write-offs on accounts categorized as wilful defaulters or fraud. This implies that a wilful offender or a company involved in fraud will no longer face prejudice by lenders, on account of criminal proceedings against them.If nothing works out then you can file an insolvency petition with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). .As asalaried individual who defaults on a personal loan can apply for insolvency proceedings.The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) of 2016 allows individuals, including salaried employees, to file for bankruptcy if they are unable to repay their debts.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Unable to pay EMI on unsecured loans",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Urgent measures are needed in order to prevent defaults and avoid any form of legal issues. To begin with, you are advised to negotiate with your lenders for restructuring or rescheduling of loans, that may involve stretching the tenure, or decreasing EMIs, or decreasing the interest rates to ensure repayment ease. Consolidation of debt bundling several loans into one loan with a lower rate of interest can also make payments easier and that may be an easier way to the burden lower. Refrain from taking fresh loans or speculative investments to settle debts, as this can deepen your financial situation. Pay the minimum EMIs at least to avoid defaulting and adverse credit reporting. If restructuring cannot be done, get advice from a financial advisor or credit counselling agency for a repayment schedule. In extreme situations, one can go in for legal insolvency under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, but that should be a last resort. Being proactive and talking to lenders is the best way to avoid future entanglements.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Your wife would not become the sole owner automatically but would have a share along with your children.How to include your wife's name in ownership now?The most typical and simplest method is to make a Gift Deed in favour of your wife, giving either full or part ownership in your lifetime. The process is:Prepare a gift deed mentioning the property and share given to your wife.Give required stamp duty (3% in Maharashtra for gift to spouse) and registration charges.Register the gift deed at the local Sub-Registrar's office with the presence of both parties and witnesses.Modify municipal and society records to show joint ownership.This makes your wife a co-owner as soon as today, securing her rights and preventing future troubles.How to make sure your daughter will inherit the property after you and your wife are no longer around?You must make a Will where you stipulate that upon your and your wife's death, the property shall devolve specifically in your daughter's favour.

    "question": "Non-financial contribution of an adult son in father's self-acquired property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In Indian Hindu law, a Hindu adult son cannot have any legal entitlement or interest in his father's self-acquired property just because he made non-financial contributions in his lifetime. The father alone has complete ownership and freedom to dispose of his self-acquired property in any manner he desires, including donating or leaving it to any person regardless of the son's non-financial or other contributions. Self-acquired property is the property that a father himself acquires through his own efforts and is not ancestral property. Sons do not automatically have any right or interest in such property in the lifetime of the father. The term \"non-financial contribution\" (like care, labor, or any other non-monetary contribution) can be identified primarily in women's rights during the time of divorce or maintenance proceedings under acts like theHindu Marriage Actbut not in entitling inheritance or claims by sons on self-acquired property of their father. When the father dies intestate, the self-acquired property goes to Class I heirs (sons and daughters) equally in accordance with theHindu Succession Act, 1956. Sons are then legally entitled to an equal share irrespective of any contribution made earlier. If a father makes a will or gift of his self-acquired property, sons cannot have any share unless they establish actual money contribution in the acquisition and co-ownership, which is unlikely and rare. The law differentiates very clearly between ancestral property where sons have coparcenary rights by birth and self-acquired property where sons have no rights during their father's lifetimeAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "If a borrower defaults on their loan, the NBFC can initiate SARFAESI proceedings, which can include taking possession of the secured asset and selling it through auction.A registered sale deed normally signifies that the property has been transferred to a new owner.However, if the NBFC holds a valid security interest on the property and the borrower has defaulted, the NBFC's claim takes precedence.However, in your case, it was not the owner who had executed the registered sale deed in your favor but it was by an order of court.Moreover, since the property was mortgaged but the NBFC has registered only the memorandum of title deeds alone, you may not find a reflection of this transaction in the encumbrance certificate.In all the probabilities, you were not in the knowledge of the so called mortgage loan even at the time of getting the property registered to your name through a court order.The suppression of the fact of the registration of property to your name by the owner to the NBFC  and suppression of the fact of the property being mortgaged to NBFC  after entering into an agreement with you, is a criminal offence and both you as well as the NBFC can initiate criminal actions also against him, but for now you have to defend your interest by stating that the property was already transferred to your name by a registered sale deed through court especially even before the NBFC had declared the account as NPS and before invoking the sarfaesi act , hence you may take shelter on this point and defend your interest properly in the court proceedings.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Recently the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a warning note highlighting the risks associated with retail unsecured loans. Validating the RBI’s concernsThe RBI guidelines have definitely brought some relief to defaulters. They allow defaulters to restructure their loans and make smaller payments, which can help them get back on their feet financially. The guidelines also provide for a longer repayment period, which can make it easier for defaulters to manage their debt.In India, the legal rights of defaulters are widely protected by legislation and regulatory frameworks. In a recent communication, The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) directed banks and finance companies to undertake compromise settlements or technical write-offs on accounts categorized as wilful defaulters or fraud. This implies that a wilful offender or a company involved in fraud will no longer face prejudice by lenders, on account of criminal proceedings against them.If nothing works out then you can file an insolvency petition with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). .As asalaried individual who defaults on a personal loan can apply for insolvency proceedings.The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) of 2016 allows individuals, including salaried employees, to file for bankruptcy if they are unable to repay their debts.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Unable to pay EMI on unsecured loans",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Urgent measures are needed in order to prevent defaults and avoid any form of legal issues. To begin with, you are advised to negotiate with your lenders for restructuring or rescheduling of loans, that may involve stretching the tenure, or decreasing EMIs, or decreasing the interest rates to ensure repayment ease. Consolidation of debt bundling several loans into one loan with a lower rate of interest can also make payments easier and that may be an easier way to the burden lower. Refrain from taking fresh loans or speculative investments to settle debts, as this can deepen your financial situation. Pay the minimum EMIs at least to avoid defaulting and adverse credit reporting. If restructuring cannot be done, get advice from a financial advisor or credit counselling agency for a repayment schedule. In extreme situations, one can go in for legal insolvency under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, but that should be a last resort.

    "question": "Land Sale deed executed by court on which bank loan exists",
    "answer": "If a borrower defaults on their loan, the NBFC can initiate SARFAESI proceedings, which can include taking possession of the secured asset and selling it through auction.A registered sale deed normally signifies that the property has been transferred to a new owner.However, if the NBFC holds a valid security interest on the property and the borrower has defaulted, the NBFC's claim takes precedence.However, in your case, it was not the owner who had executed the registered sale deed in your favor but it was by an order of court.Moreover, since the property was mortgaged but the NBFC has registered only the memorandum of title deeds alone, you may not find a reflection of this transaction in the encumbrance certificate.In all the probabilities, you were not in the knowledge of the so called mortgage loan even at the time of getting the property registered to your name through a court order.The suppression of the fact of the registration of property to your name by the owner to the NBFC  and suppression of the fact of the property being mortgaged to NBFC  after entering into an agreement with you, is a criminal offence and both you as well as the NBFC can initiate criminal actions also against him, but for now you have to defend your interest by stating that the property was already transferred to your name by a registered sale deed through court especially even before the NBFC had declared the account as NPS and before invoking the sarfaesi act , hence you may take shelter on this point and defend your interest properly in the court proceedings.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

Gopala Rao vs UBI).But in Your Case:Thesequence is reversed: your agreement predates the mortgage.Thecourt has already ruled in your favour, and thesale deed is judicially executed, not by the seller.You can cite principles ofequity and prior possession, and thedoctrine of lis pendensunder Section 52 of theTransfer of Property Act.Suggested Action:File adetailed objection before DRTunderSection 17 of SARFAESI Act.Include:Your court order,Possession certificate,Tax payments,Timeline proving your claim precedes the mortgage.Case Law That May Support You:K.J. Nathan v. Maruthi Rao– SC emphasizedequitable ownership via possession and payment.Vidhyadhar v. Manikrao– reinforces validity of court-decreed sale even if against third-party claims.Final Note:You have astrong case to retain the property, provided you act quickly and legally challenge the NBFC's claim in the DRT.

Your father's will cannot supersede the equal shares of siblings in ancestral property unless the property was self-acquired by your father. An individual cannot create a will that divides ancestral property in a disproportionate manner among beneficiaries if it compromises their legal rights. If the property was self-acquired by your father, he can bequeath it according to his wishes. However, if it is ancestral, his will cannot disinherit or diminish your share without your permission. Because the will is not registered but valid if signed properly (thumb impression is valid according to Supreme Court), it can be challenged but cannot override inheritance rights in ancestral property by default. You can take legal advice to establish the character of the property (ancestral or self-acquired) and safeguard your rights.

Subsequent to the relinquishment of her rights in the property by the daughter in law, the entire  property devolves on the mother in law. The mother in law is reported to have transferred the property by a testamentary disposition in favor of son of brother of her deceased husband by creating a Will. Even though the Will was an unregistered instrument, there was no necessity for the legatee to get a probate to the Will. However since he had approached court for grant of probate, the daughter in law would be respondent, hence she had filed her objections.  However it is not understood that how the daughter inn law had sold the entire property especially when she had already relinquished her rights in the proeprty, and it appears to be a fraudulent sale if my guess is correct.Any further opinion depends after close scrutiny of the property related papers.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

According to the Supreme Court, stilt parking areas cannot be sold to individual flat owners. The court has ruled that stilt parking spaces, along with open parking areas, are considered common areas and are part of the \"common areas and facilities\" included in the sale price of a flat. This means that residents have the right to use these parking spaces without paying additional charges.You can send a legal notice concerned builder and the society in charge i.e. the President/Chairman. A legal notice is a formal communication to a person or entity informing them that you intend to undertake legal proceedings against him/her. It is a step taken before filing a suit, and is meant to warn the other party that legal action may be taken against him/her, if they fail to comply with some specified condition. The most common cases where I have engaged with my clients in sending legal notices is in cases of property disputes, builder-buyer disputes, dishonour of Cheques, family disputes pertaining to asset distributions, husband-wife conflicts, consumer complaints and cases where salary/wage commitments are not met. The dispute therefore, can be resolved before going to the Court which generally involves time, effort and money. Legal Notice through Advocate can be sent with a warning to comply with the rules/laws within 15 days.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete facts/documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Shri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "question": "Can stilt parking area be sold to individual flat owners?",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Legally, the price of such parking spaces is already accounted for in the sale price of the flat. Hence, the society's argument that all the parking spaces were sold by the builder at first instance is legally debatable. You are entitled to utilize the parking spaces as collective property and the society owes it to ensure fair distribution. If the society denies granting parking, you can initially go to the managing committee or Residents' Welfare Association (RWA) of the society for redressal. Failing that, you can file a complaint before the Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, which is quicker and cheaper for such real estate grievances. Alternatively, you can go to the civil court, but that is generally more time-consuming and costly. When it comes to legal expenses, a consumer complaint usually entails nominal charges (a couple of thousand rupees based on the amount of claim), but civil litigation may mean more than ₹50,000 or even more based on complexity as well as attorney charges.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Matrimony maintenance case",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In Muslim law,restitution of conjugal rightsis a established remedy under which a spouse who has deserted the matrimonial home without sufficient reason can be ordered by the court to resume cohabitation. This right is is not absolute but it is subject to equitable considerations such as the health, safety, and well-being of the wife.  Since you and your wife have been staying separately for nearly three years, and the fact that she already filed a case of maintenance under Section 144 BNSS in Kolkata, chances are that she can file a counter case ofdomestic violence(DV) or cruelty if you make the RCR petition. Courts scrutinize such cases closely, and the presence of DV charges can affect the success of the RCR petition. Thus, the filing of RCR can result in complicated litigation, such as counterclaims.Possible to Halt or Resist MaintenanceA wife is entitled to maintenance during the duration of marriage in Muslim law and it is an absolute right. Even if she possesses separate income, the husband is normally under obligation to provide for her. In case the wife does not cohabit with the husband for no reasonable cause, or abandons the matrimonial home, courts can take this into account in maintenance proceedings. Since your wife is not currently employed but is a graduate with previous work experience, you can object to the maintenance claim on the basis that she is able to earn and maintain herself, particularly in light of the extended separation. It is to be noted that the courts have held that maintenance is not granted or can be decreased if the wife is disobedient or will not cohabit with the husband without reasonable cause. You can make an application to set aside the maintenance order, producing proof of her earning capacity or reluctance to reunite.Alternatives to Reconcile and Resume Married LifeCounselling and Mediation: The court usually suggests that parties attend family counselling or mediation prior to going for acrimonious litigation. You can ask the court to refer the case to a family counsellor to look into reconciliation. Showing genuine efforts towards resuming cohabitation, for example, by written invitations or requests to settle disputes, can make your case more solid and may convince the wife to change her mind. Issuing a legal notice indicating your readiness for peaceful cohabitation and concern for the child might initiate dialogue. As you have not had contact with your child in nearly three years, you may petition the court for custody or visitation, which may prompt your wife to negotiate a family settlement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,As soon as a gift deed is executed, registered, and accepted by the donee (you), it usually becomes irrevocable in Indian law (Section 126 ofTransfer of Property Act, 1882). The donor (your father) cannot revoke or cancel the gift deed unilaterally unless there is an express condition in the deed for revocation, or if the gift was given under fraud, coercion, or undue influence. Mere influence on the part of the second wife or a change of circumstances doesn't give him the legal right to revoke the gift.

As the locker is jointly owned, both of them (or their legal representatives) have rights in the same. Your father cannot after your mother's death keep you and other rightful owners out of the contents, particularly if the jewellery is yours or was given by you to your mother. You may institute a suit for injunction in a court of civil jurisdiction to restrain your father from selling or disposing of the jewellery until the dispute is decided.

Such parental interference reached an extent of causing immense harassment to the appellant, who was even made to face multiple complaints before the different agencies. The parties are residing separately since 2001 i.e. for about 13 years, during which the appellant has been deprived of his conjugal relationship for no fault of his. It needs no reiteration that the bedrock of any matrimonial relationship is cohabitation and conjugal relationships.” The Bench added that for a spouse to be deprived of his wife’s company proves that the marriage cannot survive, and such deprivation of conjugal relationships is an act of extreme cruelty.Therefore you may have to take decision at least now in this regard or else you may not find any solution to this.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

Your father's will cannot supersede the equal shares of siblings in ancestral property unless the property was self-acquired by your father. An individual cannot create a will that divides ancestral property in a disproportionate manner among beneficiaries if it compromises their legal rights. If the property was self-acquired by your father, he can bequeath it according to his wishes. However, if it is ancestral, his will cannot disinherit or diminish your share without your permission. Because the will is not registered but valid if signed properly (thumb impression is valid according to Supreme Court), it can be challenged but cannot override inheritance rights in ancestral property by default. You can take legal advice to establish the character of the property (ancestral or self-acquired) and safeguard your rights.

    "answer": "From your contents it can be observed that the daughter in law had relinquished her rights in the property in lieu of the consideration/compensation in the form of money. Subsequent to the relinquishment of her rights in the property by the daughter in law, the entire  property devolves on the mother in law. The mother in law is reported to have transferred the property by a testamentary disposition in favor of son of brother of her deceased husband by creating a Will. Even though the Will was an unregistered instrument, there was no necessity for the legatee to get a probate to the Will. However since he had approached court for grant of probate, the daughter in law would be respondent, hence she had filed her objections.  However it is not understood that how the daughter inn law had sold the entire property especially when she had already relinquished her rights in the proeprty, and it appears to be a fraudulent sale if my guess is correct.Any further opinion depends after close scrutiny of the property related papers.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

According to the Supreme Court, stilt parking areas cannot be sold to individual flat owners. The court has ruled that stilt parking spaces, along with open parking areas, are considered common areas and are part of the \"common areas and facilities\" included in the sale price of a flat. This means that residents have the right to use these parking spaces without paying additional charges.You can send a legal notice concerned builder and the society in charge i.e. the President/Chairman. A legal notice is a formal communication to a person or entity informing them that you intend to undertake legal proceedings against him/her. It is a step taken before filing a suit, and is meant to warn the other party that legal action may be taken against him/her, if they fail to comply with some specified condition. The most common cases where I have engaged with my clients in sending legal notices is in cases of property disputes, builder-buyer disputes, dishonour of Cheques, family disputes pertaining to asset distributions, husband-wife conflicts, consumer complaints and cases where salary/wage commitments are not met. The dispute therefore, can be resolved before going to the Court which generally involves time, effort and money. Legal Notice through Advocate can be sent with a warning to comply with the rules/laws within 15 days.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete facts/documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Shri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "question": "Can stilt parking area be sold to individual flat owners?",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Legally, the price of such parking spaces is already accounted for in the sale price of the flat. Hence, the society's argument that all the parking spaces were sold by the builder at first instance is legally debatable. You are entitled to utilize the parking spaces as collective property and the society owes it to ensure fair distribution. If the society denies granting parking, you can initially go to the managing committee or Residents' Welfare Association (RWA) of the society for redressal. Failing that, you can file a complaint before the Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, which is quicker and cheaper for such real estate grievances. Alternatively, you can go to the civil court, but that is generally more time-consuming and costly. When it comes to legal expenses, a consumer complaint usually entails nominal charges (a couple of thousand rupees based on the amount of claim), but civil litigation may mean more than ₹50,000 or even more based on complexity as well as attorney charges.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

First, support the investigation by the police so that you are not arrested or taken action against but assert that the FIR is uncalled for. You must consult a criminal lawyer at once who can assist you in presenting a petition under the BNSS in the High Court for quashing of the FIR on the merits that it is frivolous, malicious, and devoid of evidence. The High Court can set aside such FIRs to avoid abuse of the legal process. Also, if the police try to arrest without procedure, you may plead wrongful arrest. Presenting evidence the that refutes your lorry's involvement, like that of toll records, GPS information, or witness statements will also further improve your case. If you find that the FIR was lodged with any form of malicious intent, then can also choose to file a defamation or malicious prosecution case against the complainant.

The transfer of property by a registered unconditional gift deed cannot be revoked by the donor for any reason.Moreover your father is a government servant having sufficient source of income through salary cannot claim even maintenance from you citing the reason to cancel the gift deed for not maintaining him.Besides it was an unconditional gift deed, hence he cannot cancel the same even through court citing breach of condition.You don't take any action to prevent him taking any action in this regard, because any legal action that he may propose to initiate  now will not be tenable in law.2. Whether there was any nominee to the locker becausethe surviving joint holder is usually allowed to access and withdraw the contents of the locker.Additionally, if there is a nominee, the surviving joint holder and the nominee would be jointly allowed to access the locker.What is the basis of the joint ownership, whether it was by either or survivor or to be operated jointly?You confirm this.First you issue a legal notice to the bank manager restricting your father to operate the bank locker singly by him alone in the absence of a mandate or instructions from the legal heirs of the deceased joint holder.If the bank is not entertaining your legal notice then you can approach the court with a suit for temporary  injunction restraining your father from operating the bank locker till the disposal of suit and as the main prayer, you may pray for a direction to the bank  that the bank joint account locker should be operated by both (legal heir and him) togetherT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,As soon as a gift deed is executed, registered, and accepted by the donee (you), it usually becomes irrevocable in Indian law (Section 126 ofTransfer of Property Act, 1882). The donor (your father) cannot revoke or cancel the gift deed unilaterally unless there is an express condition in the deed for revocation, or if the gift was given under fraud, coercion, or undue influence. Mere influence on the part of the second wife or a change of circumstances doesn't give him the legal right to revoke the gift. You may go to the civil court to ask for protection and injunction against any move to revoke or interfere with your rights in respect of the gifted property. As the locker is jointly owned, both of them (or their legal representatives) have rights in the same. Your father cannot after your mother's death keep you and other rightful owners out of the contents, particularly if the jewellery is yours or was given by you to your mother. You may institute a suit for injunction in a court of civil jurisdiction to restrain your father from selling or disposing of the jewellery until the dispute is decided.

Your father's will cannot supersede the equal shares of siblings in ancestral property unless the property was self-acquired by your father. An individual cannot create a will that divides ancestral property in a disproportionate manner among beneficiaries if it compromises their legal rights. If the property was self-acquired by your father, he can bequeath it according to his wishes. However, if it is ancestral, his will cannot disinherit or diminish your share without your permission. Because the will is not registered but valid if signed properly (thumb impression is valid according to Supreme Court), it can be challenged but cannot override inheritance rights in ancestral property by default. You can take legal advice to establish the character of the property (ancestral or self-acquired) and safeguard your rights.

    "answer": "You can typically claim a parking place in the apartment association after purchasing a flat, especially if the parking space was included in the purchase price or mentioned in the sale agreement.If parking spaces were sold separately by the developer, the Supreme Court has ruled that these are common areas and cannot be sold independently.In such cases, you may be entitled to a refund.However, if the society has a lottery system or other method for managing parking, you may need to follow the society's rules.If you purchased a flat and the sale agreement includes parking, you generally have the right to use that parking space.You may verify from your registered sale deed about this and then plan to fight for it legally.If the society's rules do not accommodate your specific needs, you may need to negotiate with the association or consider legal options.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Can stilt parking area be sold to individual flat owners?",
    "answer": "As per RERA guidelines, stilt parking spaces cannot be sold separately from the property. They fall under the common areas shared by all property owners in the building. According to the Supreme Court, stilt parking areas cannot be sold to individual flat owners. The court has ruled that stilt parking spaces, along with open parking areas, are considered common areas and are part of the \"common areas and facilities\" included in the sale price of a flat. This means that residents have the right to use these parking spaces without paying additional charges.You can send a legal notice concerned builder and the society in charge i.e. the President/Chairman. A legal notice is a formal communication to a person or entity informing them that you intend to undertake legal proceedings against him/her. It is a step taken before filing a suit, and is meant to warn the other party that legal action may be taken against him/her, if they fail to comply with some specified condition. The most common cases where I have engaged with my clients in sending legal notices is in cases of property disputes, builder-buyer disputes, dishonour of Cheques, family disputes pertaining to asset distributions, husband-wife conflicts, consumer complaints and cases where salary/wage commitments are not met. The dispute therefore, can be resolved before going to the Court which generally involves time, effort and money. Legal Notice through Advocate can be sent with a warning to comply with the rules/laws within 15 days.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete facts/documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Shri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "answer": "- As per Supreme Court, Builder has no right to sell parking to apartment-owners, including stilt parking or garages; .the car parking is a part of the society's common area- Further, if the buyer -seller agreement mentions car parking as a separate item, or the buyer can produce other evidence of having purchased it, he can challenge the developer, and can get refund from the builder legally.- Further, a builder has no right to sell stilt parking or open parking, both of which are part of common amenities. , and only the housing society's general body could make the allotment of space to flat occupiers.- After forming the society and registered , it becomes the owner of all the common spaces of the apartment complex including the parking spots, and society can make new rule for allotting the parking to its members.- Hence, the society cannot refuse you on the ground of selling the same by the builder- You can lodge your complaint against the society before the Registrar , and even can file a complaint before the Consumer Forum as well.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Can stilt parking area be sold to individual flat owners?",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Legally, the price of such parking spaces is already accounted for in the sale price of the flat. Hence, the society's argument that all the parking spaces were sold by the builder at first instance is legally debatable. You are entitled to utilize the parking spaces as collective property and the society owes it to ensure fair distribution. If the society denies granting parking, you can initially go to the managing committee or Residents' Welfare Association (RWA) of the society for redressal. Failing that, you can file a complaint before the Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, which is quicker and cheaper for such real estate grievances. Alternatively, you can go to the civil court, but that is generally more time-consuming and costly. When it comes to legal expenses, a consumer complaint usually entails nominal charges (a couple of thousand rupees based on the amount of claim), but civil litigation may mean more than ₹50,000 or even more based on complexity as well as attorney charges.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The words \"this is my first and last will\" at the beginning of the 2003 will are tantamount to an express revocation of all the prior wills, including the 1995 will, even though the prior will is not mentioned.

You may institute a suit for injunction in a court of civil jurisdiction to restrain your father from selling or disposing of the jewellery until the dispute is decided.

    "question": "Can stilt parking area be sold to individual flat owners?",
    "answer": "As per RERA guidelines, stilt parking spaces cannot be sold separately from the property. They fall under the common areas shared by all property owners in the building. According to the Supreme Court, stilt parking areas cannot be sold to individual flat owners. The court has ruled that stilt parking spaces, along with open parking areas, are considered common areas and are part of the \"common areas and facilities\" included in the sale price of a flat. This means that residents have the right to use these parking spaces without paying additional charges.You can send a legal notice concerned builder and the society in charge i.e. the President/Chairman. A legal notice is a formal communication to a person or entity informing them that you intend to undertake legal proceedings against him/her. It is a step taken before filing a suit, and is meant to warn the other party that legal action may be taken against him/her, if they fail to comply with some specified condition. The most common cases where I have engaged with my clients in sending legal notices is in cases of property disputes, builder-buyer disputes, dishonour of Cheques, family disputes pertaining to asset distributions, husband-wife conflicts, consumer complaints and cases where salary/wage commitments are not met. The dispute therefore, can be resolved before going to the Court which generally involves time, effort and money. Legal Notice through Advocate can be sent with a warning to comply with the rules/laws within 15 days.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete facts/documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Shri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "question": "Can stilt parking area be sold to individual flat owners?",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Legally, the price of such parking spaces is already accounted for in the sale price of the flat. Hence, the society's argument that all the parking spaces were sold by the builder at first instance is legally debatable. You are entitled to utilize the parking spaces as collective property and the society owes it to ensure fair distribution. If the society denies granting parking, you can initially go to the managing committee or Residents' Welfare Association (RWA) of the society for redressal. Failing that, you can file a complaint before the Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, which is quicker and cheaper for such real estate grievances. Alternatively, you can go to the civil court, but that is generally more time-consuming and costly. When it comes to legal expenses, a consumer complaint usually entails nominal charges (a couple of thousand rupees based on the amount of claim), but civil litigation may mean more than ₹50,000 or even more based on complexity as well as attorney charges.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,As soon as a gift deed is executed, registered, and accepted by the donee (you), it usually becomes irrevocable in Indian law (Section 126 ofTransfer of Property Act, 1882). The donor (your father) cannot revoke or cancel the gift deed unilaterally unless there is an express condition in the deed for revocation, or if the gift was given under fraud, coercion, or undue influence. Mere influence on the part of the second wife or a change of circumstances doesn't give him the legal right to revoke the gift. You may go to the civil court to ask for protection and injunction against any move to revoke or interfere with your rights in respect of the gifted property. As the locker is jointly owned, both of them (or their legal representatives) have rights in the same. Your father cannot after your mother's death keep you and other rightful owners out of the contents, particularly if the jewellery is yours or was given by you to your mother. You may institute a suit for injunction in a court of civil jurisdiction to restrain your father from selling or disposing of the jewellery until the dispute is decided.

    "answer": "Dear Client,If your tank lorry driver has been filed an FIR on mere suspicion and without evidence, you can take the following legal measures to safeguard your interests. First, support the investigation by the police so that you are not arrested or taken action against but assert that the FIR is uncalled for. You must consult a criminal lawyer at once who can assist you in presenting a petition under the BNSS in the High Court for quashing of the FIR on the merits that it is frivolous, malicious, and devoid of evidence. The High Court can set aside such FIRs to avoid abuse of the legal process. Also, if the police try to arrest without procedure, you may plead wrongful arrest. Presenting evidence the that refutes your lorry's involvement, like that of toll records, GPS information, or witness statements will also further improve your case. If you find that the FIR was lodged with any form of malicious intent, then can also choose to file a defamation or malicious prosecution case against the complainant.

Such parental interference reached an extent of causing immense harassment to the appellant, who was even made to face multiple complaints before the different agencies. The parties are residing separately since 2001 i.e. for about 13 years, during which the appellant has been deprived of his conjugal relationship for no fault of his. It needs no reiteration that the bedrock of any matrimonial relationship is cohabitation and conjugal relationships.” The Bench added that for a spouse to be deprived of his wife’s company proves that the marriage cannot survive, and such deprivation of conjugal relationships is an act of extreme cruelty.Therefore you may have to take decision at least now in this regard or else you may not find any solution to this.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

First, reset your phone and change all passwords to stop potential tracking or hacking, and report this to the cybercrime portal at cybercrime.gov.in.

    "question": "Cancel Gift Deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,As soon as a gift deed is executed, registered, and accepted by the donee (you), it usually becomes irrevocable in Indian law (Section 126 ofTransfer of Property Act, 1882). The donor (your father) cannot revoke or cancel the gift deed unilaterally unless there is an express condition in the deed for revocation, or if the gift was given under fraud, coercion, or undue influence. Mere influence on the part of the second wife or a change of circumstances doesn't give him the legal right to revoke the gift. You may go to the civil court to ask for protection and injunction against any move to revoke or interfere with your rights in respect of the gifted property. As the locker is jointly owned, both of them (or their legal representatives) have rights in the same. Your father cannot after your mother's death keep you and other rightful owners out of the contents, particularly if the jewellery is yours or was given by you to your mother. You may institute a suit for injunction in a court of civil jurisdiction to restrain your father from selling or disposing of the jewellery until the dispute is decided.

    "question": "Matrimony maintenance case",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In Muslim law,restitution of conjugal rightsis a established remedy under which a spouse who has deserted the matrimonial home without sufficient reason can be ordered by the court to resume cohabitation. This right is is not absolute but it is subject to equitable considerations such as the health, safety, and well-being of the wife.  Since you and your wife have been staying separately for nearly three years, and the fact that she already filed a case of maintenance under Section 144 BNSS in Kolkata, chances are that she can file a counter case ofdomestic violence(DV) or cruelty if you make the RCR petition. Courts scrutinize such cases closely, and the presence of DV charges can affect the success of the RCR petition. Thus, the filing of RCR can result in complicated litigation, such as counterclaims.Possible to Halt or Resist MaintenanceA wife is entitled to maintenance during the duration of marriage in Muslim law and it is an absolute right. Even if she possesses separate income, the husband is normally under obligation to provide for her. In case the wife does not cohabit with the husband for no reasonable cause, or abandons the matrimonial home, courts can take this into account in maintenance proceedings. Since your wife is not currently employed but is a graduate with previous work experience, you can object to the maintenance claim on the basis that she is able to earn and maintain herself, particularly in light of the extended separation. It is to be noted that the courts have held that maintenance is not granted or can be decreased if the wife is disobedient or will not cohabit with the husband without reasonable cause. You can make an application to set aside the maintenance order, producing proof of her earning capacity or reluctance to reunite.Alternatives to Reconcile and Resume Married LifeCounselling and Mediation: The court usually suggests that parties attend family counselling or mediation prior to going for acrimonious litigation. You can ask the court to refer the case to a family counsellor to look into reconciliation. Showing genuine efforts towards resuming cohabitation, for example, by written invitations or requests to settle disputes, can make your case more solid and may convince the wife to change her mind. Issuing a legal notice indicating your readiness for peaceful cohabitation and concern for the child might initiate dialogue. As you have not had contact with your child in nearly three years, you may petition the court for custody or visitation, which may prompt your wife to negotiate a family settlement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Such parental interference reached an extent of causing immense harassment to the appellant, who was even made to face multiple complaints before the different agencies. The parties are residing separately since 2001 i.e. for about 13 years, during which the appellant has been deprived of his conjugal relationship for no fault of his. It needs no reiteration that the bedrock of any matrimonial relationship is cohabitation and conjugal relationships.” The Bench added that for a spouse to be deprived of his wife’s company proves that the marriage cannot survive, and such deprivation of conjugal relationships is an act of extreme cruelty.Therefore you may have to take decision at least now in this regard or else you may not find any solution to this.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,If your tank lorry driver has been filed an FIR on mere suspicion and without evidence, you can take the following legal measures to safeguard your interests. First, support the investigation by the police so that you are not arrested or taken action against but assert that the FIR is uncalled for. You must consult a criminal lawyer at once who can assist you in presenting a petition under the BNSS in the High Court for quashing of the FIR on the merits that it is frivolous, malicious, and devoid of evidence. The High Court can set aside such FIRs to avoid abuse of the legal process. Also, if the police try to arrest without procedure, you may plead wrongful arrest. Presenting evidence the that refutes your lorry's involvement, like that of toll records, GPS information, or witness statements will also further improve your case. If you find that the FIR was lodged with any form of malicious intent, then can also choose to file a defamation or malicious prosecution case against the complainant.

    "question": "Matrimony maintenance case",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In Muslim law,restitution of conjugal rightsis a established remedy under which a spouse who has deserted the matrimonial home without sufficient reason can be ordered by the court to resume cohabitation. This right is is not absolute but it is subject to equitable considerations such as the health, safety, and well-being of the wife.  Since you and your wife have been staying separately for nearly three years, and the fact that she already filed a case of maintenance under Section 144 BNSS in Kolkata, chances are that she can file a counter case ofdomestic violence(DV) or cruelty if you make the RCR petition. Courts scrutinize such cases closely, and the presence of DV charges can affect the success of the RCR petition. Thus, the filing of RCR can result in complicated litigation, such as counterclaims.Possible to Halt or Resist MaintenanceA wife is entitled to maintenance during the duration of marriage in Muslim law and it is an absolute right. Even if she possesses separate income, the husband is normally under obligation to provide for her. In case the wife does not cohabit with the husband for no reasonable cause, or abandons the matrimonial home, courts can take this into account in maintenance proceedings. Since your wife is not currently employed but is a graduate with previous work experience, you can object to the maintenance claim on the basis that she is able to earn and maintain herself, particularly in light of the extended separation. It is to be noted that the courts have held that maintenance is not granted or can be decreased if the wife is disobedient or will not cohabit with the husband without reasonable cause. You can make an application to set aside the maintenance order, producing proof of her earning capacity or reluctance to reunite.Alternatives to Reconcile and Resume Married LifeCounselling and Mediation: The court usually suggests that parties attend family counselling or mediation prior to going for acrimonious litigation. You can ask the court to refer the case to a family counsellor to look into reconciliation. Showing genuine efforts towards resuming cohabitation, for example, by written invitations or requests to settle disputes, can make your case more solid and may convince the wife to change her mind. Issuing a legal notice indicating your readiness for peaceful cohabitation and concern for the child might initiate dialogue. As you have not had contact with your child in nearly three years, you may petition the court for custody or visitation, which may prompt your wife to negotiate a family settlement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Rental issue",
    "answer": "Dear Client,For the renovation of the house and conversion of the electricity connection from residential to commercial, you can go ahead if the tenant has been evacuated already, or if you have a court order to do so. As you have recently provided the tenant with a final notice to quit the rented premises because of the current rental court case is close to being determined you have the authority to carry out the renovation work. But make sure that you do not infringe any court order regarding the status of the tenant during the eviction process to avert any legal hurt. If rental arrears cross ₹2 lakh, you can get a vacate order in your favour. If the court has granted you an ex parte order then you can enforce it to regain possession of the property. It is always wise to seek legal advice and help in order to conduct all actions without a violation of law and to help in the proper implementation of the court order.Hope you find this answer helpful in resolving your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

As there is no rental agreement, you can still demand compensation based on the principle of unjust enrichment under section 70 of the Indian Contract Act,1872.

Such parental interference reached an extent of causing immense harassment to the appellant, who was even made to face multiple complaints before the different agencies. The parties are residing separately since 2001 i.e. for about 13 years, during which the appellant has been deprived of his conjugal relationship for no fault of his. It needs no reiteration that the bedrock of any matrimonial relationship is cohabitation and conjugal relationships.” The Bench added that for a spouse to be deprived of his wife’s company proves that the marriage cannot survive, and such deprivation of conjugal relationships is an act of extreme cruelty.Therefore you may have to take decision at least now in this regard or else you may not find any solution to this.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

Since you're bedbound and unable to take direct legal action, you can still protect yourself in key ways. First, reset your phone and change all passwords to stop potential tracking or hacking, and report this to the cybercrime portal at cybercrime.gov.in. Second, gather and save any evidence of defamation or threats, including messages or witness accounts. You can ask a lawyer to send a legal notice on your behalf and file a police complaint through a representative, explaining your medical situation. Do not give in to any pressure for divorce or money—such demands are illegal. If needed, seek free legal aid through the State Legal Services Authority, which may offer home-based support.

    "question": "Marriage in Denmark valid in India?",
    "answer": "Indians getting married in a foreign country should register their marriage with the Indian embassy or consulate in that country.This registration process ensures the marriage is legally recognized in India and facilitates various legal procedures.The Foreign Marriage Act, 1969, outlines the procedure for registering marriages solemnized in foreign countries where at least one party is an Indian citizen.A foreign marriage has to be necessarily monogamous. At the time of solemnization of marriage, neither of the party must be having a living spouse .A foreign marriage in contravention to this rule would be null and void  when read with s. 24(1)(i) ofSpecial Marriage Act, 1954.Therefore, if you are a Non-Resident Indian (NRI) who marries abroad, it's highly recommended to register your marriage in India, even if it's not legally mandated.While there's no central law requiring NRI marriage registration abroad, registration is crucial for proving the validity of the marriage in India, especially for legal and practical purposes.The couple needs to appear in person at the Indian embassy or consulate along with three witnesses, who are Indian nationals, to sign the marriage register and consular records.Registration ensures the marriage is valid for visa applications, property inheritance, banking issues, and other legal matters.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

The donor (your father) cannot revoke or cancel the gift deed unilaterally unless there is an express condition in the deed for revocation, or if the gift was given under fraud, coercion, or undue influence.

As the locker is jointly owned, both of them (or their legal representatives) have rights in the same. Your father cannot after your mother's death keep you and other rightful owners out of the contents, particularly if the jewellery is yours or was given by you to your mother.

    "answer": "Dear Client,There is no legal requirement under the Indian law to respond to a divorce notice within a period of 10 days strictly. In most of the matrimonial dispute cases, it would be fair to respond to a divorce notice within a span of 15 to 30 days, but there is no legal provision for a hard-and-fast rule of a strict 10-day time limit as such. If the sister does not reply within the required time, the sender can go ahead and file a divorce petition with the court. But non-response does not equate to acceptance of the allegations or granting of divorce. It is better to have a lawyer consult before responding. It is to be noted that silence is not legally fatal.

    "question": "Legal Issue for joining client company",
    "answer": "Hello,1. Non-Compete ClausesWhile Working:Companies can ask employees not to work for competitors or start a similar business while they are still employed. Such conditions are usually valid.After Leaving the Job:In India, asking someone not to work for a competitor after leaving the company is generally not allowed. As per Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, any agreement stopping a person from doing lawful work or business is usually not valid.2. Non-Solicitation ClausesValidity:A company can stop a former employee from contacting or taking away its clients after they leave. Courts in India are more willing to accept such clauses compared to non-compete clauses.Meaning:It means after leaving the job, the employee should not try to get business from the company’s old clients whom they dealt with during their job.3. Legal Rules and ExceptionsGeneral Rule:In India, any agreement that stops a person from working freely is void.Exceptions:There are few cases where restrictions are allowed, like between business partners — for example, not competing with each other after ending the partnership.4. Important Points to RememberReasonable Limits:Restrictions must be fair — for example, for a limited time, in a certain area, and only for specific business activities.Protecting Business Interests:If a company wants to protect its trade secrets, client lists, or confidential information, some restrictions may be accepted by courts.5. Common ExamplesA software company might add a clause that stops an employee from joining their client’s company for some months after resigning.A non-solicitation clause might prevent a former employee from contacting old clients to give the same service through a new company.ConclusionIn your situation your pevious company cannot enforce any rights unless there is an explicit and technical clause in the service agreement that attracts your situation, else you cannot be barred from joining your client company .Hope this helps.Swarupananda NeogiAdvocate, Kolkata2983 Answers6 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Swarupananda Neogi"

    "question": "Legal Issue for joining client company",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Non-Compete Clauses & Indian LawIn India, any contract that restricts a person from finding employment after leaving an organization is generally void and cannot be enforced under Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.Non-compete clauses apply only while you are working, not once you’ve left the company.Indian courts have time and again held that post-employment restraints-such as not joining a client or competitor-are not legally enforceable.Your Specific SituationYou never signed any non-solicitation or non-compete contract forbidding you from joining the client company; only the appointment letter was signed, and that is not against post-employment opportunities. Your appointment letter clause limits you only from working elsewhere when you are working with your earlier employer, and it is not applicable not post-employment.Unsigned document or company policy cannot be implied and enforced against you at any point in time as stated by the courts in previous similar scenarios.Legal Notice & Threat of Civil SuitThe notice and request to sign an agreement of non-compliance are now legally irrelevant as you are no longer their employee and you did not give your prior consent to such conditions during your tenure.A civil suit or injunction against you for your joining the client company is unlikely to be upheld the in court against you, as such limitations are null and void in India.This should not impact your employment at the client firm or any of the future job that you choose to take up, provided that you have not obtained or used confidential information or trade secrets.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Legal Issue for joining client company",
    "answer": "Based on the facts shared, here is the professional legal assessment:No Binding Non-Compete Clause Post-Termination:The clause in your appointment letter primarily restricts dual employmentduringthe tenure of your employment. There is no express clause that restricts you from joining the client companyafteryou have been relieved. Furthermore, since you have not signed any separate non-compete or non-solicitation agreement, the employer cannot unilaterally impose post-employment restrictions, especially not retroactively.Company Policies Are Not Binding After Exit:While the appointment letter states that you are governed by company policies, such policies are applicable only while you are in active service. Once you are relieved and issued an experience and relieving letter, those policies no longer bind you, unless they were incorporated in a signed agreement with post-employment obligations.Attempt to Enforce Post-Employment Restrictions Without Agreement Is Legally Weak:Indian courts generally do not enforce post-employment non-compete clauses under Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, as such clauses are considered restraint of trade and hence void. Exceptions apply only in very limited scenarios involving confidentiality or trade secrets, which is not evident in your case.Legal Notice and Civil Suit:Sending a legal notice does not amount to initiation of a legal suit. If the previous employer initiates a civil suit seeking injunction or damages, they must prove:That a legally valid and binding post-employment non-compete agreement exists (which it doesn’t in your case), andThat your joining the client company has caused them direct loss or breach of contract.Given that you were contacted directly by the client company two months after your employment ended, and you did not solicit the client while in employment, the chances of the employer succeeding in a civil suit are very low.Impact on Current Employment:Unless your current employer (the client company) is concerned about litigation or has internal obligations with the former employer, your joining should not be affected. You may, however, inform them of the situation transparently and provide the relieving and experience letters to demonstrate that you left properly.Recommendation:You may respond to the legal notice stating that there is no contractual restriction prohibiting your employment with the client company and that any attempt to restrain your right to livelihood is legally untenable.Maintain a record of all communications.If the former employer initiates any legal proceedings, you may contest it strongly on the above grounds.For any further details feel free to reach out to me at Legal CorridorThanks & RegardsAdv.

The transfer of property by a registered unconditional gift deed cannot be revoked by the donor for any reason.Moreover your father is a government servant having sufficient source of income through salary cannot claim even maintenance from you citing the reason to cancel the gift deed for not maintaining him.Besides it was an unconditional gift deed, hence he cannot cancel the same even through court citing breach of condition.You don't take any action to prevent him taking any action in this regard, because any legal action that he may propose to initiate  now will not be tenable in law.2. Whether there was any nominee to the locker becausethe surviving joint holder is usually allowed to access and withdraw the contents of the locker.Additionally, if there is a nominee, the surviving joint holder and the nominee would be jointly allowed to access the locker.What is the basis of the joint ownership, whether it was by either or survivor or to be operated jointly?You confirm this.First you issue a legal notice to the bank manager restricting your father to operate the bank locker singly by him alone in the absence of a mandate or instructions from the legal heirs of the deceased joint holder.If the bank is not entertaining your legal notice then you can approach the court with a suit for temporary  injunction restraining your father from operating the bank locker till the disposal of suit and as the main prayer, you may pray for a direction to the bank  that the bank joint account locker should be operated by both (legal heir and him) togetherT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,As soon as a gift deed is executed, registered, and accepted by the donee (you), it usually becomes irrevocable in Indian law (Section 126 ofTransfer of Property Act, 1882). The donor (your father) cannot revoke or cancel the gift deed unilaterally unless there is an express condition in the deed for revocation, or if the gift was given under fraud, coercion, or undue influence. Mere influence on the part of the second wife or a change of circumstances doesn't give him the legal right to revoke the gift. You may go to the civil court to ask for protection and injunction against any move to revoke or interfere with your rights in respect of the gifted property. As the locker is jointly owned, both of them (or their legal representatives) have rights in the same. Your father cannot after your mother's death keep you and other rightful owners out of the contents, particularly if the jewellery is yours or was given by you to your mother. You may institute a suit for injunction in a court of civil jurisdiction to restrain your father from selling or disposing of the jewellery until the dispute is decided.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Kindly note the following points,Entitlement to 1/3 Share in the PropertyAccording to Section 6 of theHindu Succession Act, 1956, your mother's property goes to her husband and children equally if she passed away intestate (without a will). As you and your sister were minors in 1997, the transmission of the whole property to your father through revenue records can be held invalid if it did not include your shares.Cancellation of Registered Sale AgreementThe contract specifically requires pahani correction and your signatures to complete sales. As such conditions are yet to be completed, the buyer cannot enforce the contract. Omission of mentioning pahani correction in the contract and hurriedly getting your father to register it may amount to fraud. The lack of a timeline in your case further also diminishes the claim of the buyer since courts typically expect reasonable timeframes for execution.Options for CancellationPrepare a cancellation deed (registered before the same sub-registrar). This can take 2–4 weeks if the buyer is willing to cooperate.Lodge a civil suit under Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act for cancellation. Possibility of success is high because of non-fulfilment of pre-conditions (pahani correction, your signatures) and the potential fraud in execution.3. Lawsuit Timeline and ProcessKarnataka civil suits normally take 2–5 years for settlement, subject to court backlog. The Interim injunctions may restrain the buyer from selling during the pendency of litigation.Steps:You can institute a suit for cancellation and declaration of your shares.You may obtain an interim injunction restraining the buyer.You can Exhibit proof of pahani defects and non-consent.Validity of Agreement After 3 YearsUnder the Section 59 of the Limitation Act, a cancellation suit should be instituted primarily within 3 years from the date of discovery of fraud/defect. No time limit having been provided, the agreement will not automatically lapse after 3 years. Yet, the inability of the buyer to complete conditions (pahani correction, your signatures) makes it unenforceable.Critical RecommendationsSend a legal notice to the buyer pointing out breaches.File mutation request in revenue records to rectify pahani and establish your shares.The Failure to sign the sale deed cancels the transaction as per the terms of the agreement.Get a property attorney in Karnataka to prepare the cancellation deed/lawsuit and pursue your father's rights.Note: Safeguard your father from undue influence by the buyer. Keep a record of all interactions and maintain copies of the sale agreement, pahani records, and communication. This strategy focuses on safeguarding your inheritance rights and using the defective terms of the agreement to invalidate the sale. Pre-emptive legal action is needed to avoid causing irreparable damage.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

As you have recently provided the tenant with a final notice to quit the rented premises because of the current rental court case is close to being determined you have the authority to carry out the renovation work.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Kindly note the following points,Entitlement to 1/3 Share in the PropertyAccording to Section 6 of theHindu Succession Act, 1956, your mother's property goes to her husband and children equally if she passed away intestate (without a will). As you and your sister were minors in 1997, the transmission of the whole property to your father through revenue records can be held invalid if it did not include your shares.Cancellation of Registered Sale AgreementThe contract specifically requires pahani correction and your signatures to complete sales. As such conditions are yet to be completed, the buyer cannot enforce the contract. Omission of mentioning pahani correction in the contract and hurriedly getting your father to register it may amount to fraud. The lack of a timeline in your case further also diminishes the claim of the buyer since courts typically expect reasonable timeframes for execution.Options for CancellationPrepare a cancellation deed (registered before the same sub-registrar). This can take 2–4 weeks if the buyer is willing to cooperate.Lodge a civil suit under Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act for cancellation. Possibility of success is high because of non-fulfilment of pre-conditions (pahani correction, your signatures) and the potential fraud in execution.3. Lawsuit Timeline and ProcessKarnataka civil suits normally take 2–5 years for settlement, subject to court backlog. The Interim injunctions may restrain the buyer from selling during the pendency of litigation.Steps:You can institute a suit for cancellation and declaration of your shares.You may obtain an interim injunction restraining the buyer.You can Exhibit proof of pahani defects and non-consent.Validity of Agreement After 3 YearsUnder the Section 59 of the Limitation Act, a cancellation suit should be instituted primarily within 3 years from the date of discovery of fraud/defect. No time limit having been provided, the agreement will not automatically lapse after 3 years. Yet, the inability of the buyer to complete conditions (pahani correction, your signatures) makes it unenforceable.Critical RecommendationsSend a legal notice to the buyer pointing out breaches.File mutation request in revenue records to rectify pahani and establish your shares.The Failure to sign the sale deed cancels the transaction as per the terms of the agreement.Get a property attorney in Karnataka to prepare the cancellation deed/lawsuit and pursue your father's rights.Note: Safeguard your father from undue influence by the buyer. Keep a record of all interactions and maintain copies of the sale agreement, pahani records, and communication. This strategy focuses on safeguarding your inheritance rights and using the defective terms of the agreement to invalidate the sale. Pre-emptive legal action is needed to avoid causing irreparable damage.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "This agreement is burdened with conditions (conditional agreement)…All children signing thePahani corrections.Only the registered owner is entitled to seek correction of pahani. If the vendor refuses to seek correction of pahani by revenue authority, there is no question of execution of sale deed.If the children refuse to sign, there cannot be execution of sale deed.All family members are shares in the property as it is purchased in the  name of mother. Anyone family member can seek cancellation of agreement  by filing a suit in civil Court. In that case Court can cancel sale to the  extent of shares of only other sharers. File a suit seeking cancellation of entire sale agreement  on the  ground that it is not for benefit of family.After three years agreement will unenforceable but as there is condition of pahani correction, buyer may take the defense that, no steps are taken for such correction of pahani by seller. It is safe to file suit on the  ground that, sale is not for the  benefit of family.Ravi ShindeAdvocate, Hyderabad4923 Answers42 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ravi Shinde"

Yes, your right to a share out of your mother's property is very much available to you and your siblings even though you were minor by age at the time of death of your mother or at the time of transfer of revenue records to your father.2. If both the buyer and the seller are agreeing to execute a registered cancellation deed to cancel the registered sale agreement, it is a matter of just one day or few days depending on the circumstances.3. The civil suit may take at least two to three years for disposal.4. The limitation for the sale agreement is three years and if it is not enforced then it will be lapsed beyond three years from the date of its execution, however the encumbrance created by this registered sale agreement will remain as a tag to the property which will create an obstacle for selling the property in future.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "1) An under-construction unit can generally be sold even if there's a past NCDRC case, but some issues may arise depending on whether the case is still pending or disposed of.2) Since the project has been taken over by a new entity under the NCLT resolution plan, the authority to issue a NoC now lies with the new promoter or resolution professional, not the original builder. A NoC may be denied if the previous case is active or dues are pending.3) Importantly, NCDRC cases do not automatically close due to NCLT proceedings; they may be stayed but remain technically alive unless withdrawn or decided.4) The seller should confirm the NCDRC case status and ideally withdraw it or obtain an order of disposal. They should then approach the new builder entity with all required documents, pay any pending dues, and request a NoC. If the NoC is delayed or refused, a formal representation or legal notice may be necessary. The buyer should be fully informed of the case history, and due diligence must be documented.

The dispute between the builder and the seller has to be disposed unless the builder may not give NOC because the seller has not acquired the property by a registered sale deed, hence he has to depend on the builder to complete this process.3. No, the case before NCDRC is  different to that of the case before NCLT, they don't get disposed automatically.4.

First, support the investigation by the police so that you are not arrested or taken action against but assert that the FIR is uncalled for. You must consult a criminal lawyer at once who can assist you in presenting a petition under the BNSS in the High Court for quashing of the FIR on the merits that it is frivolous, malicious, and devoid of evidence. The High Court can set aside such FIRs to avoid abuse of the legal process. Also, if the police try to arrest without procedure, you may plead wrongful arrest. Presenting evidence the that refutes your lorry's involvement, like that of toll records, GPS information, or witness statements will also further improve your case. If you find that the FIR was lodged with any form of malicious intent, then can also choose to file a defamation or malicious prosecution case against the complainant.

    "answer": "You may move to Hon'ble High Court once again under Article 227 of theConstitution of Indiaor by filing an appropriate criminal miscellaneous application (section482 crpc)  bringing to the court’s attention that despite its earlier directions for expeditious trial within six months, the defacto complainant is deliberately abusing process of law by filing irrelevant and belated petitions (such as challenging your 317 CrPC applications from years ago) to delay the proceedings and seek a strict direction to the trial court to proceed with the trial on a day-to-day basis without entertaining further non-trial-related petitions unless absolutely necessary; you should annex a timeline of past dates showing the delay tactics and request the High Court to ensure the trial is completed within a fixed time frame especially considering your old age, prolonged pendency and mental health distress caused by this 20-year-old case.For any further legal assistance, clarification or to pursue appropriate remedies, please feel free to contact me.Regards,Adv.

    "question": "Cancel Gift Deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,As soon as a gift deed is executed, registered, and accepted by the donee (you), it usually becomes irrevocable in Indian law (Section 126 ofTransfer of Property Act, 1882). The donor (your father) cannot revoke or cancel the gift deed unilaterally unless there is an express condition in the deed for revocation, or if the gift was given under fraud, coercion, or undue influence. Mere influence on the part of the second wife or a change of circumstances doesn't give him the legal right to revoke the gift. You may go to the civil court to ask for protection and injunction against any move to revoke or interfere with your rights in respect of the gifted property. As the locker is jointly owned, both of them (or their legal representatives) have rights in the same. Your father cannot after your mother's death keep you and other rightful owners out of the contents, particularly if the jewellery is yours or was given by you to your mother. You may institute a suit for injunction in a court of civil jurisdiction to restrain your father from selling or disposing of the jewellery until the dispute is decided. The court may also direct the locker contents to be inventoried and kept under supervision to avoid misuse or loss.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client, kindly note the following:Legal PositionThe tenant residing without a written contract and police checking is a verbal tenancy according to the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, but tenancy rights cannot cross owners' rights. Your brother taking rent without your information and denying your access is wrong, particularly as you have ownership rights. Since your father has expired, rights of ownership go over to his legal heirs (yourself and your brother if joint heirs), and possession should be with the legal owners or their rightful tenants.Suggested Legal ActionServe a Legal Notice to Your Brother and TenantClaim complete details of rent payment and possession. Request your brother to supply accounts and give you access to the property.File a Civil Suit for Possession and Declaration of OwnershipIf your brother and tenant refuse your rights, then you can file a recovery of possession and declaration of title suit in civil court.Police Complaint (Optional and Cautious)You can file a criminal trespass or cheating complaint if you have proof your brother and tenant are illegally refusing you access or diverting rent. But courts usually handle property disputes as civil cases unless fraud or clear criminal intent is involved. A FIR filed without sufficient evidence can be quashed under Supreme Court orders.Partition or Family Settlement (If Co-owners)In case the property is inherited collectively, opt for a partition suit or family settlement to settle ownership and rights.Collect EvidenceGather all the documents you have (electricity bills, communications, proof of ownership) and any evidence of rent payment or refusal of access.Talk to a Property LawyerYou can get notices drawn up, sue, and walk you through the process by a lawyer.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

First, support the investigation by the police so that you are not arrested or taken action against but assert that the FIR is uncalled for. You must consult a criminal lawyer at once who can assist you in presenting a petition under the BNSS in the High Court for quashing of the FIR on the merits that it is frivolous, malicious, and devoid of evidence. The High Court can set aside such FIRs to avoid abuse of the legal process. Also, if the police try to arrest without procedure, you may plead wrongful arrest. Presenting evidence the that refutes your lorry's involvement, like that of toll records, GPS information, or witness statements will also further improve your case. If you find that the FIR was lodged with any form of malicious intent, then can also choose to file a defamation or malicious prosecution case against the complainant.

    "question": "Ownership of flat",
    "answer": "Dear Client, the following are the answers to your questions.What becomes of your house after your death?Because the house belongs to you and you happen to be Hindu, as per theHindu Succession Act, if you pass away intestate (i.e., without a will), your wife and children are legal heirs and will inherit the property as per the law. Your wife would not become the sole owner automatically but would have a share along with your children.How to include your wife's name in ownership now?The most typical and simplest method is to make a Gift Deed in favour of your wife, giving either full or part ownership in your lifetime. The process is:Prepare a gift deed mentioning the property and share given to your wife.Give required stamp duty (3% in Maharashtra for gift to spouse) and registration charges.Register the gift deed at the local Sub-Registrar's office with the presence of both parties and witnesses.Modify municipal and society records to show joint ownership.This makes your wife a co-owner as soon as today, securing her rights and preventing future troubles.How to make sure your daughter will inherit the property after you and your wife are no longer around?You must make a Will where you stipulate that upon your and your wife's death, the property shall devolve specifically in your daughter's favour. A Will supersedes intestate succession and prevents quarrels among heirs.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The words \"this is my first and last will\" at the beginning of the 2003 will are tantamount to an express revocation of all the prior wills, including the 1995 will, even though the prior will is not mentioned.

    "answer": "- As per Supreme Court judgment, wife is expected to move in with the relatives of their husbands, follow the rules and customs of their home, and ideally, blend in seamlessly as a new daughter.- Further, the court granted divorce to a man on the grounds of “cruelty” after his wife refused to share a home with her in-laws.- Hence, as per law, she cannot deny living with you, under the condition of separate living from the family.- Further, If wife is not supporting her husband for the enjoyment of life and denying relation, then the husband can get divorce after filing a divorce petition before the court on this ground.-Further, As per Delhi High Court, physical intimacy is an essential aspect of marriage and a wife's continuous refusal to have such relationship with her husband can be a ground for divorce.1. Yes, she can file the complaint under provision of DV Act to involve you and your parents in the said case- However, if she not appeared in the said RCR case filed by you , and the decree passed in your favor, then she cannot claim maintenance from you.2.

    "question": "Matrimony maintenance case",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In Muslim law,restitution of conjugal rightsis a established remedy under which a spouse who has deserted the matrimonial home without sufficient reason can be ordered by the court to resume cohabitation. This right is is not absolute but it is subject to equitable considerations such as the health, safety, and well-being of the wife.  Since you and your wife have been staying separately for nearly three years, and the fact that she already filed a case of maintenance under Section 144 BNSS in Kolkata, chances are that she can file a counter case ofdomestic violence(DV) or cruelty if you make the RCR petition. Courts scrutinize such cases closely, and the presence of DV charges can affect the success of the RCR petition. Thus, the filing of RCR can result in complicated litigation, such as counterclaims.Possible to Halt or Resist MaintenanceA wife is entitled to maintenance during the duration of marriage in Muslim law and it is an absolute right. Even if she possesses separate income, the husband is normally under obligation to provide for her. In case the wife does not cohabit with the husband for no reasonable cause, or abandons the matrimonial home, courts can take this into account in maintenance proceedings. Since your wife is not currently employed but is a graduate with previous work experience, you can object to the maintenance claim on the basis that she is able to earn and maintain herself, particularly in light of the extended separation. It is to be noted that the courts have held that maintenance is not granted or can be decreased if the wife is disobedient or will not cohabit with the husband without reasonable cause. You can make an application to set aside the maintenance order, producing proof of her earning capacity or reluctance to reunite.Alternatives to Reconcile and Resume Married LifeCounselling and Mediation: The court usually suggests that parties attend family counselling or mediation prior to going for acrimonious litigation. You can ask the court to refer the case to a family counsellor to look into reconciliation. Showing genuine efforts towards resuming cohabitation, for example, by written invitations or requests to settle disputes, can make your case more solid and may convince the wife to change her mind. Issuing a legal notice indicating your readiness for peaceful cohabitation and concern for the child might initiate dialogue. As you have not had contact with your child in nearly three years, you may petition the court for custody or visitation, which may prompt your wife to negotiate a family settlement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

But make sure that you do not infringe any court order regarding the status of the tenant during the eviction process to avert any legal hurt.

    "question": "Marriage in Denmark valid in India?",
    "answer": "Indian courts recognize marriages conducted abroad if they are valid under the law of the country where performed and supported by proper documentation, such as apostilled certificates. Recognition depends on compliance with Indian legal standards, including registration and certification procedures under the Foreign Marriage Act, 1969, or theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, depending on the marriage's religious context. Marriages are recognized in India when they are legally valid in the foreign country and properly certified by Indian authorities, ensuring adherence to procedural requirements.Recognition of your Danish Marriage- A marriage legally performed in Denmark, with a duly apostilled marriage certificate, can be recognized in India if it complies with Indian legal requirements for foreign marriages.- Under Indian law, particularly the provisions relating to recognition of foreign marriages, such marriages are valid if they are in accordance with the law of the country where they were performed and are properly certified or registered with the appropriate Indian authority or through the procedures outlined in the Foreign Marriage Act .Ajay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

    "question": "Marriage in Denmark valid in India?",
    "answer": "Indians getting married in a foreign country should register their marriage with the Indian embassy or consulate in that country.This registration process ensures the marriage is legally recognized in India and facilitates various legal procedures.The Foreign Marriage Act, 1969, outlines the procedure for registering marriages solemnized in foreign countries where at least one party is an Indian citizen.A foreign marriage has to be necessarily monogamous. At the time of solemnization of marriage, neither of the party must be having a living spouse .A foreign marriage in contravention to this rule would be null and void  when read with s. 24(1)(i) ofSpecial Marriage Act, 1954.Therefore, if you are a Non-Resident Indian (NRI) who marries abroad, it's highly recommended to register your marriage in India, even if it's not legally mandated.While there's no central law requiring NRI marriage registration abroad, registration is crucial for proving the validity of the marriage in India, especially for legal and practical purposes.The couple needs to appear in person at the Indian embassy or consulate along with three witnesses, who are Indian nationals, to sign the marriage register and consular records.Registration ensures the marriage is valid for visa applications, property inheritance, banking issues, and other legal matters.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Your Danish marriage certificate, properly apostilled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, is normally considered valid for official purposes, such as visa applications, since Denmark is a signatory to the Hague Apostille Convention, to which India is also a signatory.But for some official reasons in India, you can be required to register your foreign marriage under the Foreign Marriage Act, 1969, or theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954. Registration is carried out at the Indian Embassy/Consulate where the marriage was conducted or even in India.Brief Legal PositionYour Danish marriage certificate apostilled is accepted by law in India for all intents and purposes, such as visa applications. For official acceptance in India (such as in matrimonial cases or inheritance), you can have the marriage registered under the Foreign Marriage Act by the Indian Embassy in Denmark, or under theSpecial Marriage Actin India.The registration involves both spouses and the witnesses appearing in person before the Marriage Officer. Presenting the apostilled certificate with identification proof and other documents should be enough for the German Embassy's request for verification that your marriage is legally valid in India.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client, the following are the answers to your questions.What becomes of your house after your death?Because the house belongs to you and you happen to be Hindu, as per theHindu Succession Act, if you pass away intestate (i.e., without a will), your wife and children are legal heirs and will inherit the property as per the law. Your wife would not become the sole owner automatically but would have a share along with your children.How to include your wife's name in ownership now?The most typical and simplest method is to make a Gift Deed in favour of your wife, giving either full or part ownership in your lifetime. The process is:Prepare a gift deed mentioning the property and share given to your wife.Give required stamp duty (3% in Maharashtra for gift to spouse) and registration charges.Register the gift deed at the local Sub-Registrar's office with the presence of both parties and witnesses.Modify municipal and society records to show joint ownership.This makes your wife a co-owner as soon as today, securing her rights and preventing future troubles.How to make sure your daughter will inherit the property after you and your wife are no longer around?You must make a Will where you stipulate that upon your and your wife's death, the property shall devolve specifically in your daughter's favour. A Will supersedes intestate succession and prevents quarrels among heirs.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This right is is not absolute but it is subject to equitable considerations such as the health, safety, and well-being of the wife.  Since you and your wife have been staying separately for nearly three years, and the fact that she already filed a case of maintenance under Section 144 BNSS in Kolkata, chances are that she can file a counter case ofdomestic violence(DV) or cruelty if you make the RCR petition. Courts scrutinize such cases closely, and the presence of DV charges can affect the success of the RCR petition. Thus, the filing of RCR can result in complicated litigation, such as counterclaims.Possible to Halt or Resist MaintenanceA wife is entitled to maintenance during the duration of marriage in Muslim law and it is an absolute right. Even if she possesses separate income, the husband is normally under obligation to provide for her. In case the wife does not cohabit with the husband for no reasonable cause, or abandons the matrimonial home, courts can take this into account in maintenance proceedings. Since your wife is not currently employed but is a graduate with previous work experience, you can object to the maintenance claim on the basis that she is able to earn and maintain herself, particularly in light of the extended separation. It is to be noted that the courts have held that maintenance is not granted or can be decreased if the wife is disobedient or will not cohabit with the husband without reasonable cause. You can make an application to set aside the maintenance order, producing proof of her earning capacity or reluctance to reunite.Alternatives to Reconcile and Resume Married LifeCounselling and Mediation: The court usually suggests that parties attend family counselling or mediation prior to going for acrimonious litigation. You can ask the court to refer the case to a family counsellor to look into reconciliation. Showing genuine efforts towards resuming cohabitation, for example, by written invitations or requests to settle disputes, can make your case more solid and may convince the wife to change her mind. Issuing a legal notice indicating your readiness for peaceful cohabitation and concern for the child might initiate dialogue. As you have not had contact with your child in nearly three years, you may petition the court for custody or visitation, which may prompt your wife to negotiate a family settlement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "My tenant is staying illegally at my fathers place with permission of my brother and brother are not paying rent to me",
    "answer": "Dear Client, kindly note the following:Legal PositionThe tenant residing without a written contract and police checking is a verbal tenancy according to the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, but tenancy rights cannot cross owners' rights. Your brother taking rent without your information and denying your access is wrong, particularly as you have ownership rights. Since your father has expired, rights of ownership go over to his legal heirs (yourself and your brother if joint heirs), and possession should be with the legal owners or their rightful tenants.Suggested Legal ActionServe a Legal Notice to Your Brother and TenantClaim complete details of rent payment and possession. Request your brother to supply accounts and give you access to the property.File a Civil Suit for Possession and Declaration of OwnershipIf your brother and tenant refuse your rights, then you can file a recovery of possession and declaration of title suit in civil court.Police Complaint (Optional and Cautious)You can file a criminal trespass or cheating complaint if you have proof your brother and tenant are illegally refusing you access or diverting rent. But courts usually handle property disputes as civil cases unless fraud or clear criminal intent is involved. A FIR filed without sufficient evidence can be quashed under Supreme Court orders.Partition or Family Settlement (If Co-owners)In case the property is inherited collectively, opt for a partition suit or family settlement to settle ownership and rights.Collect EvidenceGather all the documents you have (electricity bills, communications, proof of ownership) and any evidence of rent payment or refusal of access.Talk to a Property LawyerYou can get notices drawn up, sue, and walk you through the process by a lawyer.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Your wife would not become the sole owner automatically but would have a share along with your children.How to include your wife's name in ownership now?The most typical and simplest method is to make a Gift Deed in favour of your wife, giving either full or part ownership in your lifetime. The process is:Prepare a gift deed mentioning the property and share given to your wife.Give required stamp duty (3% in Maharashtra for gift to spouse) and registration charges.Register the gift deed at the local Sub-Registrar's office with the presence of both parties and witnesses.Modify municipal and society records to show joint ownership.This makes your wife a co-owner as soon as today, securing her rights and preventing future troubles.How to make sure your daughter will inherit the property after you and your wife are no longer around?You must make a Will where you stipulate that upon your and your wife's death, the property shall devolve specifically in your daughter's favour.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In Muslim law,restitution of conjugal rightsis a established remedy under which a spouse who has deserted the matrimonial home without sufficient reason can be ordered by the court to resume cohabitation. This right is is not absolute but it is subject to equitable considerations such as the health, safety, and well-being of the wife.  Since you and your wife have been staying separately for nearly three years, and the fact that she already filed a case of maintenance under Section 144 BNSS in Kolkata, chances are that she can file a counter case ofdomestic violence(DV) or cruelty if you make the RCR petition. Courts scrutinize such cases closely, and the presence of DV charges can affect the success of the RCR petition. Thus, the filing of RCR can result in complicated litigation, such as counterclaims.Possible to Halt or Resist MaintenanceA wife is entitled to maintenance during the duration of marriage in Muslim law and it is an absolute right. Even if she possesses separate income, the husband is normally under obligation to provide for her. In case the wife does not cohabit with the husband for no reasonable cause, or abandons the matrimonial home, courts can take this into account in maintenance proceedings. Since your wife is not currently employed but is a graduate with previous work experience, you can object to the maintenance claim on the basis that she is able to earn and maintain herself, particularly in light of the extended separation. It is to be noted that the courts have held that maintenance is not granted or can be decreased if the wife is disobedient or will not cohabit with the husband without reasonable cause. You can make an application to set aside the maintenance order, producing proof of her earning capacity or reluctance to reunite.Alternatives to Reconcile and Resume Married LifeCounselling and Mediation: The court usually suggests that parties attend family counselling or mediation prior to going for acrimonious litigation. You can ask the court to refer the case to a family counsellor to look into reconciliation. Showing genuine efforts towards resuming cohabitation, for example, by written invitations or requests to settle disputes, can make your case more solid and may convince the wife to change her mind. Issuing a legal notice indicating your readiness for peaceful cohabitation and concern for the child might initiate dialogue. As you have not had contact with your child in nearly three years, you may petition the court for custody or visitation, which may prompt your wife to negotiate a family settlement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "NoC from builder - for transferring/selling a property  to buyer - with probable active court case against builder by owner",
    "answer": "1) An under-construction unit can generally be sold even if there's a past NCDRC case, but some issues may arise depending on whether the case is still pending or disposed of.2) Since the project has been taken over by a new entity under the NCLT resolution plan, the authority to issue a NoC now lies with the new promoter or resolution professional, not the original builder. A NoC may be denied if the previous case is active or dues are pending.3) Importantly, NCDRC cases do not automatically close due to NCLT proceedings; they may be stayed but remain technically alive unless withdrawn or decided.4) The seller should confirm the NCDRC case status and ideally withdraw it or obtain an order of disposal. They should then approach the new builder entity with all required documents, pay any pending dues, and request a NoC. If the NoC is delayed or refused, a formal representation or legal notice may be necessary. The buyer should be fully informed of the case history, and due diligence must be documented. A tripartite agreement may also be required to secure all parties’ interests.Siddharth JainAdvocate, New Delhi6464 Answers102 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Siddharth Jain"

    "answer": "1. If the seller has a registered sale deed on his name then he can very well sell the property provided the pending litigations are disposed, however if the seller is not having proper title to the property then you may have to wait until the disputes have been resolved fully.2. The dispute between the builder and the seller has to be disposed unless the builder may not give NOC because the seller has not acquired the property by a registered sale deed, hence he has to depend on the builder to complete this process.3. No, the case before NCDRC is  different to that of the case before NCLT, they don't get disposed automatically.4. If you are interested to purchase the under construction property then you may first of all ascertain the details and obtain a legal opinion before making any payment including the advance amount.5.

    "question": "My tenant is staying illegally at my fathers place with permission of my brother and brother are not paying rent to me",
    "answer": "Dear Client, kindly note the following:Legal PositionThe tenant residing without a written contract and police checking is a verbal tenancy according to the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, but tenancy rights cannot cross owners' rights. Your brother taking rent without your information and denying your access is wrong, particularly as you have ownership rights. Since your father has expired, rights of ownership go over to his legal heirs (yourself and your brother if joint heirs), and possession should be with the legal owners or their rightful tenants.Suggested Legal ActionServe a Legal Notice to Your Brother and TenantClaim complete details of rent payment and possession. Request your brother to supply accounts and give you access to the property.File a Civil Suit for Possession and Declaration of OwnershipIf your brother and tenant refuse your rights, then you can file a recovery of possession and declaration of title suit in civil court.Police Complaint (Optional and Cautious)You can file a criminal trespass or cheating complaint if you have proof your brother and tenant are illegally refusing you access or diverting rent. But courts usually handle property disputes as civil cases unless fraud or clear criminal intent is involved. A FIR filed without sufficient evidence can be quashed under Supreme Court orders.Partition or Family Settlement (If Co-owners)In case the property is inherited collectively, opt for a partition suit or family settlement to settle ownership and rights.Collect EvidenceGather all the documents you have (electricity bills, communications, proof of ownership) and any evidence of rent payment or refusal of access.Talk to a Property LawyerYou can get notices drawn up, sue, and walk you through the process by a lawyer.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The only risk is that your son may create legal hassle at the time of enforcement of the Will.No doubt it can be solved through court of law but again one has to run between court and home unnecessarily.2. By executing a registered gift settlement deed with following conditionsa) By retaining Life interest on you, then life interest on your wife, without any rights for alienation and then your daughter can acquire the property as an absolute owner by the virtue of the registered gift settlement deed as the third and last beneficiary.b)  You may note that neither you nor your wife can claim any rights for alienation in the property after execution of registered gift settlement deed.The second option is recommended because you can enjoy the property till your lifetime without any interruption.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client, the following are the answers to your questions.What becomes of your house after your death?Because the house belongs to you and you happen to be Hindu, as per theHindu Succession Act, if you pass away intestate (i.e., without a will), your wife and children are legal heirs and will inherit the property as per the law. Your wife would not become the sole owner automatically but would have a share along with your children.How to include your wife's name in ownership now?The most typical and simplest method is to make a Gift Deed in favour of your wife, giving either full or part ownership in your lifetime. The process is:Prepare a gift deed mentioning the property and share given to your wife.Give required stamp duty (3% in Maharashtra for gift to spouse) and registration charges.Register the gift deed at the local Sub-Registrar's office with the presence of both parties and witnesses.Modify municipal and society records to show joint ownership.This makes your wife a co-owner as soon as today, securing her rights and preventing future troubles.How to make sure your daughter will inherit the property after you and your wife are no longer around?You must make a Will where you stipulate that upon your and your wife's death, the property shall devolve specifically in your daughter's favour. A Will supersedes intestate succession and prevents quarrels among heirs.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "1) An under-construction unit can generally be sold even if there's a past NCDRC case, but some issues may arise depending on whether the case is still pending or disposed of.2) Since the project has been taken over by a new entity under the NCLT resolution plan, the authority to issue a NoC now lies with the new promoter or resolution professional, not the original builder. A NoC may be denied if the previous case is active or dues are pending.3) Importantly, NCDRC cases do not automatically close due to NCLT proceedings; they may be stayed but remain technically alive unless withdrawn or decided.4) The seller should confirm the NCDRC case status and ideally withdraw it or obtain an order of disposal. They should then approach the new builder entity with all required documents, pay any pending dues, and request a NoC. If the NoC is delayed or refused, a formal representation or legal notice may be necessary. The buyer should be fully informed of the case history, and due diligence must be documented. A tripartite agreement may also be required to secure all parties’ interests.Siddharth JainAdvocate, New Delhi6464 Answers102 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Siddharth Jain"

If the seller has a registered sale deed on his name then he can very well sell the property provided the pending litigations are disposed, however if the seller is not having proper title to the property then you may have to wait until the disputes have been resolved fully.2. The dispute between the builder and the seller has to be disposed unless the builder may not give NOC because the seller has not acquired the property by a registered sale deed, hence he has to depend on the builder to complete this process.3. No, the case before NCDRC is  different to that of the case before NCLT, they don't get disposed automatically.4.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Kindly note the following points,Entitlement to 1/3 Share in the PropertyAccording to Section 6 of theHindu Succession Act, 1956, your mother's property goes to her husband and children equally if she passed away intestate (without a will). As you and your sister were minors in 1997, the transmission of the whole property to your father through revenue records can be held invalid if it did not include your shares.Cancellation of Registered Sale AgreementThe contract specifically requires pahani correction and your signatures to complete sales. As such conditions are yet to be completed, the buyer cannot enforce the contract. Omission of mentioning pahani correction in the contract and hurriedly getting your father to register it may amount to fraud. The lack of a timeline in your case further also diminishes the claim of the buyer since courts typically expect reasonable timeframes for execution.Options for CancellationPrepare a cancellation deed (registered before the same sub-registrar). This can take 2–4 weeks if the buyer is willing to cooperate.Lodge a civil suit under Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act for cancellation. Possibility of success is high because of non-fulfilment of pre-conditions (pahani correction, your signatures) and the potential fraud in execution.3. Lawsuit Timeline and ProcessKarnataka civil suits normally take 2–5 years for settlement, subject to court backlog. The Interim injunctions may restrain the buyer from selling during the pendency of litigation.Steps:You can institute a suit for cancellation and declaration of your shares.You may obtain an interim injunction restraining the buyer.You can Exhibit proof of pahani defects and non-consent.Validity of Agreement After 3 YearsUnder the Section 59 of the Limitation Act, a cancellation suit should be instituted primarily within 3 years from the date of discovery of fraud/defect. No time limit having been provided, the agreement will not automatically lapse after 3 years. Yet, the inability of the buyer to complete conditions (pahani correction, your signatures) makes it unenforceable.Critical RecommendationsSend a legal notice to the buyer pointing out breaches.File mutation request in revenue records to rectify pahani and establish your shares.The Failure to sign the sale deed cancels the transaction as per the terms of the agreement.Get a property attorney in Karnataka to prepare the cancellation deed/lawsuit and pursue your father's rights.Note: Safeguard your father from undue influence by the buyer. Keep a record of all interactions and maintain copies of the sale agreement, pahani records, and communication. This strategy focuses on safeguarding your inheritance rights and using the defective terms of the agreement to invalidate the sale. Pre-emptive legal action is needed to avoid causing irreparable damage.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Since yor father had entered into a sale agreement with the buyer, it would be better that you talk to the buyer and get the sale agreement cancelled.If he refuses then you can issue a legal notice to both your father and the buyer stating that the sale agreement is null and void insofar as the shares of you and your sister in the property ios concerned hence you can instruct them to either cancel the sale agreement or to face the legal consequences.Your act of getting  a document registered on your both the names would be considered as an illegal act and the buyer may sue all of you for this illegal act.Hence you may better take proper precautionary measures to peacefully cancel the sale agreement and settle the issue amicably instead of getting involved into a long stretched legal battles as a consequence of your hasty decision.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Indian courts recognize marriages conducted abroad if they are valid under the law of the country where performed and supported by proper documentation, such as apostilled certificates.

    "question": "Marriage in Denmark valid in India?",
    "answer": "Indians getting married in a foreign country should register their marriage with the Indian embassy or consulate in that country.This registration process ensures the marriage is legally recognized in India and facilitates various legal procedures.The Foreign Marriage Act, 1969, outlines the procedure for registering marriages solemnized in foreign countries where at least one party is an Indian citizen.A foreign marriage has to be necessarily monogamous. At the time of solemnization of marriage, neither of the party must be having a living spouse .A foreign marriage in contravention to this rule would be null and void  when read with s. 24(1)(i) ofSpecial Marriage Act, 1954.Therefore, if you are a Non-Resident Indian (NRI) who marries abroad, it's highly recommended to register your marriage in India, even if it's not legally mandated.While there's no central law requiring NRI marriage registration abroad, registration is crucial for proving the validity of the marriage in India, especially for legal and practical purposes.The couple needs to appear in person at the Indian embassy or consulate along with three witnesses, who are Indian nationals, to sign the marriage register and consular records.Registration ensures the marriage is valid for visa applications, property inheritance, banking issues, and other legal matters.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Your Danish marriage certificate, properly apostilled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, is normally considered valid for official purposes, such as visa applications, since Denmark is a signatory to the Hague Apostille Convention, to which India is also a signatory.But for some official reasons in India, you can be required to register your foreign marriage under the Foreign Marriage Act, 1969, or theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954.

For official acceptance in India (such as in matrimonial cases or inheritance), you can have the marriage registered under the Foreign Marriage Act by the Indian Embassy in Denmark, or under theSpecial Marriage Actin India.The registration involves both spouses and the witnesses appearing in person before the Marriage Officer.

    "answer": "Dear Client,As per the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999, the NRIs are usually not allowed to buy agricultural land, plantation property, or farmhouses in India. RBI imposes this ban so that speculative purchases of agricultural land do not take place. Having only a farmer's certificate is not enough to be exempted from this limitation. Even with the certificate, being an NRI, you cannot buy agricultural land directly with money from your NRE/NRO accounts without RBI's prior permission.Exceptions:You can inherit agricultural land from a resident Indian relative.You can accept agricultural land as a gift from a resident Indian relative.In exceptional circumstances, you can get special permission from the RBI to buy agricultural land, but this is challenging and will be strictly scrutinized.NRE/NRO account funds:Even assuming you were entitled, the money for such acquisition needs to be compliant with FEMA regulations.

    "question": "My tenant is staying illegally at my fathers place with permission of my brother and brother are not paying rent to me",
    "answer": "Dear Client, kindly note the following:Legal PositionThe tenant residing without a written contract and police checking is a verbal tenancy according to the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, but tenancy rights cannot cross owners' rights. Your brother taking rent without your information and denying your access is wrong, particularly as you have ownership rights. Since your father has expired, rights of ownership go over to his legal heirs (yourself and your brother if joint heirs), and possession should be with the legal owners or their rightful tenants.Suggested Legal ActionServe a Legal Notice to Your Brother and TenantClaim complete details of rent payment and possession.

Therefore, your signatures may be required during final registration.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Kindly note the following points,Entitlement to 1/3 Share in the PropertyAccording to Section 6 of theHindu Succession Act, 1956, your mother's property goes to her husband and children equally if she passed away intestate (without a will). As you and your sister were minors in 1997, the transmission of the whole property to your father through revenue records can be held invalid if it did not include your shares.Cancellation of Registered Sale AgreementThe contract specifically requires pahani correction and your signatures to complete sales. As such conditions are yet to be completed, the buyer cannot enforce the contract. Omission of mentioning pahani correction in the contract and hurriedly getting your father to register it may amount to fraud. The lack of a timeline in your case further also diminishes the claim of the buyer since courts typically expect reasonable timeframes for execution.Options for CancellationPrepare a cancellation deed (registered before the same sub-registrar). This can take 2–4 weeks if the buyer is willing to cooperate.Lodge a civil suit under Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act for cancellation. Possibility of success is high because of non-fulfilment of pre-conditions (pahani correction, your signatures) and the potential fraud in execution.3. Lawsuit Timeline and ProcessKarnataka civil suits normally take 2–5 years for settlement, subject to court backlog. The Interim injunctions may restrain the buyer from selling during the pendency of litigation.Steps:You can institute a suit for cancellation and declaration of your shares.You may obtain an interim injunction restraining the buyer.You can Exhibit proof of pahani defects and non-consent.Validity of Agreement After 3 YearsUnder the Section 59 of the Limitation Act, a cancellation suit should be instituted primarily within 3 years from the date of discovery of fraud/defect. No time limit having been provided, the agreement will not automatically lapse after 3 years. Yet, the inability of the buyer to complete conditions (pahani correction, your signatures) makes it unenforceable.Critical RecommendationsSend a legal notice to the buyer pointing out breaches.File mutation request in revenue records to rectify pahani and establish your shares.The Failure to sign the sale deed cancels the transaction as per the terms of the agreement.Get a property attorney in Karnataka to prepare the cancellation deed/lawsuit and pursue your father's rights.Note: Safeguard your father from undue influence by the buyer. Keep a record of all interactions and maintain copies of the sale agreement, pahani records, and communication. This strategy focuses on safeguarding your inheritance rights and using the defective terms of the agreement to invalidate the sale. Pre-emptive legal action is needed to avoid causing irreparable damage.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

A NoC may be denied if the previous case is active or dues are pending.3) Importantly, NCDRC cases do not automatically close due to NCLT proceedings; they may be stayed but remain technically alive unless withdrawn or decided.4) The seller should confirm the NCDRC case status and ideally withdraw it or obtain an order of disposal. They should then approach the new builder entity with all required documents, pay any pending dues, and request a NoC. If the NoC is delayed or refused, a formal representation or legal notice may be necessary. The buyer should be fully informed of the case history, and due diligence must be documented.

    "question": "Mutual divorce settlement",
    "answer": "It is recommended that before making the payment at the second motion, you obtain a written statement from your wife confirming that she will withdraw all pending cases  or cooperate in quashing them. This statement should be recorded in court to avoid any future disputes. It is safest to make the payment in front of the court and ensure you receive a receipt. During the FIR quashing process in the High Court, if the mutual divorce is finalized and alimony is fully paid there should be no hindrance in quashing the FIR. If your wife fails to cooperate, you can point out her non-cooperation to the court and continue pursuing the FIR quashing in the High Court.For any further legal assistance, clarification or to pursue appropriate remedies, please feel free to contact me.Regards,Adv.

    "answer": "Affidavit is to be filed before high court that she has withdrawn all the cases filed by her against you, this will be done only after she has withdrawn them, however this affidavit is to be filed before high court in the quash case on the next date of hearing.The terms and conditions are not enforceable in law unless and until it is a part of decree. Hence before passing a decree to this effect, you cannot trust this to happen, hence as an abundant caution, you may wait for the disposal ofmutual consent divorcetill she withdraws the criminal cases and the quash case is disposed by high court.You can get an adjournment for the divorce case quoting the pending quash case before high court and let she withdraw the 125 cr.p.c. cas on the next date of hearing.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

You had sold the plot to a bona fide purchaser at a reasonable price, and the 7/12 stands in the purchaser's name, evidencing valid transfer.

    "question": "Pre-emption right on sale of entire adjacent agricultural plot and potential transfer of undivided share in ancestral house",
    "answer": "You cannot claim pre-emption rights on a neighbor's land that has already been sold under the West Bengal Land Reforms Act (WBLR Act). The WBLR Act grants pre-emption rights to co-sharers and contiguous owners to purchase land being sold by their neighbors, but it applies before the sale is finalized, not after it.The right of pre-emption is typically invoked before a sale is completed.

    "question": "Pre-emption right on sale of entire adjacent agricultural plot and potential transfer of undivided share in ancestral house",
    "answer": "In the normal situation the sale of property by executing a registered sale deed is considered to be complete. In your case you have not expressed your willingness to purchase the neighbor's plot before he looked for a prospective buyer outside, henc you may have lost your preemption rights in this regard.About the ancestral property, under theHindu Succession Act, co-owners of ancestral undivided property typically have pre-emption rights.This means if one co-owner wishes to sell their share, they are required to first offer it to the other co-owners before selling it to an outsider.The purpose of pre-emption rights in ancestral property is to give  the co-owners the first option to buy, the property is less likely to be split up among multiple owners, which can lead to disputes and inefficiencies.It ensures that the co-owners have a chance to maintain their share of the property and avoid unwanted ownership from strangers.When a co-owner decides to sell their share, they must first offer it to the other co-owners at the same price.If the other co-owners refuse to exercise their pre-emption right, the seller is then free to sell the share to an outsider.Therefore there is no danger about the denial of preemption rights in filing a suit for partition.You cannot compel other cosharers to transfer their respective share in the ancestral property into a trust for any reason, if one of them is not agreeing then you may have to leave him and his share alone while forming the proposed trust, then also your purpose will be defeated.In cases of disputes or disagreements, the courts may intervene to resolve the matter and ensure that the pre-emption rights are properly exercised.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

Alternatively, you can move a writ petition (e.g., mandamus) in the HC requesting the trial court to conduct the trial strictly within the prescribed time period and to disallow any further frivolous/irrelevant petitions causing delay in the trial. You can also ask the HC to impose costs or penalties on the de facto for abuse of process and wilful delay on their part thereby getting the compensation for the delay. Meet your advocate at once to prepare and file these applications before the 6-month deadline. In the meantime, keep accurate records of every adjournment and non-material petitions filed to aid your cause.

Once the sale is finalized, the right to pre-empt is usually lost. The WBLR Act grants pre-emption rights to co-sharers and contiguous owners to purchase land being sold by their neighbors, but it applies before the sale is finalized, not after it.However as far as the ancestral proeprty  is concerned, it is yet to be partitioned.You can claim pre-emption rights in ancestral property in West Bengal, even if it hasn't been partitioned yet. The right of pre-emption, also known as the right of first refusal, allows a co-owner to purchase the share of another co-owner before it's sold to an outsider. This right applies to undivided ancestral property, meaning it can be exercised even before a formal partition of the property is made.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Pre-emption right on sale of entire adjacent agricultural plot and potential transfer of undivided share in ancestral house",
    "answer": "In the normal situation the sale of property by executing a registered sale deed is considered to be complete. In your case you have not expressed your willingness to purchase the neighbor's plot before he looked for a prospective buyer outside, henc you may have lost your preemption rights in this regard.About the ancestral property, under theHindu Succession Act, co-owners of ancestral undivided property typically have pre-emption rights.This means if one co-owner wishes to sell their share, they are required to first offer it to the other co-owners before selling it to an outsider.The purpose of pre-emption rights in ancestral property is to give  the co-owners the first option to buy, the property is less likely to be split up among multiple owners, which can lead to disputes and inefficiencies.It ensures that the co-owners have a chance to maintain their share of the property and avoid unwanted ownership from strangers.When a co-owner decides to sell their share, they must first offer it to the other co-owners at the same price.If the other co-owners refuse to exercise their pre-emption right, the seller is then free to sell the share to an outsider.Therefore there is no danger about the denial of preemption rights in filing a suit for partition.You cannot compel other cosharers to transfer their respective share in the ancestral property into a trust for any reason, if one of them is not agreeing then you may have to leave him and his share alone while forming the proposed trust, then also your purpose will be defeated.In cases of disputes or disagreements, the courts may intervene to resolve the matter and ensure that the pre-emption rights are properly exercised.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Thank you for presenting the facts in such a structured and thoughtful manner. Based on the details shared, here is a professional legal opinion addressing your specific concerns:1. Defamation Risk (Complaint to Industry Association)Legal Position:In India, defamation (civil or criminal) requires the following elements:A false statement,Publication of that statement to a third party,Harm to the reputation of the person/entity.Application to Your Case:If your complaint:Is factually accurate and based on documentary evidence,Is made privately to a relevant authority (i.e., the industry association),Is made in good faith to protect your legal and financial interests,Then it falls within the\"qualified privilege\"defence, especially since the communication is made to a body with a legitimate interest in the matter.Conclusion:As long as your statements aretruthful, supported by documentation, and the communication isnot published publicly or with malice, your exposure to defamation liability is minimal. However, ensure the tone remains objective, not accusatory or inflammatory.2. Litigation Impact (Ongoing Appeal in High Court)Given that:You havealready prevailed in both lower courts, andThe case is currently pending in appeal,filing a complaint with an industry association may nottechnicallyamount to sub judice contempt, but it could lead the opposing party to argue that:You are trying toinfluence parallel forumswhile the matter is pending,You areundermining judicial processorprejudicing the appealby pursuing remedies outside the courtroom.Risk Assessment:The association hasno adjudicatory power; it can only enforce ethical standards, not legal dues.However, a savvy opposing party may attempt to use your complaint to allege harassment or parallel pressure tactics, especially if the association initiates an inquiry.Recommendation:Since your case is already strong and pending before the High Court:Wait for the final verdict, unless the balance sheet misrepresentation presents an imminent fraud on stakeholders or regulators (e.g., under MCA, SEBI, or Companies Act implications).If urgent, phrase your complaint cautiously, stating that thecourt case is pendingand that your intent is tonotifythe association of potential ethical breaches,without prejudice to ongoing litigation.Suggested Wording Revision for Key Risk Reduction:Instead of alleging fraud directly, use phrasing like:“We believe that the continued non-disclosure of this contingent liability, while the matter is sub judice, may not align with the spirit of transparency and accountability expected of members under your Code of Conduct.”This softens the tone and signals that you're not making a final accusation, but raising ethical concerns for review.Conclusion & Strategic Advice:Defamation: Low risk if complaint is factual, confidential, and not malicious.Litigation: Advisable to wait until the High Court appeal concludes, unless you must urgently act to protect stakeholder interests.If you proceed now,include a clear disclaimerthat the matter is pending before the High Court and this complaint is not intended to prejudice judicial outcomes but merely raise professional conduct concerns.Please let me know if you’d like me to refine your draft letter for legal clarity and reduced risk exposure.

    "answer": "To protect your rights and prevent the tenant from later pleading financial incapacity, you may formally notify their Chartered Accountant (Statutory Auditor) in writing, highlighting the ongoing litigation, lease terms mandating 15% annual rent escalation, and the approximate ₹12 crore arrears. Request them to ensure disclosure of this contingent liability in accordance with applicable accounting standards (AS 29 / Ind AS 37). Similarly, you may file a written representation with the concerned Registrar of Companies (RoC), pointing out that the company is continuing in possession post-lease without disclosing material liabilities in their financials, thereby potentially misleading stakeholders in violation of Sections 129 and 134 of the Companies Act, 2013.

    "answer": "Dear Client, kindly note the followingThe Risk of DefamationUnless your complaint is supported by facts and evidence, even if your complaint is accurate, defamation can be claimed in case the tenant alleges that the complaint impinges on their reputation according to the relevant sections. However, truth is an absolute defence for defamation. If all your assertions are verifiable facts, supported by documents, and done in good faith without ill will, the chances of winning defamation suit against you are minimal. Since complaint is submitted only to the industry association (not publicly), the chances of defamation liability are minimized further because the communication is restricted and not published to the general public. However, in order to minimize the risk, ensure the complaint sticks strictly to verifiable facts, avoid speculative or inflammatory language, and keep your tone professional.Impact on Ongoing LitigationFiling an ethics complaint should not legally prejudice your ongoing civil litigation in the High Court, especially since you have won in both lower courts and the complaint concerns related ethical and contractual breaches. Nevertheless, the tenant could attempt to counter that the complaint is intended to intimidate or pressure, an argument that would be raised tactically in the lawsuit. You are wise to advise your lawyer of the complaint so that she/he can plan ahead and dispel any such claims in the appeal. If you wish to stay clear of any impression of interference, you could wait for the court to dispose of the appeal, but it is not necessary.Notification to Chartered Accountant and Registrar of Companies (ROC)Failure to disclose a material liability (Rs 12 Crore arrears) in balance sheets may constitute financial misrepresentation and violation of statutory obligations under the Companies Act, 2013. You can write a formal representation to the Chartered Accountant of the tenant pointing out non-disclosure and seek rectification. At the same time, you can seek action from ROC for non-adherence to accounting and disclosure standards. This action can generate regulatory pressure upon the tenant to disclose the liability appropriately and avoid future claims of inability to pay owing to undisclosed liabilities.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Kindly note the following points,Entitlement to 1/3 Share in the PropertyAccording to Section 6 of theHindu Succession Act, 1956, your mother's property goes to her husband and children equally if she passed away intestate (without a will). As you and your sister were minors in 1997, the transmission of the whole property to your father through revenue records can be held invalid if it did not include your shares.Cancellation of Registered Sale AgreementThe contract specifically requires pahani correction and your signatures to complete sales. As such conditions are yet to be completed, the buyer cannot enforce the contract. Omission of mentioning pahani correction in the contract and hurriedly getting your father to register it may amount to fraud. The lack of a timeline in your case further also diminishes the claim of the buyer since courts typically expect reasonable timeframes for execution.Options for CancellationPrepare a cancellation deed (registered before the same sub-registrar). This can take 2–4 weeks if the buyer is willing to cooperate.Lodge a civil suit under Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act for cancellation. Possibility of success is high because of non-fulfilment of pre-conditions (pahani correction, your signatures) and the potential fraud in execution.3. Lawsuit Timeline and ProcessKarnataka civil suits normally take 2–5 years for settlement, subject to court backlog. The Interim injunctions may restrain the buyer from selling during the pendency of litigation.Steps:You can institute a suit for cancellation and declaration of your shares.You may obtain an interim injunction restraining the buyer.You can Exhibit proof of pahani defects and non-consent.Validity of Agreement After 3 YearsUnder the Section 59 of the Limitation Act, a cancellation suit should be instituted primarily within 3 years from the date of discovery of fraud/defect. No time limit having been provided, the agreement will not automatically lapse after 3 years. Yet, the inability of the buyer to complete conditions (pahani correction, your signatures) makes it unenforceable.Critical RecommendationsSend a legal notice to the buyer pointing out breaches.File mutation request in revenue records to rectify pahani and establish your shares.The Failure to sign the sale deed cancels the transaction as per the terms of the agreement.Get a property attorney in Karnataka to prepare the cancellation deed/lawsuit and pursue your father's rights.Note: Safeguard your father from undue influence by the buyer. Keep a record of all interactions and maintain copies of the sale agreement, pahani records, and communication. This strategy focuses on safeguarding your inheritance rights and using the defective terms of the agreement to invalidate the sale. Pre-emptive legal action is needed to avoid causing irreparable damage.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Marriage in Denmark valid in India?",
    "answer": "Indians getting married in a foreign country should register their marriage with the Indian embassy or consulate in that country.This registration process ensures the marriage is legally recognized in India and facilitates various legal procedures.The Foreign Marriage Act, 1969, outlines the procedure for registering marriages solemnized in foreign countries where at least one party is an Indian citizen.A foreign marriage has to be necessarily monogamous. At the time of solemnization of marriage, neither of the party must be having a living spouse .A foreign marriage in contravention to this rule would be null and void  when read with s. 24(1)(i) ofSpecial Marriage Act, 1954.Therefore, if you are a Non-Resident Indian (NRI) who marries abroad, it's highly recommended to register your marriage in India, even if it's not legally mandated.While there's no central law requiring NRI marriage registration abroad, registration is crucial for proving the validity of the marriage in India, especially for legal and practical purposes.The couple needs to appear in person at the Indian embassy or consulate along with three witnesses, who are Indian nationals, to sign the marriage register and consular records.Registration ensures the marriage is valid for visa applications, property inheritance, banking issues, and other legal matters.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

For official acceptance in India (such as in matrimonial cases or inheritance), you can have the marriage registered under the Foreign Marriage Act by the Indian Embassy in Denmark, or under theSpecial Marriage Actin India.The registration involves both spouses and the witnesses appearing in person before the Marriage Officer.

    "answer": "Dear Client,As per the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999, the NRIs are usually not allowed to buy agricultural land, plantation property, or farmhouses in India. RBI imposes this ban so that speculative purchases of agricultural land do not take place. Having only a farmer's certificate is not enough to be exempted from this limitation. Even with the certificate, being an NRI, you cannot buy agricultural land directly with money from your NRE/NRO accounts without RBI's prior permission.Exceptions:You can inherit agricultural land from a resident Indian relative.You can accept agricultural land as a gift from a resident Indian relative.In exceptional circumstances, you can get special permission from the RBI to buy agricultural land, but this is challenging and will be strictly scrutinized.NRE/NRO account funds:Even assuming you were entitled, the money for such acquisition needs to be compliant with FEMA regulations.

    "answer": "Mutual Consent Divorceis possible even if counselling fails, both must agree to divorce terms, including child custody.Custody of 5-year-old daughterusually favors themother, especially if:You are financially independent.You can show a safer, stable home environment (vs unsafe conditions at in-laws’).Infidelity alone does not disqualify youfrom getting custody —child’s welfare is most important, not parents' conduct.Best way forward:Negotiate custody termsduring mutual consent discussionsitself.Mention clear parenting/visitation rights in the divorce petition.Highlight your financial stability, safer environment, and support from your mother.Shubham GoyalAdvocate, Delhi1186 Answers7 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shubham Goyal"

    "question": "Can I get the custody of my 5 year old daughter with mutual consent divorce",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Mutual Consent Divorce: If counseling does not work, you may opt for amutual consent divorceunder Section 13B of theHindu Marriage Act(or relevant law). You must mutually agree on matters like alimony, custody, and property. Courts normally grant it after a waiting period of 6-18 months.Child Custody: Adultery alone will probably not decide custody—courts are most concerned about the child. With your secure income, the previous care of your daughter with your mother, and the dangerous in-law situation, you have a strong case. Documenting history (e.g., being physically injured by his sister) will make your case stronger.Amicable Resolution: Limit harm, provide fair terms (e.g., shared visitation, no fault-blame). Try mediation. Don't resort to hostile actions—your daughter's needs and respect for each other can simplify the process.Hope this helps you; if you still have any clarifications or issues, do not hesitate to ask."

    "question": "Seeking legal opinion: risks of submitting ethics complaint during ongoing dispute",
    "answer": "Thank you for presenting the facts in such a structured and thoughtful manner. Based on the details shared, here is a professional legal opinion addressing your specific concerns:1. Defamation Risk (Complaint to Industry Association)Legal Position:In India, defamation (civil or criminal) requires the following elements:A false statement,Publication of that statement to a third party,Harm to the reputation of the person/entity.Application to Your Case:If your complaint:Is factually accurate and based on documentary evidence,Is made privately to a relevant authority (i.e., the industry association),Is made in good faith to protect your legal and financial interests,Then it falls within the\"qualified privilege\"defence, especially since the communication is made to a body with a legitimate interest in the matter.Conclusion:As long as your statements aretruthful, supported by documentation, and the communication isnot published publicly or with malice, your exposure to defamation liability is minimal. However, ensure the tone remains objective, not accusatory or inflammatory.2. Litigation Impact (Ongoing Appeal in High Court)Given that:You havealready prevailed in both lower courts, andThe case is currently pending in appeal,filing a complaint with an industry association may nottechnicallyamount to sub judice contempt, but it could lead the opposing party to argue that:You are trying toinfluence parallel forumswhile the matter is pending,You areundermining judicial processorprejudicing the appealby pursuing remedies outside the courtroom.Risk Assessment:The association hasno adjudicatory power; it can only enforce ethical standards, not legal dues.However, a savvy opposing party may attempt to use your complaint to allege harassment or parallel pressure tactics, especially if the association initiates an inquiry.Recommendation:Since your case is already strong and pending before the High Court:Wait for the final verdict, unless the balance sheet misrepresentation presents an imminent fraud on stakeholders or regulators (e.g., under MCA, SEBI, or Companies Act implications).If urgent, phrase your complaint cautiously, stating that thecourt case is pendingand that your intent is tonotifythe association of potential ethical breaches,without prejudice to ongoing litigation.Suggested Wording Revision for Key Risk Reduction:Instead of alleging fraud directly, use phrasing like:“We believe that the continued non-disclosure of this contingent liability, while the matter is sub judice, may not align with the spirit of transparency and accountability expected of members under your Code of Conduct.”This softens the tone and signals that you're not making a final accusation, but raising ethical concerns for review.Conclusion & Strategic Advice:Defamation: Low risk if complaint is factual, confidential, and not malicious.Litigation: Advisable to wait until the High Court appeal concludes, unless you must urgently act to protect stakeholder interests.If you proceed now,include a clear disclaimerthat the matter is pending before the High Court and this complaint is not intended to prejudice judicial outcomes but merely raise professional conduct concerns.Please let me know if you’d like me to refine your draft letter for legal clarity and reduced risk exposure.

    "answer": "To protect your rights and prevent the tenant from later pleading financial incapacity, you may formally notify their Chartered Accountant (Statutory Auditor) in writing, highlighting the ongoing litigation, lease terms mandating 15% annual rent escalation, and the approximate ₹12 crore arrears. Request them to ensure disclosure of this contingent liability in accordance with applicable accounting standards (AS 29 / Ind AS 37). Similarly, you may file a written representation with the concerned Registrar of Companies (RoC), pointing out that the company is continuing in possession post-lease without disclosing material liabilities in their financials, thereby potentially misleading stakeholders in violation of Sections 129 and 134 of the Companies Act, 2013. Both communications should be factual, non-defamatory, and clearly state that they are being made without prejudice to your ongoing litigation before the High Court.Thanks & RegardsAdv.

    "question": "Seeking legal opinion: risks of submitting ethics complaint during ongoing dispute",
    "answer": "Dear Client, kindly note the followingThe Risk of DefamationUnless your complaint is supported by facts and evidence, even if your complaint is accurate, defamation can be claimed in case the tenant alleges that the complaint impinges on their reputation according to the relevant sections. However, truth is an absolute defence for defamation. If all your assertions are verifiable facts, supported by documents, and done in good faith without ill will, the chances of winning defamation suit against you are minimal. Since complaint is submitted only to the industry association (not publicly), the chances of defamation liability are minimized further because the communication is restricted and not published to the general public. However, in order to minimize the risk, ensure the complaint sticks strictly to verifiable facts, avoid speculative or inflammatory language, and keep your tone professional.Impact on Ongoing LitigationFiling an ethics complaint should not legally prejudice your ongoing civil litigation in the High Court, especially since you have won in both lower courts and the complaint concerns related ethical and contractual breaches. Nevertheless, the tenant could attempt to counter that the complaint is intended to intimidate or pressure, an argument that would be raised tactically in the lawsuit. You are wise to advise your lawyer of the complaint so that she/he can plan ahead and dispel any such claims in the appeal. If you wish to stay clear of any impression of interference, you could wait for the court to dispose of the appeal, but it is not necessary.Notification to Chartered Accountant and Registrar of Companies (ROC)Failure to disclose a material liability (Rs 12 Crore arrears) in balance sheets may constitute financial misrepresentation and violation of statutory obligations under the Companies Act, 2013. You can write a formal representation to the Chartered Accountant of the tenant pointing out non-disclosure and seek rectification. At the same time, you can seek action from ROC for non-adherence to accounting and disclosure standards. This action can generate regulatory pressure upon the tenant to disclose the liability appropriately and avoid future claims of inability to pay owing to undisclosed liabilities.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Marriage in Denmark valid in India?",
    "answer": "Indians getting married in a foreign country should register their marriage with the Indian embassy or consulate in that country.This registration process ensures the marriage is legally recognized in India and facilitates various legal procedures.The Foreign Marriage Act, 1969, outlines the procedure for registering marriages solemnized in foreign countries where at least one party is an Indian citizen.A foreign marriage has to be necessarily monogamous. At the time of solemnization of marriage, neither of the party must be having a living spouse .A foreign marriage in contravention to this rule would be null and void  when read with s. 24(1)(i) ofSpecial Marriage Act, 1954.Therefore, if you are a Non-Resident Indian (NRI) who marries abroad, it's highly recommended to register your marriage in India, even if it's not legally mandated.While there's no central law requiring NRI marriage registration abroad, registration is crucial for proving the validity of the marriage in India, especially for legal and practical purposes.The couple needs to appear in person at the Indian embassy or consulate along with three witnesses, who are Indian nationals, to sign the marriage register and consular records.Registration ensures the marriage is valid for visa applications, property inheritance, banking issues, and other legal matters.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,As per the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999, the NRIs are usually not allowed to buy agricultural land, plantation property, or farmhouses in India. RBI imposes this ban so that speculative purchases of agricultural land do not take place. Having only a farmer's certificate is not enough to be exempted from this limitation. Even with the certificate, being an NRI, you cannot buy agricultural land directly with money from your NRE/NRO accounts without RBI's prior permission.Exceptions:You can inherit agricultural land from a resident Indian relative.You can accept agricultural land as a gift from a resident Indian relative.In exceptional circumstances, you can get special permission from the RBI to buy agricultural land, but this is challenging and will be strictly scrutinized.NRE/NRO account funds:Even assuming you were entitled, the money for such acquisition needs to be compliant with FEMA regulations.

    "question": "Mutual divorce settlement",
    "answer": "It is recommended that before making the payment at the second motion, you obtain a written statement from your wife confirming that she will withdraw all pending cases  or cooperate in quashing them. This statement should be recorded in court to avoid any future disputes. It is safest to make the payment in front of the court and ensure you receive a receipt. During the FIR quashing process in the High Court, if the mutual divorce is finalized and alimony is fully paid there should be no hindrance in quashing the FIR. If your wife fails to cooperate, you can point out her non-cooperation to the court and continue pursuing the FIR quashing in the High Court.For any further legal assistance, clarification or to pursue appropriate remedies, please feel free to contact me.Regards,Adv.

A reply should ideally be sentwithin 10–15 days, unless there’s a serious reason for delay (travel, medical, etc.), in which case the lawyer can mention that in the response.Would you like help drafting a reply to the notice?

    "question": "Reply to a legal notice",
    "answer": "Dear Client,There is no legal requirement under the Indian law to respond to a divorce notice within a period of 10 days strictly. In most of the matrimonial dispute cases, it would be fair to respond to a divorce notice within a span of 15 to 30 days, but there is no legal provision for a hard-and-fast rule of a strict 10-day time limit as such. If the sister does not reply within the required time, the sender can go ahead and file a divorce petition with the court. But non-response does not equate to acceptance of the allegations or granting of divorce. It is better to have a lawyer consult before responding. It is to be noted that silence is not legally fatal.

    "answer": "Dear Client,As per the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999, the NRIs are usually not allowed to buy agricultural land, plantation property, or farmhouses in India. RBI imposes this ban so that speculative purchases of agricultural land do not take place. Having only a farmer's certificate is not enough to be exempted from this limitation. Even with the certificate, being an NRI, you cannot buy agricultural land directly with money from your NRE/NRO accounts without RBI's prior permission.Exceptions:You can inherit agricultural land from a resident Indian relative.You can accept agricultural land as a gift from a resident Indian relative.In exceptional circumstances, you can get special permission from the RBI to buy agricultural land, but this is challenging and will be strictly scrutinized.NRE/NRO account funds:Even assuming you were entitled, the money for such acquisition needs to be compliant with FEMA regulations.

A reply should ideally be sentwithin 10–15 days, unless there’s a serious reason for delay (travel, medical, etc.), in which case the lawyer can mention that in the response.Would you like help drafting a reply to the notice? I’d be happy to assist if you can share:A brief summary of the allegations.Your sister’s stance (contesting divorce, mutual separation, reconciliation, etc.).Jurisdiction (where she and her husband reside).Thanks & Regards,Adv.

    "question": "Reply to a legal notice",
    "answer": "Dear Client,There is no legal requirement under the Indian law to respond to a divorce notice within a period of 10 days strictly. In most of the matrimonial dispute cases, it would be fair to respond to a divorce notice within a span of 15 to 30 days, but there is no legal provision for a hard-and-fast rule of a strict 10-day time limit as such. If the sister does not reply within the required time, the sender can go ahead and file a divorce petition with the court. But non-response does not equate to acceptance of the allegations or granting of divorce. It is better to have a lawyer consult before responding. It is to be noted that silence is not legally fatal. Courts are interested in evidence and facts in the course of divorce proceedings, not merely in whether a notice was responded to or not.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "It is recommended that before making the payment at the second motion, you obtain a written statement from your wife confirming that she will withdraw all pending cases  or cooperate in quashing them. This statement should be recorded in court to avoid any future disputes. It is safest to make the payment in front of the court and ensure you receive a receipt. During the FIR quashing process in the High Court, if the mutual divorce is finalized and alimony is fully paid there should be no hindrance in quashing the FIR. If your wife fails to cooperate, you can point out her non-cooperation to the court and continue pursuing the FIR quashing in the High Court.For any further legal assistance, clarification or to pursue appropriate remedies, please feel free to contact me.Regards,Adv.

Alternatively, you can move a writ petition (e.g., mandamus) in the HC requesting the trial court to conduct the trial strictly within the prescribed time period and to disallow any further frivolous/irrelevant petitions causing delay in the trial. You can also ask the HC to impose costs or penalties on the de facto for abuse of process and wilful delay on their part thereby getting the compensation for the delay. Meet your advocate at once to prepare and file these applications before the 6-month deadline. In the meantime, keep accurate records of every adjournment and non-material petitions filed to aid your cause.

You had sold the plot to a bona fide purchaser at a reasonable price, and the 7/12 stands in the purchaser's name, evidencing valid transfer.

Your father canissue a legal noticeto the buyer for cancellation of the agreement due to non-fulfilment of this key condition. If the buyer refuses, you may need to file acivil suit for cancellationof the agreement citing lack of clarity, undue influence, and unfulfilled conditions.As for the final sale, if the property isinherited from your mother, it is likely thatyou and your sister have a legal share. Therefore, your signatures may be required during final registration.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Kindly note the following points,Entitlement to 1/3 Share in the PropertyAccording to Section 6 of theHindu Succession Act, 1956, your mother's property goes to her husband and children equally if she passed away intestate (without a will). As you and your sister were minors in 1997, the transmission of the whole property to your father through revenue records can be held invalid if it did not include your shares.Cancellation of Registered Sale AgreementThe contract specifically requires pahani correction and your signatures to complete sales. As such conditions are yet to be completed, the buyer cannot enforce the contract. Omission of mentioning pahani correction in the contract and hurriedly getting your father to register it may amount to fraud. The lack of a timeline in your case further also diminishes the claim of the buyer since courts typically expect reasonable timeframes for execution.Options for CancellationPrepare a cancellation deed (registered before the same sub-registrar). This can take 2–4 weeks if the buyer is willing to cooperate.Lodge a civil suit under Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act for cancellation. Possibility of success is high because of non-fulfilment of pre-conditions (pahani correction, your signatures) and the potential fraud in execution.3. Lawsuit Timeline and ProcessKarnataka civil suits normally take 2–5 years for settlement, subject to court backlog. The Interim injunctions may restrain the buyer from selling during the pendency of litigation.Steps:You can institute a suit for cancellation and declaration of your shares.You may obtain an interim injunction restraining the buyer.You can Exhibit proof of pahani defects and non-consent.Validity of Agreement After 3 YearsUnder the Section 59 of the Limitation Act, a cancellation suit should be instituted primarily within 3 years from the date of discovery of fraud/defect. No time limit having been provided, the agreement will not automatically lapse after 3 years. Yet, the inability of the buyer to complete conditions (pahani correction, your signatures) makes it unenforceable.Critical RecommendationsSend a legal notice to the buyer pointing out breaches.File mutation request in revenue records to rectify pahani and establish your shares.The Failure to sign the sale deed cancels the transaction as per the terms of the agreement.Get a property attorney in Karnataka to prepare the cancellation deed/lawsuit and pursue your father's rights.Note: Safeguard your father from undue influence by the buyer. Keep a record of all interactions and maintain copies of the sale agreement, pahani records, and communication. This strategy focuses on safeguarding your inheritance rights and using the defective terms of the agreement to invalidate the sale. Pre-emptive legal action is needed to avoid causing irreparable damage.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Since yor father had entered into a sale agreement with the buyer, it would be better that you talk to the buyer and get the sale agreement cancelled.If he refuses then you can issue a legal notice to both your father and the buyer stating that the sale agreement is null and void insofar as the shares of you and your sister in the property ios concerned hence you can instruct them to either cancel the sale agreement or to face the legal consequences.Your act of getting  a document registered on your both the names would be considered as an illegal act and the buyer may sue all of you for this illegal act.Hence you may better take proper precautionary measures to peacefully cancel the sale agreement and settle the issue amicably instead of getting involved into a long stretched legal battles as a consequence of your hasty decision.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,There is no legal requirement under the Indian law to respond to a divorce notice within a period of 10 days strictly. In most of the matrimonial dispute cases, it would be fair to respond to a divorce notice within a span of 15 to 30 days, but there is no legal provision for a hard-and-fast rule of a strict 10-day time limit as such. If the sister does not reply within the required time, the sender can go ahead and file a divorce petition with the court. But non-response does not equate to acceptance of the allegations or granting of divorce. It is better to have a lawyer consult before responding. It is to be noted that silence is not legally fatal.

    "question": "Pre-emption right on sale of entire adjacent agricultural plot and potential transfer of undivided share in ancestral house",
    "answer": "You cannot claim pre-emption rights on a neighbor's land that has already been sold under the West Bengal Land Reforms Act (WBLR Act). The WBLR Act grants pre-emption rights to co-sharers and contiguous owners to purchase land being sold by their neighbors, but it applies before the sale is finalized, not after it.The right of pre-emption is typically invoked before a sale is completed. Once the sale is finalized, the right to pre-empt is usually lost.You can claim pre-emption rights in ancestral property in West Bengal, even if it hasn't been partitioned yet. The right of pre-emption, also known as the right of first refusal, allows a co-owner to purchase the share of another co-owner before it's sold to an outsider. This right applies to undivided ancestral property, meaning it can be exercised even before a formal partition of the property is made.If you (as a co-owner) wish to exercise your pre-emption right, you'll typically need to:Be informed about the sale or offer.Express your willingness to purchase the share.Offer to pay the price the seller is willing to accept.If other co-owners also wish to purchase, the legal rules will determine who has the priority.If your request for purchase is likely to be ignored you may file a suit for injunction to restrain the cosharers from alienating the ancestral undivided property from being sold to a third party before you decline the offer.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Pre-emption right on sale of entire adjacent agricultural plot and potential transfer of undivided share in ancestral house",
    "answer": "In the first case regarding the sale of your brother’s entire adjacent agricultural plot, you cannot claim the right of pre-emption under Section 8 of the West Bengal Land Reforms (WBLR) Act, 1955. The law allows pre-emption only when apartof a holding is sold—not the entire plot. Since your brother sold his entire holding, your status as an adjacent landowner does not grant you any legal remedy under this provision. However, if there was any element of fraud, coercion, or material suppression, you may explore civil remedies through court, though success is not guaranteed.In the second case concerning the potential transfer of your brother’s undivided share in the ancestral residential (Vastu) property, pre-emption rights under the WBLR Act apply only if he sells his share, not if he gifts it. A gift deed does not constitute a sale, so co-sharers like you cannot exercise pre-emption in such a scenario. To safeguard your interests, you may consider filing a partition suit to divide the property formally, which would prevent him from gifting or selling an undivided share. Additionally, you may approach the civil court for an injunction to restrain any such transfer until partition is complete. These steps can help you protect the family property and maintain your legal rights.Shubham GoyalAdvocate, Delhi1186 Answers7 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shubham Goyal"

    "question": "Pre-emption right on sale of entire adjacent agricultural plot and potential transfer of undivided share in ancestral house",
    "answer": "In the normal situation the sale of property by executing a registered sale deed is considered to be complete. In your case you have not expressed your willingness to purchase the neighbor's plot before he looked for a prospective buyer outside, henc you may have lost your preemption rights in this regard.About the ancestral property, under theHindu Succession Act, co-owners of ancestral undivided property typically have pre-emption rights.This means if one co-owner wishes to sell their share, they are required to first offer it to the other co-owners before selling it to an outsider.The purpose of pre-emption rights in ancestral property is to give  the co-owners the first option to buy, the property is less likely to be split up among multiple owners, which can lead to disputes and inefficiencies.It ensures that the co-owners have a chance to maintain their share of the property and avoid unwanted ownership from strangers.When a co-owner decides to sell their share, they must first offer it to the other co-owners at the same price.If the other co-owners refuse to exercise their pre-emption right, the seller is then free to sell the share to an outsider.Therefore there is no danger about the denial of preemption rights in filing a suit for partition.You cannot compel other cosharers to transfer their respective share in the ancestral property into a trust for any reason, if one of them is not agreeing then you may have to leave him and his share alone while forming the proposed trust, then also your purpose will be defeated.In cases of disputes or disagreements, the courts may intervene to resolve the matter and ensure that the pre-emption rights are properly exercised.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,There is no legal requirement under the Indian law to respond to a divorce notice within a period of 10 days strictly. In most of the matrimonial dispute cases, it would be fair to respond to a divorce notice within a span of 15 to 30 days, but there is no legal provision for a hard-and-fast rule of a strict 10-day time limit as such. If the sister does not reply within the required time, the sender can go ahead and file a divorce petition with the court. But non-response does not equate to acceptance of the allegations or granting of divorce. It is better to have a lawyer consult before responding. It is to be noted that silence is not legally fatal.

    "answer": "You cannot claim pre-emption rights on a neighbor's land that has already been sold under the West Bengal Land Reforms Act (WBLR Act). The WBLR Act grants pre-emption rights to co-sharers and contiguous owners to purchase land being sold by their neighbors, but it applies before the sale is finalized, not after it.The right of pre-emption is typically invoked before a sale is completed. Once the sale is finalized, the right to pre-empt is usually lost.You can claim pre-emption rights in ancestral property in West Bengal, even if it hasn't been partitioned yet. The right of pre-emption, also known as the right of first refusal, allows a co-owner to purchase the share of another co-owner before it's sold to an outsider. This right applies to undivided ancestral property, meaning it can be exercised even before a formal partition of the property is made.If you (as a co-owner) wish to exercise your pre-emption right, you'll typically need to:Be informed about the sale or offer.Express your willingness to purchase the share.Offer to pay the price the seller is willing to accept.If other co-owners also wish to purchase, the legal rules will determine who has the priority.If your request for purchase is likely to be ignored you may file a suit for injunction to restrain the cosharers from alienating the ancestral undivided property from being sold to a third party before you decline the offer.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Pre-emption right on sale of entire adjacent agricultural plot and potential transfer of undivided share in ancestral house",
    "answer": "In the first case regarding the sale of your brother’s entire adjacent agricultural plot, you cannot claim the right of pre-emption under Section 8 of the West Bengal Land Reforms (WBLR) Act, 1955. The law allows pre-emption only when apartof a holding is sold—not the entire plot. Since your brother sold his entire holding, your status as an adjacent landowner does not grant you any legal remedy under this provision. However, if there was any element of fraud, coercion, or material suppression, you may explore civil remedies through court, though success is not guaranteed.In the second case concerning the potential transfer of your brother’s undivided share in the ancestral residential (Vastu) property, pre-emption rights under the WBLR Act apply only if he sells his share, not if he gifts it. A gift deed does not constitute a sale, so co-sharers like you cannot exercise pre-emption in such a scenario. To safeguard your interests, you may consider filing a partition suit to divide the property formally, which would prevent him from gifting or selling an undivided share. Additionally, you may approach the civil court for an injunction to restrain any such transfer until partition is complete. These steps can help you protect the family property and maintain your legal rights.Shubham GoyalAdvocate, Delhi1186 Answers7 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shubham Goyal"

    "question": "Pre-emption right on sale of entire adjacent agricultural plot and potential transfer of undivided share in ancestral house",
    "answer": "In the normal situation the sale of property by executing a registered sale deed is considered to be complete. In your case you have not expressed your willingness to purchase the neighbor's plot before he looked for a prospective buyer outside, henc you may have lost your preemption rights in this regard.About the ancestral property, under theHindu Succession Act, co-owners of ancestral undivided property typically have pre-emption rights.This means if one co-owner wishes to sell their share, they are required to first offer it to the other co-owners before selling it to an outsider.The purpose of pre-emption rights in ancestral property is to give  the co-owners the first option to buy, the property is less likely to be split up among multiple owners, which can lead to disputes and inefficiencies.It ensures that the co-owners have a chance to maintain their share of the property and avoid unwanted ownership from strangers.When a co-owner decides to sell their share, they must first offer it to the other co-owners at the same price.If the other co-owners refuse to exercise their pre-emption right, the seller is then free to sell the share to an outsider.Therefore there is no danger about the denial of preemption rights in filing a suit for partition.You cannot compel other cosharers to transfer their respective share in the ancestral property into a trust for any reason, if one of them is not agreeing then you may have to leave him and his share alone while forming the proposed trust, then also your purpose will be defeated.In cases of disputes or disagreements, the courts may intervene to resolve the matter and ensure that the pre-emption rights are properly exercised.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear client, kindly note the following ,As the High Court has already directed an expeditious trial within 6 months and there are ongoing delays in view of irrelevant petitions by the de facto complainant, you can move a contempt petition in the HC for non-obedience of its order. Alternatively, you can move a writ petition (e.g., mandamus) in the HC requesting the trial court to conduct the trial strictly within the prescribed time period and to disallow any further frivolous/irrelevant petitions causing delay in the trial. You can also ask the HC to impose costs or penalties on the de facto for abuse of process and wilful delay on their part thereby getting the compensation for the delay. Meet your advocate at once to prepare and file these applications before the 6-month deadline. In the meantime, keep accurate records of every adjournment and non-material petitions filed to aid your cause. Think of getting interim relief for expediting the trial and mental health counselling if necessary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Thank you for presenting the facts in such a structured and thoughtful manner. Based on the details shared, here is a professional legal opinion addressing your specific concerns:1. Defamation Risk (Complaint to Industry Association)Legal Position:In India, defamation (civil or criminal) requires the following elements:A false statement,Publication of that statement to a third party,Harm to the reputation of the person/entity.Application to Your Case:If your complaint:Is factually accurate and based on documentary evidence,Is made privately to a relevant authority (i.e., the industry association),Is made in good faith to protect your legal and financial interests,Then it falls within the\"qualified privilege\"defence, especially since the communication is made to a body with a legitimate interest in the matter.Conclusion:As long as your statements aretruthful, supported by documentation, and the communication isnot published publicly or with malice, your exposure to defamation liability is minimal. However, ensure the tone remains objective, not accusatory or inflammatory.2. Litigation Impact (Ongoing Appeal in High Court)Given that:You havealready prevailed in both lower courts, andThe case is currently pending in appeal,filing a complaint with an industry association may nottechnicallyamount to sub judice contempt, but it could lead the opposing party to argue that:You are trying toinfluence parallel forumswhile the matter is pending,You areundermining judicial processorprejudicing the appealby pursuing remedies outside the courtroom.Risk Assessment:The association hasno adjudicatory power; it can only enforce ethical standards, not legal dues.However, a savvy opposing party may attempt to use your complaint to allege harassment or parallel pressure tactics, especially if the association initiates an inquiry.Recommendation:Since your case is already strong and pending before the High Court:Wait for the final verdict, unless the balance sheet misrepresentation presents an imminent fraud on stakeholders or regulators (e.g., under MCA, SEBI, or Companies Act implications).If urgent, phrase your complaint cautiously, stating that thecourt case is pendingand that your intent is tonotifythe association of potential ethical breaches,without prejudice to ongoing litigation.Suggested Wording Revision for Key Risk Reduction:Instead of alleging fraud directly, use phrasing like:“We believe that the continued non-disclosure of this contingent liability, while the matter is sub judice, may not align with the spirit of transparency and accountability expected of members under your Code of Conduct.”This softens the tone and signals that you're not making a final accusation, but raising ethical concerns for review.Conclusion & Strategic Advice:Defamation: Low risk if complaint is factual, confidential, and not malicious.Litigation: Advisable to wait until the High Court appeal concludes, unless you must urgently act to protect stakeholder interests.If you proceed now,include a clear disclaimerthat the matter is pending before the High Court and this complaint is not intended to prejudice judicial outcomes but merely raise professional conduct concerns.Please let me know if you’d like me to refine your draft letter for legal clarity and reduced risk exposure.

Request them to ensure disclosure of this contingent liability in accordance with applicable accounting standards (AS 29 / Ind AS 37). Similarly, you may file a written representation with the concerned Registrar of Companies (RoC), pointing out that the company is continuing in possession post-lease without disclosing material liabilities in their financials, thereby potentially misleading stakeholders in violation of Sections 129 and 134 of the Companies Act, 2013.

    "question": "Seeking legal opinion: risks of submitting ethics complaint during ongoing dispute",
    "answer": "Dear Client, kindly note the followingThe Risk of DefamationUnless your complaint is supported by facts and evidence, even if your complaint is accurate, defamation can be claimed in case the tenant alleges that the complaint impinges on their reputation according to the relevant sections. However, truth is an absolute defence for defamation. If all your assertions are verifiable facts, supported by documents, and done in good faith without ill will, the chances of winning defamation suit against you are minimal. Since complaint is submitted only to the industry association (not publicly), the chances of defamation liability are minimized further because the communication is restricted and not published to the general public. However, in order to minimize the risk, ensure the complaint sticks strictly to verifiable facts, avoid speculative or inflammatory language, and keep your tone professional.Impact on Ongoing LitigationFiling an ethics complaint should not legally prejudice your ongoing civil litigation in the High Court, especially since you have won in both lower courts and the complaint concerns related ethical and contractual breaches. Nevertheless, the tenant could attempt to counter that the complaint is intended to intimidate or pressure, an argument that would be raised tactically in the lawsuit. You are wise to advise your lawyer of the complaint so that she/he can plan ahead and dispel any such claims in the appeal. If you wish to stay clear of any impression of interference, you could wait for the court to dispose of the appeal, but it is not necessary.Notification to Chartered Accountant and Registrar of Companies (ROC)Failure to disclose a material liability (Rs 12 Crore arrears) in balance sheets may constitute financial misrepresentation and violation of statutory obligations under the Companies Act, 2013. You can write a formal representation to the Chartered Accountant of the tenant pointing out non-disclosure and seek rectification. At the same time, you can seek action from ROC for non-adherence to accounting and disclosure standards. This action can generate regulatory pressure upon the tenant to disclose the liability appropriately and avoid future claims of inability to pay owing to undisclosed liabilities.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Since no timeframe is mentioned in the sale agreement, it would be valid for 3 years, from the date of registration.2.  Assuming that your mother died intestate (without executing a WILL), then your deceased mother's property devolves equally to your father, you and your sister in 1/3rd equal share. In that case, you can send a legal notice to the prospective buyer for cancellation of sale agreement.3.  For cancellation of registered sale agreement, both your father and the prospective buyer have to execute a registered Cancellation Deed.4.  If your mother had died intestate, then the registered sale agreement, could be stopped, since you and your sister are also legal heirs to your deceased mother's property.Shashidhar S.

Your father canissue a legal noticeto the buyer for cancellation of the agreement due to non-fulfilment of this key condition. If the buyer refuses, you may need to file acivil suit for cancellationof the agreement citing lack of clarity, undue influence, and unfulfilled conditions.As for the final sale, if the property isinherited from your mother, it is likely thatyou and your sister have a legal share. Therefore, your signatures may be required during final registration. If you both refuse to sign, the salecannot proceed legallywithout your consent.The chances of getting the agreement cancelled are fair, especially due to the absence of a time clause, the buyer’s failure to correct Pahani, and your father's limited understanding.Shubham GoyalAdvocate, Delhi1186 Answers7 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shubham Goyal"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Kindly note the following points,Entitlement to 1/3 Share in the PropertyAccording to Section 6 of theHindu Succession Act, 1956, your mother's property goes to her husband and children equally if she passed away intestate (without a will). As you and your sister were minors in 1997, the transmission of the whole property to your father through revenue records can be held invalid if it did not include your shares.Cancellation of Registered Sale AgreementThe contract specifically requires pahani correction and your signatures to complete sales. As such conditions are yet to be completed, the buyer cannot enforce the contract. Omission of mentioning pahani correction in the contract and hurriedly getting your father to register it may amount to fraud. The lack of a timeline in your case further also diminishes the claim of the buyer since courts typically expect reasonable timeframes for execution.Options for CancellationPrepare a cancellation deed (registered before the same sub-registrar). This can take 2–4 weeks if the buyer is willing to cooperate.Lodge a civil suit under Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act for cancellation. Possibility of success is high because of non-fulfilment of pre-conditions (pahani correction, your signatures) and the potential fraud in execution.3. Lawsuit Timeline and ProcessKarnataka civil suits normally take 2–5 years for settlement, subject to court backlog. The Interim injunctions may restrain the buyer from selling during the pendency of litigation.Steps:You can institute a suit for cancellation and declaration of your shares.You may obtain an interim injunction restraining the buyer.You can Exhibit proof of pahani defects and non-consent.Validity of Agreement After 3 YearsUnder the Section 59 of the Limitation Act, a cancellation suit should be instituted primarily within 3 years from the date of discovery of fraud/defect. No time limit having been provided, the agreement will not automatically lapse after 3 years. Yet, the inability of the buyer to complete conditions (pahani correction, your signatures) makes it unenforceable.Critical RecommendationsSend a legal notice to the buyer pointing out breaches.File mutation request in revenue records to rectify pahani and establish your shares.The Failure to sign the sale deed cancels the transaction as per the terms of the agreement.Get a property attorney in Karnataka to prepare the cancellation deed/lawsuit and pursue your father's rights.Note: Safeguard your father from undue influence by the buyer. Keep a record of all interactions and maintain copies of the sale agreement, pahani records, and communication. This strategy focuses on safeguarding your inheritance rights and using the defective terms of the agreement to invalidate the sale. Pre-emptive legal action is needed to avoid causing irreparable damage.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Kindly note the following:1. Character of Life EstateYour mother has a life interest in the property under your late father's Will, whereby she can stay in and utilize the property in her lifetime but cannot transfer or sell it. Upon her death, the property is to go half to you and half to your brother.2. Release of Life InterestYour mother cannot release her life interest without the consent of the other person unless the Will provides otherwise. Nevertheless, if your mother and your brother consent with you, this problem may be resolved between yourselves.3. Actual Steps in SellingA. Relinquishment Deed/Deed of Family ArrangementBoth of your sons (both brothers) and your mother ought to execute a registered family arrangement or relinquishment deed under which the mother duly waives her life interest and accepts both the sons to whom such an interest had existed. This deed should be registered at the sub-registrar office in Coimbatore and proper stamp duty should be paid.B. Court Consent Decree (Recommended)To provide additional legal protection and to provide confidence to the buyer, you can make a joint petition in the local civil court for a consent decree to the effect that all concerned agree to forego the life interest and sell the property to the sons. The court order will render the title clear and unchallenged.C. Sale of PropertyAfter the relinquishment or consent decree is issued, you and your brother (as sole owners) may legally sell the property. Give the purchaser the Will, relinquishment deed, and court order (if secured) to establish clear title.4. Other ConsiderationsHave all documents properly prepared and registered.Verify any outstanding dues or encumbrances on the property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Alternatively, you can move a writ petition (e.g., mandamus) in the HC requesting the trial court to conduct the trial strictly within the prescribed time period and to disallow any further frivolous/irrelevant petitions causing delay in the trial. You can also ask the HC to impose costs or penalties on the de facto for abuse of process and wilful delay on their part thereby getting the compensation for the delay.

    "question": "Clause in sale deed not mentioned in agreement of sale",
    "answer": "Dear ClientThe provisions stated above does essentially hold you responsible for lifetime compensation, which is a onerous and unlimited commitment.Important points:Indemnity clauses are common for covering the buyer against title defects or legal problems resulting from the vendor's side. This is normal and reasonable.The expression however making you liable \"at all times\" and from \"personal and other properties\" is broad and has the potential to make you liable in the future to any extent, which is not normal or desirable.As the buyer originally agreed to your conditions but subsequently included this burdensome condition in the sale deed, you have a sound reason to object to execution or even rescind the agreement if the condition was not agreed to by both parties.You may insist on a limited indemnity clause that protects only against losses arising out of defects in title or contractual breaches and not lifetime or unlimitedAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

A registered Gift Deed is preferable over a will in your case because it takes effect immediately, is harder to challenge, and secures your daughter’s rights during your lifetime. While the property is still undivided, your daughter will become a co-owner and may be added as a party to the partition suit, but the Gift Deed will protect her legal interest.

An email or written confirmation by the builder is useful however, it is to be noted that that is still weaker than having the alteration in the sale agreement or in the deed. It can be difficult to enforce legally later.Occupancy Certificate (OC): Not normally affected if the wall is non-load bearing and builder acts as per norms, but absence of municipal sanction may lead to issues.Local Approvals & Society Consent: Obtain required NOCs from local authorities and apartment association to prevent disputes or fines.Resale & Financing: Future purchasers or banks can raise an eyebrow over the variation; have all documents (builder's acknowledgement, architect's certificate) ready to establish the alteration.Recommendation: Demand written approval, take architect's certificate, acquire society and municipal sanctions, and maintain very minute records of the altered layout to escape future judicial or practical disputes.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Courts in India are more willing to accept such clauses compared to non-compete clauses.Meaning:It means after leaving the job, the employee should not try to get business from the company’s old clients whom they dealt with during their job.3. Legal Rules and ExceptionsGeneral Rule:In India, any agreement that stops a person from working freely is void.Exceptions:There are few cases where restrictions are allowed, like between business partners — for example, not competing with each other after ending the partnership.4. Important Points to RememberReasonable Limits:Restrictions must be fair — for example, for a limited time, in a certain area, and only for specific business activities.Protecting Business Interests:If a company wants to protect its trade secrets, client lists, or confidential information, some restrictions may be accepted by courts.5. Common ExamplesA software company might add a clause that stops an employee from joining their client’s company for some months after resigning.A non-solicitation clause might prevent a former employee from contacting old clients to give the same service through a new company.ConclusionIn your situation your pevious company cannot enforce any rights unless there is an explicit and technical clause in the service agreement that attracts your situation, else you cannot be barred from joining your client company .Hope this helps.Swarupananda NeogiAdvocate, Kolkata2983 Answers6 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Swarupananda Neogi"

    "question": "Legal Issue for joining client company",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Non-Compete Clauses & Indian LawIn India, any contract that restricts a person from finding employment after leaving an organization is generally void and cannot be enforced under Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.Non-compete clauses apply only while you are working, not once you’ve left the company.Indian courts have time and again held that post-employment restraints-such as not joining a client or competitor-are not legally enforceable.Your Specific SituationYou never signed any non-solicitation or non-compete contract forbidding you from joining the client company; only the appointment letter was signed, and that is not against post-employment opportunities. Your appointment letter clause limits you only from working elsewhere when you are working with your earlier employer, and it is not applicable not post-employment.Unsigned document or company policy cannot be implied and enforced against you at any point in time as stated by the courts in previous similar scenarios.Legal Notice & Threat of Civil SuitThe notice and request to sign an agreement of non-compliance are now legally irrelevant as you are no longer their employee and you did not give your prior consent to such conditions during your tenure.A civil suit or injunction against you for your joining the client company is unlikely to be upheld the in court against you, as such limitations are null and void in India.This should not impact your employment at the client firm or any of the future job that you choose to take up, provided that you have not obtained or used confidential information or trade secrets.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Generally, companies prohibit their former employees from joining their clients for a specific period after termination of their employment, by what is called a 'non compete' clause. As you agreed to be governed by the rules of the company as evident by the clause in your appointment letter, the company may invoke the 'non compete' clause.

    "question": "Legal Issue for joining client company",
    "answer": "Based on the facts shared, here is the professional legal assessment:No Binding Non-Compete Clause Post-Termination:The clause in your appointment letter primarily restricts dual employmentduringthe tenure of your employment. There is no express clause that restricts you from joining the client companyafteryou have been relieved. Furthermore, since you have not signed any separate non-compete or non-solicitation agreement, the employer cannot unilaterally impose post-employment restrictions, especially not retroactively.Company Policies Are Not Binding After Exit:While the appointment letter states that you are governed by company policies, such policies are applicable only while you are in active service. Once you are relieved and issued an experience and relieving letter, those policies no longer bind you, unless they were incorporated in a signed agreement with post-employment obligations.Attempt to Enforce Post-Employment Restrictions Without Agreement Is Legally Weak:Indian courts generally do not enforce post-employment non-compete clauses under Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, as such clauses are considered restraint of trade and hence void. Exceptions apply only in very limited scenarios involving confidentiality or trade secrets, which is not evident in your case.Legal Notice and Civil Suit:Sending a legal notice does not amount to initiation of a legal suit. If the previous employer initiates a civil suit seeking injunction or damages, they must prove:That a legally valid and binding post-employment non-compete agreement exists (which it doesn’t in your case), andThat your joining the client company has caused them direct loss or breach of contract.Given that you were contacted directly by the client company two months after your employment ended, and you did not solicit the client while in employment, the chances of the employer succeeding in a civil suit are very low.Impact on Current Employment:Unless your current employer (the client company) is concerned about litigation or has internal obligations with the former employer, your joining should not be affected. You may, however, inform them of the situation transparently and provide the relieving and experience letters to demonstrate that you left properly.Recommendation:You may respond to the legal notice stating that there is no contractual restriction prohibiting your employment with the client company and that any attempt to restrain your right to livelihood is legally untenable.Maintain a record of all communications.If the former employer initiates any legal proceedings, you may contest it strongly on the above grounds.For any further details feel free to reach out to me at Legal CorridorThanks & RegardsAdv.

His subsequent act of entering and placing a new lock without permissioncan amount to criminal trespassunder IPC Section 441, as he forcefully re-entered a property he no longer had rights to.Even though the TNRRRLT Act isn’t applicable due to non-registration, general principles of tenancy and possession under theTransfer of Property ActandIndian Penal Codestill apply in your favor.

However, it is highly advisable to send a well-drafted legal reply as soon as possible ideally within a reasonable time (usually 15–30 days) especially if:The allegations made in the notice are false or one-sidedYour sister does not consent to divorce or intends to contest itShe has claims for maintenance, child custody or return of stridhan/dowry articlesShe wants to put her version of facts on record.Sending a reply also helps prevent adverse inferences later in court and shows she is actively engaging in the legal process.For any further legal assistance, clarification or to pursue appropriate remedies, please feel free to contact me.Regards,Adv.

    "question": "Pre-emption right on sale of entire adjacent agricultural plot and potential transfer of undivided share in ancestral house",
    "answer": "You cannot claim pre-emption rights on a neighbor's land that has already been sold under the West Bengal Land Reforms Act (WBLR Act). The WBLR Act grants pre-emption rights to co-sharers and contiguous owners to purchase land being sold by their neighbors, but it applies before the sale is finalized, not after it.The right of pre-emption is typically invoked before a sale is completed. Once the sale is finalized, the right to pre-empt is usually lost.You can claim pre-emption rights in ancestral property in West Bengal, even if it hasn't been partitioned yet. The right of pre-emption, also known as the right of first refusal, allows a co-owner to purchase the share of another co-owner before it's sold to an outsider. This right applies to undivided ancestral property, meaning it can be exercised even before a formal partition of the property is made.If you (as a co-owner) wish to exercise your pre-emption right, you'll typically need to:Be informed about the sale or offer.Express your willingness to purchase the share.Offer to pay the price the seller is willing to accept.If other co-owners also wish to purchase, the legal rules will determine who has the priority.If your request for purchase is likely to be ignored you may file a suit for injunction to restrain the cosharers from alienating the ancestral undivided property from being sold to a third party before you decline the offer.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Pre-emption right on sale of entire adjacent agricultural plot and potential transfer of undivided share in ancestral house",
    "answer": "In the first case regarding the sale of your brother’s entire adjacent agricultural plot, you cannot claim the right of pre-emption under Section 8 of the West Bengal Land Reforms (WBLR) Act, 1955. The law allows pre-emption only when apartof a holding is sold—not the entire plot. Since your brother sold his entire holding, your status as an adjacent landowner does not grant you any legal remedy under this provision. However, if there was any element of fraud, coercion, or material suppression, you may explore civil remedies through court, though success is not guaranteed.In the second case concerning the potential transfer of your brother’s undivided share in the ancestral residential (Vastu) property, pre-emption rights under the WBLR Act apply only if he sells his share, not if he gifts it. A gift deed does not constitute a sale, so co-sharers like you cannot exercise pre-emption in such a scenario. To safeguard your interests, you may consider filing a partition suit to divide the property formally, which would prevent him from gifting or selling an undivided share. Additionally, you may approach the civil court for an injunction to restrain any such transfer until partition is complete. These steps can help you protect the family property and maintain your legal rights.Shubham GoyalAdvocate, Delhi1186 Answers7 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shubham Goyal"

    "answer": "In the normal situation the sale of property by executing a registered sale deed is considered to be complete. In your case you have not expressed your willingness to purchase the neighbor's plot before he looked for a prospective buyer outside, henc you may have lost your preemption rights in this regard.About the ancestral property, under theHindu Succession Act, co-owners of ancestral undivided property typically have pre-emption rights.This means if one co-owner wishes to sell their share, they are required to first offer it to the other co-owners before selling it to an outsider.The purpose of pre-emption rights in ancestral property is to give  the co-owners the first option to buy, the property is less likely to be split up among multiple owners, which can lead to disputes and inefficiencies.It ensures that the co-owners have a chance to maintain their share of the property and avoid unwanted ownership from strangers.When a co-owner decides to sell their share, they must first offer it to the other co-owners at the same price.If the other co-owners refuse to exercise their pre-emption right, the seller is then free to sell the share to an outsider.Therefore there is no danger about the denial of preemption rights in filing a suit for partition.You cannot compel other cosharers to transfer their respective share in the ancestral property into a trust for any reason, if one of them is not agreeing then you may have to leave him and his share alone while forming the proposed trust, then also your purpose will be defeated.In cases of disputes or disagreements, the courts may intervene to resolve the matter and ensure that the pre-emption rights are properly exercised.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

As you and your sister were minors in 1997, the transmission of the whole property to your father through revenue records can be held invalid if it did not include your shares.Cancellation of Registered Sale AgreementThe contract specifically requires pahani correction and your signatures to complete sales. As such conditions are yet to be completed, the buyer cannot enforce the contract. Omission of mentioning pahani correction in the contract and hurriedly getting your father to register it may amount to fraud. The lack of a timeline in your case further also diminishes the claim of the buyer since courts typically expect reasonable timeframes for execution.Options for CancellationPrepare a cancellation deed (registered before the same sub-registrar). This can take 2–4 weeks if the buyer is willing to cooperate.Lodge a civil suit under Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act for cancellation. Possibility of success is high because of non-fulfilment of pre-conditions (pahani correction, your signatures) and the potential fraud in execution.3. Lawsuit Timeline and ProcessKarnataka civil suits normally take 2–5 years for settlement, subject to court backlog. The Interim injunctions may restrain the buyer from selling during the pendency of litigation.Steps:You can institute a suit for cancellation and declaration of your shares.You may obtain an interim injunction restraining the buyer.You can Exhibit proof of pahani defects and non-consent.Validity of Agreement After 3 YearsUnder the Section 59 of the Limitation Act, a cancellation suit should be instituted primarily within 3 years from the date of discovery of fraud/defect. No time limit having been provided, the agreement will not automatically lapse after 3 years. Yet, the inability of the buyer to complete conditions (pahani correction, your signatures) makes it unenforceable.Critical RecommendationsSend a legal notice to the buyer pointing out breaches.File mutation request in revenue records to rectify pahani and establish your shares.The Failure to sign the sale deed cancels the transaction as per the terms of the agreement.Get a property attorney in Karnataka to prepare the cancellation deed/lawsuit and pursue your father's rights.Note: Safeguard your father from undue influence by the buyer. Keep a record of all interactions and maintain copies of the sale agreement, pahani records, and communication. This strategy focuses on safeguarding your inheritance rights and using the defective terms of the agreement to invalidate the sale.

Character of Life EstateYour mother has a life interest in the property under your late father's Will, whereby she can stay in and utilize the property in her lifetime but cannot transfer or sell it. Upon her death, the property is to go half to you and half to your brother.2. Release of Life InterestYour mother cannot release her life interest without the consent of the other person unless the Will provides otherwise. Nevertheless, if your mother and your brother consent with you, this problem may be resolved between yourselves.3. Actual Steps in SellingA. Relinquishment Deed/Deed of Family ArrangementBoth of your sons (both brothers) and your mother ought to execute a registered family arrangement or relinquishment deed under which the mother duly waives her life interest and accepts both the sons to whom such an interest had existed. This deed should be registered at the sub-registrar office in Coimbatore and proper stamp duty should be paid.B. Court Consent Decree (Recommended)To provide additional legal protection and to provide confidence to the buyer, you can make a joint petition in the local civil court for a consent decree to the effect that all concerned agree to forego the life interest and sell the property to the sons. The court order will render the title clear and unchallenged.C. Sale of PropertyAfter the relinquishment or consent decree is issued, you and your brother (as sole owners) may legally sell the property. Give the purchaser the Will, relinquishment deed, and court order (if secured) to establish clear title.4. Other ConsiderationsHave all documents properly prepared and registered.Verify any outstanding dues or encumbrances on the property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Legal Issue for joining client company",
    "answer": "Hello,1. Non-Compete ClausesWhile Working:Companies can ask employees not to work for competitors or start a similar business while they are still employed. Such conditions are usually valid.After Leaving the Job:In India, asking someone not to work for a competitor after leaving the company is generally not allowed. As per Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, any agreement stopping a person from doing lawful work or business is usually not valid.2. Non-Solicitation ClausesValidity:A company can stop a former employee from contacting or taking away its clients after they leave. Courts in India are more willing to accept such clauses compared to non-compete clauses.Meaning:It means after leaving the job, the employee should not try to get business from the company’s old clients whom they dealt with during their job.3. Legal Rules and ExceptionsGeneral Rule:In India, any agreement that stops a person from working freely is void.Exceptions:There are few cases where restrictions are allowed, like between business partners — for example, not competing with each other after ending the partnership.4. Important Points to RememberReasonable Limits:Restrictions must be fair — for example, for a limited time, in a certain area, and only for specific business activities.Protecting Business Interests:If a company wants to protect its trade secrets, client lists, or confidential information, some restrictions may be accepted by courts.5. Common ExamplesA software company might add a clause that stops an employee from joining their client’s company for some months after resigning.A non-solicitation clause might prevent a former employee from contacting old clients to give the same service through a new company.ConclusionIn your situation your pevious company cannot enforce any rights unless there is an explicit and technical clause in the service agreement that attracts your situation, else you cannot be barred from joining your client company .Hope this helps.Swarupananda NeogiAdvocate, Kolkata2983 Answers6 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Swarupananda Neogi"

    "answer": "You may not that there are no legal restrictions preventing you from joining a client company after resigning from your previous employer, especially if you haven't signed a non-compete agreement.Your previous employer cannot automatically prevent you from joining a client company after your resignation and since been relieved properly by issuing a relieving letter also.The courts generally disapprove of non-competition agreements as limitations on a former employee's right to earn a living.You can issue a reply notice to the company through your lawyer denying their allegations and inform them politely that they cannot restrict your constitutionally protected rights for employment of your choice especially in the absence of any bond or any condition of employment earlier.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Legal Issue for joining client company",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Non-Compete Clauses & Indian LawIn India, any contract that restricts a person from finding employment after leaving an organization is generally void and cannot be enforced under Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.Non-compete clauses apply only while you are working, not once you’ve left the company.Indian courts have time and again held that post-employment restraints-such as not joining a client or competitor-are not legally enforceable.Your Specific SituationYou never signed any non-solicitation or non-compete contract forbidding you from joining the client company; only the appointment letter was signed, and that is not against post-employment opportunities. Your appointment letter clause limits you only from working elsewhere when you are working with your earlier employer, and it is not applicable not post-employment.Unsigned document or company policy cannot be implied and enforced against you at any point in time as stated by the courts in previous similar scenarios.Legal Notice & Threat of Civil SuitThe notice and request to sign an agreement of non-compliance are now legally irrelevant as you are no longer their employee and you did not give your prior consent to such conditions during your tenure.A civil suit or injunction against you for your joining the client company is unlikely to be upheld the in court against you, as such limitations are null and void in India.This should not impact your employment at the client firm or any of the future job that you choose to take up, provided that you have not obtained or used confidential information or trade secrets.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Generally, companies prohibit their former employees from joining their clients for a specific period after termination of their employment, by what is called a 'non compete' clause. As you agreed to be governed by the rules of the company as evident by the clause in your appointment letter, the company may invoke the 'non compete' clause. You are, however,  free to join any other company not having any business relations with your former employer.Swaminathan NeelakantanAdvocate, Coimbatore3023 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Swaminathan Neelakantan"

    "context": "Asked 16 days ago in Business Law",
    "question": "Legal Issue for joining client company",
    "answer": "Based on the facts shared, here is the professional legal assessment:No Binding Non-Compete Clause Post-Termination:The clause in your appointment letter primarily restricts dual employmentduringthe tenure of your employment. There is no express clause that restricts you from joining the client companyafteryou have been relieved. Furthermore, since you have not signed any separate non-compete or non-solicitation agreement, the employer cannot unilaterally impose post-employment restrictions, especially not retroactively.Company Policies Are Not Binding After Exit:While the appointment letter states that you are governed by company policies, such policies are applicable only while you are in active service. Once you are relieved and issued an experience and relieving letter, those policies no longer bind you, unless they were incorporated in a signed agreement with post-employment obligations.Attempt to Enforce Post-Employment Restrictions Without Agreement Is Legally Weak:Indian courts generally do not enforce post-employment non-compete clauses under Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, as such clauses are considered restraint of trade and hence void. Exceptions apply only in very limited scenarios involving confidentiality or trade secrets, which is not evident in your case.Legal Notice and Civil Suit:Sending a legal notice does not amount to initiation of a legal suit. If the previous employer initiates a civil suit seeking injunction or damages, they must prove:That a legally valid and binding post-employment non-compete agreement exists (which it doesn’t in your case), andThat your joining the client company has caused them direct loss or breach of contract.Given that you were contacted directly by the client company two months after your employment ended, and you did not solicit the client while in employment, the chances of the employer succeeding in a civil suit are very low.Impact on Current Employment:Unless your current employer (the client company) is concerned about litigation or has internal obligations with the former employer, your joining should not be affected. You may, however, inform them of the situation transparently and provide the relieving and experience letters to demonstrate that you left properly.Recommendation:You may respond to the legal notice stating that there is no contractual restriction prohibiting your employment with the client company and that any attempt to restrain your right to livelihood is legally untenable.Maintain a record of all communications.If the former employer initiates any legal proceedings, you may contest it strongly on the above grounds.For any further details feel free to reach out to me at Legal CorridorThanks & RegardsAdv.

In most of the matrimonial dispute cases, it would be fair to respond to a divorce notice within a span of 15 to 30 days, but there is no legal provision for a hard-and-fast rule of a strict 10-day time limit as such.

But non-response does not equate to acceptance of the allegations or granting of divorce. It is better to have a lawyer consult before responding. It is to be noted that silence is not legally fatal.

A registered Gift Deed is preferable over a will in your case because it takes effect immediately, is harder to challenge, and secures your daughter’s rights during your lifetime. While the property is still undivided, your daughter will become a co-owner and may be added as a party to the partition suit, but the Gift Deed will protect her legal interest. Ensure the gift deed clearly mentions your share and the pending litigation to avoid complications."

This would help protect her interest now itself, even amidst the pending suit.Will: Effective only from your death, which can be challenged or put on hold by the court and thus does not afford immediate protection.Risks for your youngest daughter: As the partition suit is pending, her rights as your share transferee may be challenged by the other parties.But once the Gift Deed is registered, her title over your share is secure, and she may be made a party to the suit in order to safeguard her interest.

An email or written confirmation by the builder is useful however, it is to be noted that that is still weaker than having the alteration in the sale agreement or in the deed. It can be difficult to enforce legally later.Occupancy Certificate (OC): Not normally affected if the wall is non-load bearing and builder acts as per norms, but absence of municipal sanction may lead to issues.Local Approvals & Society Consent: Obtain required NOCs from local authorities and apartment association to prevent disputes or fines.Resale & Financing: Future purchasers or banks can raise an eyebrow over the variation; have all documents (builder's acknowledgement, architect's certificate) ready to establish the alteration.Recommendation: Demand written approval, take architect's certificate, acquire society and municipal sanctions, and maintain very minute records of the altered layout to escape future judicial or practical disputes.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Hello,1. Non-Compete ClausesWhile Working:Companies can ask employees not to work for competitors or start a similar business while they are still employed. Such conditions are usually valid.After Leaving the Job:In India, asking someone not to work for a competitor after leaving the company is generally not allowed. As per Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, any agreement stopping a person from doing lawful work or business is usually not valid.2. Non-Solicitation ClausesValidity:A company can stop a former employee from contacting or taking away its clients after they leave. Courts in India are more willing to accept such clauses compared to non-compete clauses.Meaning:It means after leaving the job, the employee should not try to get business from the company’s old clients whom they dealt with during their job.3. Legal Rules and ExceptionsGeneral Rule:In India, any agreement that stops a person from working freely is void.Exceptions:There are few cases where restrictions are allowed, like between business partners — for example, not competing with each other after ending the partnership.4. Important Points to RememberReasonable Limits:Restrictions must be fair — for example, for a limited time, in a certain area, and only for specific business activities.Protecting Business Interests:If a company wants to protect its trade secrets, client lists, or confidential information, some restrictions may be accepted by courts.5. Common ExamplesA software company might add a clause that stops an employee from joining their client’s company for some months after resigning.A non-solicitation clause might prevent a former employee from contacting old clients to give the same service through a new company.ConclusionIn your situation your pevious company cannot enforce any rights unless there is an explicit and technical clause in the service agreement that attracts your situation, else you cannot be barred from joining your client company .Hope this helps.Swarupananda NeogiAdvocate, Kolkata2983 Answers6 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Swarupananda Neogi"

    "question": "Legal Issue for joining client company",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Non-Compete Clauses & Indian LawIn India, any contract that restricts a person from finding employment after leaving an organization is generally void and cannot be enforced under Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.Non-compete clauses apply only while you are working, not once you’ve left the company.Indian courts have time and again held that post-employment restraints-such as not joining a client or competitor-are not legally enforceable.Your Specific SituationYou never signed any non-solicitation or non-compete contract forbidding you from joining the client company; only the appointment letter was signed, and that is not against post-employment opportunities. Your appointment letter clause limits you only from working elsewhere when you are working with your earlier employer, and it is not applicable not post-employment.Unsigned document or company policy cannot be implied and enforced against you at any point in time as stated by the courts in previous similar scenarios.Legal Notice & Threat of Civil SuitThe notice and request to sign an agreement of non-compliance are now legally irrelevant as you are no longer their employee and you did not give your prior consent to such conditions during your tenure.A civil suit or injunction against you for your joining the client company is unlikely to be upheld the in court against you, as such limitations are null and void in India.This should not impact your employment at the client firm or any of the future job that you choose to take up, provided that you have not obtained or used confidential information or trade secrets.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Generally, companies prohibit their former employees from joining their clients for a specific period after termination of their employment, by what is called a 'non compete' clause. As you agreed to be governed by the rules of the company as evident by the clause in your appointment letter, the company may invoke the 'non compete' clause.

    "question": "Legal Issue for joining client company",
    "answer": "Based on the facts shared, here is the professional legal assessment:No Binding Non-Compete Clause Post-Termination:The clause in your appointment letter primarily restricts dual employmentduringthe tenure of your employment. There is no express clause that restricts you from joining the client companyafteryou have been relieved. Furthermore, since you have not signed any separate non-compete or non-solicitation agreement, the employer cannot unilaterally impose post-employment restrictions, especially not retroactively.Company Policies Are Not Binding After Exit:While the appointment letter states that you are governed by company policies, such policies are applicable only while you are in active service. Once you are relieved and issued an experience and relieving letter, those policies no longer bind you, unless they were incorporated in a signed agreement with post-employment obligations.Attempt to Enforce Post-Employment Restrictions Without Agreement Is Legally Weak:Indian courts generally do not enforce post-employment non-compete clauses under Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, as such clauses are considered restraint of trade and hence void. Exceptions apply only in very limited scenarios involving confidentiality or trade secrets, which is not evident in your case.Legal Notice and Civil Suit:Sending a legal notice does not amount to initiation of a legal suit. If the previous employer initiates a civil suit seeking injunction or damages, they must prove:That a legally valid and binding post-employment non-compete agreement exists (which it doesn’t in your case), andThat your joining the client company has caused them direct loss or breach of contract.Given that you were contacted directly by the client company two months after your employment ended, and you did not solicit the client while in employment, the chances of the employer succeeding in a civil suit are very low.Impact on Current Employment:Unless your current employer (the client company) is concerned about litigation or has internal obligations with the former employer, your joining should not be affected. You may, however, inform them of the situation transparently and provide the relieving and experience letters to demonstrate that you left properly.Recommendation:You may respond to the legal notice stating that there is no contractual restriction prohibiting your employment with the client company and that any attempt to restrain your right to livelihood is legally untenable.Maintain a record of all communications.If the former employer initiates any legal proceedings, you may contest it strongly on the above grounds.For any further details feel free to reach out to me at Legal CorridorThanks & RegardsAdv.

His subsequent act of entering and placing a new lock without permissioncan amount to criminal trespassunder IPC Section 441, as he forcefully re-entered a property he no longer had rights to.Even though the TNRRRLT Act isn’t applicable due to non-registration, general principles of tenancy and possession under theTransfer of Property ActandIndian Penal Codestill apply in your favor.

    "answer": "Thank you for presenting the facts in such a structured and thoughtful manner. Based on the details shared, here is a professional legal opinion addressing your specific concerns:1. Defamation Risk (Complaint to Industry Association)Legal Position:In India, defamation (civil or criminal) requires the following elements:A false statement,Publication of that statement to a third party,Harm to the reputation of the person/entity.Application to Your Case:If your complaint:Is factually accurate and based on documentary evidence,Is made privately to a relevant authority (i.e., the industry association),Is made in good faith to protect your legal and financial interests,Then it falls within the\"qualified privilege\"defence, especially since the communication is made to a body with a legitimate interest in the matter.Conclusion:As long as your statements aretruthful, supported by documentation, and the communication isnot published publicly or with malice, your exposure to defamation liability is minimal. However, ensure the tone remains objective, not accusatory or inflammatory.2. Litigation Impact (Ongoing Appeal in High Court)Given that:You havealready prevailed in both lower courts, andThe case is currently pending in appeal,filing a complaint with an industry association may nottechnicallyamount to sub judice contempt, but it could lead the opposing party to argue that:You are trying toinfluence parallel forumswhile the matter is pending,You areundermining judicial processorprejudicing the appealby pursuing remedies outside the courtroom.Risk Assessment:The association hasno adjudicatory power; it can only enforce ethical standards, not legal dues.However, a savvy opposing party may attempt to use your complaint to allege harassment or parallel pressure tactics, especially if the association initiates an inquiry.Recommendation:Since your case is already strong and pending before the High Court:Wait for the final verdict, unless the balance sheet misrepresentation presents an imminent fraud on stakeholders or regulators (e.g., under MCA, SEBI, or Companies Act implications).If urgent, phrase your complaint cautiously, stating that thecourt case is pendingand that your intent is tonotifythe association of potential ethical breaches,without prejudice to ongoing litigation.Suggested Wording Revision for Key Risk Reduction:Instead of alleging fraud directly, use phrasing like:“We believe that the continued non-disclosure of this contingent liability, while the matter is sub judice, may not align with the spirit of transparency and accountability expected of members under your Code of Conduct.”This softens the tone and signals that you're not making a final accusation, but raising ethical concerns for review.Conclusion & Strategic Advice:Defamation: Low risk if complaint is factual, confidential, and not malicious.Litigation: Advisable to wait until the High Court appeal concludes, unless you must urgently act to protect stakeholder interests.If you proceed now,include a clear disclaimerthat the matter is pending before the High Court and this complaint is not intended to prejudice judicial outcomes but merely raise professional conduct concerns.Please let me know if you’d like me to refine your draft letter for legal clarity and reduced risk exposure.

Request them to ensure disclosure of this contingent liability in accordance with applicable accounting standards (AS 29 / Ind AS 37). Similarly, you may file a written representation with the concerned Registrar of Companies (RoC), pointing out that the company is continuing in possession post-lease without disclosing material liabilities in their financials, thereby potentially misleading stakeholders in violation of Sections 129 and 134 of the Companies Act, 2013. Both communications should be factual, non-defamatory, and clearly state that they are being made without prejudice to your ongoing litigation before the High Court.Thanks & RegardsAdv.

    "question": "Seeking legal opinion: risks of submitting ethics complaint during ongoing dispute",
    "answer": "Dear Client, kindly note the followingThe Risk of DefamationUnless your complaint is supported by facts and evidence, even if your complaint is accurate, defamation can be claimed in case the tenant alleges that the complaint impinges on their reputation according to the relevant sections. However, truth is an absolute defence for defamation. If all your assertions are verifiable facts, supported by documents, and done in good faith without ill will, the chances of winning defamation suit against you are minimal. Since complaint is submitted only to the industry association (not publicly), the chances of defamation liability are minimized further because the communication is restricted and not published to the general public. However, in order to minimize the risk, ensure the complaint sticks strictly to verifiable facts, avoid speculative or inflammatory language, and keep your tone professional.Impact on Ongoing LitigationFiling an ethics complaint should not legally prejudice your ongoing civil litigation in the High Court, especially since you have won in both lower courts and the complaint concerns related ethical and contractual breaches. Nevertheless, the tenant could attempt to counter that the complaint is intended to intimidate or pressure, an argument that would be raised tactically in the lawsuit. You are wise to advise your lawyer of the complaint so that she/he can plan ahead and dispel any such claims in the appeal. If you wish to stay clear of any impression of interference, you could wait for the court to dispose of the appeal, but it is not necessary.Notification to Chartered Accountant and Registrar of Companies (ROC)Failure to disclose a material liability (Rs 12 Crore arrears) in balance sheets may constitute financial misrepresentation and violation of statutory obligations under the Companies Act, 2013. You can write a formal representation to the Chartered Accountant of the tenant pointing out non-disclosure and seek rectification. At the same time, you can seek action from ROC for non-adherence to accounting and disclosure standards. This action can generate regulatory pressure upon the tenant to disclose the liability appropriately and avoid future claims of inability to pay owing to undisclosed liabilities.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Kindly note the following points,Entitlement to 1/3 Share in the PropertyAccording to Section 6 of theHindu Succession Act, 1956, your mother's property goes to her husband and children equally if she passed away intestate (without a will). As you and your sister were minors in 1997, the transmission of the whole property to your father through revenue records can be held invalid if it did not include your shares.Cancellation of Registered Sale AgreementThe contract specifically requires pahani correction and your signatures to complete sales. As such conditions are yet to be completed, the buyer cannot enforce the contract. Omission of mentioning pahani correction in the contract and hurriedly getting your father to register it may amount to fraud. The lack of a timeline in your case further also diminishes the claim of the buyer since courts typically expect reasonable timeframes for execution.Options for CancellationPrepare a cancellation deed (registered before the same sub-registrar). This can take 2–4 weeks if the buyer is willing to cooperate.Lodge a civil suit under Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act for cancellation. Possibility of success is high because of non-fulfilment of pre-conditions (pahani correction, your signatures) and the potential fraud in execution.3. Lawsuit Timeline and ProcessKarnataka civil suits normally take 2–5 years for settlement, subject to court backlog. The Interim injunctions may restrain the buyer from selling during the pendency of litigation.Steps:You can institute a suit for cancellation and declaration of your shares.You may obtain an interim injunction restraining the buyer.You can Exhibit proof of pahani defects and non-consent.Validity of Agreement After 3 YearsUnder the Section 59 of the Limitation Act, a cancellation suit should be instituted primarily within 3 years from the date of discovery of fraud/defect. No time limit having been provided, the agreement will not automatically lapse after 3 years. Yet, the inability of the buyer to complete conditions (pahani correction, your signatures) makes it unenforceable.Critical RecommendationsSend a legal notice to the buyer pointing out breaches.File mutation request in revenue records to rectify pahani and establish your shares.The Failure to sign the sale deed cancels the transaction as per the terms of the agreement.Get a property attorney in Karnataka to prepare the cancellation deed/lawsuit and pursue your father's rights.Note: Safeguard your father from undue influence by the buyer. Keep a record of all interactions and maintain copies of the sale agreement, pahani records, and communication. This strategy focuses on safeguarding your inheritance rights and using the defective terms of the agreement to invalidate the sale. Pre-emptive legal action is needed to avoid causing irreparable damage.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "You cannot claim pre-emption rights on a neighbor's land that has already been sold under the West Bengal Land Reforms Act (WBLR Act). The WBLR Act grants pre-emption rights to co-sharers and contiguous owners to purchase land being sold by their neighbors, but it applies before the sale is finalized, not after it.The right of pre-emption is typically invoked before a sale is completed. Once the sale is finalized, the right to pre-empt is usually lost.You can claim pre-emption rights in ancestral property in West Bengal, even if it hasn't been partitioned yet. The right of pre-emption, also known as the right of first refusal, allows a co-owner to purchase the share of another co-owner before it's sold to an outsider. This right applies to undivided ancestral property, meaning it can be exercised even before a formal partition of the property is made.If you (as a co-owner) wish to exercise your pre-emption right, you'll typically need to:Be informed about the sale or offer.Express your willingness to purchase the share.Offer to pay the price the seller is willing to accept.If other co-owners also wish to purchase, the legal rules will determine who has the priority.If your request for purchase is likely to be ignored you may file a suit for injunction to restrain the cosharers from alienating the ancestral undivided property from being sold to a third party before you decline the offer.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Pre-emption right on sale of entire adjacent agricultural plot and potential transfer of undivided share in ancestral house",
    "answer": "In the first case regarding the sale of your brother’s entire adjacent agricultural plot, you cannot claim the right of pre-emption under Section 8 of the West Bengal Land Reforms (WBLR) Act, 1955. The law allows pre-emption only when apartof a holding is sold—not the entire plot. Since your brother sold his entire holding, your status as an adjacent landowner does not grant you any legal remedy under this provision. However, if there was any element of fraud, coercion, or material suppression, you may explore civil remedies through court, though success is not guaranteed.In the second case concerning the potential transfer of your brother’s undivided share in the ancestral residential (Vastu) property, pre-emption rights under the WBLR Act apply only if he sells his share, not if he gifts it. A gift deed does not constitute a sale, so co-sharers like you cannot exercise pre-emption in such a scenario. To safeguard your interests, you may consider filing a partition suit to divide the property formally, which would prevent him from gifting or selling an undivided share. Additionally, you may approach the civil court for an injunction to restrain any such transfer until partition is complete. These steps can help you protect the family property and maintain your legal rights.Shubham GoyalAdvocate, Delhi1186 Answers7 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shubham Goyal"

    "question": "Pre-emption right on sale of entire adjacent agricultural plot and potential transfer of undivided share in ancestral house",
    "answer": "In the normal situation the sale of property by executing a registered sale deed is considered to be complete. In your case you have not expressed your willingness to purchase the neighbor's plot before he looked for a prospective buyer outside, henc you may have lost your preemption rights in this regard.About the ancestral property, under theHindu Succession Act, co-owners of ancestral undivided property typically have pre-emption rights.This means if one co-owner wishes to sell their share, they are required to first offer it to the other co-owners before selling it to an outsider.The purpose of pre-emption rights in ancestral property is to give  the co-owners the first option to buy, the property is less likely to be split up among multiple owners, which can lead to disputes and inefficiencies.It ensures that the co-owners have a chance to maintain their share of the property and avoid unwanted ownership from strangers.When a co-owner decides to sell their share, they must first offer it to the other co-owners at the same price.If the other co-owners refuse to exercise their pre-emption right, the seller is then free to sell the share to an outsider.Therefore there is no danger about the denial of preemption rights in filing a suit for partition.You cannot compel other cosharers to transfer their respective share in the ancestral property into a trust for any reason, if one of them is not agreeing then you may have to leave him and his share alone while forming the proposed trust, then also your purpose will be defeated.In cases of disputes or disagreements, the courts may intervene to resolve the matter and ensure that the pre-emption rights are properly exercised.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Thank you for presenting the facts in such a structured and thoughtful manner. Based on the details shared, here is a professional legal opinion addressing your specific concerns:1. Defamation Risk (Complaint to Industry Association)Legal Position:In India, defamation (civil or criminal) requires the following elements:A false statement,Publication of that statement to a third party,Harm to the reputation of the person/entity.Application to Your Case:If your complaint:Is factually accurate and based on documentary evidence,Is made privately to a relevant authority (i.e., the industry association),Is made in good faith to protect your legal and financial interests,Then it falls within the\"qualified privilege\"defence, especially since the communication is made to a body with a legitimate interest in the matter.Conclusion:As long as your statements aretruthful, supported by documentation, and the communication isnot published publicly or with malice, your exposure to defamation liability is minimal. However, ensure the tone remains objective, not accusatory or inflammatory.2. Litigation Impact (Ongoing Appeal in High Court)Given that:You havealready prevailed in both lower courts, andThe case is currently pending in appeal,filing a complaint with an industry association may nottechnicallyamount to sub judice contempt, but it could lead the opposing party to argue that:You are trying toinfluence parallel forumswhile the matter is pending,You areundermining judicial processorprejudicing the appealby pursuing remedies outside the courtroom.Risk Assessment:The association hasno adjudicatory power; it can only enforce ethical standards, not legal dues.However, a savvy opposing party may attempt to use your complaint to allege harassment or parallel pressure tactics, especially if the association initiates an inquiry.Recommendation:Since your case is already strong and pending before the High Court:Wait for the final verdict, unless the balance sheet misrepresentation presents an imminent fraud on stakeholders or regulators (e.g., under MCA, SEBI, or Companies Act implications).If urgent, phrase your complaint cautiously, stating that thecourt case is pendingand that your intent is tonotifythe association of potential ethical breaches,without prejudice to ongoing litigation.Suggested Wording Revision for Key Risk Reduction:Instead of alleging fraud directly, use phrasing like:“We believe that the continued non-disclosure of this contingent liability, while the matter is sub judice, may not align with the spirit of transparency and accountability expected of members under your Code of Conduct.”This softens the tone and signals that you're not making a final accusation, but raising ethical concerns for review.Conclusion & Strategic Advice:Defamation: Low risk if complaint is factual, confidential, and not malicious.Litigation: Advisable to wait until the High Court appeal concludes, unless you must urgently act to protect stakeholder interests.If you proceed now,include a clear disclaimerthat the matter is pending before the High Court and this complaint is not intended to prejudice judicial outcomes but merely raise professional conduct concerns.Please let me know if you’d like me to refine your draft letter for legal clarity and reduced risk exposure.

    "answer": "To protect your rights and prevent the tenant from later pleading financial incapacity, you may formally notify their Chartered Accountant (Statutory Auditor) in writing, highlighting the ongoing litigation, lease terms mandating 15% annual rent escalation, and the approximate ₹12 crore arrears. Request them to ensure disclosure of this contingent liability in accordance with applicable accounting standards (AS 29 / Ind AS 37). Similarly, you may file a written representation with the concerned Registrar of Companies (RoC), pointing out that the company is continuing in possession post-lease without disclosing material liabilities in their financials, thereby potentially misleading stakeholders in violation of Sections 129 and 134 of the Companies Act, 2013. Both communications should be factual, non-defamatory, and clearly state that they are being made without prejudice to your ongoing litigation before the High Court.Thanks & RegardsAdv.

    "answer": "Dear Client, kindly note the followingThe Risk of DefamationUnless your complaint is supported by facts and evidence, even if your complaint is accurate, defamation can be claimed in case the tenant alleges that the complaint impinges on their reputation according to the relevant sections. However, truth is an absolute defence for defamation. If all your assertions are verifiable facts, supported by documents, and done in good faith without ill will, the chances of winning defamation suit against you are minimal. Since complaint is submitted only to the industry association (not publicly), the chances of defamation liability are minimized further because the communication is restricted and not published to the general public. However, in order to minimize the risk, ensure the complaint sticks strictly to verifiable facts, avoid speculative or inflammatory language, and keep your tone professional.Impact on Ongoing LitigationFiling an ethics complaint should not legally prejudice your ongoing civil litigation in the High Court, especially since you have won in both lower courts and the complaint concerns related ethical and contractual breaches. Nevertheless, the tenant could attempt to counter that the complaint is intended to intimidate or pressure, an argument that would be raised tactically in the lawsuit. You are wise to advise your lawyer of the complaint so that she/he can plan ahead and dispel any such claims in the appeal. If you wish to stay clear of any impression of interference, you could wait for the court to dispose of the appeal, but it is not necessary.Notification to Chartered Accountant and Registrar of Companies (ROC)Failure to disclose a material liability (Rs 12 Crore arrears) in balance sheets may constitute financial misrepresentation and violation of statutory obligations under the Companies Act, 2013. You can write a formal representation to the Chartered Accountant of the tenant pointing out non-disclosure and seek rectification. At the same time, you can seek action from ROC for non-adherence to accounting and disclosure standards. This action can generate regulatory pressure upon the tenant to disclose the liability appropriately and avoid future claims of inability to pay owing to undisclosed liabilities.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Kindly note the following points,Entitlement to 1/3 Share in the PropertyAccording to Section 6 of theHindu Succession Act, 1956, your mother's property goes to her husband and children equally if she passed away intestate (without a will). As you and your sister were minors in 1997, the transmission of the whole property to your father through revenue records can be held invalid if it did not include your shares.Cancellation of Registered Sale AgreementThe contract specifically requires pahani correction and your signatures to complete sales. As such conditions are yet to be completed, the buyer cannot enforce the contract. Omission of mentioning pahani correction in the contract and hurriedly getting your father to register it may amount to fraud. The lack of a timeline in your case further also diminishes the claim of the buyer since courts typically expect reasonable timeframes for execution.Options for CancellationPrepare a cancellation deed (registered before the same sub-registrar). This can take 2–4 weeks if the buyer is willing to cooperate.Lodge a civil suit under Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act for cancellation. Possibility of success is high because of non-fulfilment of pre-conditions (pahani correction, your signatures) and the potential fraud in execution.3. Lawsuit Timeline and ProcessKarnataka civil suits normally take 2–5 years for settlement, subject to court backlog. The Interim injunctions may restrain the buyer from selling during the pendency of litigation.Steps:You can institute a suit for cancellation and declaration of your shares.You may obtain an interim injunction restraining the buyer.You can Exhibit proof of pahani defects and non-consent.Validity of Agreement After 3 YearsUnder the Section 59 of the Limitation Act, a cancellation suit should be instituted primarily within 3 years from the date of discovery of fraud/defect. No time limit having been provided, the agreement will not automatically lapse after 3 years. Yet, the inability of the buyer to complete conditions (pahani correction, your signatures) makes it unenforceable.Critical RecommendationsSend a legal notice to the buyer pointing out breaches.File mutation request in revenue records to rectify pahani and establish your shares.The Failure to sign the sale deed cancels the transaction as per the terms of the agreement.Get a property attorney in Karnataka to prepare the cancellation deed/lawsuit and pursue your father's rights.Note: Safeguard your father from undue influence by the buyer. Keep a record of all interactions and maintain copies of the sale agreement, pahani records, and communication. This strategy focuses on safeguarding your inheritance rights and using the defective terms of the agreement to invalidate the sale.

Character of Life EstateYour mother has a life interest in the property under your late father's Will, whereby she can stay in and utilize the property in her lifetime but cannot transfer or sell it. Upon her death, the property is to go half to you and half to your brother.2. Release of Life InterestYour mother cannot release her life interest without the consent of the other person unless the Will provides otherwise. Nevertheless, if your mother and your brother consent with you, this problem may be resolved between yourselves.3. Actual Steps in SellingA. Relinquishment Deed/Deed of Family ArrangementBoth of your sons (both brothers) and your mother ought to execute a registered family arrangement or relinquishment deed under which the mother duly waives her life interest and accepts both the sons to whom such an interest had existed. This deed should be registered at the sub-registrar office in Coimbatore and proper stamp duty should be paid.B. Court Consent Decree (Recommended)To provide additional legal protection and to provide confidence to the buyer, you can make a joint petition in the local civil court for a consent decree to the effect that all concerned agree to forego the life interest and sell the property to the sons. The court order will render the title clear and unchallenged.C. Sale of PropertyAfter the relinquishment or consent decree is issued, you and your brother (as sole owners) may legally sell the property. Give the purchaser the Will, relinquishment deed, and court order (if secured) to establish clear title.4. Other ConsiderationsHave all documents properly prepared and registered.Verify any outstanding dues or encumbrances on the property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

A registered Gift Deed is preferable over a will in your case because it takes effect immediately, is harder to challenge, and secures your daughter’s rights during your lifetime. While the property is still undivided, your daughter will become a co-owner and may be added as a party to the partition suit, but the Gift Deed will protect her legal interest.

    "question": "Legal Issue for joining client company",
    "answer": "Hello,1. Non-Compete ClausesWhile Working:Companies can ask employees not to work for competitors or start a similar business while they are still employed. Such conditions are usually valid.After Leaving the Job:In India, asking someone not to work for a competitor after leaving the company is generally not allowed. As per Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, any agreement stopping a person from doing lawful work or business is usually not valid.2. Non-Solicitation ClausesValidity:A company can stop a former employee from contacting or taking away its clients after they leave. Courts in India are more willing to accept such clauses compared to non-compete clauses.Meaning:It means after leaving the job, the employee should not try to get business from the company’s old clients whom they dealt with during their job.3. Legal Rules and ExceptionsGeneral Rule:In India, any agreement that stops a person from working freely is void.Exceptions:There are few cases where restrictions are allowed, like between business partners — for example, not competing with each other after ending the partnership.4. Important Points to RememberReasonable Limits:Restrictions must be fair — for example, for a limited time, in a certain area, and only for specific business activities.Protecting Business Interests:If a company wants to protect its trade secrets, client lists, or confidential information, some restrictions may be accepted by courts.5. Common ExamplesA software company might add a clause that stops an employee from joining their client’s company for some months after resigning.A non-solicitation clause might prevent a former employee from contacting old clients to give the same service through a new company.ConclusionIn your situation your pevious company cannot enforce any rights unless there is an explicit and technical clause in the service agreement that attracts your situation, else you cannot be barred from joining your client company .Hope this helps.Swarupananda NeogiAdvocate, Kolkata2983 Answers6 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Swarupananda Neogi"

    "question": "Legal Issue for joining client company",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Non-Compete Clauses & Indian LawIn India, any contract that restricts a person from finding employment after leaving an organization is generally void and cannot be enforced under Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.Non-compete clauses apply only while you are working, not once you’ve left the company.Indian courts have time and again held that post-employment restraints-such as not joining a client or competitor-are not legally enforceable.Your Specific SituationYou never signed any non-solicitation or non-compete contract forbidding you from joining the client company; only the appointment letter was signed, and that is not against post-employment opportunities. Your appointment letter clause limits you only from working elsewhere when you are working with your earlier employer, and it is not applicable not post-employment.Unsigned document or company policy cannot be implied and enforced against you at any point in time as stated by the courts in previous similar scenarios.Legal Notice & Threat of Civil SuitThe notice and request to sign an agreement of non-compliance are now legally irrelevant as you are no longer their employee and you did not give your prior consent to such conditions during your tenure.A civil suit or injunction against you for your joining the client company is unlikely to be upheld the in court against you, as such limitations are null and void in India.This should not impact your employment at the client firm or any of the future job that you choose to take up, provided that you have not obtained or used confidential information or trade secrets.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

As you agreed to be governed by the rules of the company as evident by the clause in your appointment letter, the company may invoke the 'non compete' clause.

    "question": "Legal Issue for joining client company",
    "answer": "Based on the facts shared, here is the professional legal assessment:No Binding Non-Compete Clause Post-Termination:The clause in your appointment letter primarily restricts dual employmentduringthe tenure of your employment. There is no express clause that restricts you from joining the client companyafteryou have been relieved. Furthermore, since you have not signed any separate non-compete or non-solicitation agreement, the employer cannot unilaterally impose post-employment restrictions, especially not retroactively.Company Policies Are Not Binding After Exit:While the appointment letter states that you are governed by company policies, such policies are applicable only while you are in active service. Once you are relieved and issued an experience and relieving letter, those policies no longer bind you, unless they were incorporated in a signed agreement with post-employment obligations.Attempt to Enforce Post-Employment Restrictions Without Agreement Is Legally Weak:Indian courts generally do not enforce post-employment non-compete clauses under Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, as such clauses are considered restraint of trade and hence void. Exceptions apply only in very limited scenarios involving confidentiality or trade secrets, which is not evident in your case.Legal Notice and Civil Suit:Sending a legal notice does not amount to initiation of a legal suit. If the previous employer initiates a civil suit seeking injunction or damages, they must prove:That a legally valid and binding post-employment non-compete agreement exists (which it doesn’t in your case), andThat your joining the client company has caused them direct loss or breach of contract.Given that you were contacted directly by the client company two months after your employment ended, and you did not solicit the client while in employment, the chances of the employer succeeding in a civil suit are very low.Impact on Current Employment:Unless your current employer (the client company) is concerned about litigation or has internal obligations with the former employer, your joining should not be affected. You may, however, inform them of the situation transparently and provide the relieving and experience letters to demonstrate that you left properly.Recommendation:You may respond to the legal notice stating that there is no contractual restriction prohibiting your employment with the client company and that any attempt to restrain your right to livelihood is legally untenable.Maintain a record of all communications.If the former employer initiates any legal proceedings, you may contest it strongly on the above grounds.For any further details feel free to reach out to me at Legal CorridorThanks & RegardsAdv.

Make a police complaint or anticipatory bail plea if you fear false FIRs. Report to your department to safeguard your service.

Delayed allegations are more difficult to establish but not impossible. Your video evidence refuting dowry is important.Counter-Cases: You may choose to lodge counter FIRs for defamation, criminal intimidation, or false complaints if false cases are filed against you or your parents. The evidence such as call recordings, video evidence, neighbor/maid testimony, and any written evidence will also hold value in court.Child Custody: The Courts give utmost importance to children's well-being. Therefore, the custody or visitation rights can be shared. You are adivsed to seek the services of a family lawyer to make custody petitions safeguarding your parental rights.Protecting Older Parents: Parents can be safeguarded by seeking anticipatory bail or making police complaints in case of threats.The courts do not readily agree to arrest of older parents unless on substantial reasons.Mental Health Documentation: Psychiatric counseling and keeping medical records can lend credibility to alleging mental harassment and stress.Divorce Process Under Muslim Law: You may approach divorce through talaq or mutual consent (mubarat).  Judicial intervention can be sought under the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Divorce after 14 years of marriage",
    "answer": "As a 41-year-old Muslim man contemplating divorce after 14 years of marriage, it is prudent to take certain pre-emptive legal measures to safeguard yourself and your elderly parents from potential false allegations. You should begin by documenting all relevant facts in a notarised affidavit stating there was no dowry demand or harassment, supported by the video recording where your wife and father-in-law have admitted the same. Additionally, preserve all digital evidence such as call recordings, messages, and any interactions that indicate emotional abuse or maligning of your character. You may also consider filing a precautionary General Diary (GD) or Non-Cognizable Report (NCR) at the local police station expressing apprehension of false cases. Although dowry ordomestic violencecomplaints can still be filed after 14 years, their evidentiary value is significantly weakened due to the long delay, particularly when parties have cohabited peacefully in the interim. If false cases are initiated, you are entitled to file counter-complaints under Sections 182 and 211 of the IPC and may pursue a defamation case. To protect your children’s interests, it is advisable to initiate a custody petition under the Guardians and Wards Act and maintain a record of your active involvement in their upbringing. Given your concern about the mental toll of the marriage, consulting a psychiatrist to document stress may also support your case, particularly if false mental harassment allegations are made. Lastly, you must keep your elderly parents distanced from marital conflicts and avoid any direct or volatile communication with your wife to shield them from unnecessary legal complications. Seeking timely legal counsel and maintaining calm, factual communication will help you handle this situation ethically and lawfully.Aman VermaAdvocate, Delhi400 AnswersTalk to Advocate Aman Verma"

    "answer": "No doubt it is not advisable to take any action of sending notice to the association when the matter is pending before high court in an appeal pending disposal of the appeal.This act may sometimes jeopardise the outcome of the appeal especially when you have already won in the lower courts.However there is no element of defamation by sending notice to the association also in this regard especially when the tenant has not reflected this liability of arrears of rent in his balance sheet.You can send a formal written notice to the association, clearly stating that the tenant is in arrears and detailing the amount owed.The association, as the governing body, has a responsibility to ensure that all owners, including the tenant, are adhering to their obligations, including the payment of rent.The association has a responsibility to ensure the proper functioning of the business premises and the well-being of the business owners within the premises.This act will be considered as an act done in good faith hence it may not attract the defamation ingredientsT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Thank you for presenting the facts in such a structured and thoughtful manner. Based on the details shared, here is a professional legal opinion addressing your specific concerns:1. Defamation Risk (Complaint to Industry Association)Legal Position:In India, defamation (civil or criminal) requires the following elements:A false statement,Publication of that statement to a third party,Harm to the reputation of the person/entity.Application to Your Case:If your complaint:Is factually accurate and based on documentary evidence,Is made privately to a relevant authority (i.e., the industry association),Is made in good faith to protect your legal and financial interests,Then it falls within the\"qualified privilege\"defence, especially since the communication is made to a body with a legitimate interest in the matter.Conclusion:As long as your statements aretruthful, supported by documentation, and the communication isnot published publicly or with malice, your exposure to defamation liability is minimal. However, ensure the tone remains objective, not accusatory or inflammatory.2. Litigation Impact (Ongoing Appeal in High Court)Given that:You havealready prevailed in both lower courts, andThe case is currently pending in appeal,filing a complaint with an industry association may nottechnicallyamount to sub judice contempt, but it could lead the opposing party to argue that:You are trying toinfluence parallel forumswhile the matter is pending,You areundermining judicial processorprejudicing the appealby pursuing remedies outside the courtroom.Risk Assessment:The association hasno adjudicatory power; it can only enforce ethical standards, not legal dues.However, a savvy opposing party may attempt to use your complaint to allege harassment or parallel pressure tactics, especially if the association initiates an inquiry.Recommendation:Since your case is already strong and pending before the High Court:Wait for the final verdict, unless the balance sheet misrepresentation presents an imminent fraud on stakeholders or regulators (e.g., under MCA, SEBI, or Companies Act implications).If urgent, phrase your complaint cautiously, stating that thecourt case is pendingand that your intent is tonotifythe association of potential ethical breaches,without prejudice to ongoing litigation.Suggested Wording Revision for Key Risk Reduction:Instead of alleging fraud directly, use phrasing like:“We believe that the continued non-disclosure of this contingent liability, while the matter is sub judice, may not align with the spirit of transparency and accountability expected of members under your Code of Conduct.”This softens the tone and signals that you're not making a final accusation, but raising ethical concerns for review.Conclusion & Strategic Advice:Defamation: Low risk if complaint is factual, confidential, and not malicious.Litigation: Advisable to wait until the High Court appeal concludes, unless you must urgently act to protect stakeholder interests.If you proceed now,include a clear disclaimerthat the matter is pending before the High Court and this complaint is not intended to prejudice judicial outcomes but merely raise professional conduct concerns.Please let me know if you’d like me to refine your draft letter for legal clarity and reduced risk exposure.

    "answer": "To protect your rights and prevent the tenant from later pleading financial incapacity, you may formally notify their Chartered Accountant (Statutory Auditor) in writing, highlighting the ongoing litigation, lease terms mandating 15% annual rent escalation, and the approximate ₹12 crore arrears. Request them to ensure disclosure of this contingent liability in accordance with applicable accounting standards (AS 29 / Ind AS 37). Similarly, you may file a written representation with the concerned Registrar of Companies (RoC), pointing out that the company is continuing in possession post-lease without disclosing material liabilities in their financials, thereby potentially misleading stakeholders in violation of Sections 129 and 134 of the Companies Act, 2013. Both communications should be factual, non-defamatory, and clearly state that they are being made without prejudice to your ongoing litigation before the High Court.Thanks & RegardsAdv.

    "question": "Seeking legal opinion: risks of submitting ethics complaint during ongoing dispute",
    "answer": "Dear Client, kindly note the followingThe Risk of DefamationUnless your complaint is supported by facts and evidence, even if your complaint is accurate, defamation can be claimed in case the tenant alleges that the complaint impinges on their reputation according to the relevant sections. However, truth is an absolute defence for defamation. If all your assertions are verifiable facts, supported by documents, and done in good faith without ill will, the chances of winning defamation suit against you are minimal. Since complaint is submitted only to the industry association (not publicly), the chances of defamation liability are minimized further because the communication is restricted and not published to the general public. However, in order to minimize the risk, ensure the complaint sticks strictly to verifiable facts, avoid speculative or inflammatory language, and keep your tone professional.Impact on Ongoing LitigationFiling an ethics complaint should not legally prejudice your ongoing civil litigation in the High Court, especially since you have won in both lower courts and the complaint concerns related ethical and contractual breaches. Nevertheless, the tenant could attempt to counter that the complaint is intended to intimidate or pressure, an argument that would be raised tactically in the lawsuit. You are wise to advise your lawyer of the complaint so that she/he can plan ahead and dispel any such claims in the appeal. If you wish to stay clear of any impression of interference, you could wait for the court to dispose of the appeal, but it is not necessary.Notification to Chartered Accountant and Registrar of Companies (ROC)Failure to disclose a material liability (Rs 12 Crore arrears) in balance sheets may constitute financial misrepresentation and violation of statutory obligations under the Companies Act, 2013. You can write a formal representation to the Chartered Accountant of the tenant pointing out non-disclosure and seek rectification. At the same time, you can seek action from ROC for non-adherence to accounting and disclosure standards. This action can generate regulatory pressure upon the tenant to disclose the liability appropriately and avoid future claims of inability to pay owing to undisclosed liabilities.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Kindly note the following points,Entitlement to 1/3 Share in the PropertyAccording to Section 6 of theHindu Succession Act, 1956, your mother's property goes to her husband and children equally if she passed away intestate (without a will). As you and your sister were minors in 1997, the transmission of the whole property to your father through revenue records can be held invalid if it did not include your shares.Cancellation of Registered Sale AgreementThe contract specifically requires pahani correction and your signatures to complete sales. As such conditions are yet to be completed, the buyer cannot enforce the contract. Omission of mentioning pahani correction in the contract and hurriedly getting your father to register it may amount to fraud. The lack of a timeline in your case further also diminishes the claim of the buyer since courts typically expect reasonable timeframes for execution.Options for CancellationPrepare a cancellation deed (registered before the same sub-registrar). This can take 2–4 weeks if the buyer is willing to cooperate.Lodge a civil suit under Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act for cancellation. Possibility of success is high because of non-fulfilment of pre-conditions (pahani correction, your signatures) and the potential fraud in execution.3. Lawsuit Timeline and ProcessKarnataka civil suits normally take 2–5 years for settlement, subject to court backlog. The Interim injunctions may restrain the buyer from selling during the pendency of litigation.Steps:You can institute a suit for cancellation and declaration of your shares.You may obtain an interim injunction restraining the buyer.You can Exhibit proof of pahani defects and non-consent.Validity of Agreement After 3 YearsUnder the Section 59 of the Limitation Act, a cancellation suit should be instituted primarily within 3 years from the date of discovery of fraud/defect. No time limit having been provided, the agreement will not automatically lapse after 3 years. Yet, the inability of the buyer to complete conditions (pahani correction, your signatures) makes it unenforceable.Critical RecommendationsSend a legal notice to the buyer pointing out breaches.File mutation request in revenue records to rectify pahani and establish your shares.The Failure to sign the sale deed cancels the transaction as per the terms of the agreement.Get a property attorney in Karnataka to prepare the cancellation deed/lawsuit and pursue your father's rights.Note: Safeguard your father from undue influence by the buyer. Keep a record of all interactions and maintain copies of the sale agreement, pahani records, and communication. This strategy focuses on safeguarding your inheritance rights and using the defective terms of the agreement to invalidate the sale.

    "answer": "1. Yes it's possible for you or your sister or both to file a case against your father for partition. Prior to that, you have to serve a legal notice to your father. You can't get the property registered in your sole name. But if your father and your sister execute a registered Release/Relinquishment Deed in the jurisdictional Sub Registrar's Office.2. To make the sale agreement void, cancellation deed has to be registered.3. If cancellation deed is not registered cancelling the earlier sale agreement, then your father has to face Court case from the buyer.Shashidhar S.

    "question": "Registered sale of agreement cancellation",
    "answer": "Since yor father had entered into a sale agreement with the buyer, it would be better that you talk to the buyer and get the sale agreement cancelled.If he refuses then you can issue a legal notice to both your father and the buyer stating that the sale agreement is null and void insofar as the shares of you and your sister in the property ios concerned hence you can instruct them to either cancel the sale agreement or to face the legal consequences.Your act of getting  a document registered on your both the names would be considered as an illegal act and the buyer may sue all of you for this illegal act.Hence you may better take proper precautionary measures to peacefully cancel the sale agreement and settle the issue amicably instead of getting involved into a long stretched legal battles as a consequence of your hasty decision.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

A registered Gift Deed is preferable over a will in your case because it takes effect immediately, is harder to challenge, and secures your daughter’s rights during your lifetime. While the property is still undivided, your daughter will become a co-owner and may be added as a party to the partition suit, but the Gift Deed will protect her legal interest. Ensure the gift deed clearly mentions your share and the pending litigation to avoid complications."

This would help protect her interest now itself, even amidst the pending suit.Will: Effective only from your death, which can be challenged or put on hold by the court and thus does not afford immediate protection.Risks for your youngest daughter: As the partition suit is pending, her rights as your share transferee may be challenged by the other parties.But once the Gift Deed is registered, her title over your share is secure, and she may be made a party to the suit in order to safeguard her interest.

    "question": "Wife family threatening us",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,1.You Cannot Be Compelled to Visit VizagNo one can compel you legally to visit Vizag for a family settlement. Any discussion regarding settlement can and should take place in a neutral location, considering that both of you are employed in Bangalore.Police ThreatsYour wife's relatives cannot use the police to make you separate or meet at Vizag. Police will only act if there is a valid criminal complaint (likedomestic violenceor dowry harassment). If you are visited or called by the police, be cooperative but do not sign any statement under duress. You can ask that any investigation be done in Bangalore, where both of you stay for work.Alternatives to SeparationIn case both want to separate, you can go for:Mutual Consent Divorce: It is the quickest and least confrontational option. Both have to agree, and you can file in Bangalore Family Court as both are employed there.Lok Adalat: It is a forum for alternative dispute resolution where both can settle things amicably, such as terms of separation, maintenance, and property. This too can be achieved in Bangalore.If She Gives a Police CaseIf your wife gives a complaint (e.g.,Section 498AIPC for cruelty ordomestic violence), you will be summoned for inquiry. See a local lawyer at once. Don't take police notices lightly. You have the right to apply for anticipatory bail if you are in fear of arrest.5. Maintenance and Financial ImplicationsAs your wife is earning (SBI employee, ₹40,000/month), her claim for maintenance will be restricted. But if she can establish that she requires more for her way of life, the court may direct some maintenance, but it will be reasonable given her own earnings and your responsibilities.6. Your Mother's RightsAs a single parent child, you are legally and ethically bound to take care of your mother. Indian law does not compel a husband to abandon his dependent parent unless there is established cruelty or harassment to the wife.Settlement DiscussionsDemand that any settlement or mediation be held in Bangalore, preferably in the Family Court or with a formal mediator. Never agree to anything under threat or coercion.8. DocumentationMaintain a record of all correspondence (messages, emails, call records) and incidents, as these can be helpful if the issue has to go to court.Immediate ActionDon't panic or respond to threats.Get professional advice from a local family lawyer in Bangalore for individualized legal approach.Reply to any communication from the police through your attorney.If you want to salvage the marriage, take professional marriage counseling or mediation, but only if both are agreeable.In case of unavoidable separation, elaborate on consent divorce or settlement in the Lok Adalat in BangaloreAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "You Cannot Be Forced to Go to Vizag: You are not legally obligated to travel to Vizag or attend any police mediation there. Both of you are working in Bengaluru, andany discussion or mediation should ideally take place where both parties reside and work. Threats of police action to force your travel arenot legally tenable.Police Cannot Compel Separation or Settlement: The police can only facilitate mediation through theMahila Police StationorFamily Counselling Centre. Theycannot force separation, divorce, or threaten arrestwithout a valid FIR and proper inquiry.No need to panicif threats are being made — such threats are common but largely hollow unless a formal complaint is filed.On Threat of Police Case (e.g., 498A,Domestic Violence, etc.): If they file a complaint, you will receive anotice under Section 41A CrPCor be called for counselling. It is essential toconsult a local lawyer in Bengaluru immediatelyif you receive any such notice. Keep all communication records and proof of your side (messages, travel history, her refusal to join, etc.).On Separation and Divorce: If she is unwilling to live with you and is adamant about separation:You may considerfiling forRestitution of Conjugal Rights(RCR)under Section 9 of theHindu Marriage Actto legally document that she deserted you without valid reason.Alternatively, if reconciliation is not possible, and both parties agree, you can mutually file fordivorce by mutual consentunder Section 13B. This would require a 6-month cooling-off period.If they go toLok Adalat, understand it is a voluntary forum. Youcan decline participationor attend with a lawyer.Alimony & Maintenance: Since she is earning ₹40,000 per month as a bank employee,her claim for maintenance is weak, especially given the short duration of cohabitation. Courts usually consider financial independence, and your limited cohabitation (barely any marital life) may work in your favour.Take Preventive Steps:Avoid further direct interaction with her relatives.Donot sign any documents or settlement terms without legal advice.If threats escalate, consider filing aNC complaint (non-cognizable report)in your local police station for record-keeping.Next Steps:Engage a family lawyer in Bengaluru to prepare for any legal notices.Gather all proof (messages, her refusal to stay, threats, etc.).Respond legally only after a formal complaint or notice is served.You are well within your rights to expect the dispute to be resolved in Bengaluru and protect your elderly mother’s care and your dignity.Thanks & Regards,Adv.

    "answer": "Dear Client:Question-Wise Legal Analysis:1. Should Nikhil appear at Police Station without a formal court notice or summons?No, he isnot legally boundto appear merely based on aphone call, especially if:Nonotice under Section 41A CrPChas been served, andNosummons or warranthas been issued by a competent court.However, to avoid escalation, Nikhil may:Send aformal communication via an advocateto the police expressing willingness to cooperate, andSeek details of any pending court proceedings.2. Does the 498A case remain valid after the mutual divorce decree?Yes, the498A case remains valid, unless:It isformally quashed by a High Court, orThe complainantwithdraws her allegations and files compromise affidavit, followed byquashing under Section482 CrPC.Mutual divorce doesnot automatically quash criminal proceedings. Criminal law is separate and continues until:Chargesheet is not filed and FIR is quashed, orTrial ends in acquittal/conviction, orThe case is compounded (in compoundable offences — 498A isnon-compoundablewithout High Court intervention).3. Can he file a quashing petition under Section482 CrPCin the Supreme Court?No, not directly.Quashing underSection482 CrPCliesonly before the High Court, not the Supreme Court. For Nikhil:Since the FIR is inLucknow, he must filea petition under Section482 CrPCbefore the Allahabad High Court (Lucknow Bench).Grounds for Quashing:Long delay without chargesheet (usually 3+ years is a strong ground).Mutual divorce and settlement.Abuse of legal process.No specific allegations against in-laws (often used for quashing their names).📝 He can submit:Divorce decree,Alimony payment proof,Affidavit of compromise (if obtained from wife),FIR copy,Proof of delay/lack of chargesheet.4. Can he file a defamation case against the wife?Technically yes, butpractically risky.A case forcriminal defamation (Section 499 IPC)can be initiatedif:He can prove thatfalse, malicious allegationswere madeknowingly,He and his family suffered reputational damage,The allegations werepublished or communicated to third parties (e.g., in court or police statements).But:Indian courts are cautious in allowing defamation cases against estranged spouses unless malice and falsehood arecrystal clear.Since the matter ended in mutual divorce, courts may see it as asettled personal disputeand not support further litigation unless fresh defamatory action occurs.Practical advice: Wait until the FIR is quashed. Then, if she continues to spread false allegations, defamation orcivil suit for damagescould be considered.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighcourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "answer": "Appearance at Police Station or Court: Since your friend has not received any court summons or official notice, there isno legal obligationto appear at the police station based solely on a phone call from someone claiming to be aPeshkar. Such unofficial communications should be approached with caution. Your friend shouldinsist on a written notice or summonthrough proper legal channels. If the case is still under investigation (as no chargesheet has been filed), it is advisable to verify the current status of the FIR with the concerned police station through a lawyer.Validity of 498A Case After Divorce: Yes, the criminal case underSection 498AIPC and 3/4 of theDowry Prohibition Actremains valideven after mutual divorce. A divorce decree does not automatically nullify or close criminal proceedings unless the FIR is quashed by the High Court or the complainant formally withdraws her complaint and the court records the compromise.Filing for Quashing Under Section482 CrPC: Your friendcannot file the petition for quashing directly in the Supreme Court. Such petitions underSection482 CrPCmust be filed before the concerned High Courthaving jurisdiction over the police station where the FIR was lodged — in this case, likely theLucknow Bench of Allahabad High Court. If the wife is willing to give a no-objection statement or an affidavit of compromise, it strengthens the quashing plea considerably.Filing a Defamation Case: While technically your friend may consider filing adefamation case under Section 499 IPC, courts are cautious in such matters post matrimonial disputes, especially when mutual divorce has already been granted. However, if it can be shown that the false criminal complaint caused proven loss of reputation, financial loss, and continued harassment without basis, he may proceed, but such cases are difficult and must be supported by strong evidence of malice and falsity.Your friend should consult a local advocate at Lucknow for initiating the Section482 CrPCproceedings and ensuring the matter is brought to a legal closure.Thanks & RegardsAdv.

    "context": "Asked 25 days ago in Property Law Religion: Christian",
    "question": "Elder fraud and manipulation",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The follwing are the analysis and asnwers to your questions.1. Why is the court not expediting to cancel the settlement deed in light of alleged fraud and manipulation?Civil property cases, particularly ones involving fraud, coercion, or undue influence, are time-consuming because fact-finding, production of evidence, and arguments at law need time.Courts observe procedural fairness and permit each party to lay their case out, and it leads to delay. The court cannot arbitrarily cancel a registered settlement deed without adequate evidence of fraud or coercion and a trial. The remedy would be to file a suit for cancellation under Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act, which is discretionary and time-consuming.2. Why can the distant relative take on rent and earn money from the property while the case is still pending?Once the settlement deed is registered, the distant relative is the legal owner until the court rules otherwise. Courts do not normally interfere with possession or use of property during litigation unless a temporary injunction or stay order is issued.Unless you have obtained a temporary injunction restraining the relative from renting or alienating the property, they legally can continue possession and earn income.3. What can be done to expedite cancellation and retrieve property from your parents?Plead for early hearing or relief (interim injunction) to stop the relative from dealing with the property during the suit.Lay robust documentary and witness evidence establishing fraud, manipulation, and incapacity of your elderly parents to execute the deed knowingly. Appoint a skilled advocate to press for case listing and speed up proceedings. Negotiate mediation or settlement if possible, but if the relative does not agree, proceed with litigation.Sue for criminal fraud or forgery if supported by evidence, which can also bring pressure.4. What if your parents get ill or die during the case?The case can be proceeded with by their legal representatives or legal heirs.Their inability or death does not necessarily invalidate the suit; successors can fill their shoes to carry on the claim. It is recommended that a power of attorney or legal guardian be appointed to handle proceedings if parents are unable.5. What value is your parents' assertion that property should belong to their children?Your parents' intention or spoken words are significant but not decisive without written evidence (Will or registered document). Courts mainly use registered deeds and documentary proof. But proof of manipulation and deprivation of consent can be in your favor to get back property to parents and ultimately to heirsAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Sir/Madam,The point wise reply of your queries may be as follows:1> why court is taking so long for a case involving fraud and manipulation of elderly and settlement deed signed is not cancelled ? It now a 1.5 yearsIt is quite possible that the Trial Court is might burdened by the pendency of so much cases with it and may not be taking your case with so much priority. In these circumstances, you may proceed to high court for a direction to the Trial Court for timely disposal of the matter.2. While case is going on why is distant cousin allowed to manipulate property and rent and make profit as it is prime realestate ?It is not possible to figure out from your query that whether you have filed an application under order 39 Rule 1 and 2 of CPC for retstraining your cousin from restaining from maniputing the proeprty and rest and making the profit of the property in question. If not filed earlier, you are suggested to file and get the favourable order. If it already filed and order passed by the Court already, then file the contempt petition.3. What can be done to speed up the cancellation of settlement deed and return deed back to my parents.The process already explained in reply to queries of point 1.4. What happens if both my parents get sick or passes while ongoing court case ?In the case of any uneventuality, you may suceed your parents as the plaintiff.5. My parents will state that property and land would go to their children - what weight does that have on the case ?For that option, you may get a valid and registered WILL from the parents.Ganesh SinghAdvocate, New Delhi6928 Answers16 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ganesh Singh"

    "question": "Elder fraud and manipulation",
    "answer": "Given the serious allegations of fraud, misrepresentation, and undue influence over elderly parents in executing asettlement deed, your case raises important concerns both civilly and criminally. Here is legal advice addressing each of your concerns in a structured manner:1. Delay in Court Proceedings:Indian civil courts are often overburdened, and unless interim relief is sought aggressively, cases involving cancellation of documents such as settlement deeds can take years. However, since the settlement was allegedly obtained byfraud and manipulation of elderly persons, your advocate shouldmove an application for interim injunctionunder Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 of the CPC torestrain the distant relative from further alienating, leasing, or altering the propertyduring pendency of the suit. If your counsel hasn't done this yet, it is a serious lapse and must be addressed immediately.2. Illegal Use and Profiting During Case:If noinjunctionwas obtained at the time of filing, the defendant can legally use the property unless restrained by court order. Theimmediate remedyis to file aninjunction applicationstating that the continued use, felling of trees, and rental income is causingirreparable loss, and pray that the possession or profits be frozen or directed to be held in court trust (court receivercan be appointed). Additionally, a complaint to the police can be filed underSection 420IPC (cheating) andSection 406IPC (criminal breach of trust) if the signature was obtained fraudulently or under deception.3. Steps to Speed Up Cancellation of Settlement Deed:Ensure a strong interim injunction application is on recordand argue for urgent hearing.File awrit petitionbefore the High Court seeking direction for time-bound disposal if the lower court is not moving forward.Simultaneously, considercriminal actionfor cheating and criminal intimidation if threats or coercion were involved. Criminal proceedings can sometimes exert necessary pressure.Keep applying forearly hearingunder Section 151 CPC.4. If Parents Pass Away During the Case:If either or both of your parents pass away, theright to sue survivesunder Order 22 of CPC. You, as legal heirs, can be substituted as plaintiffs. However, delay in substitution may abate the suit. So, keep a vigilant eye on your parents' health and be prepared with legal heirship proof to file for substitution immediately if needed.5. Weight of a Will in Favour of Children:If your parents execute aregistered Willin your favour now, itwill not override the already executed registered settlement deed, unless the latter is cancelled. However, it will showtheir clear intentionand could support the claim that the original deed was obtainedwithout understanding and against their will. Such a Will can beused as corroborative evidencein your current civil suit.Immediate Legal Strategy:Injunction Petition– File or press for urgent hearing.Police Complaint– File underIPC 406& 420 for criminal pressure.Writ in High Court– For time-bound disposal.Will Execution– Get a registered Will made to reaffirm their intent.Press for Court Receiver– To manage rental income till final decision.Conclusion:This is aserious case of property fraud involving elderly personsand must be handled both oncivil and criminal fronts. Your counsel must aggressively pursue interim remedies to stop ongoing damage. Delay is often due to passive litigation — you must now push for urgent listing and also explore filing acriminal complaintto escalate the matter.If you need help with drafting a strong interim application or criminal complaint, I can assist you further.

    "question": "T&C for mutual divorce",
    "answer": "Dear Client ,The Rights and Claims in Mutual Divorce under the Hindu LawThe Jewellery presented by your family at the time of your marriage is typically treated as Stridhan, so it is the wife's sole property according to Hindu law. This implies that you have the right to keep all the jewellery presented to you by your family, and that your husband cannot claim any of it in divorce under the Hindu Law. The Gifts that you receive from your in-laws are also generally considered to be Stridhan and they all also solely belong to you. You can retain such gifts unless you have specifically given them to your husband or if you are in joint ownership and the same is established. Costly gifts offered during the marriage are generally considered your personal property if they were offered to you, and you can retain those in the division of assets in the divorce.Furniture and Other AssetsAs you do not desire the furniture, you can keep it out of the mutual settlement in divorce. Property division largely hinges on contribution and ownership. If the furniture is jointly held or in the name of your husband, you can opt out of claiming it.Financial Claims and CompensationYou may claim maintenance or alimony from your husband on the basis of your needs and his ability, particularly because you have suffered mental harassment throughout the marriage. Demanding a certain lump sum amount of ₹1 crore as damages for mental anguish and wasted time is not easy or automatic under the law.Courts look at circumstances such as the length of marriage, mental cruelty, financial condition of both individuals, and adversity endured. You may approach through court processes for alimony or compensation, but the quantum is within the discretion of the court and proof of adversity or cruelty. As you are earning more than your husband, the court would consider this in allocating maintenance, but mental harassment and evidence of adultery can make your demand for compensation much stronger.Property and Financial Settlements under Mutual DivorceSection 13-BHindu Marriage Actmutual divorce involves both parties' consent, including acceptance of financial settlements like alimony and asset division. Property held exclusively by one spouse usually stays with the spouse unless the other spouse is able to establish contribution or joint ownership. Jewellery and gifts that fall under the category of Stridhan are not divisible and stay with the wife.Jewellery Given by In-LawsJewels received from your in-laws are yours (Stridhan) and you are entitled to all rights over them, even after divorce. Your husband cannot ask for it unless proved that it was given or shared jointly or gifted to him.Practical Tips for Friendly SettlementAs your husband is seeking an amicable mutual divorce, negotiate clearly as follows:Keep all jewellery and gifts received by you.Leave out the furniture from the settlement if you do not wish to have it.Negotiate reasonable alimony or compensation according to your mental harassment and economic needs.Put all agreements on paper in the mutual divorce petition so that any future disputes can be avoided.You may also consult a lawyer to prepare a fair settlement agreement and protect your rights while going through the divorce.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "T&C for mutual divorce",
    "answer": "Based on the facts presented, you are entitled to seek and negotiate a comprehensive settlement in amutual consent divorcethat accounts not only for your streedhan and marital contributions but also for the emotional and mental trauma you’ve endured over the course of your marriage. Under Indian law, all jewellery, valuables, and gifts received by you before, during, and after the marriage from your family form part of yourstreedhan— and you have an absolute legal right to reclaim the same, including any selective gifts you may wish to exclude such as furniture. Jewellery and valuables gifted by your in-laws, unless proven to be given jointly to both spouses, also fall under your personal entitlement. In amutual consent divorce, you may demand not just the return of streedhan but also a one-timelump sum alimony/settlementamount — in your case, you can justifiably seek Rs. 1 crore or higher, especially given the 14-year relationship, the betrayal, and the emotional suffering. While there is no strict formula under law for quantifying compensation in mutual divorce, it is entirely valid to raise such a demand, particularly when your husband is eager to dissolve the marriage swiftly and avoid litigation. You should ensure that all your terms — including return of jewellery, gifts, and financial compensation — are clearly recorded in a writtenMutual Divorce Settlement Agreementto be signed before filing the joint petition under Section 13B of theHindu Marriage Act. You may also insert a clause in the agreement that ensures the full and final settlement is executed before the second motion of divorce, to protect your interests. It is advisable that you proceed through a lawyer to ensure your legal rights are protected in the drafting and execution of the agreement.

    "question": "Legal Issue for joining client company",
    "answer": "Hello,1. Non-Compete ClausesWhile Working:Companies can ask employees not to work for competitors or start a similar business while they are still employed. Such conditions are usually valid.After Leaving the Job:In India, asking someone not to work for a competitor after leaving the company is generally not allowed. As per Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, any agreement stopping a person from doing lawful work or business is usually not valid.2. Non-Solicitation ClausesValidity:A company can stop a former employee from contacting or taking away its clients after they leave. Courts in India are more willing to accept such clauses compared to non-compete clauses.Meaning:It means after leaving the job, the employee should not try to get business from the company’s old clients whom they dealt with during their job.3. Legal Rules and ExceptionsGeneral Rule:In India, any agreement that stops a person from working freely is void.Exceptions:There are few cases where restrictions are allowed, like between business partners — for example, not competing with each other after ending the partnership.4. Important Points to RememberReasonable Limits:Restrictions must be fair — for example, for a limited time, in a certain area, and only for specific business activities.Protecting Business Interests:If a company wants to protect its trade secrets, client lists, or confidential information, some restrictions may be accepted by courts.5. Common ExamplesA software company might add a clause that stops an employee from joining their client’s company for some months after resigning.A non-solicitation clause might prevent a former employee from contacting old clients to give the same service through a new company.ConclusionIn your situation your pevious company cannot enforce any rights unless there is an explicit and technical clause in the service agreement that attracts your situation, else you cannot be barred from joining your client company .Hope this helps.Swarupananda NeogiAdvocate, Kolkata2983 Answers6 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Swarupananda Neogi"

    "answer": "You may not that there are no legal restrictions preventing you from joining a client company after resigning from your previous employer, especially if you haven't signed a non-compete agreement.Your previous employer cannot automatically prevent you from joining a client company after your resignation and since been relieved properly by issuing a relieving letter also.The courts generally disapprove of non-competition agreements as limitations on a former employee's right to earn a living.You can issue a reply notice to the company through your lawyer denying their allegations and inform them politely that they cannot restrict your constitutionally protected rights for employment of your choice especially in the absence of any bond or any condition of employment earlier.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Legal Issue for joining client company",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Non-Compete Clauses & Indian LawIn India, any contract that restricts a person from finding employment after leaving an organization is generally void and cannot be enforced under Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.Non-compete clauses apply only while you are working, not once you’ve left the company.Indian courts have time and again held that post-employment restraints-such as not joining a client or competitor-are not legally enforceable.Your Specific SituationYou never signed any non-solicitation or non-compete contract forbidding you from joining the client company; only the appointment letter was signed, and that is not against post-employment opportunities. Your appointment letter clause limits you only from working elsewhere when you are working with your earlier employer, and it is not applicable not post-employment.Unsigned document or company policy cannot be implied and enforced against you at any point in time as stated by the courts in previous similar scenarios.Legal Notice & Threat of Civil SuitThe notice and request to sign an agreement of non-compliance are now legally irrelevant as you are no longer their employee and you did not give your prior consent to such conditions during your tenure.A civil suit or injunction against you for your joining the client company is unlikely to be upheld the in court against you, as such limitations are null and void in India.This should not impact your employment at the client firm or any of the future job that you choose to take up, provided that you have not obtained or used confidential information or trade secrets.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Generally, companies prohibit their former employees from joining their clients for a specific period after termination of their employment, by what is called a 'non compete' clause. As you agreed to be governed by the rules of the company as evident by the clause in your appointment letter, the company may invoke the 'non compete' clause.

    "question": "Legal Issue for joining client company",
    "answer": "Based on the facts shared, here is the professional legal assessment:No Binding Non-Compete Clause Post-Termination:The clause in your appointment letter primarily restricts dual employmentduringthe tenure of your employment. There is no express clause that restricts you from joining the client companyafteryou have been relieved. Furthermore, since you have not signed any separate non-compete or non-solicitation agreement, the employer cannot unilaterally impose post-employment restrictions, especially not retroactively.Company Policies Are Not Binding After Exit:While the appointment letter states that you are governed by company policies, such policies are applicable only while you are in active service. Once you are relieved and issued an experience and relieving letter, those policies no longer bind you, unless they were incorporated in a signed agreement with post-employment obligations.Attempt to Enforce Post-Employment Restrictions Without Agreement Is Legally Weak:Indian courts generally do not enforce post-employment non-compete clauses under Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, as such clauses are considered restraint of trade and hence void. Exceptions apply only in very limited scenarios involving confidentiality or trade secrets, which is not evident in your case.Legal Notice and Civil Suit:Sending a legal notice does not amount to initiation of a legal suit. If the previous employer initiates a civil suit seeking injunction or damages, they must prove:That a legally valid and binding post-employment non-compete agreement exists (which it doesn’t in your case), andThat your joining the client company has caused them direct loss or breach of contract.Given that you were contacted directly by the client company two months after your employment ended, and you did not solicit the client while in employment, the chances of the employer succeeding in a civil suit are very low.Impact on Current Employment:Unless your current employer (the client company) is concerned about litigation or has internal obligations with the former employer, your joining should not be affected. You may, however, inform them of the situation transparently and provide the relieving and experience letters to demonstrate that you left properly.Recommendation:You may respond to the legal notice stating that there is no contractual restriction prohibiting your employment with the client company and that any attempt to restrain your right to livelihood is legally untenable.Maintain a record of all communications.If the former employer initiates any legal proceedings, you may contest it strongly on the above grounds.For any further details feel free to reach out to me at Legal CorridorThanks & RegardsAdv.

    "answer": "Thank you for presenting the facts in such a structured and thoughtful manner. Based on the details shared, here is a professional legal opinion addressing your specific concerns:1. Defamation Risk (Complaint to Industry Association)Legal Position:In India, defamation (civil or criminal) requires the following elements:A false statement,Publication of that statement to a third party,Harm to the reputation of the person/entity.Application to Your Case:If your complaint:Is factually accurate and based on documentary evidence,Is made privately to a relevant authority (i.e., the industry association),Is made in good faith to protect your legal and financial interests,Then it falls within the\"qualified privilege\"defence, especially since the communication is made to a body with a legitimate interest in the matter.Conclusion:As long as your statements aretruthful, supported by documentation, and the communication isnot published publicly or with malice, your exposure to defamation liability is minimal. However, ensure the tone remains objective, not accusatory or inflammatory.2. Litigation Impact (Ongoing Appeal in High Court)Given that:You havealready prevailed in both lower courts, andThe case is currently pending in appeal,filing a complaint with an industry association may nottechnicallyamount to sub judice contempt, but it could lead the opposing party to argue that:You are trying toinfluence parallel forumswhile the matter is pending,You areundermining judicial processorprejudicing the appealby pursuing remedies outside the courtroom.Risk Assessment:The association hasno adjudicatory power; it can only enforce ethical standards, not legal dues.However, a savvy opposing party may attempt to use your complaint to allege harassment or parallel pressure tactics, especially if the association initiates an inquiry.Recommendation:Since your case is already strong and pending before the High Court:Wait for the final verdict, unless the balance sheet misrepresentation presents an imminent fraud on stakeholders or regulators (e.g., under MCA, SEBI, or Companies Act implications).If urgent, phrase your complaint cautiously, stating that thecourt case is pendingand that your intent is tonotifythe association of potential ethical breaches,without prejudice to ongoing litigation.Suggested Wording Revision for Key Risk Reduction:Instead of alleging fraud directly, use phrasing like:“We believe that the continued non-disclosure of this contingent liability, while the matter is sub judice, may not align with the spirit of transparency and accountability expected of members under your Code of Conduct.”This softens the tone and signals that you're not making a final accusation, but raising ethical concerns for review.Conclusion & Strategic Advice:Defamation: Low risk if complaint is factual, confidential, and not malicious.Litigation: Advisable to wait until the High Court appeal concludes, unless you must urgently act to protect stakeholder interests.If you proceed now,include a clear disclaimerthat the matter is pending before the High Court and this complaint is not intended to prejudice judicial outcomes but merely raise professional conduct concerns.Please let me know if you’d like me to refine your draft letter for legal clarity and reduced risk exposure.

    "answer": "To protect your rights and prevent the tenant from later pleading financial incapacity, you may formally notify their Chartered Accountant (Statutory Auditor) in writing, highlighting the ongoing litigation, lease terms mandating 15% annual rent escalation, and the approximate ₹12 crore arrears. Request them to ensure disclosure of this contingent liability in accordance with applicable accounting standards (AS 29 / Ind AS 37). Similarly, you may file a written representation with the concerned Registrar of Companies (RoC), pointing out that the company is continuing in possession post-lease without disclosing material liabilities in their financials, thereby potentially misleading stakeholders in violation of Sections 129 and 134 of the Companies Act, 2013. Both communications should be factual, non-defamatory, and clearly state that they are being made without prejudice to your ongoing litigation before the High Court.Thanks & RegardsAdv.

    "question": "Seeking legal opinion: risks of submitting ethics complaint during ongoing dispute",
    "answer": "Dear Client, kindly note the followingThe Risk of DefamationUnless your complaint is supported by facts and evidence, even if your complaint is accurate, defamation can be claimed in case the tenant alleges that the complaint impinges on their reputation according to the relevant sections. However, truth is an absolute defence for defamation. If all your assertions are verifiable facts, supported by documents, and done in good faith without ill will, the chances of winning defamation suit against you are minimal. Since complaint is submitted only to the industry association (not publicly), the chances of defamation liability are minimized further because the communication is restricted and not published to the general public. However, in order to minimize the risk, ensure the complaint sticks strictly to verifiable facts, avoid speculative or inflammatory language, and keep your tone professional.Impact on Ongoing LitigationFiling an ethics complaint should not legally prejudice your ongoing civil litigation in the High Court, especially since you have won in both lower courts and the complaint concerns related ethical and contractual breaches. Nevertheless, the tenant could attempt to counter that the complaint is intended to intimidate or pressure, an argument that would be raised tactically in the lawsuit. You are wise to advise your lawyer of the complaint so that she/he can plan ahead and dispel any such claims in the appeal. If you wish to stay clear of any impression of interference, you could wait for the court to dispose of the appeal, but it is not necessary.Notification to Chartered Accountant and Registrar of Companies (ROC)Failure to disclose a material liability (Rs 12 Crore arrears) in balance sheets may constitute financial misrepresentation and violation of statutory obligations under the Companies Act, 2013. You can write a formal representation to the Chartered Accountant of the tenant pointing out non-disclosure and seek rectification. At the same time, you can seek action from ROC for non-adherence to accounting and disclosure standards. This action can generate regulatory pressure upon the tenant to disclose the liability appropriately and avoid future claims of inability to pay owing to undisclosed liabilities.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

A registered Gift Deed is preferable over a will in your case because it takes effect immediately, is harder to challenge, and secures your daughter’s rights during your lifetime. While the property is still undivided, your daughter will become a co-owner and may be added as a party to the partition suit, but the Gift Deed will protect her legal interest.

    "question": "Legal Issue for joining client company",
    "answer": "Hello,1. Non-Compete ClausesWhile Working:Companies can ask employees not to work for competitors or start a similar business while they are still employed. Such conditions are usually valid.After Leaving the Job:In India, asking someone not to work for a competitor after leaving the company is generally not allowed. As per Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, any agreement stopping a person from doing lawful work or business is usually not valid.2. Non-Solicitation ClausesValidity:A company can stop a former employee from contacting or taking away its clients after they leave. Courts in India are more willing to accept such clauses compared to non-compete clauses.Meaning:It means after leaving the job, the employee should not try to get business from the company’s old clients whom they dealt with during their job.3. Legal Rules and ExceptionsGeneral Rule:In India, any agreement that stops a person from working freely is void.Exceptions:There are few cases where restrictions are allowed, like between business partners — for example, not competing with each other after ending the partnership.4. Important Points to RememberReasonable Limits:Restrictions must be fair — for example, for a limited time, in a certain area, and only for specific business activities.Protecting Business Interests:If a company wants to protect its trade secrets, client lists, or confidential information, some restrictions may be accepted by courts.5. Common ExamplesA software company might add a clause that stops an employee from joining their client’s company for some months after resigning.A non-solicitation clause might prevent a former employee from contacting old clients to give the same service through a new company.ConclusionIn your situation your pevious company cannot enforce any rights unless there is an explicit and technical clause in the service agreement that attracts your situation, else you cannot be barred from joining your client company .Hope this helps.Swarupananda NeogiAdvocate, Kolkata2983 Answers6 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Swarupananda Neogi"

    "question": "Legal Issue for joining client company",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Non-Compete Clauses & Indian LawIn India, any contract that restricts a person from finding employment after leaving an organization is generally void and cannot be enforced under Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.Non-compete clauses apply only while you are working, not once you’ve left the company.Indian courts have time and again held that post-employment restraints-such as not joining a client or competitor-are not legally enforceable.Your Specific SituationYou never signed any non-solicitation or non-compete contract forbidding you from joining the client company; only the appointment letter was signed, and that is not against post-employment opportunities. Your appointment letter clause limits you only from working elsewhere when you are working with your earlier employer, and it is not applicable not post-employment.Unsigned document or company policy cannot be implied and enforced against you at any point in time as stated by the courts in previous similar scenarios.Legal Notice & Threat of Civil SuitThe notice and request to sign an agreement of non-compliance are now legally irrelevant as you are no longer their employee and you did not give your prior consent to such conditions during your tenure.A civil suit or injunction against you for your joining the client company is unlikely to be upheld the in court against you, as such limitations are null and void in India.This should not impact your employment at the client firm or any of the future job that you choose to take up, provided that you have not obtained or used confidential information or trade secrets.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Generally, companies prohibit their former employees from joining their clients for a specific period after termination of their employment, by what is called a 'non compete' clause. As you agreed to be governed by the rules of the company as evident by the clause in your appointment letter, the company may invoke the 'non compete' clause.

    "context": "Asked 16 days ago in Business Law",
    "question": "Legal Issue for joining client company",
    "answer": "Based on the facts shared, here is the professional legal assessment:No Binding Non-Compete Clause Post-Termination:The clause in your appointment letter primarily restricts dual employmentduringthe tenure of your employment. There is no express clause that restricts you from joining the client companyafteryou have been relieved. Furthermore, since you have not signed any separate non-compete or non-solicitation agreement, the employer cannot unilaterally impose post-employment restrictions, especially not retroactively.Company Policies Are Not Binding After Exit:While the appointment letter states that you are governed by company policies, such policies are applicable only while you are in active service. Once you are relieved and issued an experience and relieving letter, those policies no longer bind you, unless they were incorporated in a signed agreement with post-employment obligations.Attempt to Enforce Post-Employment Restrictions Without Agreement Is Legally Weak:Indian courts generally do not enforce post-employment non-compete clauses under Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, as such clauses are considered restraint of trade and hence void. Exceptions apply only in very limited scenarios involving confidentiality or trade secrets, which is not evident in your case.Legal Notice and Civil Suit:Sending a legal notice does not amount to initiation of a legal suit. If the previous employer initiates a civil suit seeking injunction or damages, they must prove:That a legally valid and binding post-employment non-compete agreement exists (which it doesn’t in your case), andThat your joining the client company has caused them direct loss or breach of contract.Given that you were contacted directly by the client company two months after your employment ended, and you did not solicit the client while in employment, the chances of the employer succeeding in a civil suit are very low.Impact on Current Employment:Unless your current employer (the client company) is concerned about litigation or has internal obligations with the former employer, your joining should not be affected. You may, however, inform them of the situation transparently and provide the relieving and experience letters to demonstrate that you left properly.Recommendation:You may respond to the legal notice stating that there is no contractual restriction prohibiting your employment with the client company and that any attempt to restrain your right to livelihood is legally untenable.Maintain a record of all communications.If the former employer initiates any legal proceedings, you may contest it strongly on the above grounds.For any further details feel free to reach out to me at Legal CorridorThanks & RegardsAdv.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Kindly note the following:1. Character of Life EstateYour mother has a life interest in the property under your late father's Will, whereby she can stay in and utilize the property in her lifetime but cannot transfer or sell it. Upon her death, the property is to go half to you and half to your brother.2. Release of Life InterestYour mother cannot release her life interest without the consent of the other person unless the Will provides otherwise. Nevertheless, if your mother and your brother consent with you, this problem may be resolved between yourselves.3. Actual Steps in SellingA. Relinquishment Deed/Deed of Family ArrangementBoth of your sons (both brothers) and your mother ought to execute a registered family arrangement or relinquishment deed under which the mother duly waives her life interest and accepts both the sons to whom such an interest had existed. This deed should be registered at the sub-registrar office in Coimbatore and proper stamp duty should be paid.B. Court Consent Decree (Recommended)To provide additional legal protection and to provide confidence to the buyer, you can make a joint petition in the local civil court for a consent decree to the effect that all concerned agree to forego the life interest and sell the property to the sons. The court order will render the title clear and unchallenged.C. Sale of PropertyAfter the relinquishment or consent decree is issued, you and your brother (as sole owners) may legally sell the property. Give the purchaser the Will, relinquishment deed, and court order (if secured) to establish clear title.4. Other ConsiderationsHave all documents properly prepared and registered.Verify any outstanding dues or encumbrances on the property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Thank you for presenting the facts in such a structured and thoughtful manner. Based on the details shared, here is a professional legal opinion addressing your specific concerns:1. Defamation Risk (Complaint to Industry Association)Legal Position:In India, defamation (civil or criminal) requires the following elements:A false statement,Publication of that statement to a third party,Harm to the reputation of the person/entity.Application to Your Case:If your complaint:Is factually accurate and based on documentary evidence,Is made privately to a relevant authority (i.e., the industry association),Is made in good faith to protect your legal and financial interests,Then it falls within the\"qualified privilege\"defence, especially since the communication is made to a body with a legitimate interest in the matter.Conclusion:As long as your statements aretruthful, supported by documentation, and the communication isnot published publicly or with malice, your exposure to defamation liability is minimal. However, ensure the tone remains objective, not accusatory or inflammatory.2. Litigation Impact (Ongoing Appeal in High Court)Given that:You havealready prevailed in both lower courts, andThe case is currently pending in appeal,filing a complaint with an industry association may nottechnicallyamount to sub judice contempt, but it could lead the opposing party to argue that:You are trying toinfluence parallel forumswhile the matter is pending,You areundermining judicial processorprejudicing the appealby pursuing remedies outside the courtroom.Risk Assessment:The association hasno adjudicatory power; it can only enforce ethical standards, not legal dues.However, a savvy opposing party may attempt to use your complaint to allege harassment or parallel pressure tactics, especially if the association initiates an inquiry.Recommendation:Since your case is already strong and pending before the High Court:Wait for the final verdict, unless the balance sheet misrepresentation presents an imminent fraud on stakeholders or regulators (e.g., under MCA, SEBI, or Companies Act implications).If urgent, phrase your complaint cautiously, stating that thecourt case is pendingand that your intent is tonotifythe association of potential ethical breaches,without prejudice to ongoing litigation.Suggested Wording Revision for Key Risk Reduction:Instead of alleging fraud directly, use phrasing like:“We believe that the continued non-disclosure of this contingent liability, while the matter is sub judice, may not align with the spirit of transparency and accountability expected of members under your Code of Conduct.”This softens the tone and signals that you're not making a final accusation, but raising ethical concerns for review.Conclusion & Strategic Advice:Defamation: Low risk if complaint is factual, confidential, and not malicious.Litigation: Advisable to wait until the High Court appeal concludes, unless you must urgently act to protect stakeholder interests.If you proceed now,include a clear disclaimerthat the matter is pending before the High Court and this complaint is not intended to prejudice judicial outcomes but merely raise professional conduct concerns.Please let me know if you’d like me to refine your draft letter for legal clarity and reduced risk exposure.

    "answer": "To protect your rights and prevent the tenant from later pleading financial incapacity, you may formally notify their Chartered Accountant (Statutory Auditor) in writing, highlighting the ongoing litigation, lease terms mandating 15% annual rent escalation, and the approximate ₹12 crore arrears. Request them to ensure disclosure of this contingent liability in accordance with applicable accounting standards (AS 29 / Ind AS 37). Similarly, you may file a written representation with the concerned Registrar of Companies (RoC), pointing out that the company is continuing in possession post-lease without disclosing material liabilities in their financials, thereby potentially misleading stakeholders in violation of Sections 129 and 134 of the Companies Act, 2013. Both communications should be factual, non-defamatory, and clearly state that they are being made without prejudice to your ongoing litigation before the High Court.Thanks & RegardsAdv.

    "question": "Seeking legal opinion: risks of submitting ethics complaint during ongoing dispute",
    "answer": "Dear Client, kindly note the followingThe Risk of DefamationUnless your complaint is supported by facts and evidence, even if your complaint is accurate, defamation can be claimed in case the tenant alleges that the complaint impinges on their reputation according to the relevant sections. However, truth is an absolute defence for defamation. If all your assertions are verifiable facts, supported by documents, and done in good faith without ill will, the chances of winning defamation suit against you are minimal. Since complaint is submitted only to the industry association (not publicly), the chances of defamation liability are minimized further because the communication is restricted and not published to the general public. However, in order to minimize the risk, ensure the complaint sticks strictly to verifiable facts, avoid speculative or inflammatory language, and keep your tone professional.Impact on Ongoing LitigationFiling an ethics complaint should not legally prejudice your ongoing civil litigation in the High Court, especially since you have won in both lower courts and the complaint concerns related ethical and contractual breaches. Nevertheless, the tenant could attempt to counter that the complaint is intended to intimidate or pressure, an argument that would be raised tactically in the lawsuit. You are wise to advise your lawyer of the complaint so that she/he can plan ahead and dispel any such claims in the appeal. If you wish to stay clear of any impression of interference, you could wait for the court to dispose of the appeal, but it is not necessary.Notification to Chartered Accountant and Registrar of Companies (ROC)Failure to disclose a material liability (Rs 12 Crore arrears) in balance sheets may constitute financial misrepresentation and violation of statutory obligations under the Companies Act, 2013. You can write a formal representation to the Chartered Accountant of the tenant pointing out non-disclosure and seek rectification. At the same time, you can seek action from ROC for non-adherence to accounting and disclosure standards. This action can generate regulatory pressure upon the tenant to disclose the liability appropriately and avoid future claims of inability to pay owing to undisclosed liabilities.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Awidow with a life estate and no power of alienation in a will cannot typically relinquish her rights.A life estate grants her the right to enjoy the property during her lifetime, but she cannot sell, transfer, or otherwise alienate it to the detriment of the future beneficiaries, who are usually the next in line after her.This is a specific type of ownership with limitations, and she cannot simply give up her right to use the property.A life estate gives the widow the right to possess and enjoy the property (e.g., live in a house, receive income from it) during her lifetime.Upon the widow's death, the property will go to the designated beneficiaries (usually her children or other heirs), not to anyone she might have tried to transfer it to.In most cases, there is no legal mechanism for a life estate holder to simply relinquish their rights and allow the property to revert to the next in line without the consent of the future beneficiaries.Awidow'sinterest has the nature of alife-estate.Her rightsofalienationare restricted.(i) She may mortgage but not sell, gift, or bequeath, for necessity.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Kindly note the following:1. Character of Life EstateYour mother has a life interest in the property under your late father's Will, whereby she can stay in and utilize the property in her lifetime but cannot transfer or sell it. Upon her death, the property is to go half to you and half to your brother.2. Release of Life InterestYour mother cannot release her life interest without the consent of the other person unless the Will provides otherwise. Nevertheless, if your mother and your brother consent with you, this problem may be resolved between yourselves.3. Actual Steps in SellingA. Relinquishment Deed/Deed of Family ArrangementBoth of your sons (both brothers) and your mother ought to execute a registered family arrangement or relinquishment deed under which the mother duly waives her life interest and accepts both the sons to whom such an interest had existed. This deed should be registered at the sub-registrar office in Coimbatore and proper stamp duty should be paid.B. Court Consent Decree (Recommended)To provide additional legal protection and to provide confidence to the buyer, you can make a joint petition in the local civil court for a consent decree to the effect that all concerned agree to forego the life interest and sell the property to the sons. The court order will render the title clear and unchallenged.C. Sale of PropertyAfter the relinquishment or consent decree is issued, you and your brother (as sole owners) may legally sell the property. Give the purchaser the Will, relinquishment deed, and court order (if secured) to establish clear title.4. Other ConsiderationsHave all documents properly prepared and registered.Verify any outstanding dues or encumbrances on the property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Make a police complaint or anticipatory bail plea if you fear false FIRs. Report to your department to safeguard your service.

Delayed allegations are more difficult to establish but not impossible. Your video evidence refuting dowry is important.Counter-Cases: You may choose to lodge counter FIRs for defamation, criminal intimidation, or false complaints if false cases are filed against you or your parents. The evidence such as call recordings, video evidence, neighbor/maid testimony, and any written evidence will also hold value in court.Child Custody: The Courts give utmost importance to children's well-being. Therefore, the custody or visitation rights can be shared. You are adivsed to seek the services of a family lawyer to make custody petitions safeguarding your parental rights.Protecting Older Parents: Parents can be safeguarded by seeking anticipatory bail or making police complaints in case of threats.The courts do not readily agree to arrest of older parents unless on substantial reasons.Mental Health Documentation: Psychiatric counseling and keeping medical records can lend credibility to alleging mental harassment and stress.Divorce Process Under Muslim Law: You may approach divorce through talaq or mutual consent (mubarat).  Judicial intervention can be sought under the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Divorce after 14 years of marriage",
    "answer": "As a 41-year-old Muslim man contemplating divorce after 14 years of marriage, it is prudent to take certain pre-emptive legal measures to safeguard yourself and your elderly parents from potential false allegations. You should begin by documenting all relevant facts in a notarised affidavit stating there was no dowry demand or harassment, supported by the video recording where your wife and father-in-law have admitted the same. Additionally, preserve all digital evidence such as call recordings, messages, and any interactions that indicate emotional abuse or maligning of your character. You may also consider filing a precautionary General Diary (GD) or Non-Cognizable Report (NCR) at the local police station expressing apprehension of false cases. Although dowry ordomestic violencecomplaints can still be filed after 14 years, their evidentiary value is significantly weakened due to the long delay, particularly when parties have cohabited peacefully in the interim. If false cases are initiated, you are entitled to file counter-complaints under Sections 182 and 211 of the IPC and may pursue a defamation case. To protect your children’s interests, it is advisable to initiate a custody petition under the Guardians and Wards Act and maintain a record of your active involvement in their upbringing. Given your concern about the mental toll of the marriage, consulting a psychiatrist to document stress may also support your case, particularly if false mental harassment allegations are made. Lastly, you must keep your elderly parents distanced from marital conflicts and avoid any direct or volatile communication with your wife to shield them from unnecessary legal complications. Seeking timely legal counsel and maintaining calm, factual communication will help you handle this situation ethically and lawfully.Aman VermaAdvocate, Delhi400 AnswersTalk to Advocate Aman Verma"

A registered Gift Deed is preferable over a will in your case because it takes effect immediately, is harder to challenge, and secures your daughter’s rights during your lifetime. While the property is still undivided, your daughter will become a co-owner and may be added as a party to the partition suit, but the Gift Deed will protect her legal interest.

It is better to apprise the court of the Gift Deed and make your younger daughter a party to the suit so that this issue could be prevented in the future.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Character of Life EstateYour mother has a life interest in the property under your late father's Will, whereby she can stay in and utilize the property in her lifetime but cannot transfer or sell it. Upon her death, the property is to go half to you and half to your brother.2. Release of Life InterestYour mother cannot release her life interest without the consent of the other person unless the Will provides otherwise. Nevertheless, if your mother and your brother consent with you, this problem may be resolved between yourselves.3. Actual Steps in SellingA. Relinquishment Deed/Deed of Family ArrangementBoth of your sons (both brothers) and your mother ought to execute a registered family arrangement or relinquishment deed under which the mother duly waives her life interest and accepts both the sons to whom such an interest had existed. This deed should be registered at the sub-registrar office in Coimbatore and proper stamp duty should be paid.B. Court Consent Decree (Recommended)To provide additional legal protection and to provide confidence to the buyer, you can make a joint petition in the local civil court for a consent decree to the effect that all concerned agree to forego the life interest and sell the property to the sons. The court order will render the title clear and unchallenged.C. Sale of PropertyAfter the relinquishment or consent decree is issued, you and your brother (as sole owners) may legally sell the property. Give the purchaser the Will, relinquishment deed, and court order (if secured) to establish clear title.4. Other ConsiderationsHave all documents properly prepared and registered.Verify any outstanding dues or encumbrances on the property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Will divorce/cruelty petition affect govt job joining (SSC MTS)?In most cases,a pending divorce case or police CSRs (Community Service Register entries) based on false claims(not FIRs or chargesheets)do not automatically disqualify a candidatefrom government jobs like SSC MTS. However:Ifno criminal charges (FIR/chargesheet/conviction)are filed, it isunlikely to impactjoining.Your cousin shouldcooperate fullywith verification, submitcourt documentsshowing the matter is sub judice, andclarify that no conviction exists.Keepcertified copiesof the divorce petition and court status.If CSRs did not escalate to FIRs, state this clearly —CSRs are not criminal records.Honesty during verificationand clear documentation will help.Key Point:Only a serious pending criminal case (with charges filed or conviction) may impact government job eligibility.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Divorce Case and CSRs Have No Bearing on SSC MTS RecruitmentCases of divorce pending or CSRs on the basis of unsubstantiated allegations do not disqualify candidates for SSC MTS or other government employment. Convictions in criminal cases alone (e.g., FIRs resulting in chargesheets) may affect employment. CSRs are loose police entries and have no legal bearing unless they are transformed into an FIR.During Document Verification give only necessary documents (educational certificates, caste/age proofs, etc.). Do not give information about the divorce case or CSRs unless asked specifically..You can take the help of a lawyer and state that the divorce case is a civil case not related to employment eligibility. CSRs are non-judicial documents and are not criminal charges with the help of precedents.Protection Against False Allegations : In case the department unjustifiably postpones joining because of the cases:Petition a writ in the High Court under Article 226 to invoke the right to employment.

    "question": "Wife family threatening us",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,1.You Cannot Be Compelled to Visit VizagNo one can compel you legally to visit Vizag for a family settlement. Any discussion regarding settlement can and should take place in a neutral location, considering that both of you are employed in Bangalore.Police ThreatsYour wife's relatives cannot use the police to make you separate or meet at Vizag. Police will only act if there is a valid criminal complaint (likedomestic violenceor dowry harassment). If you are visited or called by the police, be cooperative but do not sign any statement under duress. You can ask that any investigation be done in Bangalore, where both of you stay for work.Alternatives to SeparationIn case both want to separate, you can go for:Mutual Consent Divorce: It is the quickest and least confrontational option. Both have to agree, and you can file in Bangalore Family Court as both are employed there.Lok Adalat: It is a forum for alternative dispute resolution where both can settle things amicably, such as terms of separation, maintenance, and property. This too can be achieved in Bangalore.If She Gives a Police CaseIf your wife gives a complaint (e.g.,Section 498AIPC for cruelty ordomestic violence), you will be summoned for inquiry. See a local lawyer at once. Don't take police notices lightly. You have the right to apply for anticipatory bail if you are in fear of arrest.5. Maintenance and Financial ImplicationsAs your wife is earning (SBI employee, ₹40,000/month), her claim for maintenance will be restricted. But if she can establish that she requires more for her way of life, the court may direct some maintenance, but it will be reasonable given her own earnings and your responsibilities.6. Your Mother's RightsAs a single parent child, you are legally and ethically bound to take care of your mother. Indian law does not compel a husband to abandon his dependent parent unless there is established cruelty or harassment to the wife.Settlement DiscussionsDemand that any settlement or mediation be held in Bangalore, preferably in the Family Court or with a formal mediator. Never agree to anything under threat or coercion.8. DocumentationMaintain a record of all correspondence (messages, emails, call records) and incidents, as these can be helpful if the issue has to go to court.Immediate ActionDon't panic or respond to threats.Get professional advice from a local family lawyer in Bangalore for individualized legal approach.Reply to any communication from the police through your attorney.If you want to salvage the marriage, take professional marriage counseling or mediation, but only if both are agreeable.In case of unavoidable separation, elaborate on consent divorce or settlement in the Lok Adalat in BangaloreAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "You Cannot Be Forced to Go to Vizag: You are not legally obligated to travel to Vizag or attend any police mediation there. Both of you are working in Bengaluru, andany discussion or mediation should ideally take place where both parties reside and work. Threats of police action to force your travel arenot legally tenable.Police Cannot Compel Separation or Settlement: The police can only facilitate mediation through theMahila Police StationorFamily Counselling Centre. Theycannot force separation, divorce, or threaten arrestwithout a valid FIR and proper inquiry.No need to panicif threats are being made — such threats are common but largely hollow unless a formal complaint is filed.On Threat of Police Case (e.g., 498A,Domestic Violence, etc.): If they file a complaint, you will receive anotice under Section 41A CrPCor be called for counselling. It is essential toconsult a local lawyer in Bengaluru immediatelyif you receive any such notice. Keep all communication records and proof of your side (messages, travel history, her refusal to join, etc.).On Separation and Divorce: If she is unwilling to live with you and is adamant about separation:You may considerfiling forRestitution of Conjugal Rights(RCR)under Section 9 of theHindu Marriage Actto legally document that she deserted you without valid reason.Alternatively, if reconciliation is not possible, and both parties agree, you can mutually file fordivorce by mutual consentunder Section 13B. This would require a 6-month cooling-off period.If they go toLok Adalat, understand it is a voluntary forum. Youcan decline participationor attend with a lawyer.Alimony & Maintenance: Since she is earning ₹40,000 per month as a bank employee,her claim for maintenance is weak, especially given the short duration of cohabitation. Courts usually consider financial independence, and your limited cohabitation (barely any marital life) may work in your favour.Take Preventive Steps:Avoid further direct interaction with her relatives.Donot sign any documents or settlement terms without legal advice.If threats escalate, consider filing aNC complaint (non-cognizable report)in your local police station for record-keeping.Next Steps:Engage a family lawyer in Bengaluru to prepare for any legal notices.Gather all proof (messages, her refusal to stay, threats, etc.).Respond legally only after a formal complaint or notice is served.You are well within your rights to expect the dispute to be resolved in Bengaluru and protect your elderly mother’s care and your dignity.Thanks & Regards,Adv.

Clearly state that your last working day was January 9th, and that the mention of February 28th as your exit date is incorrect. Provide documentation, such as your resignation email, any payment records, or any communication regarding your notice period and payment for unserved days.Escalation: If HR refuses to make the change, escalate the issue to a higher authority within the company, such as the manager or senior HR personnel. Explain that the incorrect exit date is affecting your future employment and could have legal implications.Legal Notice: If the issue remains unresolved, you can send a legal notice through a lawyer. In the notice, ask the company to correct the relieving letter to reflect your actual last working day. The notice should also include a deadline for action, typically 7-14 days.Labor Commissioner: As a last resort, you can file a complaint with the local labor commissioner if the issue is not resolved amicably. The labor commissioner may mediate or intervene to ensure that your relieving letter is corrected in accordance with the actual facts.Legal Basis:As per labor laws, employers are obligated to provide accurate records and documents related to employment.

    "answer": "Yes, in your case, the act of the tenant returning the keys and your acceptance clearly indicates surrender of possession and termination of tenancy. This is supported by written WhatsApp messages confirming key return, and the refund of the deposit further establishes mutual agreement to end the tenancy.Once the key was returned and deposit settled,the tenant no longer had legal possession. His subsequent act of entering and placing a new lock without permissioncan amount to criminal trespassunder IPC Section 441, as he forcefully re-entered a property he no longer had rights to.Even though the TNRRRLT Act isn’t applicable due to non-registration, general principles of tenancy and possession under theTransfer of Property ActandIndian Penal Codestill apply in your favor. You can file a police complaint for trespassing and unlawful interference in possession."

Should Nikhil appear at Police Station without a formal court notice or summons?No, he isnot legally boundto appear merely based on aphone call, especially if:Nonotice under Section 41A CrPChas been served, andNosummons or warranthas been issued by a competent court.However, to avoid escalation, Nikhil may:Send aformal communication via an advocateto the police expressing willingness to cooperate, andSeek details of any pending court proceedings.2. Does the 498A case remain valid after the mutual divorce decree?Yes, the498A case remains valid, unless:It isformally quashed by a High Court, orThe complainantwithdraws her allegations and files compromise affidavit, followed byquashing under Section482 CrPC.Mutual divorce doesnot automatically quash criminal proceedings. Criminal law is separate and continues until:Chargesheet is not filed and FIR is quashed, orTrial ends in acquittal/conviction, orThe case is compounded (in compoundable offences — 498A isnon-compoundablewithout High Court intervention).3. Can he file a quashing petition under Section482 CrPCin the Supreme Court?No, not directly.Quashing underSection482 CrPCliesonly before the High Court, not the Supreme Court. For Nikhil:Since the FIR is inLucknow, he must filea petition under Section482 CrPCbefore the Allahabad High Court (Lucknow Bench).Grounds for Quashing:Long delay without chargesheet (usually 3+ years is a strong ground).Mutual divorce and settlement.Abuse of legal process.No specific allegations against in-laws (often used for quashing their names).📝 He can submit:Divorce decree,Alimony payment proof,Affidavit of compromise (if obtained from wife),FIR copy,Proof of delay/lack of chargesheet.4. Can he file a defamation case against the wife?Technically yes, butpractically risky.A case forcriminal defamation (Section 499 IPC)can be initiatedif:He can prove thatfalse, malicious allegationswere madeknowingly,He and his family suffered reputational damage,The allegations werepublished or communicated to third parties (e.g., in court or police statements).But:Indian courts are cautious in allowing defamation cases against estranged spouses unless malice and falsehood arecrystal clear.Since the matter ended in mutual divorce, courts may see it as asettled personal disputeand not support further litigation unless fresh defamatory action occurs.Practical advice: Wait until the FIR is quashed. Then, if she continues to spread false allegations, defamation orcivil suit for damagescould be considered.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighcourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "answer": "Appearance at Police Station or Court: Since your friend has not received any court summons or official notice, there isno legal obligationto appear at the police station based solely on a phone call from someone claiming to be aPeshkar. Such unofficial communications should be approached with caution. Your friend shouldinsist on a written notice or summonthrough proper legal channels. If the case is still under investigation (as no chargesheet has been filed), it is advisable to verify the current status of the FIR with the concerned police station through a lawyer.Validity of 498A Case After Divorce: Yes, the criminal case underSection 498AIPC and 3/4 of theDowry Prohibition Actremains valideven after mutual divorce. A divorce decree does not automatically nullify or close criminal proceedings unless the FIR is quashed by the High Court or the complainant formally withdraws her complaint and the court records the compromise.Filing for Quashing Under Section482 CrPC: Your friendcannot file the petition for quashing directly in the Supreme Court. Such petitions underSection482 CrPCmust be filed before the concerned High Courthaving jurisdiction over the police station where the FIR was lodged — in this case, likely theLucknow Bench of Allahabad High Court. If the wife is willing to give a no-objection statement or an affidavit of compromise, it strengthens the quashing plea considerably.Filing a Defamation Case: While technically your friend may consider filing adefamation case under Section 499 IPC, courts are cautious in such matters post matrimonial disputes, especially when mutual divorce has already been granted. However, if it can be shown that the false criminal complaint caused proven loss of reputation, financial loss, and continued harassment without basis, he may proceed, but such cases are difficult and must be supported by strong evidence of malice and falsity.Your friend should consult a local advocate at Lucknow for initiating the Section482 CrPCproceedings and ensuring the matter is brought to a legal closure.Thanks & RegardsAdv.

    "question": "Wife family threatening us",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,1.You Cannot Be Compelled to Visit VizagNo one can compel you legally to visit Vizag for a family settlement. Any discussion regarding settlement can and should take place in a neutral location, considering that both of you are employed in Bangalore.Police ThreatsYour wife's relatives cannot use the police to make you separate or meet at Vizag. Police will only act if there is a valid criminal complaint (likedomestic violenceor dowry harassment). If you are visited or called by the police, be cooperative but do not sign any statement under duress. You can ask that any investigation be done in Bangalore, where both of you stay for work.Alternatives to SeparationIn case both want to separate, you can go for:Mutual Consent Divorce: It is the quickest and least confrontational option. Both have to agree, and you can file in Bangalore Family Court as both are employed there.Lok Adalat: It is a forum for alternative dispute resolution where both can settle things amicably, such as terms of separation, maintenance, and property. This too can be achieved in Bangalore.If She Gives a Police CaseIf your wife gives a complaint (e.g.,Section 498AIPC for cruelty ordomestic violence), you will be summoned for inquiry. See a local lawyer at once. Don't take police notices lightly. You have the right to apply for anticipatory bail if you are in fear of arrest.5. Maintenance and Financial ImplicationsAs your wife is earning (SBI employee, ₹40,000/month), her claim for maintenance will be restricted. But if she can establish that she requires more for her way of life, the court may direct some maintenance, but it will be reasonable given her own earnings and your responsibilities.6. Your Mother's RightsAs a single parent child, you are legally and ethically bound to take care of your mother. Indian law does not compel a husband to abandon his dependent parent unless there is established cruelty or harassment to the wife.Settlement DiscussionsDemand that any settlement or mediation be held in Bangalore, preferably in the Family Court or with a formal mediator. Never agree to anything under threat or coercion.8. DocumentationMaintain a record of all correspondence (messages, emails, call records) and incidents, as these can be helpful if the issue has to go to court.Immediate ActionDon't panic or respond to threats.Get professional advice from a local family lawyer in Bangalore for individualized legal approach.Reply to any communication from the police through your attorney.If you want to salvage the marriage, take professional marriage counseling or mediation, but only if both are agreeable.In case of unavoidable separation, elaborate on consent divorce or settlement in the Lok Adalat in BangaloreAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "You Cannot Be Forced to Go to Vizag: You are not legally obligated to travel to Vizag or attend any police mediation there. Both of you are working in Bengaluru, andany discussion or mediation should ideally take place where both parties reside and work. Threats of police action to force your travel arenot legally tenable.Police Cannot Compel Separation or Settlement: The police can only facilitate mediation through theMahila Police StationorFamily Counselling Centre. Theycannot force separation, divorce, or threaten arrestwithout a valid FIR and proper inquiry.No need to panicif threats are being made — such threats are common but largely hollow unless a formal complaint is filed.On Threat of Police Case (e.g., 498A,Domestic Violence, etc.): If they file a complaint, you will receive anotice under Section 41A CrPCor be called for counselling. It is essential toconsult a local lawyer in Bengaluru immediatelyif you receive any such notice. Keep all communication records and proof of your side (messages, travel history, her refusal to join, etc.).On Separation and Divorce: If she is unwilling to live with you and is adamant about separation:You may considerfiling forRestitution of Conjugal Rights(RCR)under Section 9 of theHindu Marriage Actto legally document that she deserted you without valid reason.Alternatively, if reconciliation is not possible, and both parties agree, you can mutually file fordivorce by mutual consentunder Section 13B. This would require a 6-month cooling-off period.If they go toLok Adalat, understand it is a voluntary forum. Youcan decline participationor attend with a lawyer.Alimony & Maintenance: Since she is earning ₹40,000 per month as a bank employee,her claim for maintenance is weak, especially given the short duration of cohabitation. Courts usually consider financial independence, and your limited cohabitation (barely any marital life) may work in your favour.Take Preventive Steps:Avoid further direct interaction with her relatives.Donot sign any documents or settlement terms without legal advice.If threats escalate, consider filing aNC complaint (non-cognizable report)in your local police station for record-keeping.Next Steps:Engage a family lawyer in Bengaluru to prepare for any legal notices.Gather all proof (messages, her refusal to stay, threats, etc.).Respond legally only after a formal complaint or notice is served.You are well within your rights to expect the dispute to be resolved in Bengaluru and protect your elderly mother’s care and your dignity.Thanks & Regards,Adv.

    "answer": "Yes, as a Class I heir under Hindu law, you are legally entitled to your 1/4th undivided share in your late husband’s self-acquired property and can gift this share to your youngest daughter, especially since no stay order has been passed in the ongoing partition suit. A registered Gift Deed is preferable over a will in your case because it takes effect immediately, is harder to challenge, and secures your daughter’s rights during your lifetime. While the property is still undivided, your daughter will become a co-owner and may be added as a party to the partition suit, but the Gift Deed will protect her legal interest. Ensure the gift deed clearly mentions your share and the pending litigation to avoid complications."

This would help protect her interest now itself, even amidst the pending suit.Will: Effective only from your death, which can be challenged or put on hold by the court and thus does not afford immediate protection.Risks for your youngest daughter: As the partition suit is pending, her rights as your share transferee may be challenged by the other parties.But once the Gift Deed is registered, her title over your share is secure, and she may be made a party to the suit in order to safeguard her interest.

It can be difficult to enforce legally later.Occupancy Certificate (OC): Not normally affected if the wall is non-load bearing and builder acts as per norms, but absence of municipal sanction may lead to issues.Local Approvals & Society Consent: Obtain required NOCs from local authorities and apartment association to prevent disputes or fines.Resale & Financing: Future purchasers or banks can raise an eyebrow over the variation; have all documents (builder's acknowledgement, architect's certificate) ready to establish the alteration.Recommendation: Demand written approval, take architect's certificate, acquire society and municipal sanctions, and maintain very minute records of the altered layout to escape future judicial or practical disputes.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Securing my undivided share through gift deed or will: a mother’s rightful choice",
    "answer": "Yes, as a Class I heir under Hindu law, you are legally entitled to your 1/4th undivided share in your late husband’s self-acquired property and can gift this share to your youngest daughter, especially since no stay order has been passed in the ongoing partition suit. A registered Gift Deed is preferable over a will in your case because it takes effect immediately, is harder to challenge, and secures your daughter’s rights during your lifetime. While the property is still undivided, your daughter will become a co-owner and may be added as a party to the partition suit, but the Gift Deed will protect her legal interest. Ensure the gift deed clearly mentions your share and the pending litigation to avoid complications."

This would help protect her interest now itself, even amidst the pending suit.Will: Effective only from your death, which can be challenged or put on hold by the court and thus does not afford immediate protection.Risks for your youngest daughter: As the partition suit is pending, her rights as your share transferee may be challenged by the other parties.But once the Gift Deed is registered, her title over your share is secure, and she may be made a party to the suit in order to safeguard her interest. It is better to apprise the court of the Gift Deed and make your younger daughter a party to the suit so that this issue could be prevented in the future.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Should Nikhil appear at Police Station without a formal court notice or summons?No, he isnot legally boundto appear merely based on aphone call, especially if:Nonotice under Section 41A CrPChas been served, andNosummons or warranthas been issued by a competent court.However, to avoid escalation, Nikhil may:Send aformal communication via an advocateto the police expressing willingness to cooperate, andSeek details of any pending court proceedings.2. Does the 498A case remain valid after the mutual divorce decree?Yes, the498A case remains valid, unless:It isformally quashed by a High Court, orThe complainantwithdraws her allegations and files compromise affidavit, followed byquashing under Section482 CrPC.Mutual divorce doesnot automatically quash criminal proceedings. Criminal law is separate and continues until:Chargesheet is not filed and FIR is quashed, orTrial ends in acquittal/conviction, orThe case is compounded (in compoundable offences — 498A isnon-compoundablewithout High Court intervention).3. Can he file a quashing petition under Section482 CrPCin the Supreme Court?No, not directly.Quashing underSection482 CrPCliesonly before the High Court, not the Supreme Court. For Nikhil:Since the FIR is inLucknow, he must filea petition under Section482 CrPCbefore the Allahabad High Court (Lucknow Bench).Grounds for Quashing:Long delay without chargesheet (usually 3+ years is a strong ground).Mutual divorce and settlement.Abuse of legal process.No specific allegations against in-laws (often used for quashing their names).📝 He can submit:Divorce decree,Alimony payment proof,Affidavit of compromise (if obtained from wife),FIR copy,Proof of delay/lack of chargesheet.4. Can he file a defamation case against the wife?Technically yes, butpractically risky.A case forcriminal defamation (Section 499 IPC)can be initiatedif:He can prove thatfalse, malicious allegationswere madeknowingly,He and his family suffered reputational damage,The allegations werepublished or communicated to third parties (e.g., in court or police statements).But:Indian courts are cautious in allowing defamation cases against estranged spouses unless malice and falsehood arecrystal clear.Since the matter ended in mutual divorce, courts may see it as asettled personal disputeand not support further litigation unless fresh defamatory action occurs.Practical advice: Wait until the FIR is quashed. Then, if she continues to spread false allegations, defamation orcivil suit for damagescould be considered.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighcourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "answer": "Appearance at Police Station or Court: Since your friend has not received any court summons or official notice, there isno legal obligationto appear at the police station based solely on a phone call from someone claiming to be aPeshkar. Such unofficial communications should be approached with caution. Your friend shouldinsist on a written notice or summonthrough proper legal channels. If the case is still under investigation (as no chargesheet has been filed), it is advisable to verify the current status of the FIR with the concerned police station through a lawyer.Validity of 498A Case After Divorce: Yes, the criminal case underSection 498AIPC and 3/4 of theDowry Prohibition Actremains valideven after mutual divorce. A divorce decree does not automatically nullify or close criminal proceedings unless the FIR is quashed by the High Court or the complainant formally withdraws her complaint and the court records the compromise.Filing for Quashing Under Section482 CrPC: Your friendcannot file the petition for quashing directly in the Supreme Court. Such petitions underSection482 CrPCmust be filed before the concerned High Courthaving jurisdiction over the police station where the FIR was lodged — in this case, likely theLucknow Bench of Allahabad High Court. If the wife is willing to give a no-objection statement or an affidavit of compromise, it strengthens the quashing plea considerably.Filing a Defamation Case: While technically your friend may consider filing adefamation case under Section 499 IPC, courts are cautious in such matters post matrimonial disputes, especially when mutual divorce has already been granted. However, if it can be shown that the false criminal complaint caused proven loss of reputation, financial loss, and continued harassment without basis, he may proceed, but such cases are difficult and must be supported by strong evidence of malice and falsity.Your friend should consult a local advocate at Lucknow for initiating the Section482 CrPCproceedings and ensuring the matter is brought to a legal closure.Thanks & RegardsAdv.

An email or written confirmation by the builder is useful however, it is to be noted that that is still weaker than having the alteration in the sale agreement or in the deed. It can be difficult to enforce legally later.Occupancy Certificate (OC): Not normally affected if the wall is non-load bearing and builder acts as per norms, but absence of municipal sanction may lead to issues.Local Approvals & Society Consent: Obtain required NOCs from local authorities and apartment association to prevent disputes or fines.Resale & Financing: Future purchasers or banks can raise an eyebrow over the variation; have all documents (builder's acknowledgement, architect's certificate) ready to establish the alteration.Recommendation: Demand written approval, take architect's certificate, acquire society and municipal sanctions, and maintain very minute records of the altered layout to escape future judicial or practical disputes.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Does the act of tenant returning the keys and landlord accepting the key end tenancy",
    "answer": "Yes, in your case, the act of the tenant returning the keys and your acceptance clearly indicates surrender of possession and termination of tenancy. This is supported by written WhatsApp messages confirming key return, and the refund of the deposit further establishes mutual agreement to end the tenancy.Once the key was returned and deposit settled,the tenant no longer had legal possession. His subsequent act of entering and placing a new lock without permissioncan amount to criminal trespassunder IPC Section 441, as he forcefully re-entered a property he no longer had rights to.Even though the TNRRRLT Act isn’t applicable due to non-registration, general principles of tenancy and possession under theTransfer of Property ActandIndian Penal Codestill apply in your favor. You can file a police complaint for trespassing and unlawful interference in possession."

    "answer": "Dear Client,You are advised to gather and keep all evidence (video recordings, call records) with no dowry or harassment. Make a police complaint or anticipatory bail plea if you fear false FIRs. Report to your department to safeguard your service. It is advised that for you to not confront and leave it to your lawyer to handle communications.Dowry harassment or cruelty cases can be instituted at any time during marriage, but courts give weight to long peaceful cohabitation. Delayed allegations are more difficult to establish but not impossible. Your video evidence refuting dowry is important.Counter-Cases: You may choose to lodge counter FIRs for defamation, criminal intimidation, or false complaints if false cases are filed against you or your parents. The evidence such as call recordings, video evidence, neighbor/maid testimony, and any written evidence will also hold value in court.Child Custody: The Courts give utmost importance to children's well-being. Therefore, the custody or visitation rights can be shared. You are adivsed to seek the services of a family lawyer to make custody petitions safeguarding your parental rights.Protecting Older Parents: Parents can be safeguarded by seeking anticipatory bail or making police complaints in case of threats.The courts do not readily agree to arrest of older parents unless on substantial reasons.Mental Health Documentation: Psychiatric counseling and keeping medical records can lend credibility to alleging mental harassment and stress.Divorce Process Under Muslim Law: You may approach divorce through talaq or mutual consent (mubarat).  Judicial intervention can be sought under the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Divorce after 14 years of marriage",
    "answer": "As a 41-year-old Muslim man contemplating divorce after 14 years of marriage, it is prudent to take certain pre-emptive legal measures to safeguard yourself and your elderly parents from potential false allegations. You should begin by documenting all relevant facts in a notarised affidavit stating there was no dowry demand or harassment, supported by the video recording where your wife and father-in-law have admitted the same. Additionally, preserve all digital evidence such as call recordings, messages, and any interactions that indicate emotional abuse or maligning of your character. You may also consider filing a precautionary General Diary (GD) or Non-Cognizable Report (NCR) at the local police station expressing apprehension of false cases. Although dowry ordomestic violencecomplaints can still be filed after 14 years, their evidentiary value is significantly weakened due to the long delay, particularly when parties have cohabited peacefully in the interim. If false cases are initiated, you are entitled to file counter-complaints under Sections 182 and 211 of the IPC and may pursue a defamation case. To protect your children’s interests, it is advisable to initiate a custody petition under the Guardians and Wards Act and maintain a record of your active involvement in their upbringing. Given your concern about the mental toll of the marriage, consulting a psychiatrist to document stress may also support your case, particularly if false mental harassment allegations are made. Lastly, you must keep your elderly parents distanced from marital conflicts and avoid any direct or volatile communication with your wife to shield them from unnecessary legal complications. Seeking timely legal counsel and maintaining calm, factual communication will help you handle this situation ethically and lawfully.Aman VermaAdvocate, Delhi400 AnswersTalk to Advocate Aman Verma"

Does the 498A case remain valid after the mutual divorce decree?Yes, the498A case remains valid, unless:It isformally quashed by a High Court, orThe complainantwithdraws her allegations and files compromise affidavit, followed byquashing under Section482 CrPC.Mutual divorce doesnot automatically quash criminal proceedings. Criminal law is separate and continues until:Chargesheet is not filed and FIR is quashed, orTrial ends in acquittal/conviction, orThe case is compounded (in compoundable offences — 498A isnon-compoundablewithout High Court intervention).3. Can he file a quashing petition under Section482 CrPCin the Supreme Court?No, not directly.Quashing underSection482 CrPCliesonly before the High Court, not the Supreme Court. For Nikhil:Since the FIR is inLucknow, he must filea petition under Section482 CrPCbefore the Allahabad High Court (Lucknow Bench).Grounds for Quashing:Long delay without chargesheet (usually 3+ years is a strong ground).Mutual divorce and settlement.Abuse of legal process.No specific allegations against in-laws (often used for quashing their names).📝 He can submit:Divorce decree,Alimony payment proof,Affidavit of compromise (if obtained from wife),FIR copy,Proof of delay/lack of chargesheet.4. Can he file a defamation case against the wife?Technically yes, butpractically risky.A case forcriminal defamation (Section 499 IPC)can be initiatedif:He can prove thatfalse, malicious allegationswere madeknowingly,He and his family suffered reputational damage,The allegations werepublished or communicated to third parties (e.g., in court or police statements).But:Indian courts are cautious in allowing defamation cases against estranged spouses unless malice and falsehood arecrystal clear.Since the matter ended in mutual divorce, courts may see it as asettled personal disputeand not support further litigation unless fresh defamatory action occurs.Practical advice: Wait until the FIR is quashed. Then, if she continues to spread false allegations, defamation orcivil suit for damagescould be considered.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighcourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "question": "Withdrawal of false criminal cases 498A and 3/4 DP Act after getting mutual divorce",
    "answer": "Appearance at Police Station or Court: Since your friend has not received any court summons or official notice, there isno legal obligationto appear at the police station based solely on a phone call from someone claiming to be aPeshkar. Such unofficial communications should be approached with caution. Your friend shouldinsist on a written notice or summonthrough proper legal channels. If the case is still under investigation (as no chargesheet has been filed), it is advisable to verify the current status of the FIR with the concerned police station through a lawyer.Validity of 498A Case After Divorce: Yes, the criminal case underSection 498AIPC and 3/4 of theDowry Prohibition Actremains valideven after mutual divorce. A divorce decree does not automatically nullify or close criminal proceedings unless the FIR is quashed by the High Court or the complainant formally withdraws her complaint and the court records the compromise.Filing for Quashing Under Section482 CrPC: Your friendcannot file the petition for quashing directly in the Supreme Court. Such petitions underSection482 CrPCmust be filed before the concerned High Courthaving jurisdiction over the police station where the FIR was lodged — in this case, likely theLucknow Bench of Allahabad High Court. If the wife is willing to give a no-objection statement or an affidavit of compromise, it strengthens the quashing plea considerably.Filing a Defamation Case: While technically your friend may consider filing adefamation case under Section 499 IPC, courts are cautious in such matters post matrimonial disputes, especially when mutual divorce has already been granted. However, if it can be shown that the false criminal complaint caused proven loss of reputation, financial loss, and continued harassment without basis, he may proceed, but such cases are difficult and must be supported by strong evidence of malice and falsity.Your friend should consult a local advocate at Lucknow for initiating the Section482 CrPCproceedings and ensuring the matter is brought to a legal closure.Thanks & RegardsAdv.

    "question": "Wife family threatening us",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,1.You Cannot Be Compelled to Visit VizagNo one can compel you legally to visit Vizag for a family settlement. Any discussion regarding settlement can and should take place in a neutral location, considering that both of you are employed in Bangalore.Police ThreatsYour wife's relatives cannot use the police to make you separate or meet at Vizag. Police will only act if there is a valid criminal complaint (likedomestic violenceor dowry harassment). If you are visited or called by the police, be cooperative but do not sign any statement under duress. You can ask that any investigation be done in Bangalore, where both of you stay for work.Alternatives to SeparationIn case both want to separate, you can go for:Mutual Consent Divorce: It is the quickest and least confrontational option. Both have to agree, and you can file in Bangalore Family Court as both are employed there.Lok Adalat: It is a forum for alternative dispute resolution where both can settle things amicably, such as terms of separation, maintenance, and property. This too can be achieved in Bangalore.If She Gives a Police CaseIf your wife gives a complaint (e.g.,Section 498AIPC for cruelty ordomestic violence), you will be summoned for inquiry. See a local lawyer at once. Don't take police notices lightly. You have the right to apply for anticipatory bail if you are in fear of arrest.5. Maintenance and Financial ImplicationsAs your wife is earning (SBI employee, ₹40,000/month), her claim for maintenance will be restricted. But if she can establish that she requires more for her way of life, the court may direct some maintenance, but it will be reasonable given her own earnings and your responsibilities.6. Your Mother's RightsAs a single parent child, you are legally and ethically bound to take care of your mother. Indian law does not compel a husband to abandon his dependent parent unless there is established cruelty or harassment to the wife.Settlement DiscussionsDemand that any settlement or mediation be held in Bangalore, preferably in the Family Court or with a formal mediator. Never agree to anything under threat or coercion.8. DocumentationMaintain a record of all correspondence (messages, emails, call records) and incidents, as these can be helpful if the issue has to go to court.Immediate ActionDon't panic or respond to threats.Get professional advice from a local family lawyer in Bangalore for individualized legal approach.Reply to any communication from the police through your attorney.If you want to salvage the marriage, take professional marriage counseling or mediation, but only if both are agreeable.In case of unavoidable separation, elaborate on consent divorce or settlement in the Lok Adalat in BangaloreAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "You Cannot Be Forced to Go to Vizag: You are not legally obligated to travel to Vizag or attend any police mediation there. Both of you are working in Bengaluru, andany discussion or mediation should ideally take place where both parties reside and work. Threats of police action to force your travel arenot legally tenable.Police Cannot Compel Separation or Settlement: The police can only facilitate mediation through theMahila Police StationorFamily Counselling Centre. Theycannot force separation, divorce, or threaten arrestwithout a valid FIR and proper inquiry.No need to panicif threats are being made — such threats are common but largely hollow unless a formal complaint is filed.On Threat of Police Case (e.g., 498A,Domestic Violence, etc.): If they file a complaint, you will receive anotice under Section 41A CrPCor be called for counselling. It is essential toconsult a local lawyer in Bengaluru immediatelyif you receive any such notice. Keep all communication records and proof of your side (messages, travel history, her refusal to join, etc.).On Separation and Divorce: If she is unwilling to live with you and is adamant about separation:You may considerfiling forRestitution of Conjugal Rights(RCR)under Section 9 of theHindu Marriage Actto legally document that she deserted you without valid reason.Alternatively, if reconciliation is not possible, and both parties agree, you can mutually file fordivorce by mutual consentunder Section 13B. This would require a 6-month cooling-off period.If they go toLok Adalat, understand it is a voluntary forum. Youcan decline participationor attend with a lawyer.Alimony & Maintenance: Since she is earning ₹40,000 per month as a bank employee,her claim for maintenance is weak, especially given the short duration of cohabitation. Courts usually consider financial independence, and your limited cohabitation (barely any marital life) may work in your favour.Take Preventive Steps:Avoid further direct interaction with her relatives.Donot sign any documents or settlement terms without legal advice.If threats escalate, consider filing aNC complaint (non-cognizable report)in your local police station for record-keeping.Next Steps:Engage a family lawyer in Bengaluru to prepare for any legal notices.Gather all proof (messages, her refusal to stay, threats, etc.).Respond legally only after a formal complaint or notice is served.You are well within your rights to expect the dispute to be resolved in Bengaluru and protect your elderly mother’s care and your dignity.Thanks & Regards,Adv.

    "question": "Power of Attorney or Will",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1. Power of Attorney (PoA) for Managing Property in ChennaiA Power of Attorney (PoA) is a legal instrument wherein your father (the Principal) appoints you (the Agent) to deal with his property in Chennai on his behalf. You may pay rent, pay property taxes, or even sell the property, if authorized. Since your father is 88 years old and as he cannot move to Chennai for registration, you have the following alternatives:a. PoA Execution and Registration:The PoA should be signed in the presence of witnesses and executed on stamp paper by your father. Registration of the PoA at the Sub-Registrar's office in Chennai is necessary for property transactions (sale) under the Registration Act, 1908. If your father is unable to go to Chennai, he can sign the PoA in Bangalore in front of a Sub-Registrar or a Notary Public. The PoA may be forwarded to Chennai for registration. Your father may also sign the PoA in front of an Indian Consulate or Embassy if he is outside India (not applicable in this case because he is in Bangalore). You can hire a lawyer in Chennai to carry out the registration after the PoA is signed and forwarded from Bangalore.2.Types of PoA:General Power of Attorney (GPA): Wide powers to conduct all matters concerning the property.Special Power of Attorney (SPA): Restricted to particular activities, e.g., collection of rent or sale of the property. As you would like to manage the property actively, a Registered General Power of Attorney in Chennai is recommended. A Will is a legal instrument that defines how your father's property will be divided after his death to the people. It does not provide the power to deal with or sell the property during his lifetime. Hence, a Will cannot serve as a substitute for a Power of Attorney if the intention is to deal or  manage the property presently. A Will only comes into force upon the death of the testator and has to be probated to take legal effect. If your father wishes to have peace of mind in terms of smooth succession on his death, he must draft a Will apart from the PoA for current management.3. You are advised to contact a lawyer who can help you with the following :Preparing and executing of the Power of Attorney documents. Further also help you with the process of registration of PoA in Tamil Nadu (Chennai). Assist you with the Estate planning such as Wills and succession issues. Cross-jurisdictional property issues (Bangalore-Chennai).There are numerous skilled property lawyers in Bangalore who can prepare the PoA and assist you in notarization and registration procedures. They can even arrange with a Chennai-based advocate for registration.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

After that, you can apply for certified copies of registered documents (sale deed, release deed, etc.) in your name by submitting your identification details and property details on the same.You can choose to utilize the State Government Online Portals for Property Records. Most of the Indian states have official web portals for property registration and land records, e.g.: Kaveri Online Registration (Karnataka), IGR Maharashtra (Maharashtra), the Delhi Online Registry (Delhi) and so on. On these portals , you can view your ownership information, transaction history, and then download the certified copies of documents by providing your name, property registration number, survey or plot number and other relevant details. Get Encumbrance Certificate (EC). The EC obtained from the Sub-Registrar office reflects all dealings relating to the property and ensures that it is clear of any encumbrances (loans, mortgages). It can be procured online or offline. Verify Mutation Records and Land Revenue Documents. Mutation records in the local municipal or revenue office verify the change in ownership in government records. Patta or Record of Rights (RoR) documents also validate ownership status.Documents You May Need to FurnishYour complete name and identification (Aadhaar, PAN)Details of property (address, survey number, registration number if known)Old property documents if you have them (even photocopies)If you Need Certified Copies , make application at the Sub-Registrar office or online portal for certified copies of registered deeds.

Provide documentation, such as your resignation email, any payment records, or any communication regarding your notice period and payment for unserved days.Escalation: If HR refuses to make the change, escalate the issue to a higher authority within the company, such as the manager or senior HR personnel. Explain that the incorrect exit date is affecting your future employment and could have legal implications.Legal Notice: If the issue remains unresolved, you can send a legal notice through a lawyer. In the notice, ask the company to correct the relieving letter to reflect your actual last working day. The notice should also include a deadline for action, typically 7-14 days.Labor Commissioner: As a last resort, you can file a complaint with the local labor commissioner if the issue is not resolved amicably. The labor commissioner may mediate or intervene to ensure that your relieving letter is corrected in accordance with the actual facts.Legal Basis:As per labor laws, employers are obligated to provide accurate records and documents related to employment.

    "context": "Asked 25 days ago in Property Law Religion: Christian",
    "question": "Elder fraud and manipulation",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The follwing are the analysis and asnwers to your questions.1. Why is the court not expediting to cancel the settlement deed in light of alleged fraud and manipulation?Civil property cases, particularly ones involving fraud, coercion, or undue influence, are time-consuming because fact-finding, production of evidence, and arguments at law need time.Courts observe procedural fairness and permit each party to lay their case out, and it leads to delay. The court cannot arbitrarily cancel a registered settlement deed without adequate evidence of fraud or coercion and a trial. The remedy would be to file a suit for cancellation under Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act, which is discretionary and time-consuming.2. Why can the distant relative take on rent and earn money from the property while the case is still pending?Once the settlement deed is registered, the distant relative is the legal owner until the court rules otherwise. Courts do not normally interfere with possession or use of property during litigation unless a temporary injunction or stay order is issued.Unless you have obtained a temporary injunction restraining the relative from renting or alienating the property, they legally can continue possession and earn income.3. What can be done to expedite cancellation and retrieve property from your parents?Plead for early hearing or relief (interim injunction) to stop the relative from dealing with the property during the suit.Lay robust documentary and witness evidence establishing fraud, manipulation, and incapacity of your elderly parents to execute the deed knowingly. Appoint a skilled advocate to press for case listing and speed up proceedings. Negotiate mediation or settlement if possible, but if the relative does not agree, proceed with litigation.Sue for criminal fraud or forgery if supported by evidence, which can also bring pressure.4. What if your parents get ill or die during the case?The case can be proceeded with by their legal representatives or legal heirs.Their inability or death does not necessarily invalidate the suit; successors can fill their shoes to carry on the claim. It is recommended that a power of attorney or legal guardian be appointed to handle proceedings if parents are unable.5. What value is your parents' assertion that property should belong to their children?Your parents' intention or spoken words are significant but not decisive without written evidence (Will or registered document). Courts mainly use registered deeds and documentary proof. But proof of manipulation and deprivation of consent can be in your favor to get back property to parents and ultimately to heirsAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It now a 1.5 yearsIt is quite possible that the Trial Court is might burdened by the pendency of so much cases with it and may not be taking your case with so much priority.

    "question": "Elder fraud and manipulation",
    "answer": "Given the serious allegations of fraud, misrepresentation, and undue influence over elderly parents in executing asettlement deed, your case raises important concerns both civilly and criminally. Here is legal advice addressing each of your concerns in a structured manner:1. Delay in Court Proceedings:Indian civil courts are often overburdened, and unless interim relief is sought aggressively, cases involving cancellation of documents such as settlement deeds can take years. However, since the settlement was allegedly obtained byfraud and manipulation of elderly persons, your advocate shouldmove an application for interim injunctionunder Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 of the CPC torestrain the distant relative from further alienating, leasing, or altering the propertyduring pendency of the suit. If your counsel hasn't done this yet, it is a serious lapse and must be addressed immediately.2. Illegal Use and Profiting During Case:If noinjunctionwas obtained at the time of filing, the defendant can legally use the property unless restrained by court order. Theimmediate remedyis to file aninjunction applicationstating that the continued use, felling of trees, and rental income is causingirreparable loss, and pray that the possession or profits be frozen or directed to be held in court trust (court receivercan be appointed). Additionally, a complaint to the police can be filed underSection 420IPC (cheating) andSection 406IPC (criminal breach of trust) if the signature was obtained fraudulently or under deception.3. Steps to Speed Up Cancellation of Settlement Deed:Ensure a strong interim injunction application is on recordand argue for urgent hearing.File awrit petitionbefore the High Court seeking direction for time-bound disposal if the lower court is not moving forward.Simultaneously, considercriminal actionfor cheating and criminal intimidation if threats or coercion were involved. Criminal proceedings can sometimes exert necessary pressure.Keep applying forearly hearingunder Section 151 CPC.4. If Parents Pass Away During the Case:If either or both of your parents pass away, theright to sue survivesunder Order 22 of CPC. You, as legal heirs, can be substituted as plaintiffs. However, delay in substitution may abate the suit. So, keep a vigilant eye on your parents' health and be prepared with legal heirship proof to file for substitution immediately if needed.5. Weight of a Will in Favour of Children:If your parents execute aregistered Willin your favour now, itwill not override the already executed registered settlement deed, unless the latter is cancelled. However, it will showtheir clear intentionand could support the claim that the original deed was obtainedwithout understanding and against their will. Such a Will can beused as corroborative evidencein your current civil suit.Immediate Legal Strategy:Injunction Petition– File or press for urgent hearing.Police Complaint– File underIPC 406& 420 for criminal pressure.Writ in High Court– For time-bound disposal.Will Execution– Get a registered Will made to reaffirm their intent.Press for Court Receiver– To manage rental income till final decision.Conclusion:This is aserious case of property fraud involving elderly personsand must be handled both oncivil and criminal fronts. Your counsel must aggressively pursue interim remedies to stop ongoing damage. Delay is often due to passive litigation — you must now push for urgent listing and also explore filing acriminal complaintto escalate the matter.If you need help with drafting a strong interim application or criminal complaint, I can assist you further.

    "question": "Can I get the custody of my 5 year old daughter with mutual consent divorce",
    "answer": "- Yes, you can take his consent for mutual divorce , and which can be granted within a short period of time.- Your affair cannot be a ground for the refusal of custody of the daughter.- Under the Guardian and Ward Act, , the welfare of the child as the paramount importance, like ethical upbringing of the child, Safe-keeping of the child, Good education , and economic well-being of the guardian.- Further, as per the Supreme Court, for the custody of the minor, the only consideration is the welfare of the minor.- Under Hindu law, A mother usually gets custody of the minor child, under the age of 5 and fathers get custody of older boys, but it is not a strict rule and is primarily decided based on the child’s interests.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Can I get the custody of my 5 year old daughter with mutual consent divorce",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Mutual Consent Divorce: If counseling does not work, you may opt for amutual consent divorceunder Section 13B of theHindu Marriage Act(or relevant law). You must mutually agree on matters like alimony, custody, and property. Courts normally grant it after a waiting period of 6-18 months.Child Custody: Adultery alone will probably not decide custody—courts are most concerned about the child. With your secure income, the previous care of your daughter with your mother, and the dangerous in-law situation, you have a strong case. Documenting history (e.g., being physically injured by his sister) will make your case stronger.Amicable Resolution: Limit harm, provide fair terms (e.g., shared visitation, no fault-blame). Try mediation. Don't resort to hostile actions—your daughter's needs and respect for each other can simplify the process.Hope this helps you; if you still have any clarifications or issues, do not hesitate to ask."

    "answer": "- As per law, even a mother who is a housewife can gain custody of the child and the father will be asked to provide child support.- The mother is the preferred custodial parent when the child is less than five years old. The opinion of a child who is over nine years old will be considered- If he not agrees for mutual settlement on the point of custody of the daughter , then you will have to approach the family court for getting the same.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"
