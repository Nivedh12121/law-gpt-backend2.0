    "question": "Fell for a cam girl (escort) fraud",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Firstly, it is important to understand that the best course of action is to realise that one has most likely, however, become a staking victim of a scam. The famous tendency that scammers use is to ask for a small amount of money compared to the promised sum, and after that, they vanish. In light of the services discussed in this paper, this complicates the problem as we try to find a solution for it.From a legal point of view, web-based selling of sexual services, including cam shows, is completely legal and may be unlawful in some contexts or in certain countries or states. In many places, such transactions remain either unlawful or, at the very least, are vague and without a clearly defined legal status, which often makes it almost impossible for a buyer to seek compensation for the alleged fraud through legal means.Filing a Complaint and Chargeback:Filing a Complaint and Chargeback:NPCI and Bank Chargeback: You can apply for a chargeback with NPCI or apply directly with the bank However, one must note that banks often need a valid reason for processing chargebacks or reversing a transaction. Specifically for the type of payment you received and the service being offered, it can be challenging without jeopardising the legal aspects of the case to defend your stand, let alone admit to prostitution.Consumer Forums: There are solutions available for reporting instances of online fraud the consumer forums or the helpline number, but these may not be the most effective option for challenging issues related to adult services because of said legal ambiguities.Reporting the Scam:This way, you have to be careful when reporting the scam, considering the legal consequences of doing so. However, returning the money to the person is the main focus, and the revelation of the details of the transaction can have negative repercussions. In some jurisdictions, just confessing to attempt to access such services or participating in such a service supplier.Alternative Steps:Cease Further Contact: It means that one should cut any ties to the individual to avoid further financial losses or getting caught up in such a situation.Privacy and Security: However, it is recommended to use the slot at the hotel or any other private location that will guarantee the privacy and security of the individuals involved. If the scammer has any of your details, then even you might be at risk of identity theft or more attempts to con you.Awareness and Caution: To do this, one may argue that it is pertinent to draw lessons from this experience for future occurrences to be more careful. Do not buy or seek services from company or persons whose legal nature of business is questionable or not well defined.Consult a Legal Advisor: Before proceeding any further with the steps outlined on this web site to report the issue or to file for a chargeback, one must seek the advice of a lawyer. They can then recommend which legal route to take with the case while taking into consideration your own circumstances.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can I register an Afidavit/Confirmation at Delhi Registrar office in relation to a property sale deed registered in Kerala (part",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Based on the circumstances, it will be possible to respond to the issues raised by the bank lawyer up to the special power of attorney and its value on stamp. However, the original POA was not notarized and not registered, and in any case, if the stamp value of the document does not conform to the legal requirements of stamp duties in the State of Kerala, at least a registered affidavit or confirmation should be able to treat the wrong.If your mother and sister want to get over this, they can execute an affidavit in Delhi, where the particulars of producing the original power of attorney and the actual sale deed will be stated. This affidavit should particularly mention that you had the original power of attorney to do the following for the sale of property in Kerala. Moreover, there should be details concerning the sale deed, and all parties should have knowledge about the transaction beforehand.After the affidavit is drafted, it should be lodged with the registrar of the stated city. In the case of registration, the common-law partners, or your mother and sister in this case, will have to go to the registrar, who will then cause the affidavit to be sworn by them. This registered affidavit can then be procured from the office of the subregistrar and submitted to the bank in Kerala to meet the above requirement.Though it is a standard practice to follow while rectifying inconsistencies in title deeds across different states, it is wise to seek legal advice from an attorney with knowledge of real estate law in Delhi and Kerala. They can help determine whether all the legal requirements in the preparation of the affidavit have been met, not to mention issues related to registration. It will also assist in eschewing additional problems with the bank’s verification process and simplifying the process of acquiring the loan application.Lastly, it is for this reason that you can actually handle this at the registrar’s office in Delhi by preparing and forwarding an affidavit that will consist of the details in regard to the original POA and the sale deed. It will also involve consulting a legal professional to make sure that the responses in the affidavit are proper and that the affidavit is properly drafted and recorded to address the bank’s concerns.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This letter can also outline your purpose in trying to find damages in the event that they do not comply.If the competitor does not respond satisfactorily to the end-and-desist letter, you may proceed with submitting a lawsuit.

    "question": "NRI concealed about his 'NRI status\" during the sale of property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1) As regards to the TDS Rs percentage amount would be higher for NRI therefore, the exact Rbs amount should be determined. For the properties sold by the NRIs, the TDS has been reportedly prevalent at 20% of the sale value; however, it can reach up to 30% if the value is undervalued intentionally. As for the TDS amount, the exact percentage depends on the selling price and you should consult a tax professional/ CA for the correct TDS percentage. It is advised that even if the seller provides the required documentation stating that he is declaring a capital loss, as the buyer, it becomes the buyer’s responsibility to deduct and deposit the TDS as required. Later on the seller is in a position to demand refund for any given product in case the need arises. If you have deducted and deposited the TDS, you can try to get the TDS certificate (Form 16A) either by checking with the Income Tax Department using your TAN (Tax Deduction and Collection Account Number) or intimation of such deposit.To pressurize the NRI into agreeing to pay the TDS, legal notice through an attorney should be given to the NRI to compel him/her to pay the TDS. This notice should indicate thegist of the fraud and insist on the payment of the outstanding taxes raised on the fraudster with any interests where applicable. The summons and threats of being locked out may force the seller to bring further issues to settlement to prevent complicating the legal process.3) The period within which TDS is required to be deposited of property transactions varies generally 30 days from the end of the month for which TDS has been deducted. In any case, you have not deducted TDS and thus you should immediately resolve this in order to refrain from future penalties and interests. It further does not become a legal offence if one continues to live in the house, once legal proceedings have been initiated against the NRI. However, relevant importance should be given to tax compliance as any disputing issue may arise between the organization and the Income Tax Department.4) While the embassy or consulate won't directly intervene in such matters, they could provide steering on the felony framework and obligations of NRIs. You can also are trying to find help from criminal professionals who focus on NRI belongings transactions and tax issues.5) The first step legally would be to discuss with a belongings lawyer or a tax consultant skilled in NRI transactions. They assist you to draft and ship a prison word to the NRI supplier, disturbing the TDS payment and necessary documentation. If the seller does now not comply, you could record a grievance with the local police for fraud and cheating, and simultaneously, provoke prison complaints in a civil court docket to recover the TDS amount and any related penalties. Keep all transaction records, communications, and criminal notices properly-documented to aid your case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Dismissing your first appeal for failure to appear because you did not appear means that the court did not hear the merits of the case but dismissed it because you (the plaintiff) or 'because of the absence of the representative. This is not a green flag for remarriage, as the original order from the Family Court still stands unless the Supreme Court taxes it so you need to look carefully at the next steps, especially while considering the ongoing appeal under Section125 CrPCand other pending matters.First, you can make an application to the Supreme Court to review the dismissed appeal. This application should explain why you did not show up and why the matter should be reconsidered. If the Supreme Court returns your appeal, it will be retried in the case. Secondly, as far as your ongoing Section125 CrPCcase is concerned, you can proceed to pursue it by submitting all relevant evidence and information, including the allegation that your wife has deserted you as a Hindu Section 13 of the Adoption and Maintenance Act (MHA) provides.As far as pending cases under Section 498-A of the IPC andDomestic ViolenceAct are concerned, it is necessary to present a strong defence and provide evidence that the allegations are false or fabricated to stay on top of. It will be useful to gather evidence such as witness testimony, communication records, and any documents that can support your version of events. If you can prove that the allegations are inconsistent or that the opponents lack strong evidence, they can continue to help you with this information.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Based on the circumstances, it will be possible to respond to the issues raised by the bank lawyer up to the special power of attorney and its value on stamp. However, the original POA was not notarized and not registered, and in any case, if the stamp value of the document does not conform to the legal requirements of stamp duties in the State of Kerala, at least a registered affidavit or confirmation should be able to treat the wrong.If your mother and sister want to get over this, they can execute an affidavit in Delhi, where the particulars of producing the original power of attorney and the actual sale deed will be stated. This affidavit should particularly mention that you had the original power of attorney to do the following for the sale of property in Kerala. Moreover, there should be details concerning the sale deed, and all parties should have knowledge about the transaction beforehand.After the affidavit is drafted, it should be lodged with the registrar of the stated city. In the case of registration, the common-law partners, or your mother and sister in this case, will have to go to the registrar, who will then cause the affidavit to be sworn by them. This registered affidavit can then be procured from the office of the subregistrar and submitted to the bank in Kerala to meet the above requirement.Though it is a standard practice to follow while rectifying inconsistencies in title deeds across different states, it is wise to seek legal advice from an attorney with knowledge of real estate law in Delhi and Kerala. They can help determine whether all the legal requirements in the preparation of the affidavit have been met, not to mention issues related to registration. It will also assist in eschewing additional problems with the bank’s verification process and simplifying the process of acquiring the loan application.Lastly, it is for this reason that you can actually handle this at the registrar’s office in Delhi by preparing and forwarding an affidavit that will consist of the details in regard to the original POA and the sale deed. It will also involve consulting a legal professional to make sure that the responses in the affidavit are proper and that the affidavit is properly drafted and recorded to address the bank’s concerns.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "NRI concealed about his 'NRI status\" during the sale of property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1) As regards to the TDS Rs percentage amount would be higher for NRI therefore, the exact Rbs amount should be determined. For the properties sold by the NRIs, the TDS has been reportedly prevalent at 20% of the sale value; however, it can reach up to 30% if the value is undervalued intentionally. As for the TDS amount, the exact percentage depends on the selling price and you should consult a tax professional/ CA for the correct TDS percentage. It is advised that even if the seller provides the required documentation stating that he is declaring a capital loss, as the buyer, it becomes the buyer’s responsibility to deduct and deposit the TDS as required. Later on the seller is in a position to demand refund for any given product in case the need arises. If you have deducted and deposited the TDS, you can try to get the TDS certificate (Form 16A) either by checking with the Income Tax Department using your TAN (Tax Deduction and Collection Account Number) or intimation of such deposit.To pressurize the NRI into agreeing to pay the TDS, legal notice through an attorney should be given to the NRI to compel him/her to pay the TDS. This notice should indicate thegist of the fraud and insist on the payment of the outstanding taxes raised on the fraudster with any interests where applicable. The summons and threats of being locked out may force the seller to bring further issues to settlement to prevent complicating the legal process.3) The period within which TDS is required to be deposited of property transactions varies generally 30 days from the end of the month for which TDS has been deducted. In any case, you have not deducted TDS and thus you should immediately resolve this in order to refrain from future penalties and interests. It further does not become a legal offence if one continues to live in the house, once legal proceedings have been initiated against the NRI. However, relevant importance should be given to tax compliance as any disputing issue may arise between the organization and the Income Tax Department.4) While the embassy or consulate won't directly intervene in such matters, they could provide steering on the felony framework and obligations of NRIs. You can also are trying to find help from criminal professionals who focus on NRI belongings transactions and tax issues.5) The first step legally would be to discuss with a belongings lawyer or a tax consultant skilled in NRI transactions. They assist you to draft and ship a prison word to the NRI supplier, disturbing the TDS payment and necessary documentation. If the seller does now not comply, you could record a grievance with the local police for fraud and cheating, and simultaneously, provoke prison complaints in a civil court docket to recover the TDS amount and any related penalties. Keep all transaction records, communications, and criminal notices properly-documented to aid your case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Fell for a cam girl (escort) fraud",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Firstly, it is important to understand that the best course of action is to realise that one has most likely, however, become a staking victim of a scam. The famous tendency that scammers use is to ask for a small amount of money compared to the promised sum, and after that, they vanish. In light of the services discussed in this paper, this complicates the problem as we try to find a solution for it.From a legal point of view, web-based selling of sexual services, including cam shows, is completely legal and may be unlawful in some contexts or in certain countries or states. In many places, such transactions remain either unlawful or, at the very least, are vague and without a clearly defined legal status, which often makes it almost impossible for a buyer to seek compensation for the alleged fraud through legal means.Filing a Complaint and Chargeback:Filing a Complaint and Chargeback:NPCI and Bank Chargeback: You can apply for a chargeback with NPCI or apply directly with the bank However, one must note that banks often need a valid reason for processing chargebacks or reversing a transaction. Specifically for the type of payment you received and the service being offered, it can be challenging without jeopardising the legal aspects of the case to defend your stand, let alone admit to prostitution.Consumer Forums: There are solutions available for reporting instances of online fraud the consumer forums or the helpline number, but these may not be the most effective option for challenging issues related to adult services because of said legal ambiguities.Reporting the Scam:This way, you have to be careful when reporting the scam, considering the legal consequences of doing so. However, returning the money to the person is the main focus, and the revelation of the details of the transaction can have negative repercussions. In some jurisdictions, just confessing to attempt to access such services or participating in such a service supplier.Alternative Steps:Cease Further Contact: It means that one should cut any ties to the individual to avoid further financial losses or getting caught up in such a situation.Privacy and Security: However, it is recommended to use the slot at the hotel or any other private location that will guarantee the privacy and security of the individuals involved. If the scammer has any of your details, then even you might be at risk of identity theft or more attempts to con you.Awareness and Caution: To do this, one may argue that it is pertinent to draw lessons from this experience for future occurrences to be more careful. Do not buy or seek services from company or persons whose legal nature of business is questionable or not well defined.Consult a Legal Advisor: Before proceeding any further with the steps outlined on this web site to report the issue or to file for a chargeback, one must seek the advice of a lawyer. They can then recommend which legal route to take with the case while taking into consideration your own circumstances.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can I register an Afidavit/Confirmation at Delhi Registrar office in relation to a property sale deed registered in Kerala (part",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Based on the circumstances, it will be possible to respond to the issues raised by the bank lawyer up to the special power of attorney and its value on stamp. However, the original POA was not notarized and not registered, and in any case, if the stamp value of the document does not conform to the legal requirements of stamp duties in the State of Kerala, at least a registered affidavit or confirmation should be able to treat the wrong.If your mother and sister want to get over this, they can execute an affidavit in Delhi, where the particulars of producing the original power of attorney and the actual sale deed will be stated. This affidavit should particularly mention that you had the original power of attorney to do the following for the sale of property in Kerala. Moreover, there should be details concerning the sale deed, and all parties should have knowledge about the transaction beforehand.After the affidavit is drafted, it should be lodged with the registrar of the stated city. In the case of registration, the common-law partners, or your mother and sister in this case, will have to go to the registrar, who will then cause the affidavit to be sworn by them. This registered affidavit can then be procured from the office of the subregistrar and submitted to the bank in Kerala to meet the above requirement.Though it is a standard practice to follow while rectifying inconsistencies in title deeds across different states, it is wise to seek legal advice from an attorney with knowledge of real estate law in Delhi and Kerala. They can help determine whether all the legal requirements in the preparation of the affidavit have been met, not to mention issues related to registration. It will also assist in eschewing additional problems with the bank’s verification process and simplifying the process of acquiring the loan application.Lastly, it is for this reason that you can actually handle this at the registrar’s office in Delhi by preparing and forwarding an affidavit that will consist of the details in regard to the original POA and the sale deed. It will also involve consulting a legal professional to make sure that the responses in the affidavit are proper and that the affidavit is properly drafted and recorded to address the bank’s concerns.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Buying a resale flat in an under construction building",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Marketing an apartment for resale in a building under construction that continues to have construction delays was undoubtedly fraught with some difficulties, particularly in relation to the concerns regarding the inability of an investor reluctant to sign the Tripartite Agreement. The primary concern for consideration here is that your interests are safeguarded, especially because this project has been experiencing some setbacks, and the investor's decision to back out and opt not to be part of the Tripartite Agreement makes the transaction more challenging.A potential solution is to work out with the investor that an initial payment will be made contingent on the agreed-upon amount of future revenue. In a spirit of negotiation, you could suggest a plan through which a part of the payment is made before the launch of the project and the rest of the amount is paid and retained in trust until ownership is handed over. This also ensures that the investor gets at least some funds upon the completion of the first part, and you are also shielded in case there are likely to be further delays. This arrangement would also call for a precise legal framework that would lay down various provisions in a bid to unlock the remaining balance. No doubt it is wise to consult a lawyer to draw up or at least to inspect this agreement in order to make sure that all such clauses are cogent and the interests of the parties are shielded.The other thing that can be done is to talk with the bank of your choice and possibly come to an agreement on how the loan is paid out in phases based on project progress or possession. Banks generally release funds with respect to construction work completed, and you can negotiate a specific payment schedule you feel would safeguard a part of the funds until you take possession. This might entail explanations with the bank and, with the help of records of the current situation and the manner in which the progress of the project is being slowed, getting consent.If the investor remains inflexible and the bank cannot accommodate your request for a conditional disbursement plan, you may need to reconsider the purchase. Paying the full amount without any assurance of possession exposes you to significant risks, especially in a delayed project. The investor's reluctance to pay GST again suggests they are looking to minimise their costs at your expense, which could indicate potential red flags in the transaction.It's essential to assess the potential for further delays and the overall credibility of the builder. If the delays seem likely to extend beyond the current RERA extension and there is no clear timeline for completion, it might be prudent to explore other options.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,You appear to have a strong case against your competitor for defamation and unfair trade practices, which have potentially caused significant harm to your business. In India, defamation laws provide recourse for individuals and businesses whose reputation has been unjustly harmed by false statements. Given that the competitor's article contains false information about your services, which is demonstrably incorrect based on your website content and has likely impacted your business, you can take legal action.First, acquire all applicable proof. This consists of the thing in question, screenshots of your website showing the suitable facts, and any facts that may help quantify the economic impact, such as records of potential customers lost or a decrease in enterprise inquiries corresponding with the article's booklet. Documenting how the competitor's false claims have directly harmed your commercial enterprise is important.Consult with a prison professional focusing on commercial enterprise regulation and defamation. They can offer unique advice tailored in your state of affairs and help you decide the first-class direction of movement. Typically, the initial step might involve sending a cease-and-desist letter on your competitor, demanding that they remove the object and issue a retraction and public apology. This letter can also outline your purpose in trying to find damages in the event that they do not comply.If the competitor does not respond satisfactorily to the end-and-desist letter, you may proceed with submitting a lawsuit. You can claim compensation for the economic losses incurred due to the defamatory statements, in addition to are trying to find damages for the damage for your popularity. The legal method will involve offering your evidence and demonstrating the impact of the false records on your business.Additionally, you can explore treatments underneath the Competition Act, 2002, which addresses anti-competitive practices together with false and misleading advertising which could harm competition. Filing a grievance with the Competition Commission of India (CCI) is probably another avenue to seek redress.Given the complexity of your capability and the desire to precisely quantify your losses, an in-depth consultation with your attorney will be important.

    "question": "My mother Gift Deed to Daughter in law where 2 sons are there",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In situations involving property and family relations, it’s crucial to handle matters delicately and in accordance with the law. Here’s some general information that might help guide you:Gift Deed Considerations: A gift deed is a legal instrument used to transfer property voluntarily without compensation. In India, theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, governs the process of gifting property. The donor must be solvent and should not use the gift deed as a tool for tax evasion or illegal gains. Once a gift deed is registered, it signifies the change in ownership and is generally irrevocable.Partition Deed and Inheritance: Your mother’s property, if purchased solely by her and not inherited or acquired from your father, is typically considered her self-acquired property. She has the right to gift it to anyone she chooses. However, if your brother claims that your father contributed financially to the purchase of the property, he might challenge the gift deed by asserting that the property should be considered part of your father’s estate and, therefore, subject to inheritance laws.Avoiding Disputes: To avoid potential disputes, it’s advisable to have clear documentation proving that the property was indeed purchased by your mother with her own funds, if that’s the case. If your father did contribute, it might be prudent to reach a family settlement that acknowledges your brother’s concerns and seeks an amicable resolution.Tax Implications: Regarding taxation, if the property is gifted to you or your wife, the donee may be liable to pay taxes based on the market value of the property, as per the Income Tax Act. It’s important to consult with a tax advisor to understand the implications fully.Legal Advice: Given the complexity of property laws and the potential for familial conflict, it’s highly recommended to seek legal advice from a property lawyer who can provide personalised guidance based on all the facts of your case. A lawyer can help ensure that any transfer of property is done legally and with consideration of all parties’ rights and obligations.Remember, each situation is unique, and the above information is general in nature. Legal counsel can offer more specific guidance tailored to your circumstances."

    "question": "NRI concealed about his 'NRI status\" during the sale of property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,1) As regards to the TDS Rs percentage amount would be higher for NRI therefore, the exact Rbs amount should be determined. For the properties sold by the NRIs, the TDS has been reportedly prevalent at 20% of the sale value; however, it can reach up to 30% if the value is undervalued intentionally. As for the TDS amount, the exact percentage depends on the selling price and you should consult a tax professional/ CA for the correct TDS percentage. It is advised that even if the seller provides the required documentation stating that he is declaring a capital loss, as the buyer, it becomes the buyer’s responsibility to deduct and deposit the TDS as required. Later on the seller is in a position to demand refund for any given product in case the need arises. If you have deducted and deposited the TDS, you can try to get the TDS certificate (Form 16A) either by checking with the Income Tax Department using your TAN (Tax Deduction and Collection Account Number) or intimation of such deposit.To pressurize the NRI into agreeing to pay the TDS, legal notice through an attorney should be given to the NRI to compel him/her to pay the TDS. This notice should indicate thegist of the fraud and insist on the payment of the outstanding taxes raised on the fraudster with any interests where applicable. The summons and threats of being locked out may force the seller to bring further issues to settlement to prevent complicating the legal process.3) The period within which TDS is required to be deposited of property transactions varies generally 30 days from the end of the month for which TDS has been deducted. In any case, you have not deducted TDS and thus you should immediately resolve this in order to refrain from future penalties and interests. It further does not become a legal offence if one continues to live in the house, once legal proceedings have been initiated against the NRI. However, relevant importance should be given to tax compliance as any disputing issue may arise between the organization and the Income Tax Department.4) While the embassy or consulate won't directly intervene in such matters, they could provide steering on the felony framework and obligations of NRIs. You can also are trying to find help from criminal professionals who focus on NRI belongings transactions and tax issues.5) The first step legally would be to discuss with a belongings lawyer or a tax consultant skilled in NRI transactions. They assist you to draft and ship a prison word to the NRI supplier, disturbing the TDS payment and necessary documentation. If the seller does now not comply, you could record a grievance with the local police for fraud and cheating, and simultaneously, provoke prison complaints in a civil court docket to recover the TDS amount and any related penalties. Keep all transaction records, communications, and criminal notices properly-documented to aid your case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

First, visit the Indian Embassy in Bahrain to report the mishap and seek forms, as well as directions on how to go about changing the mentioned birth certificate. Depending on the birth registration process of the Indian mission, they will assist you with the documentary requirement, which normally consists of an affidavit, conclusive DNA results if available, a mother's consent, and her husband's consent, among other documents if need be. After making the first changes in Bahrain, take your daughter to India on an out-pass. After reaching India, it is necessary to go to the registrar of births and deaths with the documents, including the admissible birth certificate obtained from Bahrain, which has to be inscribed with the alterations in Indian records. In this process, you will be able to get her passport with the right parentage information.

According to the facts as narrated by you, your marital relationship is at a stage from where it can be saved, nothing would be better than mediation with help of common family/friend. I would suggest you to try to save your relationship as far as possible as you have a child too.But if you think that the situation is somewhere which is out of your hand and you may get trapped into false accusation by your partner then I would suggest you to:Keep a detailed record of all financial transactions, including the EMI payments you have made, personal loans, and any expenses related to the household and your wife’s personal needs.Maintain copies of all communications(chats or recordings) with your wife and in-laws, especially any threats or demands made.Communicate with your wifeCalculations of your total liabilities and financial burden, including home loan EMI, personal loans, and monthly expenses. Keep in mind that basic necessary expenses of child and wife are covered.As you pointed out that there was verbal agreement regarding sharing of Loan EMI but same has not been complied by your wife and only you are paying those EMIs thentry to document those verbal agreement regarding the EMI paymentsand her failure to contribute (if possibletry to communicate this thing with her on whatsapp chat so that she may respond (admit or deny or give any explanation)and keep screenshot of every communication before she delete same)Abandonment anddomestic violenceare serious allegations. Since you left Bangalore due to financial strain and conflicts, not with the intention to abandon, this context is crucial. You have to keep all the documents ready which shows that you left Bangalore in different circumstances. Try to communicate her over chats / calls and document/record same. Be calm and talk to her politely even if she instigates you.You have to gather evidences such as messages or witnesses to counter such false allegations. Restaurant bills / shopping bills etc also are good evidences.Talk to her and try for mediation through a neutral third party or mediator (if possible). This could help resolve issues without escalating to legal battles. Emphasize your willingness to support your wife and child but also explain your financial crunch.But keep copy/record of all the communication that you are doing.Before any interaction with police try to consult a lawyer(family and criminal cases), but before police officer remain calm and provide clear evidence to support your position.But the most important and crucial point here is:-If you have clear anticipation that your wife may file complaint against you then---Consult a lawyer immediately for taking legal recourse before she initiate any formal legal action or files any FIR.You should keep your family and close friends in loop and informed about your situation for emotional and practical support.It is crucial to handle the situation with a calm and strategic approachYou may consult me if you need further legal assistance.

    "question": "My wife is not willing to come to my place",
    "answer": "Dear Client,This is particularly paramount bearing in mind the above complications, which make it necessary to avoid haphazard advancement in this methodical approach to defend your interests and address the concerns adequately.To begin with, all the records should be kept in order, paying extra attention to your financial activities and the verbal agreements concluded with your wife. Documents to be compiled include the bank statements of EMI payments on the credit cards, written communications of the financial arrangements taken, and loan records incurred for household or personal reasons. It is useful in the event that there is a need to go to court due to some illegality. It is also important that any external influence, especially from in-laws, that has influenced your marriage in a negative way be included.Next, it is recommended to contact an attorney as soon as possible. If you’re unsure about your rights when going through the process, it would be wise to engage the services of a lawyer who focuses on family law. They can assist you in dealing with the notice that your wife has issued and can make you ready for any legal battle she might launch against you or any accusations she may make, such as abandonment, domestic abuse, and violence, among others. Your lawyer can also explain the legal consequences of your financial agreements and how they can be resolved, for example, by obtaining a legal resolution, continuing the legal process by obtaining legal separation, or seeking legal advice for an out-of-court settlement.Lastly, in this legal environment, it is the best if you keep talking to your wife calmly and in an understanding manner if you wish to reach a common agreement. You may wish to urge the suggestion to employ mediation as an option to address your disagreements without resorting to litigation. Should the situation worsen and legal processes are the only solution, your attorney will assist you with appropriate defence strategies and, possibly, claims for compensation for the monetary and, respectively, the emotional loss you have suffered.Hope this helps!Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Disputing unfair dismissal procedures can be one of the most challenging tasks an employee can ever encounter in his/her life. Here are the steps you can take to address your termination from Muks Robotics AI Private Limited:1.Review Your Employment Contract: Some of the connected papers might be: First of all, read through your employment contract and any other documents that you signed when you joined the specific company. This is due to the fact that this clause will contain details on the periods of notice that can be given, the circumstances under which dismissals are allowed or even required, and when it is allowed for the contract to be terminated. This will assist in helping you determine the position of the law on your side as well as see if the company in question has violated any of your rights granted by the law.2.Document Everything:Therefore, ensure that you record any conversation held in person, on the phone, or in writing with the company such as emails, letters etc. In our contemporary society, people不知不知道 many tasks are performed online, and thus, document your work activities to show that you did not abuse company resources, for instance, by using your personal laptop for an interview.3.Seek Clarification:It may be required to write a polite and professional letter to the Human Resources department or to the director of the company to know the exact reasons for the dismissal more elaborately. Engaging you with the specific details of your misconduct, detail cases where you are accused of using the company’s property for personal gains as well as explaining how you were unable to meet the various compliance requirements while your brief tenure with the company.4.Legal Consultation:This is a good point to seek legal advice from an employment lawyer. They can give you legal services which are based on your specific case, explain your legal position and decide whether the termination was unlawful. The lawyer may also advise one on the procedures to follow when it comes to filing for reimbursement of losses, or even filing for a lawsuit.5.Request Compensation:In your dealing with the company, make sure to remember to ask for the two months’ pay that is deprived from you as a result of the said dismissal. Ensure that you have not been provided with an indication or chance to comment on any issues being levelled against you, which may amount to an unfair working environment.6.Explore Alternative Dispute Resolution: If direct communication with the company does not yield results, consider mediation or arbitration. These are less formal than court proceedings and can be effective in resolving employment disputes.7.File a Complaint: If the company refuses to cooperate, you can file a complaint with the appropriate labor authorities in your region. This could be the labor commissioner’s office or an employment tribunal. Provide them with all your documentation and evidence of unfair termination.8.Job Search and Support: While addressing the termination issue, continue your job search. Reach out to professional networks and consider temporary or freelance work to mitigate the impact of unemployment. Utilize support services, such as career counseling or employment agencies, to help find new opportunities.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This means that the rent increase should apply immediately after the completion of 11 months from the start of the lease in 2020. Therefore, the rent should have been increased in 2021 and every year thereafter.If the landlord is now claiming arrears for the increased rent since 2021, and you have been paying the same rent since 2020 without any prior communication from the landlord, there may be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the lease agreement.Try to negotiate with the landlord to reach a mutual understanding regarding the rent arrears. If there was a genuine misunderstanding or lack of communication, you may be able to come to a resolution without legal intervention.If you are satisfied with the reply, kindly give me a 5 star rating.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay Highcourt.Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "question": "Rent increase and arrears",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here’s a detailed analysis and response to your questions based on the lease agreement and relevant legal provisions:Lease Agreement Interpretation:Question #1: When is the rent increase applicable?Lease Clause: “The lease shall be for a period of 3 years beginning on October 21, 2020, and renewable with 5% escalation on the rent after completion of 11 months every year.”Based on this clause, the rent increase is applicable every year after the completion of 11 months, not after the lease renewal in 2023. Therefore, the first increase would have been due on September 21, 2021, the second on August 21, 2022, and the third on July 21, 2023.Question #2: Landlord’s Claim for ArrearsSince the landlord has never raised this issue before and there was no communication regarding the rent increase, there are certain considerations under the law:Legal Provisions and Principles:1. \"Contractual Terms\":Section 70 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872: When a person lawfully does something for another person or delivers something to him without intending to do so gratuitously, and the other person enjoys the benefit thereof, the latter is bound to make compensation to the former in respect of, or to restore, the thing so done or delivered.Section 115 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872: Estoppel by conduct, where if a person has, by his declaration, act, or omission, intentionally caused or permitted another person to believe a thing to be true and to act upon such belief, neither he nor his representative shall be allowed, in any suit or proceeding between himself and such person or his representative, to deny the truth of that thing.2. Reasonableness and Communication:Section 106 of theTransfer of Property Act, 1882: In the absence of a contract or local law or usage to the contrary, a lease of immovable property shall be deemed to be a lease from month to month, terminable, on the part of either the lessor or the lessee, by 15 days’ notice expiring with the end of a month of the tenancy.The landlord’s delay in raising the issue of rent increases and the absence of any prior communication may be considered unreasonable and could be argued to have waived the right to claim the increased rent retroactively.Steps to take:1. Review the Lease Agreement: Carefully read the lease agreement again to ensure there are no additional clauses that clarify the rent escalation terms.2. Communicate with the Landlord: Write a formal letter or email to the landlord expressing your understanding of the lease agreement. State that there was no prior communication regarding the rent increase and that you have been paying the agreed rent of Rs. 23,000 per month.3. Negotiate a Settlement: If the landlord insists on the arrears, negotiate a possible settlement. Given the absence of prior communication and the sudden demand for arrears, you can argue for a reduction or a waiver of the alleged outstanding amount.4. Seek Legal Advice: Consult a legal expert specialising in property or tenancy law. They can help draft a formal response and guide you on how to proceed if the landlord continues to demand the arrears.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "If the original agreement fixed in the year was 23000, the enhanced rent @ 5% is payable in the year 2021, which will be 24150 and the same is payable at Rs. 25360  in the year 2022 and it amounts to 26630 in the year 2023 and it will be Rs. 27960 in the year 2024.Therefore the demand for Rs. 40,000 in the year as monthly rental amount is exorbitant.You can calculate the arrears of rental amount due to the difference in enhancement every year and inform him that you can pay that amount as well the actual amount as per the calculation given above.You can refuse to pay exorbitant rental amount and also refuse to vacate, besides you can approach the rent control court or civil court seeking an order of injunction agaisnt the landlord to restrain him from forcibly evicting you other than by due process of law.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Rent increase and arrears",
    "answer": "Dear Client,So, this is what you can do...Review the Original AgreementEscalation Clause: For instance, if the initial agreement for salary increment was at 5 percent annually, they expect you to stick to the same formula unless a new arrangement is made and put down in writing.Expiry of Agreement: Specifically, when the initial deal concluded in 2018, there have been no extensions or new conditions set to replace it; however, you operate legally on a month-to-month basis until new terms and conditions are established.Communication and NegotiationDiscussion with Landlord: You should also try to speak to the landlord regarding the rent rise that is in place for the flat. Point out that since the escalation of the rate was not accompanied by a new agreement on the matter or a new contract, the raise should be implemented strictly in accordance with the increase previously agreed upon.Written Agreement: Better make sure that any new terms are put in writing so that others can’t take advantage in the same way in the future.Legal StandpointValidity of Rent Increase: Unless the landlord secures a new signature for a new agreement, legal means exist that forbid this action, by which the landlord begins to unilaterally alter the terms of the rent and demands back payments according to those terms.Payment of Arrears: You remain bound by the terms of the original agreement and thereby you will be expected to pay the arrears as outlined by the 5% escalation clause, not the new rate which has been singly decided.Steps to TakeArrears calculated on the original terms and conditions Working in this calculation The formula in working with this calculation The formula in working with this calculation The formula in working with this calculation Arrears calculated based on the above-mentioned original terms and conditions can be determined by the following calculations: Working in this calculation: Arrears = Credit terms – Actual payment Credit terms are the original terms that were agreed upon between the supplier and the buyer while the actualBased on this seeming disparity, determine the new total rent which is 5% above your last agreed rent, and then calculate the rent arrears from October 2023 to May 2024.Communicate Your PositionDraft a letter or email to the landlord explaining your position. It is also important to confirm that there is a new agreement or an extension on the previous deadline. For that reason, state it in writing that: The current terms apply, including the 5% escalation clause due to the lack of a new agreement.In conclusion, based on the current tenancy agreement that has not been altered, you cannot be expected to pay the arrears based on the new rent demand of Rs. 40, 000 without a new agreement being initiated and signed. You should work on the escalations based on the provisions of the agreement where the rate increases by 5% every year and that should be communicated to the landlord. Moreover, it is always useful to talk to a legal professional to ensure your rights are covered and to manage potential conflict.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Buying a resale flat in an under construction building",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Marketing an apartment for resale in a building under construction that continues to have construction delays was undoubtedly fraught with some difficulties, particularly in relation to the concerns regarding the inability of an investor reluctant to sign the Tripartite Agreement. The primary concern for consideration here is that your interests are safeguarded, especially because this project has been experiencing some setbacks, and the investor's decision to back out and opt not to be part of the Tripartite Agreement makes the transaction more challenging.A potential solution is to work out with the investor that an initial payment will be made contingent on the agreed-upon amount of future revenue. In a spirit of negotiation, you could suggest a plan through which a part of the payment is made before the launch of the project and the rest of the amount is paid and retained in trust until ownership is handed over. This also ensures that the investor gets at least some funds upon the completion of the first part, and you are also shielded in case there are likely to be further delays. This arrangement would also call for a precise legal framework that would lay down various provisions in a bid to unlock the remaining balance. No doubt it is wise to consult a lawyer to draw up or at least to inspect this agreement in order to make sure that all such clauses are cogent and the interests of the parties are shielded.The other thing that can be done is to talk with the bank of your choice and possibly come to an agreement on how the loan is paid out in phases based on project progress or possession. Banks generally release funds with respect to construction work completed, and you can negotiate a specific payment schedule you feel would safeguard a part of the funds until you take possession. This might entail explanations with the bank and, with the help of records of the current situation and the manner in which the progress of the project is being slowed, getting consent.If the investor remains inflexible and the bank cannot accommodate your request for a conditional disbursement plan, you may need to reconsider the purchase. Paying the full amount without any assurance of possession exposes you to significant risks, especially in a delayed project. The investor's reluctance to pay GST again suggests they are looking to minimise their costs at your expense, which could indicate potential red flags in the transaction.It's essential to assess the potential for further delays and the overall credibility of the builder. If the delays seem likely to extend beyond the current RERA extension and there is no clear timeline for completion, it might be prudent to explore other options.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

So its wise to keep everything transparent and builder well informed about your transaction. In case that is not done then take NOC from the Builder for First Transaction Free so that the Builder does not put additional cost for such Transfer.

    "question": "Termination from employer",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Disputing unfair dismissal procedures can be one of the most challenging tasks an employee can ever encounter in his/her life. Here are the steps you can take to address your termination from Muks Robotics AI Private Limited:1.Review Your Employment Contract: Some of the connected papers might be: First of all, read through your employment contract and any other documents that you signed when you joined the specific company. This is due to the fact that this clause will contain details on the periods of notice that can be given, the circumstances under which dismissals are allowed or even required, and when it is allowed for the contract to be terminated. This will assist in helping you determine the position of the law on your side as well as see if the company in question has violated any of your rights granted by the law.2.Document Everything:Therefore, ensure that you record any conversation held in person, on the phone, or in writing with the company such as emails, letters etc. In our contemporary society, people不知不知道 many tasks are performed online, and thus, document your work activities to show that you did not abuse company resources, for instance, by using your personal laptop for an interview.3.Seek Clarification:It may be required to write a polite and professional letter to the Human Resources department or to the director of the company to know the exact reasons for the dismissal more elaborately. Engaging you with the specific details of your misconduct, detail cases where you are accused of using the company’s property for personal gains as well as explaining how you were unable to meet the various compliance requirements while your brief tenure with the company.4.Legal Consultation:This is a good point to seek legal advice from an employment lawyer. They can give you legal services which are based on your specific case, explain your legal position and decide whether the termination was unlawful. The lawyer may also advise one on the procedures to follow when it comes to filing for reimbursement of losses, or even filing for a lawsuit.5.Request Compensation:In your dealing with the company, make sure to remember to ask for the two months’ pay that is deprived from you as a result of the said dismissal. Ensure that you have not been provided with an indication or chance to comment on any issues being levelled against you, which may amount to an unfair working environment.6.Explore Alternative Dispute Resolution: If direct communication with the company does not yield results, consider mediation or arbitration. These are less formal than court proceedings and can be effective in resolving employment disputes.7.File a Complaint: If the company refuses to cooperate, you can file a complaint with the appropriate labor authorities in your region. This could be the labor commissioner’s office or an employment tribunal. Provide them with all your documentation and evidence of unfair termination.8.Job Search and Support: While addressing the termination issue, continue your job search. Reach out to professional networks and consider temporary or freelance work to mitigate the impact of unemployment. Utilize support services, such as career counseling or employment agencies, to help find new opportunities.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Both Mumbai and goa are having jurisdiction.Goa has jurisdiction as you had married there, but there is absolutely no compulsion and you can choose to consider it as a secondary option if it seems inconvenient.For filing in Mumbai - You will need to provide a valid address proof to prove that you (petitioner) are living in Mumbai and are having jurisdiction of Mumbai to file a divorce case . Your Documents should have a  Mumbai address such as (any one document is required )- voter Id, aadhar card , passport , gas connection bill are considered valid documents to file case in Mumbai .Secondly - You have a right to ask your wedding gold prior to signing divorce papers if in-laws are on good terms . Otherside usually gold is kept as last part of exchange on the last day of final court settlement in front of judge.Pls ensure to make note of gold(in grams) is with in-laws and will be  exchanged on final decree day in ur divorce papers to avoid any problems.Certain other clauses are also important to mention in divorce proceedings which I could discuss better if I had more details of your case for which I will be at your service if required.Mutual divorce is the quickest and simplest way to get a  divorce and usually has a 6 months cooling off period which can be waived off by convincing the judge  to fast track the case.Warm regards.

    "question": "Transfer of immovable property after death",
    "answer": "Yes, the family has the authority to sell the property, but certain legal steps must be taken to ensure that the property transfer is valid and binding.Since the property is still in the deceased father's name, all legal heirs must be involved in the sale process. According to the Indian Succession Act, 1925, applicable to Christians, the property of a deceased person who dies intestate is inherited by the legal heirs. In this case, the legal heirs are the spouse (mother) and the children (two sons and one daughter).Therefore, all legal heirs (mother, two sons, and one daughter) must sign the sale deed to transfer the property legally. They all need to give their consent to the sale and participate in the execution of the sale deed.Yes, it is generally mandatory to have a legal heir certificate to establish the legal heirs of the deceased. This certificate is essential for various legal and administrative processes, including the transfer of property. The legal heir certificate will identify the mother and the three children as the legitimate heirs of the deceased father, thereby establishing their right to sell the property.No, a legal heir certificate and a succession certificate are not the same, although they serve related purposes:Legal Heir Certificate:This certificate is issued by the local revenue authorities (like the Tehsildar) or the municipal authority, identifying the legal heirs of a deceased person. It is typically used for non-movable assets, such as property transfer, and for other purposes like claiming insurance, pension, or other benefits.Succession Certificate:This certificate is issued by a civil court and is used primarily for movable assets, such as bank accounts, securities, and debts. It authorizes the holder to collect the debts and securities of the deceased person.In your case, for the sale of immovable property, a legal heir certificate should suffice to establish the heirs of the deceased father. However, if there are any disputes or complexities, a succession certificate may be required.Hope your legal queries are answered to your satisfaction.

    "question": "Transfer of immovable property after death",
    "answer": "Dear Client,When you are buying a particular property, there are certain legalities that have to be followed in order to have a clear understanding of the ownership of the property that is changing hands. Here are the answers to your questions:Yes, the family is legally entitled to dispose of that property, but there is a process to be followed since the father predeceased without a will. Often, documents like the legal heir certificate must be produced to confirm that the property will be transferred to the rightful heirs. This is not the same as a succession certificate; the former is in relation to the ascertainment of legal representatives, while the latter concerns securities and debt. In your case, it secures your acquisition-by-sale not only for the 1/3 portion but also shows clearly who the legal heirs are to the property.The property can be sold by the legal heirs if necessary; however, since the property is still in the deceased father’s name, a legal heir certificate is required for the transfer of title. The mother and all children are legal heirs, and hence they have rights with regard to the sale. Here, while the GPA given to one son means he can handle the sale of the property, a clear NOC from the other heirs is required and legally enforceable. Actually, in order to eliminate any possible dispute in the future, it is better to obtain a legal heir certificate after checking that all the heirs agree with the sale and that the transfer of property occurred legally.Without legal heir certificates, there's a chance that the transfer may be contested later. Therefore, it's strongly encouraged to insist on acquiring a criminal heir certificate earlier than intended. This certificate will serve as proof of the criminal heirs and make certain that each of the important parties is in agreement. Additionally, affirm the GPA's validity and ensure that the NOCs from the abroad-based son and daughter are well notarized and diagnosed in India to avoid any felony headaches.To conclude, while the son with the GPA and the mother can execute the sale deed, it's far more prudent to insist on a felony inheritor certificate. This certificate will offer a clean prison foundation for the sale and defend you from any capability claims by different heirs in the future. Ensuring that every file is in order and legally recognised will facilitate an easy and stable asset purchase.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Transfer of immovable property after death",
    "answer": "Yes, the family has the authority to sell the property, but certain legal steps must be taken to ensure that the property transfer is valid and binding.Since the property is still in the deceased father's name, all legal heirs must be involved in the sale process. According to the Indian Succession Act, 1925, applicable to Christians, the property of a deceased person who dies intestate is inherited by the legal heirs. In this case, the legal heirs are the spouse (mother) and the children (two sons and one daughter).Therefore, all legal heirs (mother, two sons, and one daughter) must sign the sale deed to transfer the property legally. They all need to give their consent to the sale and participate in the execution of the sale deed.Yes, it is generally mandatory to have a legal heir certificate to establish the legal heirs of the deceased. This certificate is essential for various legal and administrative processes, including the transfer of property. The legal heir certificate will identify the mother and the three children as the legitimate heirs of the deceased father, thereby establishing their right to sell the property.No, a legal heir certificate and a succession certificate are not the same, although they serve related purposes:Legal Heir Certificate:This certificate is issued by the local revenue authorities (like the Tehsildar) or the municipal authority, identifying the legal heirs of a deceased person. It is typically used for non-movable assets, such as property transfer, and for other purposes like claiming insurance, pension, or other benefits.Succession Certificate:This certificate is issued by a civil court and is used primarily for movable assets, such as bank accounts, securities, and debts. It authorizes the holder to collect the debts and securities of the deceased person.In your case, for the sale of immovable property, a legal heir certificate should suffice to establish the heirs of the deceased father. However, if there are any disputes or complexities, a succession certificate may be required.Hope your legal queries are answered to your satisfaction.

The GPA should explicitly authorize Son A to sell the property and execute all necessary documents on behalf of the other legal heirs. Obtain and verify the NOCs from Son B and the daughter. These NOCs should explicitly state that they have no objection to the sale of the property and that they consent to Son A and the mother executing the sale deed on their behalf. Conduct a thorough title search to ensure there are no other legal claims or encumbrances on the property. This can be done through the local sub-registrar’s office and by engaging a lawyer to review the title documents. While it is not strictly mandatory to have a legal heir certificate to execute the sale of property if the legal heirs have provided a GPA and NOCs, it is highly recommended as it can help prevent future disputes.Thanks!RAJVEER SINGHAdvocateRajveer SinghAdvocate, Ranchi31 AnswersTalk to Advocate Rajveer Singh"

Ensure that your parent have updated nominations for the property in the housing society records. While a nominee is not the legal owner, it helps in the interim management of the property until the probate process is completed.ORIf you dont want to get into technicality of probate then it is recommended to simplify the transfer process by having the property in joint names. If your parent include your and your sister's names as joint owners, the property can pass to the surviving joint owners without needing probate.ORFor more safest option (to bypass from risk of toxicity in relationship with sister) I would recommend you to ask your parent for HIBA. Although HIBA does not require registration but it would be best if same is written on Non-judicial Stamp Paper, Notarised and Attested by 2 independent witnesses. This will ensure that if in future any dispute arises then you can have some more evidence in your favour.Thanks!Rajveer SinghAdvocateRajveer SinghAdvocate, Ranchi31 AnswersTalk to Advocate Rajveer Singh"

    "question": "Registered will in Mumbai",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I am glad to learn that you are fully supportive of the plan and that your family has full support for it. Here are detailed answers to your questions to help simplify the process of estate transfer:First, regarding the registered will: In Mumbai, only a registered will can guarantee how your parents’ property is to be utilised due to the legal recognition of the will. Still, if ownership of a certain property, like a house in a society, is to be transferred, the will usually has to be probated. Probate, therefore, acts as the legal approval of the will and formal validation of the executor’s capacity to manage the estate. This can sometimes be viewed as a somewhat bureaucratic and lengthy process, but it helps to make certain that the will is fully legally binding, and it is a process that, if required, can be completed without any form of dispute. In this regard, it is wise to seek the services of an attorney to explain the probate procedures in Mumbai and any other associated issues.Second, if there are local provisions for what is called ‘ a transfer on death’, deed, your parents can consider making one, and through this, they could avoid probate court after their demise. It permits the property to be transferred to the beneficiaries through an assignment; hence, there is no need for the intervention of the probate court upon the owner’s death. consequently, they may consider establishing a trust. In this way, your parents can set terms on how the property should be split or turned over to you and your sister without the need for probate. A trust is an entity affiliated with a trustee; this would be responsible for the distribution of tangible and intangible assets as dictated by the terms of the trust deed.Ultimately, you and your sister can manage the property distribution without going through probate by entering into a family arrangement deed following the death of your parents. A mutual agreement among family members regarding the distribution of property is reflected in a family arrangement deed. By entering into this arrangement, the official probate process and its attendant costs may be avoided. To avoid future problems, it is imperative that the deed be well-drafted, unambiguous, and legally enforceable. In order to make sure that the family arrangement deed is enforceable and accurately represents the intentions of all parties, legal counsel should be sought out during its drafting and registration.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This would be a subject matter of Mohammedan personal law (which differs in its application among Shias and Sunnis). If a Muslim testator has not appointed an executor under his will, it is still valid.If voluntary probate is still desired, the beneficiaries can apply to the relevant court for a grant of Letter of Administration (LoA). The court on receiving satisfactory proof of valid execution of the will issues a LoA to the beneficiary who will then perform the duties of an administrator of the estate. An LoA may be granted to one or several people who may apply to the court, but note that the categories are broad and not limited to the heirs of the deceased. The beneficiaries are at liberty to attend the court proceedings but attendance of each and every beneficiary is not compulsory. It will be a matter of personal choice. Prior to the final grant or order and early in the process, the court is required to grant an opportunity to the beneficiaries to raise objections, if any.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

Joint account: Having a joint account with an \"either or survivor\" statement is a smart step. This ensures that the surviving account holder can access the funds after the death of the new account holder without legal impediments or probate requirements2. Registered Will: Your parents have done well in creating a registered will. A registered will is a strong legal document that will help them successfully transfer assets as they wish. It is advisable to keep a certified copy of the will and ensure that it is easily accessible.3. Avoid Probate: While a notary will make the process much easier, in order to avoid probate again, you may want to consider having your parents execute a \"Transfer on Death\" (TOD) deed for your w 'property, if appropriate in your jurisdiction. This document allows you and your sister to transfer your assets directly after your parents die and pass probate.By taking this step, you can ensure a smooth and easy transfer of assets, reducing the need for title deeds and legal complications.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Transfer of immovable property after death",
    "answer": "Yes, the family has the authority to sell the property, but certain legal steps must be taken to ensure that the property transfer is valid and binding.Since the property is still in the deceased father's name, all legal heirs must be involved in the sale process. According to the Indian Succession Act, 1925, applicable to Christians, the property of a deceased person who dies intestate is inherited by the legal heirs. In this case, the legal heirs are the spouse (mother) and the children (two sons and one daughter).Therefore, all legal heirs (mother, two sons, and one daughter) must sign the sale deed to transfer the property legally. They all need to give their consent to the sale and participate in the execution of the sale deed.Yes, it is generally mandatory to have a legal heir certificate to establish the legal heirs of the deceased. This certificate is essential for various legal and administrative processes, including the transfer of property. The legal heir certificate will identify the mother and the three children as the legitimate heirs of the deceased father, thereby establishing their right to sell the property.No, a legal heir certificate and a succession certificate are not the same, although they serve related purposes:Legal Heir Certificate:This certificate is issued by the local revenue authorities (like the Tehsildar) or the municipal authority, identifying the legal heirs of a deceased person. It is typically used for non-movable assets, such as property transfer, and for other purposes like claiming insurance, pension, or other benefits.Succession Certificate:This certificate is issued by a civil court and is used primarily for movable assets, such as bank accounts, securities, and debts. It authorizes the holder to collect the debts and securities of the deceased person.In your case, for the sale of immovable property, a legal heir certificate should suffice to establish the heirs of the deceased father. However, if there are any disputes or complexities, a succession certificate may be required.Hope your legal queries are answered to your satisfaction.

    "answer": "Dear Client,When you are buying a particular property, there are certain legalities that have to be followed in order to have a clear understanding of the ownership of the property that is changing hands. Here are the answers to your questions:Yes, the family is legally entitled to dispose of that property, but there is a process to be followed since the father predeceased without a will. Often, documents like the legal heir certificate must be produced to confirm that the property will be transferred to the rightful heirs. This is not the same as a succession certificate; the former is in relation to the ascertainment of legal representatives, while the latter concerns securities and debt. In your case, it secures your acquisition-by-sale not only for the 1/3 portion but also shows clearly who the legal heirs are to the property.The property can be sold by the legal heirs if necessary; however, since the property is still in the deceased father’s name, a legal heir certificate is required for the transfer of title. The mother and all children are legal heirs, and hence they have rights with regard to the sale. Here, while the GPA given to one son means he can handle the sale of the property, a clear NOC from the other heirs is required and legally enforceable. Actually, in order to eliminate any possible dispute in the future, it is better to obtain a legal heir certificate after checking that all the heirs agree with the sale and that the transfer of property occurred legally.Without legal heir certificates, there's a chance that the transfer may be contested later. Therefore, it's strongly encouraged to insist on acquiring a criminal heir certificate earlier than intended. This certificate will serve as proof of the criminal heirs and make certain that each of the important parties is in agreement. Additionally, affirm the GPA's validity and ensure that the NOCs from the abroad-based son and daughter are well notarized and diagnosed in India to avoid any felony headaches.To conclude, while the son with the GPA and the mother can execute the sale deed, it's far more prudent to insist on a felony inheritor certificate. This certificate will offer a clean prison foundation for the sale and defend you from any capability claims by different heirs in the future. Ensuring that every file is in order and legally recognised will facilitate an easy and stable asset purchase.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Hello, it depends upon future situation also and the will comes into operation only after death of will maker. Ensure that your parent have updated nominations for the property in the housing society records. While a nominee is not the legal owner, it helps in the interim management of the property until the probate process is completed.ORIf you dont want to get into technicality of probate then it is recommended to simplify the transfer process by having the property in joint names. If your parent include your and your sister's names as joint owners, the property can pass to the surviving joint owners without needing probate.ORFor more safest option (to bypass from risk of toxicity in relationship with sister) I would recommend you to ask your parent for HIBA. Although HIBA does not require registration but it would be best if same is written on Non-judicial Stamp Paper, Notarised and Attested by 2 independent witnesses. This will ensure that if in future any dispute arises then you can have some more evidence in your favour.Thanks!Rajveer SinghAdvocateRajveer SinghAdvocate, Ranchi31 AnswersTalk to Advocate Rajveer Singh"

    "question": "Registered will in Mumbai",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I am glad to learn that you are fully supportive of the plan and that your family has full support for it. Here are detailed answers to your questions to help simplify the process of estate transfer:First, regarding the registered will: In Mumbai, only a registered will can guarantee how your parents’ property is to be utilised due to the legal recognition of the will. Still, if ownership of a certain property, like a house in a society, is to be transferred, the will usually has to be probated. Probate, therefore, acts as the legal approval of the will and formal validation of the executor’s capacity to manage the estate. This can sometimes be viewed as a somewhat bureaucratic and lengthy process, but it helps to make certain that the will is fully legally binding, and it is a process that, if required, can be completed without any form of dispute. In this regard, it is wise to seek the services of an attorney to explain the probate procedures in Mumbai and any other associated issues.Second, if there are local provisions for what is called ‘ a transfer on death’, deed, your parents can consider making one, and through this, they could avoid probate court after their demise. It permits the property to be transferred to the beneficiaries through an assignment; hence, there is no need for the intervention of the probate court upon the owner’s death. consequently, they may consider establishing a trust. In this way, your parents can set terms on how the property should be split or turned over to you and your sister without the need for probate. A trust is an entity affiliated with a trustee; this would be responsible for the distribution of tangible and intangible assets as dictated by the terms of the trust deed.Ultimately, you and your sister can manage the property distribution without going through probate by entering into a family arrangement deed following the death of your parents. A mutual agreement among family members regarding the distribution of property is reflected in a family arrangement deed. By entering into this arrangement, the official probate process and its attendant costs may be avoided. To avoid future problems, it is imperative that the deed be well-drafted, unambiguous, and legally enforceable. In order to make sure that the family arrangement deed is enforceable and accurately represents the intentions of all parties, legal counsel should be sought out during its drafting and registration.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This would be a subject matter of Mohammedan personal law (which differs in its application among Shias and Sunnis). If a Muslim testator has not appointed an executor under his will, it is still valid.If voluntary probate is still desired, the beneficiaries can apply to the relevant court for a grant of Letter of Administration (LoA). The court on receiving satisfactory proof of valid execution of the will issues a LoA to the beneficiary who will then perform the duties of an administrator of the estate. An LoA may be granted to one or several people who may apply to the court, but note that the categories are broad and not limited to the heirs of the deceased. The beneficiaries are at liberty to attend the court proceedings but attendance of each and every beneficiary is not compulsory. It will be a matter of personal choice. Prior to the final grant or order and early in the process, the court is required to grant an opportunity to the beneficiaries to raise objections, if any.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

Joint account: Having a joint account with an \"either or survivor\" statement is a smart step. This ensures that the surviving account holder can access the funds after the death of the new account holder without legal impediments or probate requirements2. Registered Will: Your parents have done well in creating a registered will. A registered will is a strong legal document that will help them successfully transfer assets as they wish. It is advisable to keep a certified copy of the will and ensure that it is easily accessible.3. Avoid Probate: While a notary will make the process much easier, in order to avoid probate again, you may want to consider having your parents execute a \"Transfer on Death\" (TOD) deed for your w 'property, if appropriate in your jurisdiction. This document allows you and your sister to transfer your assets directly after your parents die and pass probate.By taking this step, you can ensure a smooth and easy transfer of assets, reducing the need for title deeds and legal complications.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Communication from the SP Office to ImmigrationThe communication from the SP Office to the immigration authorities likely clarified your legal status and confirmed that no arrest warrant was issued against you. This would have reassured the immigration officials that, while an LOC was active, it did not necessitate immediate detention or arrest. The SP Office might have also communicated any specific instructions, such as your requirement to attend court hearings, which allowed the immigration officials to proceed accordingly.Eligibility to Travel with Court OrderSince the court order explicitly states that you should attend all court hearings and does not impose any travel restrictions, you are generally eligible to travel. The court's lack of mention regarding travel restrictions implies that you are free to travel, provided you return for your court hearings. Always carry a copy of this court order when traveling to demonstrate your compliance with legal requirements.Status of Your LOCThe fact that you were allowed to travel after the SP Office communicated with the immigration officials suggests that the immediate concerns of the LOC were addressed, at least temporarily. However, this does not necessarily mean the LOC is revoked or lifted permanently. The LOC may still be active, and its enforcement could vary depending on the specifics of your case and the instructions from the SP Office.-Travel Preparations: Keep Documentation: Always take a copy of the court mandate with you when traveling. This will be important in demonstrating that you are following the court's orders. Legal Disclaimer: Check with your attorney before traveling to make sure you do not have anything pending that may interfere with your travel plans.-If Stopped by Immigration: Court Order: A court order which says that no implied order not to travel Inform them all you are doing is complying with the court order by going to all court hearing-Talking: You ask for immigration staff members to check in with the SP Office or elsewhere to confirm your status.Hope this helps!Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Sir,I understand your challenging situation. According to the facts as narrated by you, your marital relationship is at a stage from where it can be saved, nothing would be better than mediation with help of common family/friend. I would suggest you to try to save your relationship as far as possible as you have a child too.But if you think that the situation is somewhere which is out of your hand and you may get trapped into false accusation by your partner then I would suggest you to:Keep a detailed record of all financial transactions, including the EMI payments you have made, personal loans, and any expenses related to the household and your wife’s personal needs.Maintain copies of all communications(chats or recordings) with your wife and in-laws, especially any threats or demands made.Communicate with your wifeCalculations of your total liabilities and financial burden, including home loan EMI, personal loans, and monthly expenses. Keep in mind that basic necessary expenses of child and wife are covered.As you pointed out that there was verbal agreement regarding sharing of Loan EMI but same has not been complied by your wife and only you are paying those EMIs thentry to document those verbal agreement regarding the EMI paymentsand her failure to contribute (if possibletry to communicate this thing with her on whatsapp chat so that she may respond (admit or deny or give any explanation)and keep screenshot of every communication before she delete same)Abandonment anddomestic violenceare serious allegations. Since you left Bangalore due to financial strain and conflicts, not with the intention to abandon, this context is crucial. You have to keep all the documents ready which shows that you left Bangalore in different circumstances. Try to communicate her over chats / calls and document/record same. Be calm and talk to her politely even if she instigates you.You have to gather evidences such as messages or witnesses to counter such false allegations. Restaurant bills / shopping bills etc also are good evidences.Talk to her and try for mediation through a neutral third party or mediator (if possible). This could help resolve issues without escalating to legal battles. Emphasize your willingness to support your wife and child but also explain your financial crunch.But keep copy/record of all the communication that you are doing.Before any interaction with police try to consult a lawyer(family and criminal cases), but before police officer remain calm and provide clear evidence to support your position.But the most important and crucial point here is:-If you have clear anticipation that your wife may file complaint against you then---Consult a lawyer immediately for taking legal recourse before she initiate any formal legal action or files any FIR.You should keep your family and close friends in loop and informed about your situation for emotional and practical support.It is crucial to handle the situation with a calm and strategic approachYou may consult me if you need further legal assistance.

    "question": "My wife is not willing to come to my place",
    "answer": "Dear Client,This is particularly paramount bearing in mind the above complications, which make it necessary to avoid haphazard advancement in this methodical approach to defend your interests and address the concerns adequately.To begin with, all the records should be kept in order, paying extra attention to your financial activities and the verbal agreements concluded with your wife. Documents to be compiled include the bank statements of EMI payments on the credit cards, written communications of the financial arrangements taken, and loan records incurred for household or personal reasons. It is useful in the event that there is a need to go to court due to some illegality. It is also important that any external influence, especially from in-laws, that has influenced your marriage in a negative way be included.Next, it is recommended to contact an attorney as soon as possible. If you’re unsure about your rights when going through the process, it would be wise to engage the services of a lawyer who focuses on family law. They can assist you in dealing with the notice that your wife has issued and can make you ready for any legal battle she might launch against you or any accusations she may make, such as abandonment, domestic abuse, and violence, among others. Your lawyer can also explain the legal consequences of your financial agreements and how they can be resolved, for example, by obtaining a legal resolution, continuing the legal process by obtaining legal separation, or seeking legal advice for an out-of-court settlement.Lastly, in this legal environment, it is the best if you keep talking to your wife calmly and in an understanding manner if you wish to reach a common agreement. You may wish to urge the suggestion to employ mediation as an option to address your disagreements without resorting to litigation. Should the situation worsen and legal processes are the only solution, your attorney will assist you with appropriate defence strategies and, possibly, claims for compensation for the monetary and, respectively, the emotional loss you have suffered.Hope this helps!Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

While a nominee is not the legal owner, it helps in the interim management of the property until the probate process is completed.ORIf you dont want to get into technicality of probate then it is recommended to simplify the transfer process by having the property in joint names. If your parent include your and your sister's names as joint owners, the property can pass to the surviving joint owners without needing probate.ORFor more safest option (to bypass from risk of toxicity in relationship with sister) I would recommend you to ask your parent for HIBA. Although HIBA does not require registration but it would be best if same is written on Non-judicial Stamp Paper, Notarised and Attested by 2 independent witnesses.

    "question": "Registered will in Mumbai",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I am glad to learn that you are fully supportive of the plan and that your family has full support for it. Here are detailed answers to your questions to help simplify the process of estate transfer:First, regarding the registered will: In Mumbai, only a registered will can guarantee how your parents’ property is to be utilised due to the legal recognition of the will. Still, if ownership of a certain property, like a house in a society, is to be transferred, the will usually has to be probated. Probate, therefore, acts as the legal approval of the will and formal validation of the executor’s capacity to manage the estate. This can sometimes be viewed as a somewhat bureaucratic and lengthy process, but it helps to make certain that the will is fully legally binding, and it is a process that, if required, can be completed without any form of dispute. In this regard, it is wise to seek the services of an attorney to explain the probate procedures in Mumbai and any other associated issues.Second, if there are local provisions for what is called ‘ a transfer on death’, deed, your parents can consider making one, and through this, they could avoid probate court after their demise. It permits the property to be transferred to the beneficiaries through an assignment; hence, there is no need for the intervention of the probate court upon the owner’s death. consequently, they may consider establishing a trust. In this way, your parents can set terms on how the property should be split or turned over to you and your sister without the need for probate. A trust is an entity affiliated with a trustee; this would be responsible for the distribution of tangible and intangible assets as dictated by the terms of the trust deed.Ultimately, you and your sister can manage the property distribution without going through probate by entering into a family arrangement deed following the death of your parents. A mutual agreement among family members regarding the distribution of property is reflected in a family arrangement deed. By entering into this arrangement, the official probate process and its attendant costs may be avoided. To avoid future problems, it is imperative that the deed be well-drafted, unambiguous, and legally enforceable. In order to make sure that the family arrangement deed is enforceable and accurately represents the intentions of all parties, legal counsel should be sought out during its drafting and registration.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This would be a subject matter of Mohammedan personal law (which differs in its application among Shias and Sunnis). If a Muslim testator has not appointed an executor under his will, it is still valid.If voluntary probate is still desired, the beneficiaries can apply to the relevant court for a grant of Letter of Administration (LoA). The court on receiving satisfactory proof of valid execution of the will issues a LoA to the beneficiary who will then perform the duties of an administrator of the estate. An LoA may be granted to one or several people who may apply to the court, but note that the categories are broad and not limited to the heirs of the deceased. The beneficiaries are at liberty to attend the court proceedings but attendance of each and every beneficiary is not compulsory. It will be a matter of personal choice. Prior to the final grant or order and early in the process, the court is required to grant an opportunity to the beneficiaries to raise objections, if any.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

Joint account: Having a joint account with an \"either or survivor\" statement is a smart step. This ensures that the surviving account holder can access the funds after the death of the new account holder without legal impediments or probate requirements2. Registered Will: Your parents have done well in creating a registered will. A registered will is a strong legal document that will help them successfully transfer assets as they wish. It is advisable to keep a certified copy of the will and ensure that it is easily accessible.3. Avoid Probate: While a notary will make the process much easier, in order to avoid probate again, you may want to consider having your parents execute a \"Transfer on Death\" (TOD) deed for your w 'property, if appropriate in your jurisdiction. This document allows you and your sister to transfer your assets directly after your parents die and pass probate.By taking this step, you can ensure a smooth and easy transfer of assets, reducing the need for title deeds and legal complications.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Suffering from chronic neurological disorder and facing harassment at workplace",
    "answer": "Supreme Court: In  a case where a citizen, who suffers from a writer’s cramp, was denied a scribe in the civil services’ examination, the 3-judge bench of Dr. DY Chandrachud*, Indira Banerjee and Sanjiv Khanna, JJ has held that writer’s cramp Forms part of Entry IV of the Schedule to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act 2016) and“To deny the facility of a scribe in a situation such as the present would negate the valuable rights and entitlements which are recognised by the RPwD Act 2016.”Part III of our Constitution does not explicitly include persons with disabilities within its protective fold. However, much like their able-bodied counterparts, the golden triangle of Articles 14, 19 and 21 applies with full force and vigour to the disabled. The RPwD Act 2016 seeks to operationalize and give concrete shape to the promise of full and equal citizenship held out by the Constitution to the disabled and to execute its ethos of inclusion and acceptance.”Section 3 casts an affirmative obligation on the government to ensure that persons with disabilities enjoy (i) the right to equality; (ii) a life with dignity; and (iii) respect for their integrity equally with others. By recognizing a statutory right and entitlement on the part of persons who are disabled, Section 3 seeks to implement and facilitate the fulfillment of the constitutional rights of persons with disabilities.You can give a representation based on supreme court judgmentT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Suffering from chronic neurological disorder and facing harassment at workplace",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Legally, you have several options to seek redress and accommodations. The Supreme Court's judgement in Vikash Kumar v. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) is indeed relevant to your situation. Here’s a detailed explanation:Facts and Decisions in Vikash Kumar v. UPSCIn Vikash Kumar v. UPSC (2021), the petitioner suffered from a similar neurological condition that impaired his writing ability. He requested reasonable accommodations to take a civil service examination, including the provision of a scribe. The UPSC rejected his request, prompting him to challenge their decision.The Supreme Court ruled in favour of Vikash Kumar, emphasising the following key points:1.Rights of Persons with Disabilities:The Court underscored the rights of individuals with disabilities to reasonable accommodations under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPWD Act). This Act mandates non-discrimination and provides for necessary accommodations to enable persons with disabilities to perform their roles effectively.2.Definition of Disability: The Court broadened the interpretation of “disability” to include conditions like writer's cramp, stressing that the impairment need not be visible or permanent as long as it hampers the individual’s ability to perform daily activities.3.Obligation of Employers:The Court held that employers, including public sector entities, have a duty to provide reasonable accommodations to employees with disabilities. This includes reassignment to suitable positions where the disability would not impede job performance.Legal Options and Steps for Your Case1. Request Reasonable Accommodations in Writing:Submit a formal, written request to your higher authorities and HR department, outlining your condition, its impact on your job performance, and the specific accommodations you are seeking. Reference is made to the RPWD Act and the Supreme Court judgement in Vikash Kumar v. UPSC.2. Consult with medical professionals:Obtain detailed medical documentation from your neurologist or other healthcare providers. These documents should describe your condition, its impact on your ability to write, and recommended accommodations.3. File a grievance:If your initial requests are ignored or denied, file a formal grievance through your bank’s internal grievance redressal mechanism. Make sure to document all instances of harassment and lack of accommodation.4. Approach the Equal Opportunity Cell (if available):Many public sector organisations have an Equal Opportunity Cell or a similar body responsible for addressing issues related to discrimination and accommodations for employees with disabilities. Approach this body with your complaint.5. Legal Action:If internal remedies fail, you can file a complaint with the Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities (CCPD) or the State Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities. These bodies have the authority to investigate and take action on complaints of non-compliance with the RPWD Act.You can also consider filing a writ petition in the High Court under Article 226 of theIndian Constitution, seeking a directive for your employer to provide reasonable accommodations and to stop the harassment.Relevant Case LawIn addition to Vikash Kumar v. UPSC, consider referencing these cases:Jeeja Ghosh & Anotherv.Union of India: This case reinforced the rights of persons with disabilities to equal treatment and accommodations.Bhavya Nainv.University of Delhi highlighted the need for reasonable accommodations in educational and employment settings for persons with disabilities.Your condition qualifies as a disability under the RPWD Act, and your employer is legally obligated to provide reasonable accommodations. The Supreme Court’s ruling in Vikash Kumar v. UPSC supports your case, emphasising the duty of employers to accommodate employees with disabilities. You have the right to request reassignment or other accommodations and to seek redress through internal grievance mechanisms or legal channels if necessary.Seek legal counsel to assist with drafting formal requests and potential legal actions. Your case highlights the need for compliance with disability rights legislation and the importance of creating an inclusive work environment.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Suffering from chronic neurological disorder and facing harassment at workplace",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The facts of the case:Vikash Kumar is the petitioner who gave the Civil Services Examination as organised by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). Specifically, he had the particularity of a certain type of learning disability that made him write significantly slowly.Due to his disability, Vikash Kumar had to write to the school principal, asking for permission for a scribe for the examination. However, his request was rejected by the UPSC on the basis that he failed to fulfil the regulatory requirements inevitably in regard to the availability of a scribe.Several pages offer an account of Vikash Kumar, who sought to appeal the UPSC refusal, arguing that his rights under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 had been violated. He argued that this piece of legislation required accommodations for individuals with disabilities to be reasonable to make necessary adjustments to prevent discrimination.High Court's Decision:The Honourable High Court of India endorsed the directives of the UPSC and dismissed the appeal of Vikash Kumar on the grounds that he did not fall under the criteria for scribe under the prevailing conditions and norms. Vikash Kumar appealed to S.C. of India; ultimately, the Honourable Apex Court took up the matter for consideration.Supreme Court's Decision:Some of the changes that were made included the reevaluation of the guidelines and criteria by the Supreme Court for providing scribes to persons with disabilities to do their writing for them with the intention of having a more inclusive approach. The Court underlined another key principle outlined in the RPwD Act, 2016, known as reasonable accommodation, which implies that it is necessary for the implementation of appropriate modifications and adjustments in order to ensure persons with disabilities exercise their rights.The judgement elucidated that the RPwD Act entitled Vikash Kumar to certain rights, including a scribe, if he were to request them, and Oudh had arbitrarily denied him that right. The Court added that the act requires one to be given an equal chance with no discrimination and to implement the act of reasonable accommodation as part of the mandate.Hence, the SC recommended that the UPSC reconsider its guidelines and provide candidature appropriate damages for disability that the UPSC deprives of disabled candidates by not letting them have a scribe and making it a criteria for examination so that their rights are being protected and they can also write their examinations in the best way possible.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,If you have provided representation along with a letter from NIMHANS Bengaluru about your condition when requesting reasonable accommodation from your branch manager but none has been responded to by the HR Department, it is wise to keep documentation of such communications. If a reasonable period has passed with no work being done or little progress is made for the student and myself,. Follow up with HR through a second email or letter if you do not receive a response to your initial message of introducing yourself. This should be done gently and diplomatically in an effort to remind them of your previous request. Emphasise its urgency. Enclose photocopies of previous communications along with the one received from NIMHANS.Furthermore, continue to remind the officer’s association of the absence of a reply from HR and enquire them to further support and fight for your rights. If you continue to be overwhelmed by your struggle, you should report the issue to the higher authorities of your organisation. Select a position at a higher level, such as senior HR manager or director. Obviously, describe actions that were taken beforehand that can contribute to the solution of the problem. Emphasise that you have received little or no response, especially with newer social media platforms.Correlatively, seek any legal advice that you would be in a position to take against any form of discrimination concerning medical conditions in the workplace with regard to reasonable accommodation. Although the study found that laws and regulations were weak and violated in food production, there is a need for research on the laws and regulations of different jurisdictions. For specific advice on this matter, it is advised to seek services from an employment lawyer. Use clean language and follow professional etiquette while writing.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Sir,I understand your challenging situation. According to the facts as narrated by you, your marital relationship is at a stage from where it can be saved, nothing would be better than mediation with help of common family/friend. I would suggest you to try to save your relationship as far as possible as you have a child too.But if you think that the situation is somewhere which is out of your hand and you may get trapped into false accusation by your partner then I would suggest you to:Keep a detailed record of all financial transactions, including the EMI payments you have made, personal loans, and any expenses related to the household and your wife’s personal needs.Maintain copies of all communications(chats or recordings) with your wife and in-laws, especially any threats or demands made.Communicate with your wifeCalculations of your total liabilities and financial burden, including home loan EMI, personal loans, and monthly expenses. Keep in mind that basic necessary expenses of child and wife are covered.As you pointed out that there was verbal agreement regarding sharing of Loan EMI but same has not been complied by your wife and only you are paying those EMIs thentry to document those verbal agreement regarding the EMI paymentsand her failure to contribute (if possibletry to communicate this thing with her on whatsapp chat so that she may respond (admit or deny or give any explanation)and keep screenshot of every communication before she delete same)Abandonment anddomestic violenceare serious allegations. Since you left Bangalore due to financial strain and conflicts, not with the intention to abandon, this context is crucial. You have to keep all the documents ready which shows that you left Bangalore in different circumstances. Try to communicate her over chats / calls and document/record same. Be calm and talk to her politely even if she instigates you.You have to gather evidences such as messages or witnesses to counter such false allegations. Restaurant bills / shopping bills etc also are good evidences.Talk to her and try for mediation through a neutral third party or mediator (if possible). This could help resolve issues without escalating to legal battles. Emphasize your willingness to support your wife and child but also explain your financial crunch.But keep copy/record of all the communication that you are doing.Before any interaction with police try to consult a lawyer(family and criminal cases), but before police officer remain calm and provide clear evidence to support your position.But the most important and crucial point here is:-If you have clear anticipation that your wife may file complaint against you then---Consult a lawyer immediately for taking legal recourse before she initiate any formal legal action or files any FIR.You should keep your family and close friends in loop and informed about your situation for emotional and practical support.It is crucial to handle the situation with a calm and strategic approachYou may consult me if you need further legal assistance.

    "question": "My wife is not willing to come to my place",
    "answer": "Dear Client,This is particularly paramount bearing in mind the above complications, which make it necessary to avoid haphazard advancement in this methodical approach to defend your interests and address the concerns adequately.To begin with, all the records should be kept in order, paying extra attention to your financial activities and the verbal agreements concluded with your wife. Documents to be compiled include the bank statements of EMI payments on the credit cards, written communications of the financial arrangements taken, and loan records incurred for household or personal reasons. It is useful in the event that there is a need to go to court due to some illegality. It is also important that any external influence, especially from in-laws, that has influenced your marriage in a negative way be included.Next, it is recommended to contact an attorney as soon as possible. If you’re unsure about your rights when going through the process, it would be wise to engage the services of a lawyer who focuses on family law. They can assist you in dealing with the notice that your wife has issued and can make you ready for any legal battle she might launch against you or any accusations she may make, such as abandonment, domestic abuse, and violence, among others. Your lawyer can also explain the legal consequences of your financial agreements and how they can be resolved, for example, by obtaining a legal resolution, continuing the legal process by obtaining legal separation, or seeking legal advice for an out-of-court settlement.Lastly, in this legal environment, it is the best if you keep talking to your wife calmly and in an understanding manner if you wish to reach a common agreement. You may wish to urge the suggestion to employ mediation as an option to address your disagreements without resorting to litigation. Should the situation worsen and legal processes are the only solution, your attorney will assist you with appropriate defence strategies and, possibly, claims for compensation for the monetary and, respectively, the emotional loss you have suffered.Hope this helps!Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Dismissing your first appeal for failure to appear because you did not appear means that the court did not hear the merits of the case but dismissed it because you (the plaintiff) or 'because of the absence of the representative. This is not a green flag for remarriage, as the original order from the Family Court still stands unless the Supreme Court taxes it so you need to look carefully at the next steps, especially while considering the ongoing appeal under Section125 CrPCand other pending matters.First, you can make an application to the Supreme Court to review the dismissed appeal. This application should explain why you did not show up and why the matter should be reconsidered. If the Supreme Court returns your appeal, it will be retried in the case. Secondly, as far as your ongoing Section125 CrPCcase is concerned, you can proceed to pursue it by submitting all relevant evidence and information, including the allegation that your wife has deserted you as a Hindu Section 13 of the Adoption and Maintenance Act (MHA) provides.As far as pending cases under Section 498-A of the IPC andDomestic ViolenceAct are concerned, it is necessary to present a strong defence and provide evidence that the allegations are false or fabricated to stay on top of. It will be useful to gather evidence such as witness testimony, communication records, and any documents that can support your version of events.

    "question": "Birth registration",
    "answer": "Dear Client,If you wish to change your daughter’s birth record and ensure that your name is mentioned as the biological father, you will have to go through the proper legal channels. First, visit the Indian Embassy in Bahrain to report the mishap and seek forms, as well as directions on how to go about changing the mentioned birth certificate. Depending on the birth registration process of the Indian mission, they will assist you with the documentary requirement, which normally consists of an affidavit, conclusive DNA results if available, a mother's consent, and her husband's consent, among other documents if need be. After making the first changes in Bahrain, take your daughter to India on an out-pass.

    "answer": "Hello, it depends upon future situation also and the will comes into operation only after death of will maker. Ensure that your parent have updated nominations for the property in the housing society records. While a nominee is not the legal owner, it helps in the interim management of the property until the probate process is completed.ORIf you dont want to get into technicality of probate then it is recommended to simplify the transfer process by having the property in joint names. If your parent include your and your sister's names as joint owners, the property can pass to the surviving joint owners without needing probate.ORFor more safest option (to bypass from risk of toxicity in relationship with sister) I would recommend you to ask your parent for HIBA. Although HIBA does not require registration but it would be best if same is written on Non-judicial Stamp Paper, Notarised and Attested by 2 independent witnesses. This will ensure that if in future any dispute arises then you can have some more evidence in your favour.Thanks!Rajveer SinghAdvocateRajveer SinghAdvocate, Ranchi31 AnswersTalk to Advocate Rajveer Singh"

    "question": "Registered will in Mumbai",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I am glad to learn that you are fully supportive of the plan and that your family has full support for it. Here are detailed answers to your questions to help simplify the process of estate transfer:First, regarding the registered will: In Mumbai, only a registered will can guarantee how your parents’ property is to be utilised due to the legal recognition of the will. Still, if ownership of a certain property, like a house in a society, is to be transferred, the will usually has to be probated. Probate, therefore, acts as the legal approval of the will and formal validation of the executor’s capacity to manage the estate. This can sometimes be viewed as a somewhat bureaucratic and lengthy process, but it helps to make certain that the will is fully legally binding, and it is a process that, if required, can be completed without any form of dispute. In this regard, it is wise to seek the services of an attorney to explain the probate procedures in Mumbai and any other associated issues.Second, if there are local provisions for what is called ‘ a transfer on death’, deed, your parents can consider making one, and through this, they could avoid probate court after their demise. It permits the property to be transferred to the beneficiaries through an assignment; hence, there is no need for the intervention of the probate court upon the owner’s death. consequently, they may consider establishing a trust. In this way, your parents can set terms on how the property should be split or turned over to you and your sister without the need for probate. A trust is an entity affiliated with a trustee; this would be responsible for the distribution of tangible and intangible assets as dictated by the terms of the trust deed.Ultimately, you and your sister can manage the property distribution without going through probate by entering into a family arrangement deed following the death of your parents. A mutual agreement among family members regarding the distribution of property is reflected in a family arrangement deed. By entering into this arrangement, the official probate process and its attendant costs may be avoided. To avoid future problems, it is imperative that the deed be well-drafted, unambiguous, and legally enforceable. In order to make sure that the family arrangement deed is enforceable and accurately represents the intentions of all parties, legal counsel should be sought out during its drafting and registration.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This would be a subject matter of Mohammedan personal law (which differs in its application among Shias and Sunnis). If a Muslim testator has not appointed an executor under his will, it is still valid.If voluntary probate is still desired, the beneficiaries can apply to the relevant court for a grant of Letter of Administration (LoA). The court on receiving satisfactory proof of valid execution of the will issues a LoA to the beneficiary who will then perform the duties of an administrator of the estate. An LoA may be granted to one or several people who may apply to the court, but note that the categories are broad and not limited to the heirs of the deceased. The beneficiaries are at liberty to attend the court proceedings but attendance of each and every beneficiary is not compulsory. It will be a matter of personal choice. Prior to the final grant or order and early in the process, the court is required to grant an opportunity to the beneficiaries to raise objections, if any.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

Joint account: Having a joint account with an \"either or survivor\" statement is a smart step. This ensures that the surviving account holder can access the funds after the death of the new account holder without legal impediments or probate requirements2. Registered Will: Your parents have done well in creating a registered will. A registered will is a strong legal document that will help them successfully transfer assets as they wish. It is advisable to keep a certified copy of the will and ensure that it is easily accessible.3. Avoid Probate: While a notary will make the process much easier, in order to avoid probate again, you may want to consider having your parents execute a \"Transfer on Death\" (TOD) deed for your w 'property, if appropriate in your jurisdiction. This document allows you and your sister to transfer your assets directly after your parents die and pass probate.By taking this step, you can ensure a smooth and easy transfer of assets, reducing the need for title deeds and legal complications.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Legally, you have several options to seek redress and accommodations. The Supreme Court's judgement in Vikash Kumar v. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) is indeed relevant to your situation. Here’s a detailed explanation:Facts and Decisions in Vikash Kumar v. UPSCIn Vikash Kumar v. UPSC (2021), the petitioner suffered from a similar neurological condition that impaired his writing ability. He requested reasonable accommodations to take a civil service examination, including the provision of a scribe. The UPSC rejected his request, prompting him to challenge their decision.The Supreme Court ruled in favour of Vikash Kumar, emphasising the following key points:1.Rights of Persons with Disabilities:The Court underscored the rights of individuals with disabilities to reasonable accommodations under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPWD Act). This Act mandates non-discrimination and provides for necessary accommodations to enable persons with disabilities to perform their roles effectively.2.Definition of Disability: The Court broadened the interpretation of “disability” to include conditions like writer's cramp, stressing that the impairment need not be visible or permanent as long as it hampers the individual’s ability to perform daily activities.3.Obligation of Employers:The Court held that employers, including public sector entities, have a duty to provide reasonable accommodations to employees with disabilities. This includes reassignment to suitable positions where the disability would not impede job performance.Legal Options and Steps for Your Case1. Request Reasonable Accommodations in Writing:Submit a formal, written request to your higher authorities and HR department, outlining your condition, its impact on your job performance, and the specific accommodations you are seeking. Reference is made to the RPWD Act and the Supreme Court judgement in Vikash Kumar v. UPSC.2. Consult with medical professionals:Obtain detailed medical documentation from your neurologist or other healthcare providers. These documents should describe your condition, its impact on your ability to write, and recommended accommodations.3. File a grievance:If your initial requests are ignored or denied, file a formal grievance through your bank’s internal grievance redressal mechanism. Make sure to document all instances of harassment and lack of accommodation.4. Approach the Equal Opportunity Cell (if available):Many public sector organisations have an Equal Opportunity Cell or a similar body responsible for addressing issues related to discrimination and accommodations for employees with disabilities. Approach this body with your complaint.5. Legal Action:If internal remedies fail, you can file a complaint with the Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities (CCPD) or the State Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities. These bodies have the authority to investigate and take action on complaints of non-compliance with the RPWD Act.You can also consider filing a writ petition in the High Court under Article 226 of theIndian Constitution, seeking a directive for your employer to provide reasonable accommodations and to stop the harassment.Relevant Case LawIn addition to Vikash Kumar v. UPSC, consider referencing these cases:Jeeja Ghosh & Anotherv.Union of India: This case reinforced the rights of persons with disabilities to equal treatment and accommodations.Bhavya Nainv.University of Delhi highlighted the need for reasonable accommodations in educational and employment settings for persons with disabilities.Your condition qualifies as a disability under the RPWD Act, and your employer is legally obligated to provide reasonable accommodations. The Supreme Court’s ruling in Vikash Kumar v. UPSC supports your case, emphasising the duty of employers to accommodate employees with disabilities. You have the right to request reassignment or other accommodations and to seek redress through internal grievance mechanisms or legal channels if necessary.Seek legal counsel to assist with drafting formal requests and potential legal actions. Your case highlights the need for compliance with disability rights legislation and the importance of creating an inclusive work environment.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The facts of the case:Vikash Kumar is the petitioner who gave the Civil Services Examination as organised by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). Specifically, he had the particularity of a certain type of learning disability that made him write significantly slowly.Due to his disability, Vikash Kumar had to write to the school principal, asking for permission for a scribe for the examination. However, his request was rejected by the UPSC on the basis that he failed to fulfil the regulatory requirements inevitably in regard to the availability of a scribe.Several pages offer an account of Vikash Kumar, who sought to appeal the UPSC refusal, arguing that his rights under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 had been violated. He argued that this piece of legislation required accommodations for individuals with disabilities to be reasonable to make necessary adjustments to prevent discrimination.High Court's Decision:The Honourable High Court of India endorsed the directives of the UPSC and dismissed the appeal of Vikash Kumar on the grounds that he did not fall under the criteria for scribe under the prevailing conditions and norms. Vikash Kumar appealed to S.C. of India; ultimately, the Honourable Apex Court took up the matter for consideration.Supreme Court's Decision:Some of the changes that were made included the reevaluation of the guidelines and criteria by the Supreme Court for providing scribes to persons with disabilities to do their writing for them with the intention of having a more inclusive approach. The Court underlined another key principle outlined in the RPwD Act, 2016, known as reasonable accommodation, which implies that it is necessary for the implementation of appropriate modifications and adjustments in order to ensure persons with disabilities exercise their rights.The judgement elucidated that the RPwD Act entitled Vikash Kumar to certain rights, including a scribe, if he were to request them, and Oudh had arbitrarily denied him that right. The Court added that the act requires one to be given an equal chance with no discrimination and to implement the act of reasonable accommodation as part of the mandate.Hence, the SC recommended that the UPSC reconsider its guidelines and provide candidature appropriate damages for disability that the UPSC deprives of disabled candidates by not letting them have a scribe and making it a criteria for examination so that their rights are being protected and they can also write their examinations in the best way possible.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Follow up with HR through a second email or letter if you do not receive a response to your initial message of introducing yourself. This should be done gently and diplomatically in an effort to remind them of your previous request. Emphasise its urgency. Enclose photocopies of previous communications along with the one received from NIMHANS.Furthermore, continue to remind the officer’s association of the absence of a reply from HR and enquire them to further support and fight for your rights.

    "question": "Builder not agreeing to register  sale  agreement",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Coming to the point, I suggest that you write to the builder and the bank formally and request that they remove the said clause from the tripartite agreement. When making your disapproval pertaining to the clause that may bar one from claiming an opportunity to sue or sue the other in relation to the property, it is crucial to be assertively clear. So cast a spell on a clause as highly prejudicial, unfair and unviable and state how its enforcement can actually have a negative effect on that particular contractual party.In the event that the builder and bank are not in a position to respond to your request to delete the clause, then it is time to seek a legal opinion. To overcome this issue, you better talk with the provider and try to negotiate with them or find another legal way to solve the issue with the help of an attorney. If those negotiations are never to yield any results or if they are to produce results which are not in good proportions for better negotiation, then perhaps it is time to rethink about the agreement in such terms since, during and after the construction phase, one will not have many channels to seek legal redress in case of any eventuality.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Dismissing your first appeal for failure to appear because you did not appear means that the court did not hear the merits of the case but dismissed it because you (the plaintiff) or 'because of the absence of the representative. This is not a green flag for remarriage, as the original order from the Family Court still stands unless the Supreme Court taxes it so you need to look carefully at the next steps, especially while considering the ongoing appeal under Section125 CrPCand other pending matters.First, you can make an application to the Supreme Court to review the dismissed appeal. This application should explain why you did not show up and why the matter should be reconsidered. If the Supreme Court returns your appeal, it will be retried in the case. Secondly, as far as your ongoing Section125 CrPCcase is concerned, you can proceed to pursue it by submitting all relevant evidence and information, including the allegation that your wife has deserted you as a Hindu Section 13 of the Adoption and Maintenance Act (MHA) provides.As far as pending cases under Section 498-A of the IPC andDomestic ViolenceAct are concerned, it is necessary to present a strong defence and provide evidence that the allegations are false or fabricated to stay on top of. It will be useful to gather evidence such as witness testimony, communication records, and any documents that can support your version of events.

First, visit the Indian Embassy in Bahrain to report the mishap and seek forms, as well as directions on how to go about changing the mentioned birth certificate. Depending on the birth registration process of the Indian mission, they will assist you with the documentary requirement, which normally consists of an affidavit, conclusive DNA results if available, a mother's consent, and her husband's consent, among other documents if need be. After making the first changes in Bahrain, take your daughter to India on an out-pass. After reaching India, it is necessary to go to the registrar of births and deaths with the documents, including the admissible birth certificate obtained from Bahrain, which has to be inscribed with the alterations in Indian records. In this process, you will be able to get her passport with the right parentage information.

If your parent include your and your sister's names as joint owners, the property can pass to the surviving joint owners without needing probate.ORFor more safest option (to bypass from risk of toxicity in relationship with sister) I would recommend you to ask your parent for HIBA. Although HIBA does not require registration but it would be best if same is written on Non-judicial Stamp Paper, Notarised and Attested by 2 independent witnesses.

    "question": "Registered will in Mumbai",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I am glad to learn that you are fully supportive of the plan and that your family has full support for it. Here are detailed answers to your questions to help simplify the process of estate transfer:First, regarding the registered will: In Mumbai, only a registered will can guarantee how your parents’ property is to be utilised due to the legal recognition of the will. Still, if ownership of a certain property, like a house in a society, is to be transferred, the will usually has to be probated. Probate, therefore, acts as the legal approval of the will and formal validation of the executor’s capacity to manage the estate. This can sometimes be viewed as a somewhat bureaucratic and lengthy process, but it helps to make certain that the will is fully legally binding, and it is a process that, if required, can be completed without any form of dispute. In this regard, it is wise to seek the services of an attorney to explain the probate procedures in Mumbai and any other associated issues.Second, if there are local provisions for what is called ‘ a transfer on death’, deed, your parents can consider making one, and through this, they could avoid probate court after their demise. It permits the property to be transferred to the beneficiaries through an assignment; hence, there is no need for the intervention of the probate court upon the owner’s death. consequently, they may consider establishing a trust. In this way, your parents can set terms on how the property should be split or turned over to you and your sister without the need for probate. A trust is an entity affiliated with a trustee; this would be responsible for the distribution of tangible and intangible assets as dictated by the terms of the trust deed.Ultimately, you and your sister can manage the property distribution without going through probate by entering into a family arrangement deed following the death of your parents. A mutual agreement among family members regarding the distribution of property is reflected in a family arrangement deed. By entering into this arrangement, the official probate process and its attendant costs may be avoided. To avoid future problems, it is imperative that the deed be well-drafted, unambiguous, and legally enforceable. In order to make sure that the family arrangement deed is enforceable and accurately represents the intentions of all parties, legal counsel should be sought out during its drafting and registration.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This would be a subject matter of Mohammedan personal law (which differs in its application among Shias and Sunnis). If a Muslim testator has not appointed an executor under his will, it is still valid.If voluntary probate is still desired, the beneficiaries can apply to the relevant court for a grant of Letter of Administration (LoA). The court on receiving satisfactory proof of valid execution of the will issues a LoA to the beneficiary who will then perform the duties of an administrator of the estate. An LoA may be granted to one or several people who may apply to the court, but note that the categories are broad and not limited to the heirs of the deceased. The beneficiaries are at liberty to attend the court proceedings but attendance of each and every beneficiary is not compulsory. It will be a matter of personal choice. Prior to the final grant or order and early in the process, the court is required to grant an opportunity to the beneficiaries to raise objections, if any.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

Joint account: Having a joint account with an \"either or survivor\" statement is a smart step. This ensures that the surviving account holder can access the funds after the death of the new account holder without legal impediments or probate requirements2. Registered Will: Your parents have done well in creating a registered will. A registered will is a strong legal document that will help them successfully transfer assets as they wish. It is advisable to keep a certified copy of the will and ensure that it is easily accessible.3. Avoid Probate: While a notary will make the process much easier, in order to avoid probate again, you may want to consider having your parents execute a \"Transfer on Death\" (TOD) deed for your w 'property, if appropriate in your jurisdiction. This document allows you and your sister to transfer your assets directly after your parents die and pass probate.By taking this step, you can ensure a smooth and easy transfer of assets, reducing the need for title deeds and legal complications.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "First appeal by wife against judgment in sec 13 HMA dismissed by HC",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Dismissing your first appeal for failure to appear because you did not appear means that the court did not hear the merits of the case but dismissed it because you (the plaintiff) or 'because of the absence of the representative. This is not a green flag for remarriage, as the original order from the Family Court still stands unless the Supreme Court taxes it so you need to look carefully at the next steps, especially while considering the ongoing appeal under Section125 CrPCand other pending matters.First, you can make an application to the Supreme Court to review the dismissed appeal. This application should explain why you did not show up and why the matter should be reconsidered. If the Supreme Court returns your appeal, it will be retried in the case. Secondly, as far as your ongoing Section125 CrPCcase is concerned, you can proceed to pursue it by submitting all relevant evidence and information, including the allegation that your wife has deserted you as a Hindu Section 13 of the Adoption and Maintenance Act (MHA) provides.As far as pending cases under Section 498-A of the IPC andDomestic ViolenceAct are concerned, it is necessary to present a strong defence and provide evidence that the allegations are false or fabricated to stay on top of. It will be useful to gather evidence such as witness testimony, communication records, and any documents that can support your version of events. If you can prove that the allegations are inconsistent or that the opponents lack strong evidence, they can continue to help you with this information.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Builder not agreeing to register  sale  agreement",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Coming to the point, I suggest that you write to the builder and the bank formally and request that they remove the said clause from the tripartite agreement. When making your disapproval pertaining to the clause that may bar one from claiming an opportunity to sue or sue the other in relation to the property, it is crucial to be assertively clear. So cast a spell on a clause as highly prejudicial, unfair and unviable and state how its enforcement can actually have a negative effect on that particular contractual party.In the event that the builder and bank are not in a position to respond to your request to delete the clause, then it is time to seek a legal opinion. To overcome this issue, you better talk with the provider and try to negotiate with them or find another legal way to solve the issue with the help of an attorney. If those negotiations are never to yield any results or if they are to produce results which are not in good proportions for better negotiation, then perhaps it is time to rethink about the agreement in such terms since, during and after the construction phase, one will not have many channels to seek legal redress in case of any eventuality.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Marriage registration under Special Marriage Act and validity of prenuptial agreement",
    "answer": "Dear Client,To ensure the felony binding of a prenuptial agreement under theSpecial Marriage Actin India, each event has to publish complete documentation through the registration system. This includes valid identity proofs, start certificates, passport-sized pix, and a testimony affirming the marital repute of each event. The prenuptial agreement itself must be in writing, signed at each event, and preferably notarized. Additionally, it needs to be performed before the wedding takes place and ought to be honest and equitable, voluntarily entered into by using both events without any duress or coercion. Legal consultation and the presence of impartial prison counsel for both parties are fantastically advocated to ensure the agreement's validity.Despite those precautions, certain clauses in prenuptial agreements can be considered null and void by Indian courts. Any clauses that are in opposition to public coverage, together with people who inspire divorce, waive the right to child aid, or include provisions that might be deemed unfair or unconscionable, will no longer be enforceable. Additionally, any conditions that try to predetermine child custody or parenting time, as these subjects are exclusively beneath the jurisdiction of the courts and are determined based totally on the best interests of the kid, can also be invalid. Ensuring the agreement complies with Indian laws and does not contain these sorts of clauses is crucial for its enforceability.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can I travel abroad with court order",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Communication from the SP Office to ImmigrationThe communication from the SP Office to the immigration authorities likely clarified your legal status and confirmed that no arrest warrant was issued against you. This would have reassured the immigration officials that, while an LOC was active, it did not necessitate immediate detention or arrest. The SP Office might have also communicated any specific instructions, such as your requirement to attend court hearings, which allowed the immigration officials to proceed accordingly.Eligibility to Travel with Court OrderSince the court order explicitly states that you should attend all court hearings and does not impose any travel restrictions, you are generally eligible to travel. The court's lack of mention regarding travel restrictions implies that you are free to travel, provided you return for your court hearings. Always carry a copy of this court order when traveling to demonstrate your compliance with legal requirements.Status of Your LOCThe fact that you were allowed to travel after the SP Office communicated with the immigration officials suggests that the immediate concerns of the LOC were addressed, at least temporarily. However, this does not necessarily mean the LOC is revoked or lifted permanently. The LOC may still be active, and its enforcement could vary depending on the specifics of your case and the instructions from the SP Office.-Travel Preparations: Keep Documentation: Always take a copy of the court mandate with you when traveling. This will be important in demonstrating that you are following the court's orders. Legal Disclaimer: Check with your attorney before traveling to make sure you do not have anything pending that may interfere with your travel plans.-If Stopped by Immigration: Court Order: A court order which says that no implied order not to travel Inform them all you are doing is complying with the court order by going to all court hearing-Talking: You ask for immigration staff members to check in with the SP Office or elsewhere to confirm your status.Hope this helps!Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Response to a defamation notice based on falsifications",
    "answer": "Dear Client,As the President of a Resident Welfare Association (RWA), your primary duty is to ensure the smooth functioning and maintenance of society. Facing a defamation notice, especially under such contentious circumstances, can be daunting. Here is a comprehensive approach to address the defamation notice and tackle ongoing harassment, with relevant legal provisions and strategies.Understanding Defamation and Relevant Legal ProvisionsDefamation Law in India:Defamation, under Indian law, is addressed under Section 499 of theIndian Penal Code(IPC), 1860, which defines defamation and Section 500 of the IPC which prescribes punishment for defamation.Section 499 IPC: Defamation involves making or publishing any imputation concerning any person, intending to harm, or knowing or having reason to believe that such imputation will harm the reputation of such person.Section 500 of the IPCProvides for punishment with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, with a fine, or with both.To constitute defamation, three elements must be established:1. Imputation: There must be an imputation made or published.2. Harm: The imputation must be made with the intention of harming the reputation of the person.3. Knowledge: The imputation must be known or reasonably believed to harm the person’s reputation.Civil Defamation: The person aggrieved can also file a civil suit claiming damages for defamation.Steps to Respond to the Defamation Notice1. Engage Legal Counsel:Immediately consult a lawyer experienced in defamation cases. They will help you draft a formal response to the defamation notice and guide you through the legal intricacies.2. Prepare a Detailed response:Your response should clarify the context in which the statements were made. Emphasise the ongoing issues with maintenance dues and the obstruction of entry and exit points. Highlight that the statements made in the WhatsApp group were in response to the disruptive behaviour, not intended to defame but to inform and manage the situation.3. Evidence Collection:Compile all evidence that supports your claims, including video footage of the entry/exit blockade, records of bounced checks, and any communications related to the maintenance dues.Document the sequence of events, including the interaction with the police and any witness statements from other residents.4. Justification and Truth Defence:Under Section 499 IPC, truth is a defence to defamation if the statement was made for the public good. Emphasise that your statement was true and made in the interest of the society's members’ welfare.Addressing the Ongoing Harassment1. File a Police complaint:lodge a detailed complaint against the defaulter for harassment, obstruction, and disruption of peace. Since there is already a bias, ensure the complaint is comprehensive and includes all supporting evidence.If the local police are unresponsive, escalate the matter to higher authorities, such as the District Superintendent of Police or the State Human Rights Commission.2. Civil Suit for Injunction:Consider filing a civil suit seeking an injunction against the defaulter from harassing you and other society members. This can include an order to restrain him from blocking entry and exit points and interfering with society’s functioning.3. Society’s Legal Framework:Ensure the society’s rules and regulations are documented and followed. The RWA can impose penalties on defaulters as per the society’s bylaws. Seek legal advice on enforcing these bylaws effectively.Case Law on Defamation and Public Good:Subramanian Swamyv.Union of India, Ministry of Law (2016): The Supreme Court upheld that truth and public good are valid defences against defamation.Consumer Protection Act, 2019:If the defaulter’s actions are severely affecting the living conditions in society, the RWA may file a complaint under theConsumer Protection Actfor unfair trade practices, if applicable.Responding to a defamation notice and addressing ongoing harassment requires a strategic and legally sound approach. By engaging legal counsel, preparing a robust response, collecting evidence, and leveraging relevant legal provisions, you can effectively counter the defamation claims and protect your rights and reputation. Simultaneously, taking steps to mitigate ongoing harassment through legal channels will ensure the smooth functioning of society and uphold the rule of law.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client, I understand this is a challenging situation for you.As per the lease deed, the rent escalation clause states that there should be a 5% escalation on the rent after completion of 11 months every year. This means that the rent increase should apply immediately after the completion of 11 months from the start of the lease in 2020. Therefore, the rent should have been increased in 2021 and every year thereafter.If the landlord is now claiming arrears for the increased rent since 2021, and you have been paying the same rent since 2020 without any prior communication from the landlord, there may be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the lease agreement.Try to negotiate with the landlord to reach a mutual understanding regarding the rent arrears.

    "question": "Rent increase and arrears",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here’s a detailed analysis and response to your questions based on the lease agreement and relevant legal provisions:Lease Agreement Interpretation:Question #1: When is the rent increase applicable?Lease Clause: “The lease shall be for a period of 3 years beginning on October 21, 2020, and renewable with 5% escalation on the rent after completion of 11 months every year.”Based on this clause, the rent increase is applicable every year after the completion of 11 months, not after the lease renewal in 2023. Therefore, the first increase would have been due on September 21, 2021, the second on August 21, 2022, and the third on July 21, 2023.Question #2: Landlord’s Claim for ArrearsSince the landlord has never raised this issue before and there was no communication regarding the rent increase, there are certain considerations under the law:Legal Provisions and Principles:1. \"Contractual Terms\":Section 70 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872: When a person lawfully does something for another person or delivers something to him without intending to do so gratuitously, and the other person enjoys the benefit thereof, the latter is bound to make compensation to the former in respect of, or to restore, the thing so done or delivered.Section 115 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872: Estoppel by conduct, where if a person has, by his declaration, act, or omission, intentionally caused or permitted another person to believe a thing to be true and to act upon such belief, neither he nor his representative shall be allowed, in any suit or proceeding between himself and such person or his representative, to deny the truth of that thing.2. Reasonableness and Communication:Section 106 of theTransfer of Property Act, 1882: In the absence of a contract or local law or usage to the contrary, a lease of immovable property shall be deemed to be a lease from month to month, terminable, on the part of either the lessor or the lessee, by 15 days’ notice expiring with the end of a month of the tenancy.The landlord’s delay in raising the issue of rent increases and the absence of any prior communication may be considered unreasonable and could be argued to have waived the right to claim the increased rent retroactively.Steps to take:1. Review the Lease Agreement: Carefully read the lease agreement again to ensure there are no additional clauses that clarify the rent escalation terms.2. Communicate with the Landlord: Write a formal letter or email to the landlord expressing your understanding of the lease agreement. State that there was no prior communication regarding the rent increase and that you have been paying the agreed rent of Rs. 23,000 per month.3. Negotiate a Settlement: If the landlord insists on the arrears, negotiate a possible settlement. Given the absence of prior communication and the sudden demand for arrears, you can argue for a reduction or a waiver of the alleged outstanding amount.4. Seek Legal Advice: Consult a legal expert specialising in property or tenancy law. They can help draft a formal response and guide you on how to proceed if the landlord continues to demand the arrears.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "If the original agreement fixed in the year was 23000, the enhanced rent @ 5% is payable in the year 2021, which will be 24150 and the same is payable at Rs. 25360  in the year 2022 and it amounts to 26630 in the year 2023 and it will be Rs. 27960 in the year 2024.Therefore the demand for Rs. 40,000 in the year as monthly rental amount is exorbitant.You can calculate the arrears of rental amount due to the difference in enhancement every year and inform him that you can pay that amount as well the actual amount as per the calculation given above.You can refuse to pay exorbitant rental amount and also refuse to vacate, besides you can approach the rent control court or civil court seeking an order of injunction agaisnt the landlord to restrain him from forcibly evicting you other than by due process of law.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Rent increase and arrears",
    "answer": "Dear Client,So, this is what you can do...Review the Original AgreementEscalation Clause: For instance, if the initial agreement for salary increment was at 5 percent annually, they expect you to stick to the same formula unless a new arrangement is made and put down in writing.Expiry of Agreement: Specifically, when the initial deal concluded in 2018, there have been no extensions or new conditions set to replace it; however, you operate legally on a month-to-month basis until new terms and conditions are established.Communication and NegotiationDiscussion with Landlord: You should also try to speak to the landlord regarding the rent rise that is in place for the flat. Point out that since the escalation of the rate was not accompanied by a new agreement on the matter or a new contract, the raise should be implemented strictly in accordance with the increase previously agreed upon.Written Agreement: Better make sure that any new terms are put in writing so that others can’t take advantage in the same way in the future.Legal StandpointValidity of Rent Increase: Unless the landlord secures a new signature for a new agreement, legal means exist that forbid this action, by which the landlord begins to unilaterally alter the terms of the rent and demands back payments according to those terms.Payment of Arrears: You remain bound by the terms of the original agreement and thereby you will be expected to pay the arrears as outlined by the 5% escalation clause, not the new rate which has been singly decided.Steps to TakeArrears calculated on the original terms and conditions Working in this calculation The formula in working with this calculation The formula in working with this calculation The formula in working with this calculation Arrears calculated based on the above-mentioned original terms and conditions can be determined by the following calculations: Working in this calculation: Arrears = Credit terms – Actual payment Credit terms are the original terms that were agreed upon between the supplier and the buyer while the actualBased on this seeming disparity, determine the new total rent which is 5% above your last agreed rent, and then calculate the rent arrears from October 2023 to May 2024.Communicate Your PositionDraft a letter or email to the landlord explaining your position. It is also important to confirm that there is a new agreement or an extension on the previous deadline. For that reason, state it in writing that: The current terms apply, including the 5% escalation clause due to the lack of a new agreement.In conclusion, based on the current tenancy agreement that has not been altered, you cannot be expected to pay the arrears based on the new rent demand of Rs. 40, 000 without a new agreement being initiated and signed. You should work on the escalations based on the provisions of the agreement where the rate increases by 5% every year and that should be communicated to the landlord. Moreover, it is always useful to talk to a legal professional to ensure your rights are covered and to manage potential conflict.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Marriage registration under Special Marriage Act and validity of prenuptial agreement",
    "answer": "Dear Client,To ensure the felony binding of a prenuptial agreement under theSpecial Marriage Actin India, each event has to publish complete documentation through the registration system. This includes valid identity proofs, start certificates, passport-sized pix, and a testimony affirming the marital repute of each event. The prenuptial agreement itself must be in writing, signed at each event, and preferably notarized. Additionally, it needs to be performed before the wedding takes place and ought to be honest and equitable, voluntarily entered into by using both events without any duress or coercion. Legal consultation and the presence of impartial prison counsel for both parties are fantastically advocated to ensure the agreement's validity.Despite those precautions, certain clauses in prenuptial agreements can be considered null and void by Indian courts. Any clauses that are in opposition to public coverage, together with people who inspire divorce, waive the right to child aid, or include provisions that might be deemed unfair or unconscionable, will no longer be enforceable. Additionally, any conditions that try to predetermine child custody or parenting time, as these subjects are exclusively beneath the jurisdiction of the courts and are determined based totally on the best interests of the kid, can also be invalid. Ensuring the agreement complies with Indian laws and does not contain these sorts of clauses is crucial for its enforceability.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The SP Office might have also communicated any specific instructions, such as your requirement to attend court hearings, which allowed the immigration officials to proceed accordingly.Eligibility to Travel with Court OrderSince the court order explicitly states that you should attend all court hearings and does not impose any travel restrictions, you are generally eligible to travel. The court's lack of mention regarding travel restrictions implies that you are free to travel, provided you return for your court hearings. Always carry a copy of this court order when traveling to demonstrate your compliance with legal requirements.Status of Your LOCThe fact that you were allowed to travel after the SP Office communicated with the immigration officials suggests that the immediate concerns of the LOC were addressed, at least temporarily. However, this does not necessarily mean the LOC is revoked or lifted permanently. The LOC may still be active, and its enforcement could vary depending on the specifics of your case and the instructions from the SP Office.-Travel Preparations: Keep Documentation: Always take a copy of the court mandate with you when traveling. This will be important in demonstrating that you are following the court's orders.

Since you have agreed and accepted the terms as stated in the lease agreement you are bound by the clauses and have to pay the arrears of rental amount as well as the enhanced rental amount whether the landlord has intimated to you earlier or not.Please note that the enhancement of monthly rental amount shall be given effect after completion of one year i.e., 12 months and not on completion of 11 months, this clause of increase in monthly rental amount after 11 months  makes no sense and cannot be legally valid.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Rent increase and arrears",
    "answer": "Dear Client, I understand this is a challenging situation for you.As per the lease deed, the rent escalation clause states that there should be a 5% escalation on the rent after completion of 11 months every year. This means that the rent increase should apply immediately after the completion of 11 months from the start of the lease in 2020. Therefore, the rent should have been increased in 2021 and every year thereafter.If the landlord is now claiming arrears for the increased rent since 2021, and you have been paying the same rent since 2020 without any prior communication from the landlord, there may be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the lease agreement.Try to negotiate with the landlord to reach a mutual understanding regarding the rent arrears. If there was a genuine misunderstanding or lack of communication, you may be able to come to a resolution without legal intervention.If you are satisfied with the reply, kindly give me a 5 star rating.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay Highcourt.Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "answer": "1. As per Karnataka Rent Act, 1999, the landlord can lawfully increase the rent per year by an amount not exceeding ten percent of such cost.- Hence, the rent will be applicable after completion of 12 months and not 11 months.2. The rent can be increased if there is clause mentioned in the lease deed/rent agreement , otherwise legally the landlord cannot increase the rent in the absence of any agreement.- Hence, if there is no clause in the agreement then you can deny to pay the sameMohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Rent increase and arrears",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here’s a detailed analysis and response to your questions based on the lease agreement and relevant legal provisions:Lease Agreement Interpretation:Question #1: When is the rent increase applicable?Lease Clause: “The lease shall be for a period of 3 years beginning on October 21, 2020, and renewable with 5% escalation on the rent after completion of 11 months every year.”Based on this clause, the rent increase is applicable every year after the completion of 11 months, not after the lease renewal in 2023. Therefore, the first increase would have been due on September 21, 2021, the second on August 21, 2022, and the third on July 21, 2023.Question #2: Landlord’s Claim for ArrearsSince the landlord has never raised this issue before and there was no communication regarding the rent increase, there are certain considerations under the law:Legal Provisions and Principles:1. \"Contractual Terms\":Section 70 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872: When a person lawfully does something for another person or delivers something to him without intending to do so gratuitously, and the other person enjoys the benefit thereof, the latter is bound to make compensation to the former in respect of, or to restore, the thing so done or delivered.Section 115 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872: Estoppel by conduct, where if a person has, by his declaration, act, or omission, intentionally caused or permitted another person to believe a thing to be true and to act upon such belief, neither he nor his representative shall be allowed, in any suit or proceeding between himself and such person or his representative, to deny the truth of that thing.2. Reasonableness and Communication:Section 106 of theTransfer of Property Act, 1882: In the absence of a contract or local law or usage to the contrary, a lease of immovable property shall be deemed to be a lease from month to month, terminable, on the part of either the lessor or the lessee, by 15 days’ notice expiring with the end of a month of the tenancy.The landlord’s delay in raising the issue of rent increases and the absence of any prior communication may be considered unreasonable and could be argued to have waived the right to claim the increased rent retroactively.Steps to take:1. Review the Lease Agreement: Carefully read the lease agreement again to ensure there are no additional clauses that clarify the rent escalation terms.2. Communicate with the Landlord: Write a formal letter or email to the landlord expressing your understanding of the lease agreement. State that there was no prior communication regarding the rent increase and that you have been paying the agreed rent of Rs. 23,000 per month.3. Negotiate a Settlement: If the landlord insists on the arrears, negotiate a possible settlement. Given the absence of prior communication and the sudden demand for arrears, you can argue for a reduction or a waiver of the alleged outstanding amount.4. Seek Legal Advice: Consult a legal expert specialising in property or tenancy law. They can help draft a formal response and guide you on how to proceed if the landlord continues to demand the arrears.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Rent increase and arrears",
    "answer": "If the original agreement fixed in the year was 23000, the enhanced rent @ 5% is payable in the year 2021, which will be 24150 and the same is payable at Rs. 25360  in the year 2022 and it amounts to 26630 in the year 2023 and it will be Rs. 27960 in the year 2024.Therefore the demand for Rs. 40,000 in the year as monthly rental amount is exorbitant.You can calculate the arrears of rental amount due to the difference in enhancement every year and inform him that you can pay that amount as well the actual amount as per the calculation given above.You can refuse to pay exorbitant rental amount and also refuse to vacate, besides you can approach the rent control court or civil court seeking an order of injunction agaisnt the landlord to restrain him from forcibly evicting you other than by due process of law.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,So, this is what you can do...Review the Original AgreementEscalation Clause: For instance, if the initial agreement for salary increment was at 5 percent annually, they expect you to stick to the same formula unless a new arrangement is made and put down in writing.Expiry of Agreement: Specifically, when the initial deal concluded in 2018, there have been no extensions or new conditions set to replace it; however, you operate legally on a month-to-month basis until new terms and conditions are established.Communication and NegotiationDiscussion with Landlord: You should also try to speak to the landlord regarding the rent rise that is in place for the flat. Point out that since the escalation of the rate was not accompanied by a new agreement on the matter or a new contract, the raise should be implemented strictly in accordance with the increase previously agreed upon.Written Agreement: Better make sure that any new terms are put in writing so that others can’t take advantage in the same way in the future.Legal StandpointValidity of Rent Increase: Unless the landlord secures a new signature for a new agreement, legal means exist that forbid this action, by which the landlord begins to unilaterally alter the terms of the rent and demands back payments according to those terms.Payment of Arrears: You remain bound by the terms of the original agreement and thereby you will be expected to pay the arrears as outlined by the 5% escalation clause, not the new rate which has been singly decided.Steps to TakeArrears calculated on the original terms and conditions Working in this calculation The formula in working with this calculation The formula in working with this calculation The formula in working with this calculation Arrears calculated based on the above-mentioned original terms and conditions can be determined by the following calculations: Working in this calculation: Arrears = Credit terms – Actual payment Credit terms are the original terms that were agreed upon between the supplier and the buyer while the actualBased on this seeming disparity, determine the new total rent which is 5% above your last agreed rent, and then calculate the rent arrears from October 2023 to May 2024.Communicate Your PositionDraft a letter or email to the landlord explaining your position. It is also important to confirm that there is a new agreement or an extension on the previous deadline. For that reason, state it in writing that: The current terms apply, including the 5% escalation clause due to the lack of a new agreement.In conclusion, based on the current tenancy agreement that has not been altered, you cannot be expected to pay the arrears based on the new rent demand of Rs. 40, 000 without a new agreement being initiated and signed. You should work on the escalations based on the provisions of the agreement where the rate increases by 5% every year and that should be communicated to the landlord. Moreover, it is always useful to talk to a legal professional to ensure your rights are covered and to manage potential conflict.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Marriage registration under Special Marriage Act and validity of prenuptial agreement",
    "answer": "Dear Client,To ensure the felony binding of a prenuptial agreement under theSpecial Marriage Actin India, each event has to publish complete documentation through the registration system. This includes valid identity proofs, start certificates, passport-sized pix, and a testimony affirming the marital repute of each event. The prenuptial agreement itself must be in writing, signed at each event, and preferably notarized. Additionally, it needs to be performed before the wedding takes place and ought to be honest and equitable, voluntarily entered into by using both events without any duress or coercion. Legal consultation and the presence of impartial prison counsel for both parties are fantastically advocated to ensure the agreement's validity.Despite those precautions, certain clauses in prenuptial agreements can be considered null and void by Indian courts. Any clauses that are in opposition to public coverage, together with people who inspire divorce, waive the right to child aid, or include provisions that might be deemed unfair or unconscionable, will no longer be enforceable. Additionally, any conditions that try to predetermine child custody or parenting time, as these subjects are exclusively beneath the jurisdiction of the courts and are determined based totally on the best interests of the kid, can also be invalid. Ensuring the agreement complies with Indian laws and does not contain these sorts of clauses is crucial for its enforceability.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The SP Office might have also communicated any specific instructions, such as your requirement to attend court hearings, which allowed the immigration officials to proceed accordingly.Eligibility to Travel with Court OrderSince the court order explicitly states that you should attend all court hearings and does not impose any travel restrictions, you are generally eligible to travel. The court's lack of mention regarding travel restrictions implies that you are free to travel, provided you return for your court hearings. Always carry a copy of this court order when traveling to demonstrate your compliance with legal requirements.Status of Your LOCThe fact that you were allowed to travel after the SP Office communicated with the immigration officials suggests that the immediate concerns of the LOC were addressed, at least temporarily. However, this does not necessarily mean the LOC is revoked or lifted permanently. The LOC may still be active, and its enforcement could vary depending on the specifics of your case and the instructions from the SP Office.-Travel Preparations: Keep Documentation: Always take a copy of the court mandate with you when traveling. This will be important in demonstrating that you are following the court's orders.

    "answer": "Dear Client,I understand your concerns regarding the use of an alias name in official documents and its implications. Here’s some general information that may help address your queries:School Admission:Schools typically require a birth certificate for admission, and they should accept the name listed on the birth certificate.If the birth certificate includes an alias, it’s advisable to have consistent documentation. If all other documents are in the maiden surname, it would be beneficial to have the birth certificate reflect the same.Travel Abroad:For visa applications, especially for minors, the birth certificate is a crucial document. Consistency across all documents is key.If the mother’s name on the birth certificate includes an alias, it’s important to ensure that the same name is reflected in the child’s passport and other travel documents.Visa Applications with Single Name:Having a single name or an alias should not inherently cause issues for visa applications, as long as all documents are consistent and the alias is legally recognised.The father’s name being mentioned on the birth certificate is standard and should not pose a problem as long as the child’s identity is clear and verifiable.Regarding the official nature of an alias, it is generally recognised in legal documents if it has been used consistently and is backed by legal procedures such as a gazette notification or court order. It’s important to ensure that all legal documents reflect the name change or alias usage to avoid complications.For passports, the official name without the alias is typically printed. However, if there has been a legal name change, supporting documents can be provided to update the passport accordingly.Given the complexity of legal and bureaucratic processes, it’s always best to consult with a legal professional who can provide specific guidance based on the laws and regulations applicable to your situation. They can assist you in ensuring that all documents are correctly aligned and legally recognised, which is essential for school admissions, travel, and other official purposes."

    "question": "Can I travel abroad with court order",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Communication from the SP Office to ImmigrationThe communication from the SP Office to the immigration authorities likely clarified your legal status and confirmed that no arrest warrant was issued against you. This would have reassured the immigration officials that, while an LOC was active, it did not necessitate immediate detention or arrest. The SP Office might have also communicated any specific instructions, such as your requirement to attend court hearings, which allowed the immigration officials to proceed accordingly.Eligibility to Travel with Court OrderSince the court order explicitly states that you should attend all court hearings and does not impose any travel restrictions, you are generally eligible to travel. The court's lack of mention regarding travel restrictions implies that you are free to travel, provided you return for your court hearings. Always carry a copy of this court order when traveling to demonstrate your compliance with legal requirements.Status of Your LOCThe fact that you were allowed to travel after the SP Office communicated with the immigration officials suggests that the immediate concerns of the LOC were addressed, at least temporarily. However, this does not necessarily mean the LOC is revoked or lifted permanently. The LOC may still be active, and its enforcement could vary depending on the specifics of your case and the instructions from the SP Office.-Travel Preparations: Keep Documentation: Always take a copy of the court mandate with you when traveling. This will be important in demonstrating that you are following the court's orders. Legal Disclaimer: Check with your attorney before traveling to make sure you do not have anything pending that may interfere with your travel plans.-If Stopped by Immigration: Court Order: A court order which says that no implied order not to travel Inform them all you are doing is complying with the court order by going to all court hearing-Talking: You ask for immigration staff members to check in with the SP Office or elsewhere to confirm your status.Hope this helps!Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Child maintenance",
    "answer": "1. There is no criteria to determine minimum or maximum maintenance for child support as it majorly depends on factors like -* Earning of parents*Standard of living of parties*Expenses of childwhich differs from case to case.2. In a case where a lumpsum amount is demanded, a future prospect of expenses of child (for atleast 10 year) must be considered.For example if your wife is asking for 20L rupees and if we break down the sum 20L into 10 years 20L ÷10 = 2L will be the maintenance per year and if we further break it into months 2L ÷12 = 16,666 rupees per month.So monthly maintenance of your child demand by your wife is approx 17000 rupees Which is considered to be a nominal amount for maintenance where both the parents are earning well.3. If the gold items were given by your friends to your wife than it becomes sole property of your wife only and you can not claim it back as once a thing is given to a wife by anyone its become her stridhan and she has absolute right over it.Vishek VatsAdvocate, Delhi90 AnswersTalk to Advocate Vishek Vats"

    "question": "Child maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Optimal Child Maintenance Amount:In India, there is no fixed formula for calculating child maintenance, but the courts often consider the income and financial capacity of both parents, as well as the needs of the child.TheHindu Marriage Actsuggests that the spouse can receive at least 25% of the partner’s net income for both her and the child’s maintenance, while Supreme Court judgements clarify that child maintenance should be a reasonable percentage of the non-custodial parent’s income, often falling within the range of 15–30%.Lump Sum Child Maintenance:A demand for a ₹20L lump sum for child maintenance needs to be evaluated based on the child’s needs, the duration of support required, and the parents’ financial capacity.The court may consider a lump-sum payment if it’s in the child’s best interest and aligns with the financial realities of both parents.Retrieving personal items:Generally, you have the right to retrieve any personal belongings that were left at your former residence, including items like jewellery.If these items were used as collateral for loans or sold without your consent, you may need to take legal action to recover them or their value."

    "question": "Child maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The optimal amount for child maintenance depends on various factors, such as the child's needs, the parents' financial resources, and the standard of living the child is accustomed to. In your case, with your ex-wife's monthly net income of ₹1.04 lakh and your income of ₹1.1 lakh per month, the court will likely consider both parents' financial capabilities and the child's needs to determine a fair amount for child maintenance. The court may order you to pay a portion of your income towards child support, but the exact amount will depend on the specific circumstances of your case.Demanding a ₹20 lakh lump sum as child maintenance may not be rational, as it is a significant amount and may not be necessary for the child's immediate needs. The court will likely consider the child's actual expenses and the parents' financial resources to determine a reasonable amount for child maintenance, which may be paid in installments or on a monthly basis.Regarding the retrieval of the gold items and money, it is important to determine theownershipof these assets. If the gold items were given to you as a wedding present, they may be considered your personal property. However, if they were given to both you and your ex-wife jointly, or if they were used for the family's benefit, the court may consider them as marital assets subject to division. The same applies to the ₹2 lakh used for real estate purchases. If the money was used for the family's benefit, the court may consider it as a marital asset.For more details you can please take paid consultancy.If you are satisfied with the reply, kindly give me a 5 star rating.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay Highcourt.Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "context": "Asked 12 months ago in Family Law Religion: Other",
    "question": "Divorce on the basis of cruelty",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Mental cruelty can indeed be grounds for divorce under Indian law. TheHindu Marriage Act, 1955, specifically Section 13(1)(ia), allows for divorce on the grounds of cruelty, which includes both physical and mental harm.To file for divorce on the basis of mental cruelty, you would need to demonstrate that your wife’s behaviour is of such a nature that it causes you mental pain and suffering to the extent that it is not possible for you to live with her. The behaviour must be grave and substantial, not just the ordinary wear and tear of married life.The Supreme Court of India has provided guidelines on what constitutes mental cruelty, including acts that cause significant suffering, disrupt communication, or intentionally undermine a person’s credibility in a marriage. In your case, the physical abuse, constant fighting, disrespect towards your parents, and her excessive involvement with her own parents to the detriment of your marital relationship could potentially be considered grounds for mental cruelty.However, it’s important to have detailed and documented evidence of the incidents of cruelty. This can include witnesses, medical reports (if there’s physical abuse), or any other relevant documentation. A lawyer can help you gather the necessary evidence and guide you through the process of filing for divorce.It’s also crucial to consider the well-being of your child in this situation. The court will take into account the best interests of the child when making decisions regarding custody and visitation rights.If you decide to proceed with the divorce, I would strongly recommend consulting with a family lawyer who can provide personalised legal advice and represent you in court. They can also help mediate and possibly resolve the issues without going to court, which can be beneficial for all parties involved, especially the child."

    "question": "Response to a defamation notice based on falsifications",
    "answer": "Dear Client,As the President of a Resident Welfare Association (RWA), your primary duty is to ensure the smooth functioning and maintenance of society. Facing a defamation notice, especially under such contentious circumstances, can be daunting. Here is a comprehensive approach to address the defamation notice and tackle ongoing harassment, with relevant legal provisions and strategies.Understanding Defamation and Relevant Legal ProvisionsDefamation Law in India:Defamation, under Indian law, is addressed under Section 499 of theIndian Penal Code(IPC), 1860, which defines defamation and Section 500 of the IPC which prescribes punishment for defamation.Section 499 IPC: Defamation involves making or publishing any imputation concerning any person, intending to harm, or knowing or having reason to believe that such imputation will harm the reputation of such person.Section 500 of the IPCProvides for punishment with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, with a fine, or with both.To constitute defamation, three elements must be established:1. Imputation: There must be an imputation made or published.2. Harm: The imputation must be made with the intention of harming the reputation of the person.3. Knowledge: The imputation must be known or reasonably believed to harm the person’s reputation.Civil Defamation: The person aggrieved can also file a civil suit claiming damages for defamation.Steps to Respond to the Defamation Notice1. Engage Legal Counsel:Immediately consult a lawyer experienced in defamation cases. They will help you draft a formal response to the defamation notice and guide you through the legal intricacies.2. Prepare a Detailed response:Your response should clarify the context in which the statements were made. Emphasise the ongoing issues with maintenance dues and the obstruction of entry and exit points. Highlight that the statements made in the WhatsApp group were in response to the disruptive behaviour, not intended to defame but to inform and manage the situation.3. Evidence Collection:Compile all evidence that supports your claims, including video footage of the entry/exit blockade, records of bounced checks, and any communications related to the maintenance dues.Document the sequence of events, including the interaction with the police and any witness statements from other residents.4. Justification and Truth Defence:Under Section 499 IPC, truth is a defence to defamation if the statement was made for the public good. Emphasise that your statement was true and made in the interest of the society's members’ welfare.Addressing the Ongoing Harassment1. File a Police complaint:lodge a detailed complaint against the defaulter for harassment, obstruction, and disruption of peace. Since there is already a bias, ensure the complaint is comprehensive and includes all supporting evidence.If the local police are unresponsive, escalate the matter to higher authorities, such as the District Superintendent of Police or the State Human Rights Commission.2. Civil Suit for Injunction:Consider filing a civil suit seeking an injunction against the defaulter from harassing you and other society members. This can include an order to restrain him from blocking entry and exit points and interfering with society’s functioning.3. Society’s Legal Framework:Ensure the society’s rules and regulations are documented and followed. The RWA can impose penalties on defaulters as per the society’s bylaws. Seek legal advice on enforcing these bylaws effectively.Case Law on Defamation and Public Good:Subramanian Swamyv.Union of India, Ministry of Law (2016): The Supreme Court upheld that truth and public good are valid defences against defamation.Consumer Protection Act, 2019:If the defaulter’s actions are severely affecting the living conditions in society, the RWA may file a complaint under theConsumer Protection Actfor unfair trade practices, if applicable.Responding to a defamation notice and addressing ongoing harassment requires a strategic and legally sound approach. By engaging legal counsel, preparing a robust response, collecting evidence, and leveraging relevant legal provisions, you can effectively counter the defamation claims and protect your rights and reputation. Simultaneously, taking steps to mitigate ongoing harassment through legal channels will ensure the smooth functioning of society and uphold the rule of law.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Regarding birth certificate",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I understand your concerns regarding the use of an alias name in official documents and its implications. Here’s some general information that may help address your queries:School Admission:Schools typically require a birth certificate for admission, and they should accept the name listed on the birth certificate.If the birth certificate includes an alias, it’s advisable to have consistent documentation. If all other documents are in the maiden surname, it would be beneficial to have the birth certificate reflect the same.Travel Abroad:For visa applications, especially for minors, the birth certificate is a crucial document. Consistency across all documents is key.If the mother’s name on the birth certificate includes an alias, it’s important to ensure that the same name is reflected in the child’s passport and other travel documents.Visa Applications with Single Name:Having a single name or an alias should not inherently cause issues for visa applications, as long as all documents are consistent and the alias is legally recognised.The father’s name being mentioned on the birth certificate is standard and should not pose a problem as long as the child’s identity is clear and verifiable.Regarding the official nature of an alias, it is generally recognised in legal documents if it has been used consistently and is backed by legal procedures such as a gazette notification or court order. It’s important to ensure that all legal documents reflect the name change or alias usage to avoid complications.For passports, the official name without the alias is typically printed. However, if there has been a legal name change, supporting documents can be provided to update the passport accordingly.Given the complexity of legal and bureaucratic processes, it’s always best to consult with a legal professional who can provide specific guidance based on the laws and regulations applicable to your situation. They can assist you in ensuring that all documents are correctly aligned and legally recognised, which is essential for school admissions, travel, and other official purposes."

    "answer": "Dear Client,1. Applications for Visas and PassportsEnsure that Gunjita Tuteja is consistently included on all of her current documentation, including her birth certificate, passport, Aadhar, and PAN.- Notice in the Gazette: Even though you have reversed the name using the already-existing documentation, the proper way to officially change a name is through a gazette notification. Consider getting a gazette notice verifying the name change from Gunjita Sukhija to Gunjita Tuteja in order to avoid problems in the future. This can prevent any inconsistencies and act as an official record.2. Entrance to Schools and Other Official ConcernsVerify the consistency of all the paperwork you submit for official reasons, such as school applications. Should any document still bear the married surname Gunjita Sukhija, you may be required to substantiate the name change with more documentation.Declaration: Make an affidavit stating that there is a name change. This can be used to verify her identification in addition to other paperwork.Obtain Notification in the Gazette (Optional but Recommended)Apply for Notification in the Gazette: File a name change application with the official gazette. Usually, this entails submitting an affidavit, a marriage licence, if any, and identification documentation with the maiden surname.Publicise in the Gazette: Save a copy of the gazette as formal documentation of the name change after it is announced.Make a Declaration of IntentWrite a Declaration: Compose a declaration affirming that Gunjita Sukhija and Gunjita Tuteja are the same individual and that her name has been changed back to her original surname.Sign and date the affidavit. Have a notary public notarize the affidavit.Make Sure All Documents Are ConsistentExamine Every Document: Make sure that Gunjita Tuteja's name appears on all current documentation, including your birth certificate, passport, Aadhar, and PAN.Make any necessary corrections: Update any documents that still have the married surname on them by following the appropriate processes.Keep all of the proofs close at hand.- Document Copies: To be presented as needed, maintain copies of all pertinent documents, such as the affidavit and gazette notification (if acquired).- Clear Communication: Provide all necessary supporting documentation and fully explain the name change when applying for passports, visas, school admissions, or other official purposes.In summary, you can prevent future issues by making sure all of the documentation is consistent and by getting an affidavit and gazette notification.

    "question": "Child maintenance",
    "answer": "1. There is no criteria to determine minimum or maximum maintenance for child support as it majorly depends on factors like -* Earning of parents*Standard of living of parties*Expenses of childwhich differs from case to case.2. In a case where a lumpsum amount is demanded, a future prospect of expenses of child (for atleast 10 year) must be considered.For example if your wife is asking for 20L rupees and if we break down the sum 20L into 10 years 20L ÷10 = 2L will be the maintenance per year and if we further break it into months 2L ÷12 = 16,666 rupees per month.So monthly maintenance of your child demand by your wife is approx 17000 rupees Which is considered to be a nominal amount for maintenance where both the parents are earning well.3. If the gold items were given by your friends to your wife than it becomes sole property of your wife only and you can not claim it back as once a thing is given to a wife by anyone its become her stridhan and she has absolute right over it.Vishek VatsAdvocate, Delhi90 AnswersTalk to Advocate Vishek Vats"

    "question": "Child maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Optimal Child Maintenance Amount:In India, there is no fixed formula for calculating child maintenance, but the courts often consider the income and financial capacity of both parents, as well as the needs of the child.TheHindu Marriage Actsuggests that the spouse can receive at least 25% of the partner’s net income for both her and the child’s maintenance, while Supreme Court judgements clarify that child maintenance should be a reasonable percentage of the non-custodial parent’s income, often falling within the range of 15–30%.Lump Sum Child Maintenance:A demand for a ₹20L lump sum for child maintenance needs to be evaluated based on the child’s needs, the duration of support required, and the parents’ financial capacity.The court may consider a lump-sum payment if it’s in the child’s best interest and aligns with the financial realities of both parents.Retrieving personal items:Generally, you have the right to retrieve any personal belongings that were left at your former residence, including items like jewellery.If these items were used as collateral for loans or sold without your consent, you may need to take legal action to recover them or their value."

    "question": "Child maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The optimal amount for child maintenance depends on various factors, such as the child's needs, the parents' financial resources, and the standard of living the child is accustomed to. In your case, with your ex-wife's monthly net income of ₹1.04 lakh and your income of ₹1.1 lakh per month, the court will likely consider both parents' financial capabilities and the child's needs to determine a fair amount for child maintenance. The court may order you to pay a portion of your income towards child support, but the exact amount will depend on the specific circumstances of your case.Demanding a ₹20 lakh lump sum as child maintenance may not be rational, as it is a significant amount and may not be necessary for the child's immediate needs. The court will likely consider the child's actual expenses and the parents' financial resources to determine a reasonable amount for child maintenance, which may be paid in installments or on a monthly basis.Regarding the retrieval of the gold items and money, it is important to determine theownershipof these assets. If the gold items were given to you as a wedding present, they may be considered your personal property. However, if they were given to both you and your ex-wife jointly, or if they were used for the family's benefit, the court may consider them as marital assets subject to division. The same applies to the ₹2 lakh used for real estate purchases. If the money was used for the family's benefit, the court may consider it as a marital asset.For more details you can please take paid consultancy.If you are satisfied with the reply, kindly give me a 5 star rating.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay Highcourt.Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "question": "My mother Gift Deed to Daughter in law where 2 sons are there",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In situations involving property and family relations, it’s crucial to handle matters delicately and in accordance with the law. Here’s some general information that might help guide you:Gift Deed Considerations: A gift deed is a legal instrument used to transfer property voluntarily without compensation. In India, theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, governs the process of gifting property. The donor must be solvent and should not use the gift deed as a tool for tax evasion or illegal gains. Once a gift deed is registered, it signifies the change in ownership and is generally irrevocable.Partition Deed and Inheritance: Your mother’s property, if purchased solely by her and not inherited or acquired from your father, is typically considered her self-acquired property. She has the right to gift it to anyone she chooses. However, if your brother claims that your father contributed financially to the purchase of the property, he might challenge the gift deed by asserting that the property should be considered part of your father’s estate and, therefore, subject to inheritance laws.Avoiding Disputes: To avoid potential disputes, it’s advisable to have clear documentation proving that the property was indeed purchased by your mother with her own funds, if that’s the case. If your father did contribute, it might be prudent to reach a family settlement that acknowledges your brother’s concerns and seeks an amicable resolution.Tax Implications: Regarding taxation, if the property is gifted to you or your wife, the donee may be liable to pay taxes based on the market value of the property, as per the Income Tax Act. It’s important to consult with a tax advisor to understand the implications fully.Legal Advice: Given the complexity of property laws and the potential for familial conflict, it’s highly recommended to seek legal advice from a property lawyer who can provide personalised guidance based on all the facts of your case. A lawyer can help ensure that any transfer of property is done legally and with consideration of all parties’ rights and obligations.Remember, each situation is unique, and the above information is general in nature. Legal counsel can offer more specific guidance tailored to your circumstances."

    "question": "Response to a defamation notice based on falsifications",
    "answer": "Dear Client,As the President of a Resident Welfare Association (RWA), your primary duty is to ensure the smooth functioning and maintenance of society. Facing a defamation notice, especially under such contentious circumstances, can be daunting. Here is a comprehensive approach to address the defamation notice and tackle ongoing harassment, with relevant legal provisions and strategies.Understanding Defamation and Relevant Legal ProvisionsDefamation Law in India:Defamation, under Indian law, is addressed under Section 499 of theIndian Penal Code(IPC), 1860, which defines defamation and Section 500 of the IPC which prescribes punishment for defamation.Section 499 IPC: Defamation involves making or publishing any imputation concerning any person, intending to harm, or knowing or having reason to believe that such imputation will harm the reputation of such person.Section 500 of the IPCProvides for punishment with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, with a fine, or with both.To constitute defamation, three elements must be established:1. Imputation: There must be an imputation made or published.2. Harm: The imputation must be made with the intention of harming the reputation of the person.3. Knowledge: The imputation must be known or reasonably believed to harm the person’s reputation.Civil Defamation: The person aggrieved can also file a civil suit claiming damages for defamation.Steps to Respond to the Defamation Notice1. Engage Legal Counsel:Immediately consult a lawyer experienced in defamation cases. They will help you draft a formal response to the defamation notice and guide you through the legal intricacies.2. Prepare a Detailed response:Your response should clarify the context in which the statements were made. Emphasise the ongoing issues with maintenance dues and the obstruction of entry and exit points. Highlight that the statements made in the WhatsApp group were in response to the disruptive behaviour, not intended to defame but to inform and manage the situation.3. Evidence Collection:Compile all evidence that supports your claims, including video footage of the entry/exit blockade, records of bounced checks, and any communications related to the maintenance dues.Document the sequence of events, including the interaction with the police and any witness statements from other residents.4. Justification and Truth Defence:Under Section 499 IPC, truth is a defence to defamation if the statement was made for the public good. Emphasise that your statement was true and made in the interest of the society's members’ welfare.Addressing the Ongoing Harassment1. File a Police complaint:lodge a detailed complaint against the defaulter for harassment, obstruction, and disruption of peace. Since there is already a bias, ensure the complaint is comprehensive and includes all supporting evidence.If the local police are unresponsive, escalate the matter to higher authorities, such as the District Superintendent of Police or the State Human Rights Commission.2. Civil Suit for Injunction:Consider filing a civil suit seeking an injunction against the defaulter from harassing you and other society members. This can include an order to restrain him from blocking entry and exit points and interfering with society’s functioning.3. Society’s Legal Framework:Ensure the society’s rules and regulations are documented and followed. The RWA can impose penalties on defaulters as per the society’s bylaws. Seek legal advice on enforcing these bylaws effectively.Case Law on Defamation and Public Good:Subramanian Swamyv.Union of India, Ministry of Law (2016): The Supreme Court upheld that truth and public good are valid defences against defamation.Consumer Protection Act, 2019:If the defaulter’s actions are severely affecting the living conditions in society, the RWA may file a complaint under theConsumer Protection Actfor unfair trade practices, if applicable.Responding to a defamation notice and addressing ongoing harassment requires a strategic and legally sound approach. By engaging legal counsel, preparing a robust response, collecting evidence, and leveraging relevant legal provisions, you can effectively counter the defamation claims and protect your rights and reputation. Simultaneously, taking steps to mitigate ongoing harassment through legal channels will ensure the smooth functioning of society and uphold the rule of law.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Child maintenance",
    "answer": "1. There is no criteria to determine minimum or maximum maintenance for child support as it majorly depends on factors like -* Earning of parents*Standard of living of parties*Expenses of childwhich differs from case to case.2. In a case where a lumpsum amount is demanded, a future prospect of expenses of child (for atleast 10 year) must be considered.For example if your wife is asking for 20L rupees and if we break down the sum 20L into 10 years 20L ÷10 = 2L will be the maintenance per year and if we further break it into months 2L ÷12 = 16,666 rupees per month.So monthly maintenance of your child demand by your wife is approx 17000 rupees Which is considered to be a nominal amount for maintenance where both the parents are earning well.3. If the gold items were given by your friends to your wife than it becomes sole property of your wife only and you can not claim it back as once a thing is given to a wife by anyone its become her stridhan and she has absolute right over it.Vishek VatsAdvocate, Delhi90 AnswersTalk to Advocate Vishek Vats"

    "question": "Child maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Optimal Child Maintenance Amount:In India, there is no fixed formula for calculating child maintenance, but the courts often consider the income and financial capacity of both parents, as well as the needs of the child.TheHindu Marriage Actsuggests that the spouse can receive at least 25% of the partner’s net income for both her and the child’s maintenance, while Supreme Court judgements clarify that child maintenance should be a reasonable percentage of the non-custodial parent’s income, often falling within the range of 15–30%.Lump Sum Child Maintenance:A demand for a ₹20L lump sum for child maintenance needs to be evaluated based on the child’s needs, the duration of support required, and the parents’ financial capacity.The court may consider a lump-sum payment if it’s in the child’s best interest and aligns with the financial realities of both parents.Retrieving personal items:Generally, you have the right to retrieve any personal belongings that were left at your former residence, including items like jewellery.If these items were used as collateral for loans or sold without your consent, you may need to take legal action to recover them or their value."

    "question": "Child maintenance",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The optimal amount for child maintenance depends on various factors, such as the child's needs, the parents' financial resources, and the standard of living the child is accustomed to. In your case, with your ex-wife's monthly net income of ₹1.04 lakh and your income of ₹1.1 lakh per month, the court will likely consider both parents' financial capabilities and the child's needs to determine a fair amount for child maintenance. The court may order you to pay a portion of your income towards child support, but the exact amount will depend on the specific circumstances of your case.Demanding a ₹20 lakh lump sum as child maintenance may not be rational, as it is a significant amount and may not be necessary for the child's immediate needs. The court will likely consider the child's actual expenses and the parents' financial resources to determine a reasonable amount for child maintenance, which may be paid in installments or on a monthly basis.Regarding the retrieval of the gold items and money, it is important to determine theownershipof these assets. If the gold items were given to you as a wedding present, they may be considered your personal property. However, if they were given to both you and your ex-wife jointly, or if they were used for the family's benefit, the court may consider them as marital assets subject to division. The same applies to the ₹2 lakh used for real estate purchases. If the money was used for the family's benefit, the court may consider it as a marital asset.For more details you can please take paid consultancy.If you are satisfied with the reply, kindly give me a 5 star rating.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay Highcourt.Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "question": "My mother Gift Deed to Daughter in law where 2 sons are there",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In situations involving property and family relations, it’s crucial to handle matters delicately and in accordance with the law. Here’s some general information that might help guide you:Gift Deed Considerations: A gift deed is a legal instrument used to transfer property voluntarily without compensation. In India, theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, governs the process of gifting property. The donor must be solvent and should not use the gift deed as a tool for tax evasion or illegal gains. Once a gift deed is registered, it signifies the change in ownership and is generally irrevocable.Partition Deed and Inheritance: Your mother’s property, if purchased solely by her and not inherited or acquired from your father, is typically considered her self-acquired property. She has the right to gift it to anyone she chooses. However, if your brother claims that your father contributed financially to the purchase of the property, he might challenge the gift deed by asserting that the property should be considered part of your father’s estate and, therefore, subject to inheritance laws.Avoiding Disputes: To avoid potential disputes, it’s advisable to have clear documentation proving that the property was indeed purchased by your mother with her own funds, if that’s the case. If your father did contribute, it might be prudent to reach a family settlement that acknowledges your brother’s concerns and seeks an amicable resolution.Tax Implications: Regarding taxation, if the property is gifted to you or your wife, the donee may be liable to pay taxes based on the market value of the property, as per the Income Tax Act. It’s important to consult with a tax advisor to understand the implications fully.Legal Advice: Given the complexity of property laws and the potential for familial conflict, it’s highly recommended to seek legal advice from a property lawyer who can provide personalised guidance based on all the facts of your case. A lawyer can help ensure that any transfer of property is done legally and with consideration of all parties’ rights and obligations.Remember, each situation is unique, and the above information is general in nature. Legal counsel can offer more specific guidance tailored to your circumstances."

    "question": "Leaving the company before notice period",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I understand your situation, and it’s quite common for employees to face such dilemmas when transitioning between jobs. As per Indian employment law, the notice period is a significant part of the employment contract, and both parties are expected to honour it. The purpose of the notice period is to give the employer time to find a replacement and to ensure a smooth transition without disrupting the workflow.If you’ve offered compensation in lieu of the notice period and your employer is not accepting it, they are within their rights to ask you to serve the full notice period as per the terms of your employment contract. However, if your new employer is willing to accept you with just a resignation acceptance, you may consider negotiating further with your current employer or seeking a mutual agreement.Legally speaking, if you leave without serving the full notice period and without the consent of your current employer, they may take legal action against you for breach of contract. This could include withholding your final settlement, demanding payment for the remaining notice period, or even filing a lawsuit for damages if they can prove that your early departure caused significant harm to the company.It’s important to review your employment contract and understand the specific terms regarding the notice period. If there’s a clause that allows for paying compensation in lieu of notice, you could potentially argue that you’ve fulfilled your contractual obligations by offering the compensation.In any case, it’s advisable to handle the situation diplomatically to avoid any potential legal issues. You might want to have a candid conversation with your HR department or seek the assistance of a legal professional to explore your options and ensure that you’re making an informed decision."

    "context": "Asked 12 months ago in Family Law Religion: Other",
    "question": "Divorce on the basis of cruelty",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Mental cruelty can indeed be grounds for divorce under Indian law. TheHindu Marriage Act, 1955, specifically Section 13(1)(ia), allows for divorce on the grounds of cruelty, which includes both physical and mental harm.To file for divorce on the basis of mental cruelty, you would need to demonstrate that your wife’s behaviour is of such a nature that it causes you mental pain and suffering to the extent that it is not possible for you to live with her. The behaviour must be grave and substantial, not just the ordinary wear and tear of married life.The Supreme Court of India has provided guidelines on what constitutes mental cruelty, including acts that cause significant suffering, disrupt communication, or intentionally undermine a person’s credibility in a marriage. In your case, the physical abuse, constant fighting, disrespect towards your parents, and her excessive involvement with her own parents to the detriment of your marital relationship could potentially be considered grounds for mental cruelty.However, it’s important to have detailed and documented evidence of the incidents of cruelty. This can include witnesses, medical reports (if there’s physical abuse), or any other relevant documentation. A lawyer can help you gather the necessary evidence and guide you through the process of filing for divorce.It’s also crucial to consider the well-being of your child in this situation. The court will take into account the best interests of the child when making decisions regarding custody and visitation rights.If you decide to proceed with the divorce, I would strongly recommend consulting with a family lawyer who can provide personalised legal advice and represent you in court. They can also help mediate and possibly resolve the issues without going to court, which can be beneficial for all parties involved, especially the child."

    "question": "Regarding birth certificate",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I understand your concerns regarding the use of an alias name in official documents and its implications. Here’s some general information that may help address your queries:School Admission:Schools typically require a birth certificate for admission, and they should accept the name listed on the birth certificate.If the birth certificate includes an alias, it’s advisable to have consistent documentation. If all other documents are in the maiden surname, it would be beneficial to have the birth certificate reflect the same.Travel Abroad:For visa applications, especially for minors, the birth certificate is a crucial document. Consistency across all documents is key.If the mother’s name on the birth certificate includes an alias, it’s important to ensure that the same name is reflected in the child’s passport and other travel documents.Visa Applications with Single Name:Having a single name or an alias should not inherently cause issues for visa applications, as long as all documents are consistent and the alias is legally recognised.The father’s name being mentioned on the birth certificate is standard and should not pose a problem as long as the child’s identity is clear and verifiable.Regarding the official nature of an alias, it is generally recognised in legal documents if it has been used consistently and is backed by legal procedures such as a gazette notification or court order. It’s important to ensure that all legal documents reflect the name change or alias usage to avoid complications.For passports, the official name without the alias is typically printed. However, if there has been a legal name change, supporting documents can be provided to update the passport accordingly.Given the complexity of legal and bureaucratic processes, it’s always best to consult with a legal professional who can provide specific guidance based on the laws and regulations applicable to your situation. They can assist you in ensuring that all documents are correctly aligned and legally recognised, which is essential for school admissions, travel, and other official purposes."

    "question": "My mother Gift Deed to Daughter in law where 2 sons are there",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In situations involving property and family relations, it’s crucial to handle matters delicately and in accordance with the law. Here’s some general information that might help guide you:Gift Deed Considerations: A gift deed is a legal instrument used to transfer property voluntarily without compensation. In India, theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, governs the process of gifting property. The donor must be solvent and should not use the gift deed as a tool for tax evasion or illegal gains. Once a gift deed is registered, it signifies the change in ownership and is generally irrevocable.Partition Deed and Inheritance: Your mother’s property, if purchased solely by her and not inherited or acquired from your father, is typically considered her self-acquired property. She has the right to gift it to anyone she chooses. However, if your brother claims that your father contributed financially to the purchase of the property, he might challenge the gift deed by asserting that the property should be considered part of your father’s estate and, therefore, subject to inheritance laws.Avoiding Disputes: To avoid potential disputes, it’s advisable to have clear documentation proving that the property was indeed purchased by your mother with her own funds, if that’s the case. If your father did contribute, it might be prudent to reach a family settlement that acknowledges your brother’s concerns and seeks an amicable resolution.Tax Implications: Regarding taxation, if the property is gifted to you or your wife, the donee may be liable to pay taxes based on the market value of the property, as per the Income Tax Act. It’s important to consult with a tax advisor to understand the implications fully.Legal Advice: Given the complexity of property laws and the potential for familial conflict, it’s highly recommended to seek legal advice from a property lawyer who can provide personalised guidance based on all the facts of your case. A lawyer can help ensure that any transfer of property is done legally and with consideration of all parties’ rights and obligations.Remember, each situation is unique, and the above information is general in nature. Legal counsel can offer more specific guidance tailored to your circumstances."

    "question": "Response to a defamation notice based on falsifications",
    "answer": "Dear Client,As the President of a Resident Welfare Association (RWA), your primary duty is to ensure the smooth functioning and maintenance of society. Facing a defamation notice, especially under such contentious circumstances, can be daunting. Here is a comprehensive approach to address the defamation notice and tackle ongoing harassment, with relevant legal provisions and strategies.Understanding Defamation and Relevant Legal ProvisionsDefamation Law in India:Defamation, under Indian law, is addressed under Section 499 of theIndian Penal Code(IPC), 1860, which defines defamation and Section 500 of the IPC which prescribes punishment for defamation.Section 499 IPC: Defamation involves making or publishing any imputation concerning any person, intending to harm, or knowing or having reason to believe that such imputation will harm the reputation of such person.Section 500 of the IPCProvides for punishment with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, with a fine, or with both.To constitute defamation, three elements must be established:1. Imputation: There must be an imputation made or published.2. Harm: The imputation must be made with the intention of harming the reputation of the person.3. Knowledge: The imputation must be known or reasonably believed to harm the person’s reputation.Civil Defamation: The person aggrieved can also file a civil suit claiming damages for defamation.Steps to Respond to the Defamation Notice1. Engage Legal Counsel:Immediately consult a lawyer experienced in defamation cases. They will help you draft a formal response to the defamation notice and guide you through the legal intricacies.2. Prepare a Detailed response:Your response should clarify the context in which the statements were made. Emphasise the ongoing issues with maintenance dues and the obstruction of entry and exit points. Highlight that the statements made in the WhatsApp group were in response to the disruptive behaviour, not intended to defame but to inform and manage the situation.3. Evidence Collection:Compile all evidence that supports your claims, including video footage of the entry/exit blockade, records of bounced checks, and any communications related to the maintenance dues.Document the sequence of events, including the interaction with the police and any witness statements from other residents.4. Justification and Truth Defence:Under Section 499 IPC, truth is a defence to defamation if the statement was made for the public good. Emphasise that your statement was true and made in the interest of the society's members’ welfare.Addressing the Ongoing Harassment1. File a Police complaint:lodge a detailed complaint against the defaulter for harassment, obstruction, and disruption of peace. Since there is already a bias, ensure the complaint is comprehensive and includes all supporting evidence.If the local police are unresponsive, escalate the matter to higher authorities, such as the District Superintendent of Police or the State Human Rights Commission.2. Civil Suit for Injunction:Consider filing a civil suit seeking an injunction against the defaulter from harassing you and other society members. This can include an order to restrain him from blocking entry and exit points and interfering with society’s functioning.3. Society’s Legal Framework:Ensure the society’s rules and regulations are documented and followed. The RWA can impose penalties on defaulters as per the society’s bylaws. Seek legal advice on enforcing these bylaws effectively.Case Law on Defamation and Public Good:Subramanian Swamyv.Union of India, Ministry of Law (2016): The Supreme Court upheld that truth and public good are valid defences against defamation.Consumer Protection Act, 2019:If the defaulter’s actions are severely affecting the living conditions in society, the RWA may file a complaint under theConsumer Protection Actfor unfair trade practices, if applicable.Responding to a defamation notice and addressing ongoing harassment requires a strategic and legally sound approach. By engaging legal counsel, preparing a robust response, collecting evidence, and leveraging relevant legal provisions, you can effectively counter the defamation claims and protect your rights and reputation. Simultaneously, taking steps to mitigate ongoing harassment through legal channels will ensure the smooth functioning of society and uphold the rule of law.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "My mother Gift Deed to Daughter in law where 2 sons are there",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In situations involving property and family relations, it’s crucial to handle matters delicately and in accordance with the law. Here’s some general information that might help guide you:Gift Deed Considerations: A gift deed is a legal instrument used to transfer property voluntarily without compensation. In India, theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, governs the process of gifting property. The donor must be solvent and should not use the gift deed as a tool for tax evasion or illegal gains. Once a gift deed is registered, it signifies the change in ownership and is generally irrevocable.Partition Deed and Inheritance: Your mother’s property, if purchased solely by her and not inherited or acquired from your father, is typically considered her self-acquired property. She has the right to gift it to anyone she chooses. However, if your brother claims that your father contributed financially to the purchase of the property, he might challenge the gift deed by asserting that the property should be considered part of your father’s estate and, therefore, subject to inheritance laws.Avoiding Disputes: To avoid potential disputes, it’s advisable to have clear documentation proving that the property was indeed purchased by your mother with her own funds, if that’s the case. If your father did contribute, it might be prudent to reach a family settlement that acknowledges your brother’s concerns and seeks an amicable resolution.Tax Implications: Regarding taxation, if the property is gifted to you or your wife, the donee may be liable to pay taxes based on the market value of the property, as per the Income Tax Act. It’s important to consult with a tax advisor to understand the implications fully.Legal Advice: Given the complexity of property laws and the potential for familial conflict, it’s highly recommended to seek legal advice from a property lawyer who can provide personalised guidance based on all the facts of your case. A lawyer can help ensure that any transfer of property is done legally and with consideration of all parties’ rights and obligations.Remember, each situation is unique, and the above information is general in nature. Legal counsel can offer more specific guidance tailored to your circumstances."

    "question": "Leaving the company before notice period",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I understand your situation, and it’s quite common for employees to face such dilemmas when transitioning between jobs. As per Indian employment law, the notice period is a significant part of the employment contract, and both parties are expected to honour it. The purpose of the notice period is to give the employer time to find a replacement and to ensure a smooth transition without disrupting the workflow.If you’ve offered compensation in lieu of the notice period and your employer is not accepting it, they are within their rights to ask you to serve the full notice period as per the terms of your employment contract. However, if your new employer is willing to accept you with just a resignation acceptance, you may consider negotiating further with your current employer or seeking a mutual agreement.Legally speaking, if you leave without serving the full notice period and without the consent of your current employer, they may take legal action against you for breach of contract. This could include withholding your final settlement, demanding payment for the remaining notice period, or even filing a lawsuit for damages if they can prove that your early departure caused significant harm to the company.It’s important to review your employment contract and understand the specific terms regarding the notice period. If there’s a clause that allows for paying compensation in lieu of notice, you could potentially argue that you’ve fulfilled your contractual obligations by offering the compensation.In any case, it’s advisable to handle the situation diplomatically to avoid any potential legal issues. You might want to have a candid conversation with your HR department or seek the assistance of a legal professional to explore your options and ensure that you’re making an informed decision."

    "context": "Asked 12 months ago in Family Law Religion: Other",
    "question": "Divorce on the basis of cruelty",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Mental cruelty can indeed be grounds for divorce under Indian law. TheHindu Marriage Act, 1955, specifically Section 13(1)(ia), allows for divorce on the grounds of cruelty, which includes both physical and mental harm.To file for divorce on the basis of mental cruelty, you would need to demonstrate that your wife’s behaviour is of such a nature that it causes you mental pain and suffering to the extent that it is not possible for you to live with her. The behaviour must be grave and substantial, not just the ordinary wear and tear of married life.The Supreme Court of India has provided guidelines on what constitutes mental cruelty, including acts that cause significant suffering, disrupt communication, or intentionally undermine a person’s credibility in a marriage. In your case, the physical abuse, constant fighting, disrespect towards your parents, and her excessive involvement with her own parents to the detriment of your marital relationship could potentially be considered grounds for mental cruelty.However, it’s important to have detailed and documented evidence of the incidents of cruelty. This can include witnesses, medical reports (if there’s physical abuse), or any other relevant documentation. A lawyer can help you gather the necessary evidence and guide you through the process of filing for divorce.It’s also crucial to consider the well-being of your child in this situation. The court will take into account the best interests of the child when making decisions regarding custody and visitation rights.If you decide to proceed with the divorce, I would strongly recommend consulting with a family lawyer who can provide personalised legal advice and represent you in court. They can also help mediate and possibly resolve the issues without going to court, which can be beneficial for all parties involved, especially the child."

The intention of the accused person should be of such a nature that it is likely to insult and provoke the other person thus the nature of the intention matters.3) The accused has the knowledge that such provocation would cause the person to break the public peace or under the influence of which, he can commit some other offence.4) Any use of words by which someone can be offended is enough to constitute insult for the purpose of this Section.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In India, the use of abusive language or cursing can potentially invoke certain sections of theIndian Penal Code(IPC), depending on the nature and context of the words used. If the language used by the elderly lady is considered abusive or insulting with the intent to provoke a breach of peace, it could fall under:Section 504 IPC: This section deals with intentional insults with the intent to provoke a breach of peace. If the cursing is intended to insult and provoke someone to the point where it could cause a disturbance, this section may be invoked.Section 294 IPC: This section pertains to obscene acts and songs in public places. If the cursing is considered obscene and causes annoyance to others, it could be considered under this section.However, it’s important to note that the context and intent behind the words are crucial. The mental state of the person, especially if they are under mental stress, stigma, or depression, as well as the relationship between the parties involved, could be significant factors in determining whether legal action is warranted.In the scenario described, if the elderly lady is expressing her distress and not intentionally trying to provoke or insult, it might not necessarily lead to legal action. The courts may consider her age, mental health, and the familial context before deciding on the applicability of these sections.It’s also worth mentioning that legal action in such sensitive family matters is often seen as a last resort, and mediation or counselling might be recommended to address the underlying issues."

    "answer": "Supreme Court: In  a case where a citizen, who suffers from a writer’s cramp, was denied a scribe in the civil services’ examination, the 3-judge bench of Dr. DY Chandrachud*, Indira Banerjee and Sanjiv Khanna, JJ has held that writer’s cramp Forms part of Entry IV of the Schedule to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act 2016) and“To deny the facility of a scribe in a situation such as the present would negate the valuable rights and entitlements which are recognised by the RPwD Act 2016.”Part III of our Constitution does not explicitly include persons with disabilities within its protective fold. However, much like their able-bodied counterparts, the golden triangle of Articles 14, 19 and 21 applies with full force and vigour to the disabled. The RPwD Act 2016 seeks to operationalize and give concrete shape to the promise of full and equal citizenship held out by the Constitution to the disabled and to execute its ethos of inclusion and acceptance.”Section 3 casts an affirmative obligation on the government to ensure that persons with disabilities enjoy (i) the right to equality; (ii) a life with dignity; and (iii) respect for their integrity equally with others. By recognizing a statutory right and entitlement on the part of persons who are disabled, Section 3 seeks to implement and facilitate the fulfillment of the constitutional rights of persons with disabilities.You can give a representation based on supreme court judgmentT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Suffering from chronic neurological disorder and facing harassment at workplace",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Legally, you have several options to seek redress and accommodations. The Supreme Court's judgement in Vikash Kumar v. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) is indeed relevant to your situation. Here’s a detailed explanation:Facts and Decisions in Vikash Kumar v. UPSCIn Vikash Kumar v. UPSC (2021), the petitioner suffered from a similar neurological condition that impaired his writing ability. He requested reasonable accommodations to take a civil service examination, including the provision of a scribe. The UPSC rejected his request, prompting him to challenge their decision.The Supreme Court ruled in favour of Vikash Kumar, emphasising the following key points:1.Rights of Persons with Disabilities:The Court underscored the rights of individuals with disabilities to reasonable accommodations under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPWD Act). This Act mandates non-discrimination and provides for necessary accommodations to enable persons with disabilities to perform their roles effectively.2.Definition of Disability: The Court broadened the interpretation of “disability” to include conditions like writer's cramp, stressing that the impairment need not be visible or permanent as long as it hampers the individual’s ability to perform daily activities.3.Obligation of Employers:The Court held that employers, including public sector entities, have a duty to provide reasonable accommodations to employees with disabilities. This includes reassignment to suitable positions where the disability would not impede job performance.Legal Options and Steps for Your Case1. Request Reasonable Accommodations in Writing:Submit a formal, written request to your higher authorities and HR department, outlining your condition, its impact on your job performance, and the specific accommodations you are seeking. Reference is made to the RPWD Act and the Supreme Court judgement in Vikash Kumar v. UPSC.2. Consult with medical professionals:Obtain detailed medical documentation from your neurologist or other healthcare providers. These documents should describe your condition, its impact on your ability to write, and recommended accommodations.3. File a grievance:If your initial requests are ignored or denied, file a formal grievance through your bank’s internal grievance redressal mechanism. Make sure to document all instances of harassment and lack of accommodation.4. Approach the Equal Opportunity Cell (if available):Many public sector organisations have an Equal Opportunity Cell or a similar body responsible for addressing issues related to discrimination and accommodations for employees with disabilities. Approach this body with your complaint.5. Legal Action:If internal remedies fail, you can file a complaint with the Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities (CCPD) or the State Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities. These bodies have the authority to investigate and take action on complaints of non-compliance with the RPWD Act.You can also consider filing a writ petition in the High Court under Article 226 of theIndian Constitution, seeking a directive for your employer to provide reasonable accommodations and to stop the harassment.Relevant Case LawIn addition to Vikash Kumar v. UPSC, consider referencing these cases:Jeeja Ghosh & Anotherv.Union of India: This case reinforced the rights of persons with disabilities to equal treatment and accommodations.Bhavya Nainv.University of Delhi highlighted the need for reasonable accommodations in educational and employment settings for persons with disabilities.Your condition qualifies as a disability under the RPWD Act, and your employer is legally obligated to provide reasonable accommodations. The Supreme Court’s ruling in Vikash Kumar v. UPSC supports your case, emphasising the duty of employers to accommodate employees with disabilities. You have the right to request reassignment or other accommodations and to seek redress through internal grievance mechanisms or legal channels if necessary.Seek legal counsel to assist with drafting formal requests and potential legal actions. Your case highlights the need for compliance with disability rights legislation and the importance of creating an inclusive work environment.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Suffering from chronic neurological disorder and facing harassment at workplace",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The facts of the case:Vikash Kumar is the petitioner who gave the Civil Services Examination as organised by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). Specifically, he had the particularity of a certain type of learning disability that made him write significantly slowly.Due to his disability, Vikash Kumar had to write to the school principal, asking for permission for a scribe for the examination. However, his request was rejected by the UPSC on the basis that he failed to fulfil the regulatory requirements inevitably in regard to the availability of a scribe.Several pages offer an account of Vikash Kumar, who sought to appeal the UPSC refusal, arguing that his rights under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 had been violated. He argued that this piece of legislation required accommodations for individuals with disabilities to be reasonable to make necessary adjustments to prevent discrimination.High Court's Decision:The Honourable High Court of India endorsed the directives of the UPSC and dismissed the appeal of Vikash Kumar on the grounds that he did not fall under the criteria for scribe under the prevailing conditions and norms. Vikash Kumar appealed to S.C. of India; ultimately, the Honourable Apex Court took up the matter for consideration.Supreme Court's Decision:Some of the changes that were made included the reevaluation of the guidelines and criteria by the Supreme Court for providing scribes to persons with disabilities to do their writing for them with the intention of having a more inclusive approach. The Court underlined another key principle outlined in the RPwD Act, 2016, known as reasonable accommodation, which implies that it is necessary for the implementation of appropriate modifications and adjustments in order to ensure persons with disabilities exercise their rights.The judgement elucidated that the RPwD Act entitled Vikash Kumar to certain rights, including a scribe, if he were to request them, and Oudh had arbitrarily denied him that right. The Court added that the act requires one to be given an equal chance with no discrimination and to implement the act of reasonable accommodation as part of the mandate.Hence, the SC recommended that the UPSC reconsider its guidelines and provide candidature appropriate damages for disability that the UPSC deprives of disabled candidates by not letting them have a scribe and making it a criteria for examination so that their rights are being protected and they can also write their examinations in the best way possible.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,If you have provided representation along with a letter from NIMHANS Bengaluru about your condition when requesting reasonable accommodation from your branch manager but none has been responded to by the HR Department, it is wise to keep documentation of such communications. If a reasonable period has passed with no work being done or little progress is made for the student and myself,. Follow up with HR through a second email or letter if you do not receive a response to your initial message of introducing yourself. This should be done gently and diplomatically in an effort to remind them of your previous request. Emphasise its urgency. Enclose photocopies of previous communications along with the one received from NIMHANS.Furthermore, continue to remind the officer’s association of the absence of a reply from HR and enquire them to further support and fight for your rights. If you continue to be overwhelmed by your struggle, you should report the issue to the higher authorities of your organisation. Select a position at a higher level, such as senior HR manager or director. Obviously, describe actions that were taken beforehand that can contribute to the solution of the problem. Emphasise that you have received little or no response, especially with newer social media platforms.Correlatively, seek any legal advice that you would be in a position to take against any form of discrimination concerning medical conditions in the workplace with regard to reasonable accommodation. Although the study found that laws and regulations were weak and violated in food production, there is a need for research on the laws and regulations of different jurisdictions. For specific advice on this matter, it is advised to seek services from an employment lawyer.

    "context": "Asked 1 year ago in Family Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Relationship and girl friend family issue",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Your situation is quite complex, involving personal relationships, family dynamics, and potential legal implications. Here’s a structured approach to address your concerns and guide you through the process.The primary concern appears to be the resistance from both families due to inter-caste differences and other personal reasons. This is compounded by the legal risks associated with potential false complaints against you, including allegations of harassment or coercion, and the possibility of your girlfriend being pressured into making statements against you.Since both of you are adults (25 years old), under Indian law, you have the right to marry whoever you choose, irrespective of caste or family approval. This is a fundamental right guaranteed by theConstitution of India. If a false complaint is made, it is essential to be prepared with evidence of your relationship and the consent of your girlfriend. Such evidence could include photos, voice recordings, and any written communication that demonstrates mutual consent. This will be crucial in defending against any false allegations.Communication and mediation are essential steps in resolving this issue. It might be helpful to involve neutral, respected elders or mediators from both sides to facilitate discussions. This could help in reducing hostility and reaching a mutual understanding. However, it is important to avoid direct confrontation with her uncle or any family member without mediation, as this may escalate the situation and lead to legal complications or physical altercations.Preserving evidence is vital in this scenario. Keep all evidence of your relationship, including photos, messages, call records, and any documentation that can support your case if legal issues arise. If you visit her family or engage in discussions, consider recording these interactions (if legally permissible) to have evidence of your intentions and conduct. This documentation will be crucial in defending yourself if the situation escalates to legal proceedings.Regarding the incident on 25-05-204, where her uncle tried to beat you and said bad words to your family, it is advisable to avoid direct confrontation. Directly confronting her uncle could lead to further escalation. Given the past violent reaction, it’s better to avoid this approach. If you feel defamed or threatened, discuss with your lawyer the possibility of sending a legal notice demanding an apology or even considering defamation charges if the situation warrants it. Instead of seeking an apology through confrontation, focus on resolving the main issue, which is the acceptance of your relationship or a peaceful mutual agreement.From a legal perspective, several provisions can offer protection and recourse. Under theIndian Penal Code(IPC), sections such as Section 499/500 for defamation andSection 506for criminal intimidation may be relevant if there are false accusations or threats against you. TheSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, allows for inter-caste marriages with legal protection, which could be a viable option if you both decide to marry without family consent. Additionally, if your girlfriend faces harassment or coercion from her family, she can seek protection under the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005.In conclusion, addressing this situation requires a combination of legal, communicative, and supportive measures. Seek advice from a qualified lawyer, involve neutral mediators, preserve all evidence, and ensure both you and your girlfriend receive the necessary psychological support. Prioritize safety and well-being in all actions you take, and focus on achieving a peaceful resolution while protecting your legal rights.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Leaving the company before notice period",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I understand your situation, and it’s quite common for employees to face such dilemmas when transitioning between jobs. As per Indian employment law, the notice period is a significant part of the employment contract, and both parties are expected to honour it. The purpose of the notice period is to give the employer time to find a replacement and to ensure a smooth transition without disrupting the workflow.If you’ve offered compensation in lieu of the notice period and your employer is not accepting it, they are within their rights to ask you to serve the full notice period as per the terms of your employment contract. However, if your new employer is willing to accept you with just a resignation acceptance, you may consider negotiating further with your current employer or seeking a mutual agreement.Legally speaking, if you leave without serving the full notice period and without the consent of your current employer, they may take legal action against you for breach of contract. This could include withholding your final settlement, demanding payment for the remaining notice period, or even filing a lawsuit for damages if they can prove that your early departure caused significant harm to the company.It’s important to review your employment contract and understand the specific terms regarding the notice period. If there’s a clause that allows for paying compensation in lieu of notice, you could potentially argue that you’ve fulfilled your contractual obligations by offering the compensation.In any case, it’s advisable to handle the situation diplomatically to avoid any potential legal issues. You might want to have a candid conversation with your HR department or seek the assistance of a legal professional to explore your options and ensure that you’re making an informed decision."

    "question": "Divorce on the basis of cruelty",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Mental cruelty can indeed be grounds for divorce under Indian law. TheHindu Marriage Act, 1955, specifically Section 13(1)(ia), allows for divorce on the grounds of cruelty, which includes both physical and mental harm.To file for divorce on the basis of mental cruelty, you would need to demonstrate that your wife’s behaviour is of such a nature that it causes you mental pain and suffering to the extent that it is not possible for you to live with her. The behaviour must be grave and substantial, not just the ordinary wear and tear of married life.The Supreme Court of India has provided guidelines on what constitutes mental cruelty, including acts that cause significant suffering, disrupt communication, or intentionally undermine a person’s credibility in a marriage. In your case, the physical abuse, constant fighting, disrespect towards your parents, and her excessive involvement with her own parents to the detriment of your marital relationship could potentially be considered grounds for mental cruelty.However, it’s important to have detailed and documented evidence of the incidents of cruelty. This can include witnesses, medical reports (if there’s physical abuse), or any other relevant documentation. A lawyer can help you gather the necessary evidence and guide you through the process of filing for divorce.It’s also crucial to consider the well-being of your child in this situation. The court will take into account the best interests of the child when making decisions regarding custody and visitation rights.If you decide to proceed with the divorce, I would strongly recommend consulting with a family lawyer who can provide personalised legal advice and represent you in court. They can also help mediate and possibly resolve the issues without going to court, which can be beneficial for all parties involved, especially the child."

    "answer": "Dear Client,In India, the use of abusive language or cursing can potentially invoke certain sections of theIndian Penal Code(IPC), depending on the nature and context of the words used. If the language used by the elderly lady is considered abusive or insulting with the intent to provoke a breach of peace, it could fall under:Section 504 IPC: This section deals with intentional insults with the intent to provoke a breach of peace. If the cursing is intended to insult and provoke someone to the point where it could cause a disturbance, this section may be invoked.Section 294 IPC: This section pertains to obscene acts and songs in public places. If the cursing is considered obscene and causes annoyance to others, it could be considered under this section.However, it’s important to note that the context and intent behind the words are crucial. The mental state of the person, especially if they are under mental stress, stigma, or depression, as well as the relationship between the parties involved, could be significant factors in determining whether legal action is warranted.In the scenario described, if the elderly lady is expressing her distress and not intentionally trying to provoke or insult, it might not necessarily lead to legal action. The courts may consider her age, mental health, and the familial context before deciding on the applicability of these sections.It’s also worth mentioning that legal action in such sensitive family matters is often seen as a last resort, and mediation or counselling might be recommended to address the underlying issues."

    "answer": "dear client, in India, the legality of charging money for going on a date is not explicitly addressed in the law. However, there are several legal provisions that could be relevant depending on the circumstances:Contract Act, 1872: If both parties agree to the terms of the date, including any payment, it could be considered a contract. As long as the agreement is lawful, with lawful consideration and a lawful object, and not expressly declared to be void, it would generally be valid underSections 10and23of the Contract Act.Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956: If the nature of the date implies an exchange of money for sexual favours, it could potentially fall under the scope of this Act, which criminalises sexual exploitation for commercial purposes.Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986: Charging money for a date should not involve any indecent representation of the woman, as that would be prohibited under this Act.Information Technology Act, 2000: If the arrangement is made online, and if any content shared is obscene or lascivious, it could attract provisions under this Act, particularlySection 67,which penalizes the publication of obscene content in electronic form.It’s important to note that while there is no specific law that prohibits charging for a date, the context and conduct of both parties during the date could bring the activity under the purview of various laws. It’s also essential to consider the societal norms and perceptions, which can influence the legal interpretation of such arrangements.For a definitive legal opinion, it would be advisable to consult with a legal professional who can provide guidance based on the specifics of the situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, much like their able-bodied counterparts, the golden triangle of Articles 14, 19 and 21 applies with full force and vigour to the disabled. The RPwD Act 2016 seeks to operationalize and give concrete shape to the promise of full and equal citizenship held out by the Constitution to the disabled and to execute its ethos of inclusion and acceptance.”Section 3 casts an affirmative obligation on the government to ensure that persons with disabilities enjoy (i) the right to equality; (ii) a life with dignity; and (iii) respect for their integrity equally with others.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Legally, you have several options to seek redress and accommodations. The Supreme Court's judgement in Vikash Kumar v. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) is indeed relevant to your situation. Here’s a detailed explanation:Facts and Decisions in Vikash Kumar v. UPSCIn Vikash Kumar v. UPSC (2021), the petitioner suffered from a similar neurological condition that impaired his writing ability. He requested reasonable accommodations to take a civil service examination, including the provision of a scribe. The UPSC rejected his request, prompting him to challenge their decision.The Supreme Court ruled in favour of Vikash Kumar, emphasising the following key points:1.Rights of Persons with Disabilities:The Court underscored the rights of individuals with disabilities to reasonable accommodations under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPWD Act). This Act mandates non-discrimination and provides for necessary accommodations to enable persons with disabilities to perform their roles effectively.2.Definition of Disability: The Court broadened the interpretation of “disability” to include conditions like writer's cramp, stressing that the impairment need not be visible or permanent as long as it hampers the individual’s ability to perform daily activities.3.Obligation of Employers:The Court held that employers, including public sector entities, have a duty to provide reasonable accommodations to employees with disabilities. This includes reassignment to suitable positions where the disability would not impede job performance.Legal Options and Steps for Your Case1. Request Reasonable Accommodations in Writing:Submit a formal, written request to your higher authorities and HR department, outlining your condition, its impact on your job performance, and the specific accommodations you are seeking. Reference is made to the RPWD Act and the Supreme Court judgement in Vikash Kumar v. UPSC.2. Consult with medical professionals:Obtain detailed medical documentation from your neurologist or other healthcare providers. These documents should describe your condition, its impact on your ability to write, and recommended accommodations.3. File a grievance:If your initial requests are ignored or denied, file a formal grievance through your bank’s internal grievance redressal mechanism. Make sure to document all instances of harassment and lack of accommodation.4. Approach the Equal Opportunity Cell (if available):Many public sector organisations have an Equal Opportunity Cell or a similar body responsible for addressing issues related to discrimination and accommodations for employees with disabilities. Approach this body with your complaint.5. Legal Action:If internal remedies fail, you can file a complaint with the Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities (CCPD) or the State Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities. These bodies have the authority to investigate and take action on complaints of non-compliance with the RPWD Act.You can also consider filing a writ petition in the High Court under Article 226 of theIndian Constitution, seeking a directive for your employer to provide reasonable accommodations and to stop the harassment.Relevant Case LawIn addition to Vikash Kumar v. UPSC, consider referencing these cases:Jeeja Ghosh & Anotherv.Union of India: This case reinforced the rights of persons with disabilities to equal treatment and accommodations.Bhavya Nainv.University of Delhi highlighted the need for reasonable accommodations in educational and employment settings for persons with disabilities.Your condition qualifies as a disability under the RPWD Act, and your employer is legally obligated to provide reasonable accommodations. The Supreme Court’s ruling in Vikash Kumar v. UPSC supports your case, emphasising the duty of employers to accommodate employees with disabilities. You have the right to request reassignment or other accommodations and to seek redress through internal grievance mechanisms or legal channels if necessary.Seek legal counsel to assist with drafting formal requests and potential legal actions. Your case highlights the need for compliance with disability rights legislation and the importance of creating an inclusive work environment.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Suffering from chronic neurological disorder and facing harassment at workplace",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The facts of the case:Vikash Kumar is the petitioner who gave the Civil Services Examination as organised by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). Specifically, he had the particularity of a certain type of learning disability that made him write significantly slowly.Due to his disability, Vikash Kumar had to write to the school principal, asking for permission for a scribe for the examination. However, his request was rejected by the UPSC on the basis that he failed to fulfil the regulatory requirements inevitably in regard to the availability of a scribe.Several pages offer an account of Vikash Kumar, who sought to appeal the UPSC refusal, arguing that his rights under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 had been violated. He argued that this piece of legislation required accommodations for individuals with disabilities to be reasonable to make necessary adjustments to prevent discrimination.High Court's Decision:The Honourable High Court of India endorsed the directives of the UPSC and dismissed the appeal of Vikash Kumar on the grounds that he did not fall under the criteria for scribe under the prevailing conditions and norms. Vikash Kumar appealed to S.C. of India; ultimately, the Honourable Apex Court took up the matter for consideration.Supreme Court's Decision:Some of the changes that were made included the reevaluation of the guidelines and criteria by the Supreme Court for providing scribes to persons with disabilities to do their writing for them with the intention of having a more inclusive approach. The Court underlined another key principle outlined in the RPwD Act, 2016, known as reasonable accommodation, which implies that it is necessary for the implementation of appropriate modifications and adjustments in order to ensure persons with disabilities exercise their rights.The judgement elucidated that the RPwD Act entitled Vikash Kumar to certain rights, including a scribe, if he were to request them, and Oudh had arbitrarily denied him that right. The Court added that the act requires one to be given an equal chance with no discrimination and to implement the act of reasonable accommodation as part of the mandate.Hence, the SC recommended that the UPSC reconsider its guidelines and provide candidature appropriate damages for disability that the UPSC deprives of disabled candidates by not letting them have a scribe and making it a criteria for examination so that their rights are being protected and they can also write their examinations in the best way possible.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,If you have provided representation along with a letter from NIMHANS Bengaluru about your condition when requesting reasonable accommodation from your branch manager but none has been responded to by the HR Department, it is wise to keep documentation of such communications. If a reasonable period has passed with no work being done or little progress is made for the student and myself,. Follow up with HR through a second email or letter if you do not receive a response to your initial message of introducing yourself. This should be done gently and diplomatically in an effort to remind them of your previous request. Emphasise its urgency. Enclose photocopies of previous communications along with the one received from NIMHANS.Furthermore, continue to remind the officer’s association of the absence of a reply from HR and enquire them to further support and fight for your rights. If you continue to be overwhelmed by your struggle, you should report the issue to the higher authorities of your organisation. Select a position at a higher level, such as senior HR manager or director. Obviously, describe actions that were taken beforehand that can contribute to the solution of the problem. Emphasise that you have received little or no response, especially with newer social media platforms.Correlatively, seek any legal advice that you would be in a position to take against any form of discrimination concerning medical conditions in the workplace with regard to reasonable accommodation. Although the study found that laws and regulations were weak and violated in food production, there is a need for research on the laws and regulations of different jurisdictions. For specific advice on this matter, it is advised to seek services from an employment lawyer.

    "question": "Leaving the company before notice period",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I understand your situation, and it’s quite common for employees to face such dilemmas when transitioning between jobs. As per Indian employment law, the notice period is a significant part of the employment contract, and both parties are expected to honour it. The purpose of the notice period is to give the employer time to find a replacement and to ensure a smooth transition without disrupting the workflow.If you’ve offered compensation in lieu of the notice period and your employer is not accepting it, they are within their rights to ask you to serve the full notice period as per the terms of your employment contract. However, if your new employer is willing to accept you with just a resignation acceptance, you may consider negotiating further with your current employer or seeking a mutual agreement.Legally speaking, if you leave without serving the full notice period and without the consent of your current employer, they may take legal action against you for breach of contract. This could include withholding your final settlement, demanding payment for the remaining notice period, or even filing a lawsuit for damages if they can prove that your early departure caused significant harm to the company.It’s important to review your employment contract and understand the specific terms regarding the notice period. If there’s a clause that allows for paying compensation in lieu of notice, you could potentially argue that you’ve fulfilled your contractual obligations by offering the compensation.In any case, it’s advisable to handle the situation diplomatically to avoid any potential legal issues. You might want to have a candid conversation with your HR department or seek the assistance of a legal professional to explore your options and ensure that you’re making an informed decision."

    "question": "Divorce on the basis of cruelty",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Mental cruelty can indeed be grounds for divorce under Indian law. TheHindu Marriage Act, 1955, specifically Section 13(1)(ia), allows for divorce on the grounds of cruelty, which includes both physical and mental harm.To file for divorce on the basis of mental cruelty, you would need to demonstrate that your wife’s behaviour is of such a nature that it causes you mental pain and suffering to the extent that it is not possible for you to live with her. The behaviour must be grave and substantial, not just the ordinary wear and tear of married life.The Supreme Court of India has provided guidelines on what constitutes mental cruelty, including acts that cause significant suffering, disrupt communication, or intentionally undermine a person’s credibility in a marriage. In your case, the physical abuse, constant fighting, disrespect towards your parents, and her excessive involvement with her own parents to the detriment of your marital relationship could potentially be considered grounds for mental cruelty.However, it’s important to have detailed and documented evidence of the incidents of cruelty. This can include witnesses, medical reports (if there’s physical abuse), or any other relevant documentation. A lawyer can help you gather the necessary evidence and guide you through the process of filing for divorce.It’s also crucial to consider the well-being of your child in this situation. The court will take into account the best interests of the child when making decisions regarding custody and visitation rights.If you decide to proceed with the divorce, I would strongly recommend consulting with a family lawyer who can provide personalised legal advice and represent you in court. They can also help mediate and possibly resolve the issues without going to court, which can be beneficial for all parties involved, especially the child."

    "answer": "Dear Client,In India, the use of abusive language or cursing can potentially invoke certain sections of theIndian Penal Code(IPC), depending on the nature and context of the words used. If the language used by the elderly lady is considered abusive or insulting with the intent to provoke a breach of peace, it could fall under:Section 504 IPC: This section deals with intentional insults with the intent to provoke a breach of peace. If the cursing is intended to insult and provoke someone to the point where it could cause a disturbance, this section may be invoked.Section 294 IPC: This section pertains to obscene acts and songs in public places. If the cursing is considered obscene and causes annoyance to others, it could be considered under this section.However, it’s important to note that the context and intent behind the words are crucial. The mental state of the person, especially if they are under mental stress, stigma, or depression, as well as the relationship between the parties involved, could be significant factors in determining whether legal action is warranted.In the scenario described, if the elderly lady is expressing her distress and not intentionally trying to provoke or insult, it might not necessarily lead to legal action. The courts may consider her age, mental health, and the familial context before deciding on the applicability of these sections.It’s also worth mentioning that legal action in such sensitive family matters is often seen as a last resort, and mediation or counselling might be recommended to address the underlying issues."

However, much like their able-bodied counterparts, the golden triangle of Articles 14, 19 and 21 applies with full force and vigour to the disabled. The RPwD Act 2016 seeks to operationalize and give concrete shape to the promise of full and equal citizenship held out by the Constitution to the disabled and to execute its ethos of inclusion and acceptance.”Section 3 casts an affirmative obligation on the government to ensure that persons with disabilities enjoy (i) the right to equality; (ii) a life with dignity; and (iii) respect for their integrity equally with others. By recognizing a statutory right and entitlement on the part of persons who are disabled, Section 3 seeks to implement and facilitate the fulfillment of the constitutional rights of persons with disabilities.You can give a representation based on supreme court judgmentT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) is indeed relevant to your situation. Here’s a detailed explanation:Facts and Decisions in Vikash Kumar v. UPSCIn Vikash Kumar v. UPSC (2021), the petitioner suffered from a similar neurological condition that impaired his writing ability. He requested reasonable accommodations to take a civil service examination, including the provision of a scribe. The UPSC rejected his request, prompting him to challenge their decision.The Supreme Court ruled in favour of Vikash Kumar, emphasising the following key points:1.Rights of Persons with Disabilities:The Court underscored the rights of individuals with disabilities to reasonable accommodations under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPWD Act). This Act mandates non-discrimination and provides for necessary accommodations to enable persons with disabilities to perform their roles effectively.2.Definition of Disability: The Court broadened the interpretation of “disability” to include conditions like writer's cramp, stressing that the impairment need not be visible or permanent as long as it hampers the individual’s ability to perform daily activities.3.Obligation of Employers:The Court held that employers, including public sector entities, have a duty to provide reasonable accommodations to employees with disabilities. This includes reassignment to suitable positions where the disability would not impede job performance.Legal Options and Steps for Your Case1. Request Reasonable Accommodations in Writing:Submit a formal, written request to your higher authorities and HR department, outlining your condition, its impact on your job performance, and the specific accommodations you are seeking. Reference is made to the RPWD Act and the Supreme Court judgement in Vikash Kumar v. UPSC.2. Consult with medical professionals:Obtain detailed medical documentation from your neurologist or other healthcare providers. These documents should describe your condition, its impact on your ability to write, and recommended accommodations.3. File a grievance:If your initial requests are ignored or denied, file a formal grievance through your bank’s internal grievance redressal mechanism. Make sure to document all instances of harassment and lack of accommodation.4. Approach the Equal Opportunity Cell (if available):Many public sector organisations have an Equal Opportunity Cell or a similar body responsible for addressing issues related to discrimination and accommodations for employees with disabilities. Approach this body with your complaint.5. Legal Action:If internal remedies fail, you can file a complaint with the Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities (CCPD) or the State Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities. These bodies have the authority to investigate and take action on complaints of non-compliance with the RPWD Act.You can also consider filing a writ petition in the High Court under Article 226 of theIndian Constitution, seeking a directive for your employer to provide reasonable accommodations and to stop the harassment.Relevant Case LawIn addition to Vikash Kumar v. UPSC, consider referencing these cases:Jeeja Ghosh & Anotherv.Union of India: This case reinforced the rights of persons with disabilities to equal treatment and accommodations.Bhavya Nainv.University of Delhi highlighted the need for reasonable accommodations in educational and employment settings for persons with disabilities.Your condition qualifies as a disability under the RPWD Act, and your employer is legally obligated to provide reasonable accommodations. The Supreme Court’s ruling in Vikash Kumar v. UPSC supports your case, emphasising the duty of employers to accommodate employees with disabilities. You have the right to request reassignment or other accommodations and to seek redress through internal grievance mechanisms or legal channels if necessary.Seek legal counsel to assist with drafting formal requests and potential legal actions. Your case highlights the need for compliance with disability rights legislation and the importance of creating an inclusive work environment.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Suffering from chronic neurological disorder and facing harassment at workplace",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The facts of the case:Vikash Kumar is the petitioner who gave the Civil Services Examination as organised by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). Specifically, he had the particularity of a certain type of learning disability that made him write significantly slowly.Due to his disability, Vikash Kumar had to write to the school principal, asking for permission for a scribe for the examination. However, his request was rejected by the UPSC on the basis that he failed to fulfil the regulatory requirements inevitably in regard to the availability of a scribe.Several pages offer an account of Vikash Kumar, who sought to appeal the UPSC refusal, arguing that his rights under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 had been violated. He argued that this piece of legislation required accommodations for individuals with disabilities to be reasonable to make necessary adjustments to prevent discrimination.High Court's Decision:The Honourable High Court of India endorsed the directives of the UPSC and dismissed the appeal of Vikash Kumar on the grounds that he did not fall under the criteria for scribe under the prevailing conditions and norms. Vikash Kumar appealed to S.C. of India; ultimately, the Honourable Apex Court took up the matter for consideration.Supreme Court's Decision:Some of the changes that were made included the reevaluation of the guidelines and criteria by the Supreme Court for providing scribes to persons with disabilities to do their writing for them with the intention of having a more inclusive approach. The Court underlined another key principle outlined in the RPwD Act, 2016, known as reasonable accommodation, which implies that it is necessary for the implementation of appropriate modifications and adjustments in order to ensure persons with disabilities exercise their rights.The judgement elucidated that the RPwD Act entitled Vikash Kumar to certain rights, including a scribe, if he were to request them, and Oudh had arbitrarily denied him that right. The Court added that the act requires one to be given an equal chance with no discrimination and to implement the act of reasonable accommodation as part of the mandate.Hence, the SC recommended that the UPSC reconsider its guidelines and provide candidature appropriate damages for disability that the UPSC deprives of disabled candidates by not letting them have a scribe and making it a criteria for examination so that their rights are being protected and they can also write their examinations in the best way possible.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,If you have provided representation along with a letter from NIMHANS Bengaluru about your condition when requesting reasonable accommodation from your branch manager but none has been responded to by the HR Department, it is wise to keep documentation of such communications. If a reasonable period has passed with no work being done or little progress is made for the student and myself,. Follow up with HR through a second email or letter if you do not receive a response to your initial message of introducing yourself. This should be done gently and diplomatically in an effort to remind them of your previous request. Emphasise its urgency. Enclose photocopies of previous communications along with the one received from NIMHANS.Furthermore, continue to remind the officer’s association of the absence of a reply from HR and enquire them to further support and fight for your rights. If you continue to be overwhelmed by your struggle, you should report the issue to the higher authorities of your organisation. Select a position at a higher level, such as senior HR manager or director. Obviously, describe actions that were taken beforehand that can contribute to the solution of the problem. Emphasise that you have received little or no response, especially with newer social media platforms.Correlatively, seek any legal advice that you would be in a position to take against any form of discrimination concerning medical conditions in the workplace with regard to reasonable accommodation. Although the study found that laws and regulations were weak and violated in food production, there is a need for research on the laws and regulations of different jurisdictions. For specific advice on this matter, it is advised to seek services from an employment lawyer.

    "answer": "If you’re facing issues with the refund of your security deposit after vacating a rented property in India, here are the steps you can take, along with relevant legal provisions:Review Your Rental Agreement: Check the terms and conditions regarding the security deposit and notice period. Ensure that you have complied with all the conditions mentioned in the agreement.Send a Formal Request: Initially, send a formal written request to the landlord asking for the refund of the security deposit. Mention the clause in your rental agreement that stipulates the refund process.Legal Notice: If the landlord does not respond or refuses to refund the deposit, you can send a legal notice through an advocate. This notice will formally demand the refund and mention the intention to take legal action if the deposit is not returned.Consumer Protection Act, 2019: If the landlord’s actions can be considered unfair trade practices or deficiencies in service, you can approach the consumer forum under this Act.Civil Suit: If the amount is significant, you can file a civil suit for the recovery of the security deposit. The court will consider the evidence, such as the rental agreement and any communication between you and the landlord.Interest on Security Deposit: If your rental agreement specifies it, you may also claim interest on the security deposit for the period it was withheld by the landlord.Mediation: Before going to court, you can also consider mediation. A mediator can help both parties reach an amicable solution without the need for litigation.It’s important to keep all communication with the landlord documented and to have all the evidence of payments and correspondence organized."

    "context": "Asked 1 year ago in Family Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Relationship and girl friend family issue",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Your situation is quite complex, involving personal relationships, family dynamics, and potential legal implications. Here’s a structured approach to address your concerns and guide you through the process.The primary concern appears to be the resistance from both families due to inter-caste differences and other personal reasons. This is compounded by the legal risks associated with potential false complaints against you, including allegations of harassment or coercion, and the possibility of your girlfriend being pressured into making statements against you.Since both of you are adults (25 years old), under Indian law, you have the right to marry whoever you choose, irrespective of caste or family approval. This is a fundamental right guaranteed by theConstitution of India. If a false complaint is made, it is essential to be prepared with evidence of your relationship and the consent of your girlfriend. Such evidence could include photos, voice recordings, and any written communication that demonstrates mutual consent. This will be crucial in defending against any false allegations.Communication and mediation are essential steps in resolving this issue. It might be helpful to involve neutral, respected elders or mediators from both sides to facilitate discussions. This could help in reducing hostility and reaching a mutual understanding. However, it is important to avoid direct confrontation with her uncle or any family member without mediation, as this may escalate the situation and lead to legal complications or physical altercations.Preserving evidence is vital in this scenario. Keep all evidence of your relationship, including photos, messages, call records, and any documentation that can support your case if legal issues arise. If you visit her family or engage in discussions, consider recording these interactions (if legally permissible) to have evidence of your intentions and conduct. This documentation will be crucial in defending yourself if the situation escalates to legal proceedings.Regarding the incident on 25-05-204, where her uncle tried to beat you and said bad words to your family, it is advisable to avoid direct confrontation. Directly confronting her uncle could lead to further escalation. Given the past violent reaction, it’s better to avoid this approach. If you feel defamed or threatened, discuss with your lawyer the possibility of sending a legal notice demanding an apology or even considering defamation charges if the situation warrants it. Instead of seeking an apology through confrontation, focus on resolving the main issue, which is the acceptance of your relationship or a peaceful mutual agreement.From a legal perspective, several provisions can offer protection and recourse. Under theIndian Penal Code(IPC), sections such as Section 499/500 for defamation andSection 506for criminal intimidation may be relevant if there are false accusations or threats against you. TheSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, allows for inter-caste marriages with legal protection, which could be a viable option if you both decide to marry without family consent. Additionally, if your girlfriend faces harassment or coercion from her family, she can seek protection under the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005.In conclusion, addressing this situation requires a combination of legal, communicative, and supportive measures. Seek advice from a qualified lawyer, involve neutral mediators, preserve all evidence, and ensure both you and your girlfriend receive the necessary psychological support. Prioritize safety and well-being in all actions you take, and focus on achieving a peaceful resolution while protecting your legal rights.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Girl charging money to the boy for a date",
    "answer": "dear client, in India, the legality of charging money for going on a date is not explicitly addressed in the law. However, there are several legal provisions that could be relevant depending on the circumstances:Contract Act, 1872: If both parties agree to the terms of the date, including any payment, it could be considered a contract. As long as the agreement is lawful, with lawful consideration and a lawful object, and not expressly declared to be void, it would generally be valid underSections 10and23of the Contract Act.Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956: If the nature of the date implies an exchange of money for sexual favours, it could potentially fall under the scope of this Act, which criminalises sexual exploitation for commercial purposes.Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986: Charging money for a date should not involve any indecent representation of the woman, as that would be prohibited under this Act.Information Technology Act, 2000: If the arrangement is made online, and if any content shared is obscene or lascivious, it could attract provisions under this Act, particularlySection 67,which penalizes the publication of obscene content in electronic form.It’s important to note that while there is no specific law that prohibits charging for a date, the context and conduct of both parties during the date could bring the activity under the purview of various laws. It’s also essential to consider the societal norms and perceptions, which can influence the legal interpretation of such arrangements.For a definitive legal opinion, it would be advisable to consult with a legal professional who can provide guidance based on the specifics of the situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Rent increase and arrears",
    "answer": "Dear Client, I understand this is a challenging situation for you.As per the lease deed, the rent escalation clause states that there should be a 5% escalation on the rent after completion of 11 months every year. This means that the rent increase should apply immediately after the completion of 11 months from the start of the lease in 2020. Therefore, the rent should have been increased in 2021 and every year thereafter.If the landlord is now claiming arrears for the increased rent since 2021, and you have been paying the same rent since 2020 without any prior communication from the landlord, there may be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the lease agreement.Try to negotiate with the landlord to reach a mutual understanding regarding the rent arrears. If there was a genuine misunderstanding or lack of communication, you may be able to come to a resolution without legal intervention.If you are satisfied with the reply, kindly give me a 5 star rating.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay Highcourt.Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "question": "Rent increase and arrears",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here’s a detailed analysis and response to your questions based on the lease agreement and relevant legal provisions:Lease Agreement Interpretation:Question #1: When is the rent increase applicable?Lease Clause: “The lease shall be for a period of 3 years beginning on October 21, 2020, and renewable with 5% escalation on the rent after completion of 11 months every year.”Based on this clause, the rent increase is applicable every year after the completion of 11 months, not after the lease renewal in 2023. Therefore, the first increase would have been due on September 21, 2021, the second on August 21, 2022, and the third on July 21, 2023.Question #2: Landlord’s Claim for ArrearsSince the landlord has never raised this issue before and there was no communication regarding the rent increase, there are certain considerations under the law:Legal Provisions and Principles:1. \"Contractual Terms\":Section 70 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872: When a person lawfully does something for another person or delivers something to him without intending to do so gratuitously, and the other person enjoys the benefit thereof, the latter is bound to make compensation to the former in respect of, or to restore, the thing so done or delivered.Section 115 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872: Estoppel by conduct, where if a person has, by his declaration, act, or omission, intentionally caused or permitted another person to believe a thing to be true and to act upon such belief, neither he nor his representative shall be allowed, in any suit or proceeding between himself and such person or his representative, to deny the truth of that thing.2. Reasonableness and Communication:Section 106 of theTransfer of Property Act, 1882: In the absence of a contract or local law or usage to the contrary, a lease of immovable property shall be deemed to be a lease from month to month, terminable, on the part of either the lessor or the lessee, by 15 days’ notice expiring with the end of a month of the tenancy.The landlord’s delay in raising the issue of rent increases and the absence of any prior communication may be considered unreasonable and could be argued to have waived the right to claim the increased rent retroactively.Steps to take:1. Review the Lease Agreement: Carefully read the lease agreement again to ensure there are no additional clauses that clarify the rent escalation terms.2. Communicate with the Landlord: Write a formal letter or email to the landlord expressing your understanding of the lease agreement. State that there was no prior communication regarding the rent increase and that you have been paying the agreed rent of Rs. 23,000 per month.3. Negotiate a Settlement: If the landlord insists on the arrears, negotiate a possible settlement. Given the absence of prior communication and the sudden demand for arrears, you can argue for a reduction or a waiver of the alleged outstanding amount.4. Seek Legal Advice: Consult a legal expert specialising in property or tenancy law. They can help draft a formal response and guide you on how to proceed if the landlord continues to demand the arrears.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "If the original agreement fixed in the year was 23000, the enhanced rent @ 5% is payable in the year 2021, which will be 24150 and the same is payable at Rs. 25360  in the year 2022 and it amounts to 26630 in the year 2023 and it will be Rs. 27960 in the year 2024.Therefore the demand for Rs. 40,000 in the year as monthly rental amount is exorbitant.You can calculate the arrears of rental amount due to the difference in enhancement every year and inform him that you can pay that amount as well the actual amount as per the calculation given above.You can refuse to pay exorbitant rental amount and also refuse to vacate, besides you can approach the rent control court or civil court seeking an order of injunction agaisnt the landlord to restrain him from forcibly evicting you other than by due process of law.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Rent increase and arrears",
    "answer": "Dear Client,So, this is what you can do...Review the Original AgreementEscalation Clause: For instance, if the initial agreement for salary increment was at 5 percent annually, they expect you to stick to the same formula unless a new arrangement is made and put down in writing.Expiry of Agreement: Specifically, when the initial deal concluded in 2018, there have been no extensions or new conditions set to replace it; however, you operate legally on a month-to-month basis until new terms and conditions are established.Communication and NegotiationDiscussion with Landlord: You should also try to speak to the landlord regarding the rent rise that is in place for the flat. Point out that since the escalation of the rate was not accompanied by a new agreement on the matter or a new contract, the raise should be implemented strictly in accordance with the increase previously agreed upon.Written Agreement: Better make sure that any new terms are put in writing so that others can’t take advantage in the same way in the future.Legal StandpointValidity of Rent Increase: Unless the landlord secures a new signature for a new agreement, legal means exist that forbid this action, by which the landlord begins to unilaterally alter the terms of the rent and demands back payments according to those terms.Payment of Arrears: You remain bound by the terms of the original agreement and thereby you will be expected to pay the arrears as outlined by the 5% escalation clause, not the new rate which has been singly decided.Steps to TakeArrears calculated on the original terms and conditions Working in this calculation The formula in working with this calculation The formula in working with this calculation The formula in working with this calculation Arrears calculated based on the above-mentioned original terms and conditions can be determined by the following calculations: Working in this calculation: Arrears = Credit terms – Actual payment Credit terms are the original terms that were agreed upon between the supplier and the buyer while the actualBased on this seeming disparity, determine the new total rent which is 5% above your last agreed rent, and then calculate the rent arrears from October 2023 to May 2024.Communicate Your PositionDraft a letter or email to the landlord explaining your position. It is also important to confirm that there is a new agreement or an extension on the previous deadline. For that reason, state it in writing that: The current terms apply, including the 5% escalation clause due to the lack of a new agreement.In conclusion, based on the current tenancy agreement that has not been altered, you cannot be expected to pay the arrears based on the new rent demand of Rs. 40, 000 without a new agreement being initiated and signed. You should work on the escalations based on the provisions of the agreement where the rate increases by 5% every year and that should be communicated to the landlord. Moreover, it is always useful to talk to a legal professional to ensure your rights are covered and to manage potential conflict.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Your situation is quite complex, involving personal relationships, family dynamics, and potential legal implications. Here’s a structured approach to address your concerns and guide you through the process.The primary concern appears to be the resistance from both families due to inter-caste differences and other personal reasons. This is compounded by the legal risks associated with potential false complaints against you, including allegations of harassment or coercion, and the possibility of your girlfriend being pressured into making statements against you.Since both of you are adults (25 years old), under Indian law, you have the right to marry whoever you choose, irrespective of caste or family approval. This is a fundamental right guaranteed by theConstitution of India. If a false complaint is made, it is essential to be prepared with evidence of your relationship and the consent of your girlfriend. Such evidence could include photos, voice recordings, and any written communication that demonstrates mutual consent. This will be crucial in defending against any false allegations.Communication and mediation are essential steps in resolving this issue. It might be helpful to involve neutral, respected elders or mediators from both sides to facilitate discussions. This could help in reducing hostility and reaching a mutual understanding. However, it is important to avoid direct confrontation with her uncle or any family member without mediation, as this may escalate the situation and lead to legal complications or physical altercations.Preserving evidence is vital in this scenario. Keep all evidence of your relationship, including photos, messages, call records, and any documentation that can support your case if legal issues arise. If you visit her family or engage in discussions, consider recording these interactions (if legally permissible) to have evidence of your intentions and conduct. This documentation will be crucial in defending yourself if the situation escalates to legal proceedings.Regarding the incident on 25-05-204, where her uncle tried to beat you and said bad words to your family, it is advisable to avoid direct confrontation. Directly confronting her uncle could lead to further escalation. Given the past violent reaction, it’s better to avoid this approach. If you feel defamed or threatened, discuss with your lawyer the possibility of sending a legal notice demanding an apology or even considering defamation charges if the situation warrants it. Instead of seeking an apology through confrontation, focus on resolving the main issue, which is the acceptance of your relationship or a peaceful mutual agreement.From a legal perspective, several provisions can offer protection and recourse. Under theIndian Penal Code(IPC), sections such as Section 499/500 for defamation andSection 506for criminal intimidation may be relevant if there are false accusations or threats against you. TheSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, allows for inter-caste marriages with legal protection, which could be a viable option if you both decide to marry without family consent. Additionally, if your girlfriend faces harassment or coercion from her family, she can seek protection under the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005.In conclusion, addressing this situation requires a combination of legal, communicative, and supportive measures. Seek advice from a qualified lawyer, involve neutral mediators, preserve all evidence, and ensure both you and your girlfriend receive the necessary psychological support. Prioritize safety and well-being in all actions you take, and focus on achieving a peaceful resolution while protecting your legal rights.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "dear client, in India, the legality of charging money for going on a date is not explicitly addressed in the law. However, there are several legal provisions that could be relevant depending on the circumstances:Contract Act, 1872: If both parties agree to the terms of the date, including any payment, it could be considered a contract. As long as the agreement is lawful, with lawful consideration and a lawful object, and not expressly declared to be void, it would generally be valid underSections 10and23of the Contract Act.Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956: If the nature of the date implies an exchange of money for sexual favours, it could potentially fall under the scope of this Act, which criminalises sexual exploitation for commercial purposes.Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986: Charging money for a date should not involve any indecent representation of the woman, as that would be prohibited under this Act.Information Technology Act, 2000: If the arrangement is made online, and if any content shared is obscene or lascivious, it could attract provisions under this Act, particularlySection 67,which penalizes the publication of obscene content in electronic form.It’s important to note that while there is no specific law that prohibits charging for a date, the context and conduct of both parties during the date could bring the activity under the purview of various laws.

This means that the rent increase should apply immediately after the completion of 11 months from the start of the lease in 2020.

    "context": "Asked 1 year ago in Property Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Rent increase and arrears",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here’s a detailed analysis and response to your questions based on the lease agreement and relevant legal provisions:Lease Agreement Interpretation:Question #1: When is the rent increase applicable?Lease Clause: “The lease shall be for a period of 3 years beginning on October 21, 2020, and renewable with 5% escalation on the rent after completion of 11 months every year.”Based on this clause, the rent increase is applicable every year after the completion of 11 months, not after the lease renewal in 2023. Therefore, the first increase would have been due on September 21, 2021, the second on August 21, 2022, and the third on July 21, 2023.Question #2: Landlord’s Claim for ArrearsSince the landlord has never raised this issue before and there was no communication regarding the rent increase, there are certain considerations under the law:Legal Provisions and Principles:1. \"Contractual Terms\":Section 70 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872: When a person lawfully does something for another person or delivers something to him without intending to do so gratuitously, and the other person enjoys the benefit thereof, the latter is bound to make compensation to the former in respect of, or to restore, the thing so done or delivered.Section 115 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872: Estoppel by conduct, where if a person has, by his declaration, act, or omission, intentionally caused or permitted another person to believe a thing to be true and to act upon such belief, neither he nor his representative shall be allowed, in any suit or proceeding between himself and such person or his representative, to deny the truth of that thing.2. Reasonableness and Communication:Section 106 of theTransfer of Property Act, 1882: In the absence of a contract or local law or usage to the contrary, a lease of immovable property shall be deemed to be a lease from month to month, terminable, on the part of either the lessor or the lessee, by 15 days’ notice expiring with the end of a month of the tenancy.The landlord’s delay in raising the issue of rent increases and the absence of any prior communication may be considered unreasonable and could be argued to have waived the right to claim the increased rent retroactively.Steps to take:1. Review the Lease Agreement: Carefully read the lease agreement again to ensure there are no additional clauses that clarify the rent escalation terms.2. Communicate with the Landlord: Write a formal letter or email to the landlord expressing your understanding of the lease agreement. State that there was no prior communication regarding the rent increase and that you have been paying the agreed rent of Rs. 23,000 per month.3. Negotiate a Settlement: If the landlord insists on the arrears, negotiate a possible settlement. Given the absence of prior communication and the sudden demand for arrears, you can argue for a reduction or a waiver of the alleged outstanding amount.4. Seek Legal Advice: Consult a legal expert specialising in property or tenancy law. They can help draft a formal response and guide you on how to proceed if the landlord continues to demand the arrears.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "If the original agreement fixed in the year was 23000, the enhanced rent @ 5% is payable in the year 2021, which will be 24150 and the same is payable at Rs. 25360  in the year 2022 and it amounts to 26630 in the year 2023 and it will be Rs. 27960 in the year 2024.Therefore the demand for Rs. 40,000 in the year as monthly rental amount is exorbitant.You can calculate the arrears of rental amount due to the difference in enhancement every year and inform him that you can pay that amount as well the actual amount as per the calculation given above.You can refuse to pay exorbitant rental amount and also refuse to vacate, besides you can approach the rent control court or civil court seeking an order of injunction agaisnt the landlord to restrain him from forcibly evicting you other than by due process of law.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Rent increase and arrears",
    "answer": "Dear Client,So, this is what you can do...Review the Original AgreementEscalation Clause: For instance, if the initial agreement for salary increment was at 5 percent annually, they expect you to stick to the same formula unless a new arrangement is made and put down in writing.Expiry of Agreement: Specifically, when the initial deal concluded in 2018, there have been no extensions or new conditions set to replace it; however, you operate legally on a month-to-month basis until new terms and conditions are established.Communication and NegotiationDiscussion with Landlord: You should also try to speak to the landlord regarding the rent rise that is in place for the flat. Point out that since the escalation of the rate was not accompanied by a new agreement on the matter or a new contract, the raise should be implemented strictly in accordance with the increase previously agreed upon.Written Agreement: Better make sure that any new terms are put in writing so that others can’t take advantage in the same way in the future.Legal StandpointValidity of Rent Increase: Unless the landlord secures a new signature for a new agreement, legal means exist that forbid this action, by which the landlord begins to unilaterally alter the terms of the rent and demands back payments according to those terms.Payment of Arrears: You remain bound by the terms of the original agreement and thereby you will be expected to pay the arrears as outlined by the 5% escalation clause, not the new rate which has been singly decided.Steps to TakeArrears calculated on the original terms and conditions Working in this calculation The formula in working with this calculation The formula in working with this calculation The formula in working with this calculation Arrears calculated based on the above-mentioned original terms and conditions can be determined by the following calculations: Working in this calculation: Arrears = Credit terms – Actual payment Credit terms are the original terms that were agreed upon between the supplier and the buyer while the actualBased on this seeming disparity, determine the new total rent which is 5% above your last agreed rent, and then calculate the rent arrears from October 2023 to May 2024.Communicate Your PositionDraft a letter or email to the landlord explaining your position. It is also important to confirm that there is a new agreement or an extension on the previous deadline. For that reason, state it in writing that: The current terms apply, including the 5% escalation clause due to the lack of a new agreement.In conclusion, based on the current tenancy agreement that has not been altered, you cannot be expected to pay the arrears based on the new rent demand of Rs. 40, 000 without a new agreement being initiated and signed. You should work on the escalations based on the provisions of the agreement where the rate increases by 5% every year and that should be communicated to the landlord. Moreover, it is always useful to talk to a legal professional to ensure your rights are covered and to manage potential conflict.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Adverse possession, ownership right",
    "answer": "The Supreme Court observed that tenants cannot claim claim adverse possession against their landlords, since their possession is permissive in nature.However, under the Limitation Act 1963, a tenant can potentially assert ownership of a house if the property owner fails to assert their ownership for 12 years and if the tenant continues to occupy the property for those 12 years. This is referred to as adverse possession of property. Ownership claims by tenants through adverse possession occur when the lease expires or when the landlord breaches clauses in the rental agreement regarding rent payment.Now on the basis of your continuous occupation of the property by your father and on that basis you have inheritance rights for tenancy, you can continue to occupy the property, your cousin grandfather, if not having any rental agreement and the original owner is reported to be missing, then the proposed case by your cousin grandfather also may not be maintainable.However it is not advisable that you file a suit for claiming title operating the law of adverse possession since one of the legal heirs of the original owner has already issued a legal notice to you to vacate the premises.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

Ensure that you have complied with all the conditions mentioned in the agreement.Send a Formal Request: Initially, send a formal written request to the landlord asking for the refund of the security deposit. Mention the clause in your rental agreement that stipulates the refund process.Legal Notice: If the landlord does not respond or refuses to refund the deposit, you can send a legal notice through an advocate. This notice will formally demand the refund and mention the intention to take legal action if the deposit is not returned.Consumer Protection Act, 2019: If the landlord’s actions can be considered unfair trade practices or deficiencies in service, you can approach the consumer forum under this Act.Civil Suit: If the amount is significant, you can file a civil suit for the recovery of the security deposit. The court will consider the evidence, such as the rental agreement and any communication between you and the landlord.Interest on Security Deposit: If your rental agreement specifies it, you may also claim interest on the security deposit for the period it was withheld by the landlord.Mediation: Before going to court, you can also consider mediation. A mediator can help both parties reach an amicable solution without the need for litigation.It’s important to keep all communication with the landlord documented and to have all the evidence of payments and correspondence organized."

    "question": "Rent increase and arrears",
    "answer": "Dear Client, I understand this is a challenging situation for you.As per the lease deed, the rent escalation clause states that there should be a 5% escalation on the rent after completion of 11 months every year. This means that the rent increase should apply immediately after the completion of 11 months from the start of the lease in 2020. Therefore, the rent should have been increased in 2021 and every year thereafter.If the landlord is now claiming arrears for the increased rent since 2021, and you have been paying the same rent since 2020 without any prior communication from the landlord, there may be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the lease agreement.Try to negotiate with the landlord to reach a mutual understanding regarding the rent arrears. If there was a genuine misunderstanding or lack of communication, you may be able to come to a resolution without legal intervention.If you are satisfied with the reply, kindly give me a 5 star rating.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay Highcourt.Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "context": "Asked 1 year ago in Property Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Rent increase and arrears",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here’s a detailed analysis and response to your questions based on the lease agreement and relevant legal provisions:Lease Agreement Interpretation:Question #1: When is the rent increase applicable?Lease Clause: “The lease shall be for a period of 3 years beginning on October 21, 2020, and renewable with 5% escalation on the rent after completion of 11 months every year.”Based on this clause, the rent increase is applicable every year after the completion of 11 months, not after the lease renewal in 2023. Therefore, the first increase would have been due on September 21, 2021, the second on August 21, 2022, and the third on July 21, 2023.Question #2: Landlord’s Claim for ArrearsSince the landlord has never raised this issue before and there was no communication regarding the rent increase, there are certain considerations under the law:Legal Provisions and Principles:1. \"Contractual Terms\":Section 70 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872: When a person lawfully does something for another person or delivers something to him without intending to do so gratuitously, and the other person enjoys the benefit thereof, the latter is bound to make compensation to the former in respect of, or to restore, the thing so done or delivered.Section 115 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872: Estoppel by conduct, where if a person has, by his declaration, act, or omission, intentionally caused or permitted another person to believe a thing to be true and to act upon such belief, neither he nor his representative shall be allowed, in any suit or proceeding between himself and such person or his representative, to deny the truth of that thing.2. Reasonableness and Communication:Section 106 of theTransfer of Property Act, 1882: In the absence of a contract or local law or usage to the contrary, a lease of immovable property shall be deemed to be a lease from month to month, terminable, on the part of either the lessor or the lessee, by 15 days’ notice expiring with the end of a month of the tenancy.The landlord’s delay in raising the issue of rent increases and the absence of any prior communication may be considered unreasonable and could be argued to have waived the right to claim the increased rent retroactively.Steps to take:1. Review the Lease Agreement: Carefully read the lease agreement again to ensure there are no additional clauses that clarify the rent escalation terms.2. Communicate with the Landlord: Write a formal letter or email to the landlord expressing your understanding of the lease agreement. State that there was no prior communication regarding the rent increase and that you have been paying the agreed rent of Rs. 23,000 per month.3. Negotiate a Settlement: If the landlord insists on the arrears, negotiate a possible settlement. Given the absence of prior communication and the sudden demand for arrears, you can argue for a reduction or a waiver of the alleged outstanding amount.4. Seek Legal Advice: Consult a legal expert specialising in property or tenancy law. They can help draft a formal response and guide you on how to proceed if the landlord continues to demand the arrears.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Rent increase and arrears",
    "answer": "If the original agreement fixed in the year was 23000, the enhanced rent @ 5% is payable in the year 2021, which will be 24150 and the same is payable at Rs. 25360  in the year 2022 and it amounts to 26630 in the year 2023 and it will be Rs. 27960 in the year 2024.Therefore the demand for Rs. 40,000 in the year as monthly rental amount is exorbitant.You can calculate the arrears of rental amount due to the difference in enhancement every year and inform him that you can pay that amount as well the actual amount as per the calculation given above.You can refuse to pay exorbitant rental amount and also refuse to vacate, besides you can approach the rent control court or civil court seeking an order of injunction agaisnt the landlord to restrain him from forcibly evicting you other than by due process of law.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Rent increase and arrears",
    "answer": "Dear Client,So, this is what you can do...Review the Original AgreementEscalation Clause: For instance, if the initial agreement for salary increment was at 5 percent annually, they expect you to stick to the same formula unless a new arrangement is made and put down in writing.Expiry of Agreement: Specifically, when the initial deal concluded in 2018, there have been no extensions or new conditions set to replace it; however, you operate legally on a month-to-month basis until new terms and conditions are established.Communication and NegotiationDiscussion with Landlord: You should also try to speak to the landlord regarding the rent rise that is in place for the flat. Point out that since the escalation of the rate was not accompanied by a new agreement on the matter or a new contract, the raise should be implemented strictly in accordance with the increase previously agreed upon.Written Agreement: Better make sure that any new terms are put in writing so that others can’t take advantage in the same way in the future.Legal StandpointValidity of Rent Increase: Unless the landlord secures a new signature for a new agreement, legal means exist that forbid this action, by which the landlord begins to unilaterally alter the terms of the rent and demands back payments according to those terms.Payment of Arrears: You remain bound by the terms of the original agreement and thereby you will be expected to pay the arrears as outlined by the 5% escalation clause, not the new rate which has been singly decided.Steps to TakeArrears calculated on the original terms and conditions Working in this calculation The formula in working with this calculation The formula in working with this calculation The formula in working with this calculation Arrears calculated based on the above-mentioned original terms and conditions can be determined by the following calculations: Working in this calculation: Arrears = Credit terms – Actual payment Credit terms are the original terms that were agreed upon between the supplier and the buyer while the actualBased on this seeming disparity, determine the new total rent which is 5% above your last agreed rent, and then calculate the rent arrears from October 2023 to May 2024.Communicate Your PositionDraft a letter or email to the landlord explaining your position. It is also important to confirm that there is a new agreement or an extension on the previous deadline. For that reason, state it in writing that: The current terms apply, including the 5% escalation clause due to the lack of a new agreement.In conclusion, based on the current tenancy agreement that has not been altered, you cannot be expected to pay the arrears based on the new rent demand of Rs. 40, 000 without a new agreement being initiated and signed. You should work on the escalations based on the provisions of the agreement where the rate increases by 5% every year and that should be communicated to the landlord. Moreover, it is always useful to talk to a legal professional to ensure your rights are covered and to manage potential conflict.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Divorce",
    "answer": "I am sorry to hear that you are facing such issues. Doubt is very destructive in a relationship. It's important to have an open and honest conversation with your partner regarding what happened in the past, it will not contribute positively to your married life. had life been that simple enough, why would we be facing challenges at all?You think if she had loved you, none of this would have happened. You choose to see it from your point of view which is understandable. Discovering that you were having previous love/ sex history with someone else can be a traumatic experience, and it's understandable that she may be feeling hurt, angry, and betrayed which she could not have resist or open up during the initial stage of marriage. It's important to prioritize well-being and emotional health during this time.If you want to work on your relationship with your wife, it's important to communicate openly and honestly about your feelings. Let your wife know how her actions have affected you and what you need in order to move forward and set clear boundaries with your wife regarding what is and isn't acceptable behavior. If you choose to work on your relationship, make sure that your wife is willing to take responsibility for her actions and work towards rebuilding trust.Very first step is to get her to acknowledge that something is missing, and your concerns are valid. You have to learn to make her empathize with you. Explain how you feel and ask her if she thinks this is fair. If you think she will go into defence mode impulsively, tell her that you don't want an answer. That you just want her to think about it. Tell her that you want to make it work, but that this is not enough and that you expect more from her. There is a chance that none of this will work. If that's the case, you may need to get used to a loveless marriage or get a divorce. Honestly, I feel sorry for you, but you don't deserve this. It breaks my heart to see a fellow human deprived of the joys of having a spouse who loves them the same. Maybe it is because I see a lot of my younger self in you. I honestly hope the best for you. so:Consider counseling: If you and your wife want to work on your relationship, consider couples counseling. A trained therapist can help you and your wife communicate effectively and work through any underlying issues that may have contributed to the infidelity. Sit down as a couple and if it is with a marriage counsellor, it might help as you can have an independent view of things.Take time to reflect: Consider what you want for your future and whether or not she is willing to work on your relationship. It's important to make a decision that feels right for both of you keeping the interest and well-being of the child onboard.Don't blame each-other: It's important to remember that your wife's behaviour may be some situation based or due to strong interference of her parents in the marriage. Ultimately, the decision about what to do with your marriage is up to you and your wife, and it's important to make a decision that feels right for both of you.Wouldn’t you want to know if your wife wants to continue in this marriage or not?Why she keeps away from you and why she doesn’t want intimacy or dont want to leave her job? why she is not ready to come back? any triggering issues? Any emotional triggers from your past relationship/ life ?- these questions need to be answered,so that both of you as mature adults can priorities what’s important and either work together for the marriage or move on with your lives going separate.she has to recognize that all that has happened is a matter of past and if you are fully emotionally, physically, financially and in all other aspect, are honestly committed to her in the relationship, she should come to you and explain whatever problems persist and resolve mutually.Here, she may be worried about the financial independence, or she want some form of freedom in the married life and in the present patriarchal society the fabrics of responsibilities are still around the girl. so, both of you have to communicate with yourself and each-other. Try a fresh with focus on the present and try to build a more transparent and communicative relationship in the present. Take this opportunity to work together and strengthen your marriage.Try to follow these commandment answers for a lifetime of happiness and harmony:What are your personal values and beliefs?How do you envision our roles and responsibilities within the marriage?How do you envision the role of family in our relationship?What are your career aspirations, and how do you plan to achieve them?How do you handle stress or challenges in life?How do you handle conflicts or disagreements in a relationship?How do you manage finances and plan for the future?What are your hobbies and interests outside of work?How do you prioritize spending time with family and friends?What are your expectations regarding communication and openness in our relationship?What are your religious or cultural beliefs, and how do they influence your life?How do you see our relationship evolving over time, and what are your thoughts on starting a family?Are there any specific values or traditions that are important to you, and how do you envision incorporating them into our lives together?How do you prioritize personal growth and self-improvement in a relationship?How do you maintain a healthy work-life balance?How do you express love and affection in a relationship?How do you handle differences in opinions or cultural backgrounds?What are your expectations regarding household chores and responsibilities?How do you balance personal space and time with family responsibilities?What are your views on gender equality and mutual respect in marriage?How do you envision supporting each other through life's ups and downs?And if all this failed, then proceed for initiating a case forrestitution of Conjugal rightsu/s 9 of HMA. and if, despite of the court order, she submit or not willing to conjugate, file a divorce case and denial of the conjugal rights would be a very valid grounds for divorce, which might be without paying any maintenance too.The procedure for filing a case u/s 9 of HMA for conjugal rights is:file a petition in the district court. The format of such petition is available on the internet. This can be transferred by application to the High Court or Supreme Court as well.Upon such filing, a copy of the petition should be sent to the respondent- wife along with the date of hearing from the district court. The date is generally after 3 months of filing the petition.Both parties are to be present at the date of hearing. If both parties are not present, the court gives another date.The next step is that of counseling/mediation sent by the court-It is done by the family court, as provided for in the Family Courts Act. This takes approximately 4 months.Once the application back to court on grounds that mediation has failed.The suit will continue, and the respondent-wife is required to give her ‘counter’ to the husband’s application. Oral arguments will proceed to dispose of the interim petitions first and pass the interim order.Once this is done with, the proceedings forrestitution of conjugal rightsbegin. The husband has to file a Chief Examination Affidavit for producing evidence that the wife has left him, which will result in cross-examination.Final arguments take place next, where both the parties represent their version of facts, cite any relevant judgments, and ultimately pray for relief from the Judge.Based on the counseling, statements made and the conduct of the parties, the judge accordingly grants the decree.to ensure execution, there is an attachment of the Respondent’s property to it, as per Order21 Rule 32 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The rule says that where the party against whom a decree forrestitution of conjugal rights, has been passed, and has had an opportunity of obeying the decree and has willfully failed to obey it the decree may be enforced by attachment of his property. Upon passing of such decree, the law provides for a minimum of one year beyond which other remedies lie.the Bombay High Court has held that denying intercourse to the spouse for a long period of time will amount to cruelty and will be ground for divorce. Similarly, the Supreme Court has also said that if a spouse does not allow the partner to have intercourse for a long time, without sufficient reason, it amounts to mental cruelty, upholding a verdict of the Madras High Court to grant a divorce to a man. Thus, a husband, wherein is denied conjugal rights by the wife, can file for divorce, without the remedy of restitution of rights.The procedure of the case will then proceed on the lines of a divorce proceeding. Husband can file for it under the ground of desertion, if the time lapse is satisfied, and there is a reason to believe that the spouses may reconcile.Husband may file for judicial separation/ or for divorce on the ground of cruelty.Custody of the childcustody of a child below 5 years is given to mother only, if available so in your case she may get custody. so she may file for maintenance and since child rearing is a shared responsibility, you can challenge, and counter based on her earning and financial strength.later on, you may apply for child custody.The divorce must be used as matter of last resort.Vivek Bhai PatelAdvocate, New Delhi26 AnswersTalk to Advocate Vivek Bhai Patel"

Ensure that you have complied with all the conditions mentioned in the agreement.Send a Formal Request: Initially, send a formal written request to the landlord asking for the refund of the security deposit. Mention the clause in your rental agreement that stipulates the refund process.Legal Notice: If the landlord does not respond or refuses to refund the deposit, you can send a legal notice through an advocate. This notice will formally demand the refund and mention the intention to take legal action if the deposit is not returned.Consumer Protection Act, 2019: If the landlord’s actions can be considered unfair trade practices or deficiencies in service, you can approach the consumer forum under this Act.Civil Suit: If the amount is significant, you can file a civil suit for the recovery of the security deposit. The court will consider the evidence, such as the rental agreement and any communication between you and the landlord.Interest on Security Deposit: If your rental agreement specifies it, you may also claim interest on the security deposit for the period it was withheld by the landlord.Mediation: Before going to court, you can also consider mediation. A mediator can help both parties reach an amicable solution without the need for litigation.It’s important to keep all communication with the landlord documented and to have all the evidence of payments and correspondence organized."

    "question": "Rent increase and arrears",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here’s a detailed analysis and response to your questions based on the lease agreement and relevant legal provisions:Lease Agreement Interpretation:Question #1: When is the rent increase applicable?Lease Clause: “The lease shall be for a period of 3 years beginning on October 21, 2020, and renewable with 5% escalation on the rent after completion of 11 months every year.”Based on this clause, the rent increase is applicable every year after the completion of 11 months, not after the lease renewal in 2023. Therefore, the first increase would have been due on September 21, 2021, the second on August 21, 2022, and the third on July 21, 2023.Question #2: Landlord’s Claim for ArrearsSince the landlord has never raised this issue before and there was no communication regarding the rent increase, there are certain considerations under the law:Legal Provisions and Principles:1. \"Contractual Terms\":Section 70 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872: When a person lawfully does something for another person or delivers something to him without intending to do so gratuitously, and the other person enjoys the benefit thereof, the latter is bound to make compensation to the former in respect of, or to restore, the thing so done or delivered.Section 115 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872: Estoppel by conduct, where if a person has, by his declaration, act, or omission, intentionally caused or permitted another person to believe a thing to be true and to act upon such belief, neither he nor his representative shall be allowed, in any suit or proceeding between himself and such person or his representative, to deny the truth of that thing.2. Reasonableness and Communication:Section 106 of theTransfer of Property Act, 1882: In the absence of a contract or local law or usage to the contrary, a lease of immovable property shall be deemed to be a lease from month to month, terminable, on the part of either the lessor or the lessee, by 15 days’ notice expiring with the end of a month of the tenancy.The landlord’s delay in raising the issue of rent increases and the absence of any prior communication may be considered unreasonable and could be argued to have waived the right to claim the increased rent retroactively.Steps to take:1. Review the Lease Agreement: Carefully read the lease agreement again to ensure there are no additional clauses that clarify the rent escalation terms.2. Communicate with the Landlord: Write a formal letter or email to the landlord expressing your understanding of the lease agreement. State that there was no prior communication regarding the rent increase and that you have been paying the agreed rent of Rs. 23,000 per month.3. Negotiate a Settlement: If the landlord insists on the arrears, negotiate a possible settlement. Given the absence of prior communication and the sudden demand for arrears, you can argue for a reduction or a waiver of the alleged outstanding amount.4. Seek Legal Advice: Consult a legal expert specialising in property or tenancy law. They can help draft a formal response and guide you on how to proceed if the landlord continues to demand the arrears.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "If the original agreement fixed in the year was 23000, the enhanced rent @ 5% is payable in the year 2021, which will be 24150 and the same is payable at Rs. 25360  in the year 2022 and it amounts to 26630 in the year 2023 and it will be Rs. 27960 in the year 2024.Therefore the demand for Rs. 40,000 in the year as monthly rental amount is exorbitant.You can calculate the arrears of rental amount due to the difference in enhancement every year and inform him that you can pay that amount as well the actual amount as per the calculation given above.You can refuse to pay exorbitant rental amount and also refuse to vacate, besides you can approach the rent control court or civil court seeking an order of injunction agaisnt the landlord to restrain him from forcibly evicting you other than by due process of law.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Rent increase and arrears",
    "answer": "Dear Client,So, this is what you can do...Review the Original AgreementEscalation Clause: For instance, if the initial agreement for salary increment was at 5 percent annually, they expect you to stick to the same formula unless a new arrangement is made and put down in writing.Expiry of Agreement: Specifically, when the initial deal concluded in 2018, there have been no extensions or new conditions set to replace it; however, you operate legally on a month-to-month basis until new terms and conditions are established.Communication and NegotiationDiscussion with Landlord: You should also try to speak to the landlord regarding the rent rise that is in place for the flat. Point out that since the escalation of the rate was not accompanied by a new agreement on the matter or a new contract, the raise should be implemented strictly in accordance with the increase previously agreed upon.Written Agreement: Better make sure that any new terms are put in writing so that others can’t take advantage in the same way in the future.Legal StandpointValidity of Rent Increase: Unless the landlord secures a new signature for a new agreement, legal means exist that forbid this action, by which the landlord begins to unilaterally alter the terms of the rent and demands back payments according to those terms.Payment of Arrears: You remain bound by the terms of the original agreement and thereby you will be expected to pay the arrears as outlined by the 5% escalation clause, not the new rate which has been singly decided.Steps to TakeArrears calculated on the original terms and conditions Working in this calculation The formula in working with this calculation The formula in working with this calculation The formula in working with this calculation Arrears calculated based on the above-mentioned original terms and conditions can be determined by the following calculations: Working in this calculation: Arrears = Credit terms – Actual payment Credit terms are the original terms that were agreed upon between the supplier and the buyer while the actualBased on this seeming disparity, determine the new total rent which is 5% above your last agreed rent, and then calculate the rent arrears from October 2023 to May 2024.Communicate Your PositionDraft a letter or email to the landlord explaining your position. It is also important to confirm that there is a new agreement or an extension on the previous deadline. For that reason, state it in writing that: The current terms apply, including the 5% escalation clause due to the lack of a new agreement.In conclusion, based on the current tenancy agreement that has not been altered, you cannot be expected to pay the arrears based on the new rent demand of Rs. 40, 000 without a new agreement being initiated and signed. You should work on the escalations based on the provisions of the agreement where the rate increases by 5% every year and that should be communicated to the landlord. Moreover, it is always useful to talk to a legal professional to ensure your rights are covered and to manage potential conflict.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "How will property tax be charged on Jodi flats in Mumbai",
    "answer": "A Jodi flat, sometimes referred to as a \"combined\" or \"paired\" flat, is a residential unit that combines two or more adjacent apartments into a single living space. Jodi flats, as the name suggests, are a distinctive housing option where two adjacent apartments are merged to create a more expansive and unified living space.However, though the two flats are merged, property tax etc will be charged by the authorities on both apartments, depending on the size of the apartments.\"In simple words, merging of two flats is possible and it is legally permissible. However, who needs to go and seek permission from the BMC depending on project to project. In case, it is a new project and the home buyer is going to move into a jodi apartment, the home buyer should ask the developer to take all the permission.If it is an old society, the homeowner will require a no objection certificate (NOC) from the housing society. If the society is not formed, an NOC might be required from the developer. Additionally, a certificate from the structural auditor that the merging of two or more flats will not affect the structural stability of the building is needed.\"T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "The Supreme Court observed that tenants cannot claim claim adverse possession against their landlords, since their possession is permissive in nature.However, under the Limitation Act 1963, a tenant can potentially assert ownership of a house if the property owner fails to assert their ownership for 12 years and if the tenant continues to occupy the property for those 12 years. This is referred to as adverse possession of property. Ownership claims by tenants through adverse possession occur when the lease expires or when the landlord breaches clauses in the rental agreement regarding rent payment.Now on the basis of your continuous occupation of the property by your father and on that basis you have inheritance rights for tenancy, you can continue to occupy the property, your cousin grandfather, if not having any rental agreement and the original owner is reported to be missing, then the proposed case by your cousin grandfather also may not be maintainable.However it is not advisable that you file a suit for claiming title operating the law of adverse possession since one of the legal heirs of the original owner has already issued a legal notice to you to vacate the premises.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Builder not agreeing to register  sale  agreement",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Coming to the point, I suggest that you write to the builder and the bank formally and request that they remove the said clause from the tripartite agreement. When making your disapproval pertaining to the clause that may bar one from claiming an opportunity to sue or sue the other in relation to the property, it is crucial to be assertively clear. So cast a spell on a clause as highly prejudicial, unfair and unviable and state how its enforcement can actually have a negative effect on that particular contractual party.In the event that the builder and bank are not in a position to respond to your request to delete the clause, then it is time to seek a legal opinion. To overcome this issue, you better talk with the provider and try to negotiate with them or find another legal way to solve the issue with the help of an attorney. If those negotiations are never to yield any results or if they are to produce results which are not in good proportions for better negotiation, then perhaps it is time to rethink about the agreement in such terms since, during and after the construction phase, one will not have many channels to seek legal redress in case of any eventuality.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "The Supreme Court observed that tenants cannot claim claim adverse possession against their landlords, since their possession is permissive in nature.However, under the Limitation Act 1963, a tenant can potentially assert ownership of a house if the property owner fails to assert their ownership for 12 years and if the tenant continues to occupy the property for those 12 years. This is referred to as adverse possession of property. Ownership claims by tenants through adverse possession occur when the lease expires or when the landlord breaches clauses in the rental agreement regarding rent payment.Now on the basis of your continuous occupation of the property by your father and on that basis you have inheritance rights for tenancy, you can continue to occupy the property, your cousin grandfather, if not having any rental agreement and the original owner is reported to be missing, then the proposed case by your cousin grandfather also may not be maintainable.However it is not advisable that you file a suit for claiming title operating the law of adverse possession since one of the legal heirs of the original owner has already issued a legal notice to you to vacate the premises.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "1. In india, custody of childrens generally of inferior age is preferred to be given to mother only. But in cases where you can establish that you can take care of your child better than your wife and your wife is unfit due to certain reason like she is alcoholic etc, than it is duly considered by the Court and there appears higher chances of you getting the custody as the court while deciding the issue related to custody satisfies himself as to under whose custody the welfare of the child lies and decides accordingly.To seek custody, if you are hindu, you can move an petition under section 26 ofHindu Marriage Act, or Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, and in case to inter-religious marriage one can seek custody under section 38 ofSpecial Marriage Actbefore your juridical family court.2.

If she can establish the same before a family court, the court may decide if you had a reasonable cause or not and if it is a fit case for RCR at your instance. Try for a family counseling with responsible mediation if you really want her back.In many cases, people won't check their faults but point the spouse. Just to avoid such a mistake, check if you have to change your behavior or your parents have to change their behaviors towards her, if she complains that she's not being treated properly.

The court further stated that the woman cannot put pressure on her husband or make any \"unreasonable demand to live separately\" in accordance with Indian culture.Thus if we keep in view just the above facts, you may file for restitution and she wouldn't be able to take the defence you mentioned above as fights are part and parcel of marriage and in the heat of the moment several things are said which are not meant.Hope I have answered to your satisfaction.Gagandeep Singh ThandiAdvocate, Pathankot68 AnswersTalk to Advocate Gagandeep Singh Thandi"

    "question": "Builder not agreeing to register  sale  agreement",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Coming to the point, I suggest that you write to the builder and the bank formally and request that they remove the said clause from the tripartite agreement. When making your disapproval pertaining to the clause that may bar one from claiming an opportunity to sue or sue the other in relation to the property, it is crucial to be assertively clear. So cast a spell on a clause as highly prejudicial, unfair and unviable and state how its enforcement can actually have a negative effect on that particular contractual party.In the event that the builder and bank are not in a position to respond to your request to delete the clause, then it is time to seek a legal opinion. To overcome this issue, you better talk with the provider and try to negotiate with them or find another legal way to solve the issue with the help of an attorney. If those negotiations are never to yield any results or if they are to produce results which are not in good proportions for better negotiation, then perhaps it is time to rethink about the agreement in such terms since, during and after the construction phase, one will not have many channels to seek legal redress in case of any eventuality.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,I understand this is a challenging situation for you.As an OCI holder, you are generally allowed to purchase and hold agricultural land in India, subject to certain restrictions and regulations.If your father is the current owner of the agricultural land in India, he can transfer the land to you through a gift deed or a will. The transfer process may vary depending on the state where the land is located.Your father can transfer the land to you through a gift deed, which is a legal document that transfers the ownership of the property without any monetary consideration. The gift deed must be registered with the appropriate authorities in India.Your father can also transfer the land to you through a will, which is a legal document that specifies how his assets should be distributed after his death. The will must be executed in accordance with the Indian Succession Act.Once the transfer is complete, the land must be registered in your name with the appropriate authorities in India. This process may involve paying stamp duty and other fees.As an OCI holder, you may be subject to certain restrictions on the use and transfer of agricultural land in India. It is essential to familiarize yourself with the relevant laws and regulations in the state where the land is located.If you are satisfied with the reply, kindly give me a 5 star rating.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay Highcourt.Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "question": "Divorce",
    "answer": "I am sorry to hear that you are facing such issues. Doubt is very destructive in a relationship. It's important to have an open and honest conversation with your partner regarding what happened in the past, it will not contribute positively to your married life. had life been that simple enough, why would we be facing challenges at all?You think if she had loved you, none of this would have happened. You choose to see it from your point of view which is understandable. Discovering that you were having previous love/ sex history with someone else can be a traumatic experience, and it's understandable that she may be feeling hurt, angry, and betrayed which she could not have resist or open up during the initial stage of marriage. It's important to prioritize well-being and emotional health during this time.If you want to work on your relationship with your wife, it's important to communicate openly and honestly about your feelings. Let your wife know how her actions have affected you and what you need in order to move forward and set clear boundaries with your wife regarding what is and isn't acceptable behavior. If you choose to work on your relationship, make sure that your wife is willing to take responsibility for her actions and work towards rebuilding trust.Very first step is to get her to acknowledge that something is missing, and your concerns are valid. You have to learn to make her empathize with you. Explain how you feel and ask her if she thinks this is fair. If you think she will go into defence mode impulsively, tell her that you don't want an answer. That you just want her to think about it. Tell her that you want to make it work, but that this is not enough and that you expect more from her. There is a chance that none of this will work. If that's the case, you may need to get used to a loveless marriage or get a divorce. Honestly, I feel sorry for you, but you don't deserve this. It breaks my heart to see a fellow human deprived of the joys of having a spouse who loves them the same. Maybe it is because I see a lot of my younger self in you. I honestly hope the best for you. so:Consider counseling: If you and your wife want to work on your relationship, consider couples counseling. A trained therapist can help you and your wife communicate effectively and work through any underlying issues that may have contributed to the infidelity. Sit down as a couple and if it is with a marriage counsellor, it might help as you can have an independent view of things.Take time to reflect: Consider what you want for your future and whether or not she is willing to work on your relationship. It's important to make a decision that feels right for both of you keeping the interest and well-being of the child onboard.Don't blame each-other: It's important to remember that your wife's behaviour may be some situation based or due to strong interference of her parents in the marriage. Ultimately, the decision about what to do with your marriage is up to you and your wife, and it's important to make a decision that feels right for both of you.Wouldn’t you want to know if your wife wants to continue in this marriage or not?Why she keeps away from you and why she doesn’t want intimacy or dont want to leave her job? why she is not ready to come back? any triggering issues? Any emotional triggers from your past relationship/ life ?- these questions need to be answered,so that both of you as mature adults can priorities what’s important and either work together for the marriage or move on with your lives going separate.she has to recognize that all that has happened is a matter of past and if you are fully emotionally, physically, financially and in all other aspect, are honestly committed to her in the relationship, she should come to you and explain whatever problems persist and resolve mutually.Here, she may be worried about the financial independence, or she want some form of freedom in the married life and in the present patriarchal society the fabrics of responsibilities are still around the girl. so, both of you have to communicate with yourself and each-other. Try a fresh with focus on the present and try to build a more transparent and communicative relationship in the present. Take this opportunity to work together and strengthen your marriage.Try to follow these commandment answers for a lifetime of happiness and harmony:What are your personal values and beliefs?How do you envision our roles and responsibilities within the marriage?How do you envision the role of family in our relationship?What are your career aspirations, and how do you plan to achieve them?How do you handle stress or challenges in life?How do you handle conflicts or disagreements in a relationship?How do you manage finances and plan for the future?What are your hobbies and interests outside of work?How do you prioritize spending time with family and friends?What are your expectations regarding communication and openness in our relationship?What are your religious or cultural beliefs, and how do they influence your life?How do you see our relationship evolving over time, and what are your thoughts on starting a family?Are there any specific values or traditions that are important to you, and how do you envision incorporating them into our lives together?How do you prioritize personal growth and self-improvement in a relationship?How do you maintain a healthy work-life balance?How do you express love and affection in a relationship?How do you handle differences in opinions or cultural backgrounds?What are your expectations regarding household chores and responsibilities?How do you balance personal space and time with family responsibilities?What are your views on gender equality and mutual respect in marriage?How do you envision supporting each other through life's ups and downs?And if all this failed, then proceed for initiating a case forrestitution of Conjugal rightsu/s 9 of HMA. and if, despite of the court order, she submit or not willing to conjugate, file a divorce case and denial of the conjugal rights would be a very valid grounds for divorce, which might be without paying any maintenance too.The procedure for filing a case u/s 9 of HMA for conjugal rights is:file a petition in the district court. The format of such petition is available on the internet. This can be transferred by application to the High Court or Supreme Court as well.Upon such filing, a copy of the petition should be sent to the respondent- wife along with the date of hearing from the district court. The date is generally after 3 months of filing the petition.Both parties are to be present at the date of hearing. If both parties are not present, the court gives another date.The next step is that of counseling/mediation sent by the court-It is done by the family court, as provided for in the Family Courts Act. This takes approximately 4 months.Once the application back to court on grounds that mediation has failed.The suit will continue, and the respondent-wife is required to give her ‘counter’ to the husband’s application. Oral arguments will proceed to dispose of the interim petitions first and pass the interim order.Once this is done with, the proceedings forrestitution of conjugal rightsbegin. The husband has to file a Chief Examination Affidavit for producing evidence that the wife has left him, which will result in cross-examination.Final arguments take place next, where both the parties represent their version of facts, cite any relevant judgments, and ultimately pray for relief from the Judge.Based on the counseling, statements made and the conduct of the parties, the judge accordingly grants the decree.to ensure execution, there is an attachment of the Respondent’s property to it, as per Order21 Rule 32 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The rule says that where the party against whom a decree forrestitution of conjugal rights, has been passed, and has had an opportunity of obeying the decree and has willfully failed to obey it the decree may be enforced by attachment of his property. Upon passing of such decree, the law provides for a minimum of one year beyond which other remedies lie.the Bombay High Court has held that denying intercourse to the spouse for a long period of time will amount to cruelty and will be ground for divorce. Similarly, the Supreme Court has also said that if a spouse does not allow the partner to have intercourse for a long time, without sufficient reason, it amounts to mental cruelty, upholding a verdict of the Madras High Court to grant a divorce to a man. Thus, a husband, wherein is denied conjugal rights by the wife, can file for divorce, without the remedy of restitution of rights.The procedure of the case will then proceed on the lines of a divorce proceeding. Husband can file for it under the ground of desertion, if the time lapse is satisfied, and there is a reason to believe that the spouses may reconcile.Husband may file for judicial separation/ or for divorce on the ground of cruelty.Custody of the childcustody of a child below 5 years is given to mother only, if available so in your case she may get custody. so she may file for maintenance and since child rearing is a shared responsibility, you can challenge, and counter based on her earning and financial strength.later on, you may apply for child custody.The divorce must be used as matter of last resort.Vivek Bhai PatelAdvocate, New Delhi26 AnswersTalk to Advocate Vivek Bhai Patel"

If she can establish the same before a family court, the court may decide if you had a reasonable cause or not and if it is a fit case for RCR at your instance. Try for a family counseling with responsible mediation if you really want her back.In many cases, people won't check their faults but point the spouse. Just to avoid such a mistake, check if you have to change your behavior or your parents have to change their behaviors towards her, if she complains that she's not being treated properly.

The facts that you mentioned may not be the basis to denyrestitution of conjugal rightsbut she may level false allegations of torture for dowry or mental harassment. it is recommended that you try to talk it out but if you do take the matter to court you can use the following judgement : Rudra Narayan Ray v.

The court further stated that the woman cannot put pressure on her husband or make any \"unreasonable demand to live separately\" in accordance with Indian culture.Thus if we keep in view just the above facts, you may file for restitution and she wouldn't be able to take the defence you mentioned above as fights are part and parcel of marriage and in the heat of the moment several things are said which are not meant.Hope I have answered to your satisfaction.Gagandeep Singh ThandiAdvocate, Pathankot68 AnswersTalk to Advocate Gagandeep Singh Thandi"

    "answer": "Your description is not revealing any specific details, hence cannot give a definite answer. Whatever the context was, you've asked her to leave. She did not leave you at her own will. If she can establish the same before a family court, the court may decide if you had a reasonable cause or not and if it is a fit case for RCR at your instance. Try for a family counseling with responsible mediation if you really want her back.In many cases, people won't check their faults but point the spouse. Just to avoid such a mistake, check if you have to change your behavior or your parents have to change their behaviors towards her, if she complains that she's not being treated properly. Please don't take it in a wrong sense, I've advised because you said you want to file an RCR not divorce.

The facts that you mentioned may not be the basis to denyrestitution of conjugal rightsbut she may level false allegations of torture for dowry or mental harassment. it is recommended that you try to talk it out but if you do take the matter to court you can use the following judgement : Rudra Narayan Ray v. Piyali Ray Chatterjee.The Hon'ble Jharkhand High Court in this case stated that it is obligatory for women to serve their elderly mother-in-laws. The court further stated that the woman cannot put pressure on her husband or make any \"unreasonable demand to live separately\" in accordance with Indian culture.Thus if we keep in view just the above facts, you may file for restitution and she wouldn't be able to take the defence you mentioned above as fights are part and parcel of marriage and in the heat of the moment several things are said which are not meant.Hope I have answered to your satisfaction.Gagandeep Singh ThandiAdvocate, Pathankot68 AnswersTalk to Advocate Gagandeep Singh Thandi"

    "question": "Divorce",
    "answer": "I am sorry to hear that you are facing such issues. Doubt is very destructive in a relationship. It's important to have an open and honest conversation with your partner regarding what happened in the past, it will not contribute positively to your married life. had life been that simple enough, why would we be facing challenges at all?You think if she had loved you, none of this would have happened. You choose to see it from your point of view which is understandable. Discovering that you were having previous love/ sex history with someone else can be a traumatic experience, and it's understandable that she may be feeling hurt, angry, and betrayed which she could not have resist or open up during the initial stage of marriage. It's important to prioritize well-being and emotional health during this time.If you want to work on your relationship with your wife, it's important to communicate openly and honestly about your feelings. Let your wife know how her actions have affected you and what you need in order to move forward and set clear boundaries with your wife regarding what is and isn't acceptable behavior. If you choose to work on your relationship, make sure that your wife is willing to take responsibility for her actions and work towards rebuilding trust.Very first step is to get her to acknowledge that something is missing, and your concerns are valid. You have to learn to make her empathize with you. Explain how you feel and ask her if she thinks this is fair. If you think she will go into defence mode impulsively, tell her that you don't want an answer. That you just want her to think about it. Tell her that you want to make it work, but that this is not enough and that you expect more from her. There is a chance that none of this will work. If that's the case, you may need to get used to a loveless marriage or get a divorce. Honestly, I feel sorry for you, but you don't deserve this. It breaks my heart to see a fellow human deprived of the joys of having a spouse who loves them the same. Maybe it is because I see a lot of my younger self in you. I honestly hope the best for you. so:Consider counseling: If you and your wife want to work on your relationship, consider couples counseling. A trained therapist can help you and your wife communicate effectively and work through any underlying issues that may have contributed to the infidelity. Sit down as a couple and if it is with a marriage counsellor, it might help as you can have an independent view of things.Take time to reflect: Consider what you want for your future and whether or not she is willing to work on your relationship. It's important to make a decision that feels right for both of you keeping the interest and well-being of the child onboard.Don't blame each-other: It's important to remember that your wife's behaviour may be some situation based or due to strong interference of her parents in the marriage. Ultimately, the decision about what to do with your marriage is up to you and your wife, and it's important to make a decision that feels right for both of you.Wouldn’t you want to know if your wife wants to continue in this marriage or not?Why she keeps away from you and why she doesn’t want intimacy or dont want to leave her job? why she is not ready to come back? any triggering issues? Any emotional triggers from your past relationship/ life ?- these questions need to be answered,so that both of you as mature adults can priorities what’s important and either work together for the marriage or move on with your lives going separate.she has to recognize that all that has happened is a matter of past and if you are fully emotionally, physically, financially and in all other aspect, are honestly committed to her in the relationship, she should come to you and explain whatever problems persist and resolve mutually.Here, she may be worried about the financial independence, or she want some form of freedom in the married life and in the present patriarchal society the fabrics of responsibilities are still around the girl. so, both of you have to communicate with yourself and each-other. Try a fresh with focus on the present and try to build a more transparent and communicative relationship in the present. Take this opportunity to work together and strengthen your marriage.Try to follow these commandment answers for a lifetime of happiness and harmony:What are your personal values and beliefs?How do you envision our roles and responsibilities within the marriage?How do you envision the role of family in our relationship?What are your career aspirations, and how do you plan to achieve them?How do you handle stress or challenges in life?How do you handle conflicts or disagreements in a relationship?How do you manage finances and plan for the future?What are your hobbies and interests outside of work?How do you prioritize spending time with family and friends?What are your expectations regarding communication and openness in our relationship?What are your religious or cultural beliefs, and how do they influence your life?How do you see our relationship evolving over time, and what are your thoughts on starting a family?Are there any specific values or traditions that are important to you, and how do you envision incorporating them into our lives together?How do you prioritize personal growth and self-improvement in a relationship?How do you maintain a healthy work-life balance?How do you express love and affection in a relationship?How do you handle differences in opinions or cultural backgrounds?What are your expectations regarding household chores and responsibilities?How do you balance personal space and time with family responsibilities?What are your views on gender equality and mutual respect in marriage?How do you envision supporting each other through life's ups and downs?And if all this failed, then proceed for initiating a case forrestitution of Conjugal rightsu/s 9 of HMA. and if, despite of the court order, she submit or not willing to conjugate, file a divorce case and denial of the conjugal rights would be a very valid grounds for divorce, which might be without paying any maintenance too.The procedure for filing a case u/s 9 of HMA for conjugal rights is:file a petition in the district court. The format of such petition is available on the internet. This can be transferred by application to the High Court or Supreme Court as well.Upon such filing, a copy of the petition should be sent to the respondent- wife along with the date of hearing from the district court. The date is generally after 3 months of filing the petition.Both parties are to be present at the date of hearing. If both parties are not present, the court gives another date.The next step is that of counseling/mediation sent by the court-It is done by the family court, as provided for in the Family Courts Act. This takes approximately 4 months.Once the application back to court on grounds that mediation has failed.The suit will continue, and the respondent-wife is required to give her ‘counter’ to the husband’s application. Oral arguments will proceed to dispose of the interim petitions first and pass the interim order.Once this is done with, the proceedings forrestitution of conjugal rightsbegin. The husband has to file a Chief Examination Affidavit for producing evidence that the wife has left him, which will result in cross-examination.Final arguments take place next, where both the parties represent their version of facts, cite any relevant judgments, and ultimately pray for relief from the Judge.Based on the counseling, statements made and the conduct of the parties, the judge accordingly grants the decree.to ensure execution, there is an attachment of the Respondent’s property to it, as per Order21 Rule 32 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The rule says that where the party against whom a decree forrestitution of conjugal rights, has been passed, and has had an opportunity of obeying the decree and has willfully failed to obey it the decree may be enforced by attachment of his property. Upon passing of such decree, the law provides for a minimum of one year beyond which other remedies lie.the Bombay High Court has held that denying intercourse to the spouse for a long period of time will amount to cruelty and will be ground for divorce. Similarly, the Supreme Court has also said that if a spouse does not allow the partner to have intercourse for a long time, without sufficient reason, it amounts to mental cruelty, upholding a verdict of the Madras High Court to grant a divorce to a man. Thus, a husband, wherein is denied conjugal rights by the wife, can file for divorce, without the remedy of restitution of rights.The procedure of the case will then proceed on the lines of a divorce proceeding. Husband can file for it under the ground of desertion, if the time lapse is satisfied, and there is a reason to believe that the spouses may reconcile.Husband may file for judicial separation/ or for divorce on the ground of cruelty.Custody of the childcustody of a child below 5 years is given to mother only, if available so in your case she may get custody. so she may file for maintenance and since child rearing is a shared responsibility, you can challenge, and counter based on her earning and financial strength.later on, you may apply for child custody.The divorce must be used as matter of last resort.Vivek Bhai PatelAdvocate, New Delhi26 AnswersTalk to Advocate Vivek Bhai Patel"

If she can establish the same before a family court, the court may decide if you had a reasonable cause or not and if it is a fit case for RCR at your instance. Try for a family counseling with responsible mediation if you really want her back.In many cases, people won't check their faults but point the spouse. Just to avoid such a mistake, check if you have to change your behavior or your parents have to change their behaviors towards her, if she complains that she's not being treated properly.

The facts that you mentioned may not be the basis to denyrestitution of conjugal rightsbut she may level false allegations of torture for dowry or mental harassment. it is recommended that you try to talk it out but if you do take the matter to court you can use the following judgement : Rudra Narayan Ray v. Piyali Ray Chatterjee.The Hon'ble Jharkhand High Court in this case stated that it is obligatory for women to serve their elderly mother-in-laws. The court further stated that the woman cannot put pressure on her husband or make any \"unreasonable demand to live separately\" in accordance with Indian culture.Thus if we keep in view just the above facts, you may file for restitution and she wouldn't be able to take the defence you mentioned above as fights are part and parcel of marriage and in the heat of the moment several things are said which are not meant.Hope I have answered to your satisfaction.Gagandeep Singh ThandiAdvocate, Pathankot68 AnswersTalk to Advocate Gagandeep Singh Thandi"

    "question": "Divorce",
    "answer": "I am sorry to hear that you are facing such issues. Doubt is very destructive in a relationship. It's important to have an open and honest conversation with your partner regarding what happened in the past, it will not contribute positively to your married life. had life been that simple enough, why would we be facing challenges at all?You think if she had loved you, none of this would have happened. You choose to see it from your point of view which is understandable. Discovering that you were having previous love/ sex history with someone else can be a traumatic experience, and it's understandable that she may be feeling hurt, angry, and betrayed which she could not have resist or open up during the initial stage of marriage. It's important to prioritize well-being and emotional health during this time.If you want to work on your relationship with your wife, it's important to communicate openly and honestly about your feelings. Let your wife know how her actions have affected you and what you need in order to move forward and set clear boundaries with your wife regarding what is and isn't acceptable behavior. If you choose to work on your relationship, make sure that your wife is willing to take responsibility for her actions and work towards rebuilding trust.Very first step is to get her to acknowledge that something is missing, and your concerns are valid. You have to learn to make her empathize with you. Explain how you feel and ask her if she thinks this is fair. If you think she will go into defence mode impulsively, tell her that you don't want an answer. That you just want her to think about it. Tell her that you want to make it work, but that this is not enough and that you expect more from her. There is a chance that none of this will work. If that's the case, you may need to get used to a loveless marriage or get a divorce. Honestly, I feel sorry for you, but you don't deserve this. It breaks my heart to see a fellow human deprived of the joys of having a spouse who loves them the same. Maybe it is because I see a lot of my younger self in you. I honestly hope the best for you. so:Consider counseling: If you and your wife want to work on your relationship, consider couples counseling. A trained therapist can help you and your wife communicate effectively and work through any underlying issues that may have contributed to the infidelity. Sit down as a couple and if it is with a marriage counsellor, it might help as you can have an independent view of things.Take time to reflect: Consider what you want for your future and whether or not she is willing to work on your relationship. It's important to make a decision that feels right for both of you keeping the interest and well-being of the child onboard.Don't blame each-other: It's important to remember that your wife's behaviour may be some situation based or due to strong interference of her parents in the marriage. Ultimately, the decision about what to do with your marriage is up to you and your wife, and it's important to make a decision that feels right for both of you.Wouldn’t you want to know if your wife wants to continue in this marriage or not?Why she keeps away from you and why she doesn’t want intimacy or dont want to leave her job? why she is not ready to come back? any triggering issues? Any emotional triggers from your past relationship/ life ?- these questions need to be answered,so that both of you as mature adults can priorities what’s important and either work together for the marriage or move on with your lives going separate.she has to recognize that all that has happened is a matter of past and if you are fully emotionally, physically, financially and in all other aspect, are honestly committed to her in the relationship, she should come to you and explain whatever problems persist and resolve mutually.Here, she may be worried about the financial independence, or she want some form of freedom in the married life and in the present patriarchal society the fabrics of responsibilities are still around the girl. so, both of you have to communicate with yourself and each-other. Try a fresh with focus on the present and try to build a more transparent and communicative relationship in the present. Take this opportunity to work together and strengthen your marriage.Try to follow these commandment answers for a lifetime of happiness and harmony:What are your personal values and beliefs?How do you envision our roles and responsibilities within the marriage?How do you envision the role of family in our relationship?What are your career aspirations, and how do you plan to achieve them?How do you handle stress or challenges in life?How do you handle conflicts or disagreements in a relationship?How do you manage finances and plan for the future?What are your hobbies and interests outside of work?How do you prioritize spending time with family and friends?What are your expectations regarding communication and openness in our relationship?What are your religious or cultural beliefs, and how do they influence your life?How do you see our relationship evolving over time, and what are your thoughts on starting a family?Are there any specific values or traditions that are important to you, and how do you envision incorporating them into our lives together?How do you prioritize personal growth and self-improvement in a relationship?How do you maintain a healthy work-life balance?How do you express love and affection in a relationship?How do you handle differences in opinions or cultural backgrounds?What are your expectations regarding household chores and responsibilities?How do you balance personal space and time with family responsibilities?What are your views on gender equality and mutual respect in marriage?How do you envision supporting each other through life's ups and downs?And if all this failed, then proceed for initiating a case forrestitution of Conjugal rightsu/s 9 of HMA. and if, despite of the court order, she submit or not willing to conjugate, file a divorce case and denial of the conjugal rights would be a very valid grounds for divorce, which might be without paying any maintenance too.The procedure for filing a case u/s 9 of HMA for conjugal rights is:file a petition in the district court. The format of such petition is available on the internet. This can be transferred by application to the High Court or Supreme Court as well.Upon such filing, a copy of the petition should be sent to the respondent- wife along with the date of hearing from the district court. The date is generally after 3 months of filing the petition.Both parties are to be present at the date of hearing. If both parties are not present, the court gives another date.The next step is that of counseling/mediation sent by the court-It is done by the family court, as provided for in the Family Courts Act. This takes approximately 4 months.Once the application back to court on grounds that mediation has failed.The suit will continue, and the respondent-wife is required to give her ‘counter’ to the husband’s application. Oral arguments will proceed to dispose of the interim petitions first and pass the interim order.Once this is done with, the proceedings forrestitution of conjugal rightsbegin. The husband has to file a Chief Examination Affidavit for producing evidence that the wife has left him, which will result in cross-examination.Final arguments take place next, where both the parties represent their version of facts, cite any relevant judgments, and ultimately pray for relief from the Judge.Based on the counseling, statements made and the conduct of the parties, the judge accordingly grants the decree.to ensure execution, there is an attachment of the Respondent’s property to it, as per Order21 Rule 32 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The rule says that where the party against whom a decree forrestitution of conjugal rights, has been passed, and has had an opportunity of obeying the decree and has willfully failed to obey it the decree may be enforced by attachment of his property. Upon passing of such decree, the law provides for a minimum of one year beyond which other remedies lie.the Bombay High Court has held that denying intercourse to the spouse for a long period of time will amount to cruelty and will be ground for divorce. Similarly, the Supreme Court has also said that if a spouse does not allow the partner to have intercourse for a long time, without sufficient reason, it amounts to mental cruelty, upholding a verdict of the Madras High Court to grant a divorce to a man. Thus, a husband, wherein is denied conjugal rights by the wife, can file for divorce, without the remedy of restitution of rights.The procedure of the case will then proceed on the lines of a divorce proceeding. Husband can file for it under the ground of desertion, if the time lapse is satisfied, and there is a reason to believe that the spouses may reconcile.Husband may file for judicial separation/ or for divorce on the ground of cruelty.Custody of the childcustody of a child below 5 years is given to mother only, if available so in your case she may get custody. so she may file for maintenance and since child rearing is a shared responsibility, you can challenge, and counter based on her earning and financial strength.later on, you may apply for child custody.The divorce must be used as matter of last resort.Vivek Bhai PatelAdvocate, New Delhi26 AnswersTalk to Advocate Vivek Bhai Patel"

    "question": "Divorce",
    "answer": "I am sorry to hear that you are facing such issues. Doubt is very destructive in a relationship. It's important to have an open and honest conversation with your partner regarding what happened in the past, it will not contribute positively to your married life. had life been that simple enough, why would we be facing challenges at all?You think if she had loved you, none of this would have happened. You choose to see it from your point of view which is understandable. Discovering that you were having previous love/ sex history with someone else can be a traumatic experience, and it's understandable that she may be feeling hurt, angry, and betrayed which she could not have resist or open up during the initial stage of marriage. It's important to prioritize well-being and emotional health during this time.If you want to work on your relationship with your wife, it's important to communicate openly and honestly about your feelings. Let your wife know how her actions have affected you and what you need in order to move forward and set clear boundaries with your wife regarding what is and isn't acceptable behavior. If you choose to work on your relationship, make sure that your wife is willing to take responsibility for her actions and work towards rebuilding trust.Very first step is to get her to acknowledge that something is missing, and your concerns are valid. You have to learn to make her empathize with you. Explain how you feel and ask her if she thinks this is fair. If you think she will go into defence mode impulsively, tell her that you don't want an answer. That you just want her to think about it. Tell her that you want to make it work, but that this is not enough and that you expect more from her. There is a chance that none of this will work. If that's the case, you may need to get used to a loveless marriage or get a divorce. Honestly, I feel sorry for you, but you don't deserve this. It breaks my heart to see a fellow human deprived of the joys of having a spouse who loves them the same. Maybe it is because I see a lot of my younger self in you. I honestly hope the best for you. so:Consider counseling: If you and your wife want to work on your relationship, consider couples counseling. A trained therapist can help you and your wife communicate effectively and work through any underlying issues that may have contributed to the infidelity. Sit down as a couple and if it is with a marriage counsellor, it might help as you can have an independent view of things.Take time to reflect: Consider what you want for your future and whether or not she is willing to work on your relationship. It's important to make a decision that feels right for both of you keeping the interest and well-being of the child onboard.Don't blame each-other: It's important to remember that your wife's behaviour may be some situation based or due to strong interference of her parents in the marriage. Ultimately, the decision about what to do with your marriage is up to you and your wife, and it's important to make a decision that feels right for both of you.Wouldn’t you want to know if your wife wants to continue in this marriage or not?Why she keeps away from you and why she doesn’t want intimacy or dont want to leave her job? why she is not ready to come back? any triggering issues? Any emotional triggers from your past relationship/ life ?- these questions need to be answered,so that both of you as mature adults can priorities what’s important and either work together for the marriage or move on with your lives going separate.she has to recognize that all that has happened is a matter of past and if you are fully emotionally, physically, financially and in all other aspect, are honestly committed to her in the relationship, she should come to you and explain whatever problems persist and resolve mutually.Here, she may be worried about the financial independence, or she want some form of freedom in the married life and in the present patriarchal society the fabrics of responsibilities are still around the girl. so, both of you have to communicate with yourself and each-other. Try a fresh with focus on the present and try to build a more transparent and communicative relationship in the present. Take this opportunity to work together and strengthen your marriage.Try to follow these commandment answers for a lifetime of happiness and harmony:What are your personal values and beliefs?How do you envision our roles and responsibilities within the marriage?How do you envision the role of family in our relationship?What are your career aspirations, and how do you plan to achieve them?How do you handle stress or challenges in life?How do you handle conflicts or disagreements in a relationship?How do you manage finances and plan for the future?What are your hobbies and interests outside of work?How do you prioritize spending time with family and friends?What are your expectations regarding communication and openness in our relationship?What are your religious or cultural beliefs, and how do they influence your life?How do you see our relationship evolving over time, and what are your thoughts on starting a family?Are there any specific values or traditions that are important to you, and how do you envision incorporating them into our lives together?How do you prioritize personal growth and self-improvement in a relationship?How do you maintain a healthy work-life balance?How do you express love and affection in a relationship?How do you handle differences in opinions or cultural backgrounds?What are your expectations regarding household chores and responsibilities?How do you balance personal space and time with family responsibilities?What are your views on gender equality and mutual respect in marriage?How do you envision supporting each other through life's ups and downs?And if all this failed, then proceed for initiating a case forrestitution of Conjugal rightsu/s 9 of HMA. and if, despite of the court order, she submit or not willing to conjugate, file a divorce case and denial of the conjugal rights would be a very valid grounds for divorce, which might be without paying any maintenance too.The procedure for filing a case u/s 9 of HMA for conjugal rights is:file a petition in the district court. The format of such petition is available on the internet. This can be transferred by application to the High Court or Supreme Court as well.Upon such filing, a copy of the petition should be sent to the respondent- wife along with the date of hearing from the district court. The date is generally after 3 months of filing the petition.Both parties are to be present at the date of hearing. If both parties are not present, the court gives another date.The next step is that of counseling/mediation sent by the court-It is done by the family court, as provided for in the Family Courts Act. This takes approximately 4 months.Once the application back to court on grounds that mediation has failed.The suit will continue, and the respondent-wife is required to give her ‘counter’ to the husband’s application. Oral arguments will proceed to dispose of the interim petitions first and pass the interim order.Once this is done with, the proceedings forrestitution of conjugal rightsbegin. The husband has to file a Chief Examination Affidavit for producing evidence that the wife has left him, which will result in cross-examination.Final arguments take place next, where both the parties represent their version of facts, cite any relevant judgments, and ultimately pray for relief from the Judge.Based on the counseling, statements made and the conduct of the parties, the judge accordingly grants the decree.to ensure execution, there is an attachment of the Respondent’s property to it, as per Order21 Rule 32 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The rule says that where the party against whom a decree forrestitution of conjugal rights, has been passed, and has had an opportunity of obeying the decree and has willfully failed to obey it the decree may be enforced by attachment of his property. Upon passing of such decree, the law provides for a minimum of one year beyond which other remedies lie.the Bombay High Court has held that denying intercourse to the spouse for a long period of time will amount to cruelty and will be ground for divorce. Similarly, the Supreme Court has also said that if a spouse does not allow the partner to have intercourse for a long time, without sufficient reason, it amounts to mental cruelty, upholding a verdict of the Madras High Court to grant a divorce to a man. Thus, a husband, wherein is denied conjugal rights by the wife, can file for divorce, without the remedy of restitution of rights.The procedure of the case will then proceed on the lines of a divorce proceeding. Husband can file for it under the ground of desertion, if the time lapse is satisfied, and there is a reason to believe that the spouses may reconcile.Husband may file for judicial separation/ or for divorce on the ground of cruelty.Custody of the childcustody of a child below 5 years is given to mother only, if available so in your case she may get custody. so she may file for maintenance and since child rearing is a shared responsibility, you can challenge, and counter based on her earning and financial strength.later on, you may apply for child custody.The divorce must be used as matter of last resort.Vivek Bhai PatelAdvocate, New Delhi26 AnswersTalk to Advocate Vivek Bhai Patel"

    "question": "Bail cancellation and filing of application on the day of order",
    "answer": "\"The bail already granted may be cancelledif it is found that the person who has been granted the benefit of bail has violated any of the conditions or misused the liberty by influencing the witnesses or tampering with the evidence.It is no doubt correct that cancellation of bail is not limited to the occurrence of supervening circumstances for a court to cancel the bail. In Ash Mohammed Vs. Shiv Raj Singh @ Lalla Babu and another [2012 (4) Crimes 144(SC)], the Supreme Court has stated that there is no defined universal rule that applies in every single case. Hence, in no way one can say for sure that once bail is granted to the accused, it can only be cancelled on grounds of likelihood of abuse of the bail. In light of such observation, a court is empowered to critically analyze the soundness of the bail order. Moreover, it should check its reasoning to avoid delivery of any capricious order while cancelling the bail of an accused, since the liberty of an individual being at stake makes the court all the more accountable for its decision.In Prakash Kadam and others Vs. Ram Prasad Vishwanath Gupta and another (2011 (6) SCC 189), the Supreme Court has observed, that while considering a matter dealing with cancellation of bail, the Court must consider the gravity and nature of the offence (although not the sole basis to refuse prayer for bail, see SC judgement in Prabhakar Tewari Vs. State of UP), the prima-facie case against the accused, the position and status of the accused. If the allegations leveled against the accused are very serious in nature then his bail may be cancelled even if there has been no misuse of the bail granted to him.However the court at its discretionary powers the court may allow the accused to file additional documents in his support to object the cancellation supplication"

But in cases where you can establish that you can take care of your child better than your wife and your wife is unfit due to certain reason like she is alcoholic etc, than it is duly considered by the Court and there appears higher chances of you getting the custody as the court while deciding the issue related to custody satisfies himself as to under whose custody the welfare of the child lies and decides accordingly.To seek custody, if you are hindu, you can move an petition under section 26 ofHindu Marriage Act, or Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, and in case to inter-religious marriage one can seek custody under section 38 ofSpecial Marriage Actbefore your juridical family court.2.

    "question": "Partition suit",
    "answer": "- As per Section 42 of the SC, ST Act, there is restrictions on sale, gift and bequest of the interest of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe, in the whole or part of their holding.- Further, a scheduled caste/tribe land holder can only sell his land to schedule caste/tribe person. if anyone buy a land from them by hiding facts, then he can be behind the bar , and further government will return back the land to original land owner at anytime if he approaches authority.- However, if there was no such restriction , then the said woman was having her right to sell her self property to you and none of her family member having right over the same.- Hence, her suit of partition is not maintainable on any ground , and article 65 is not applicable in this case because your possession in the property is by transfer of title.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Partition suit",
    "answer": "Article - 65 of the limitation act:The law of Adverse Possession is contained in the Article 65 Sch-I of the Limitation Act, 1963 whichprescribes a limitation of 12 years for a suit for possession of an immovable property or any interest therein based on title.You will not fall in the above category because this property was purchased by a registered document and you were put into possession and enjoyment by the vendor properly.Therefore there is no necessity to invoke the article 65 unnecessarily into this subject.If the plaintiff has filed a suit for partition then she should have directly filed against her mother and not against the purchaser.She can be presumed to be aggrieved only against her mother and not against the purchaser, though she can implead the purchaser as necessary party as defendant third or fourthBesides the suit is not at all maintainable because it was her mother's self acquired property and not allotted to her mother under any scheme of the government, neither there is any restriction to sell by the authority concerned.Therefore instead of worrying about it, yo can challenge the case properly in the court of lawT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"
