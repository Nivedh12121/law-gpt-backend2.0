    "question": "Compromise decree expiry",
    "answer": "Dear ClientCompromise Decree: The compromise decree issued by the Bangalore magistrate court in 2001 is a legally binding document. It specified that D agreed to accept 4 lakhs in cash instead of the 8 lakhs initially sought. The court also ordered the land to be registered within 15 days.Non-Registration of Land: Since the land was not registered as per the court order within 15 days, there may be issues related to the compliance with the court's decree.Subdivision and Sale: The subdivision of the land into multiple plots and the subsequent sale of those plots to various individuals, including Party E, could potentially raise legal issues. The sale deeds mentioning the case number from the lawsuit may indicate that there is a legal dispute associated with the land.Property Taxes: Party E has been paying property taxes since 2001. This may establish their possession or claim to the property, but it does not necessarily resolve the legal complexities arising from the compromise decree and the subsequent sale of the land.Party F's Purchase: If Party F is interested in buying the land from Party E, they should conduct thorough due diligence, including a title search and verification of all legal documents associated with the property. This will help identify any potential legal issues or encumbrances on the land.Potential Issues: There are several potential issues that could arise in the future, including challenges related to the validity of the compromise decree, the court's order for land registration, and the subdivision and sale of the land without proper registration. Party F should be aware of these potential issues and seek legal advice to assess the risks involved.It's crucial for Party F to consult with a qualified property lawyer in India who can review all relevant documents, assess the legal status of the land, and provide guidance on whether it is advisable to proceed with the purchase. Resolving these legal complexities may require further legal action or negotiations with the parties involved in the original lawsuit.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Should I go for RCR or Divorce?",
    "answer": "Dear ClientRestitution of Conjugal Rights(RCR): RCR is a legal remedy available underHindu Marriage Act, 1955. It's a legal provision that allows either spouse to request the other to return and cohabit. If the court grants an RCR decree and the other spouse refuses to comply, it can be used as evidence in a future divorce case. However, it's important to understand that an RCR decree doesn't force reconciliation, and it may not necessarily lead to a divorce.Grounds for Divorce: In Hindu law, there are several grounds for divorce, including cruelty, desertion, adultery, and mutual consent. You mentioned that the reasons you've cited are minor, but it's possible to file for divorce on grounds of cruelty if the behavior of your spouse is causing you mental or physical suffering. You should consult with a different lawyer for a second opinion on the grounds for divorce based on your specific circumstances.498A andDomestic Violence(DV): While your lawyer mentioned the threat of 498A (cruelty by husband or relatives) and DV cases, these should not deter you from seeking a legitimate divorce if your marriage is irretrievably broken. False allegations can be challenged in court, and it's crucial to gather evidence to support your case.Mediation: Consider exploring mediation as an option before proceeding with divorce. Mediation can sometimes help couples reach an amicable settlement and avoid prolonged legal battles.Documentation and Evidence: It's essential to document instances of cruelty, if any, and gather evidence to support your case. This can include text messages, emails, or witnesses who can testify to the issues in your marriage.Consult Another Attorney: Given the complexities of your situation, it may be advisable to consult a different attorney for a second opinion. Different lawyers may have different perspectives on your case and may suggest alternative legal strategies.Maintenance and Property: If you proceed with divorce, ensure you are aware of your rights and responsibilities regarding alimony (maintenance) and the division of property and assets.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Should I go for RCR or Divorce?",
    "answer": "RCR (restitution of conjugal rights) and divorce are two legal options available to spouses who are facing marital issues. RCR is a legal remedy that seeks to reunite spouses and provide them with an opportunity to work on their differences and rebuild their relationship, while divorce terminates the marriage. An RCR petition is typically filed when one spouse seeks the court’s intervention to enforce the other spouse’s return to the marital home and the resumption of marital relations. If the execution petition is unsuccessful or if the court determines that the conjugal rights cannot be restored, it may be possible to proceed with a divorce petition.If you are facing false cases ofdomestic violence(DV), maintenance,CrPC 125, or 498A from your wife, you should take some preventive measures to protect yourself and your family from legal harassment and extortion. Some of these measures are:Fight the interim maintenance case whether underCrPC 125or DV Act, as if your life depends on it. This is the most important case that can affect your finances and future prospects.Do not file RCR as it may weaken your case for divorce on the grounds of cruelty or irretrievable breakdown of marriage. It may also prolong your litigation and expose you to more false allegations.File for divorce on the grounds of cruelty or irretrievable breakdown of marriage as soon as possible. This will show your intention to end the marriage and avoid further disputes.Collect all evidence and documents that can prove your innocence and refute your wife’s claims. This may include phone records, bank statements, medical reports, photographs, videos, etc.Get an anticipatory bail if you think your wife may file an FIR underSection 498Aor other criminal charges against you or your family members. This will prevent your arrest and harassment by the police.I hope this information helps you to understand some aspects of RCR and divorce and how they may affect your situation.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "RCR is wastage of time and money as neither law not court can force your wife to live with you against her wishes abd desire. So even if you take decree even then you cannot enforce decree so it is better to file divorce case and if wife would agree then also she can join you. Filing of RCR does not restrict nor prohibit your wife from filing DV case and 498A case. However, by adopting few measures its effect can be minimise.

    "answer": "Dear ClientSetting up a company involves several legal and administrative steps. Here are some legal remedies and considerations for starting your e-commerce business with multiple brands under it:Required Paperwork and Costs:a. NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement): If you plan to share proprietary information with third-party manufacturers, it's advisable to have them sign an NDA to protect your intellectual property. Legal costs for drafting an NDA can vary but are typically reasonable.b. GST Registration: If your annual turnover is expected to exceed the prescribed threshold (which varies by country), you may need to register for Goods and Services Tax (GST) or its equivalent. The cost for GST registration can vary depending on your location.c. CIN (Company Identification Number): If you choose to register your company as a Private Limited Company or Limited Company, you'll receive a Corporate Identification Number (CIN). The cost of incorporating such companies can vary but is usually higher compared to other business structures.d. Trademark Registration: To protect your brand names and logos, it's advisable to register trademarks. The costs for trademark registration vary based on the number of classes you register under and the region/country in which you seek protection.Choice of Business Structure:You mentioned considering Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) or One Person Company (OPC). The choice of business structure should be based on various factors, including your long-term business goals, tax implications, and liability. Here are some points to consider:LLP: Provides limited liability for partners and is relatively easier to set up compared to a Private Limited Company. Tax implications can be favorable, as LLPs are often taxed similarly to partnerships. Annual compliance costs are generally lower compared to companies.OPC: Suitable if you want to operate as a single owner. OPCs also offer limited liability. Tax implications depend on your income and may be similar to those of sole proprietorships or individual taxation.Consult with a chartered accountant (CA) or tax consultant to assess the tax implications based on your specific circumstances.Annual Maintenance Expense:The annual maintenance expenses for a company can vary depending on its structure, size, and compliance requirements. Generally, an LLP has lower annual compliance costs compared to a Private Limited Company. Expect to incur expenses related to accounting, annual filings, audits, and other statutory compliance requirements. Consulting a CA can help estimate these costs more accurately.Choosing a Professional:Chartered Accountant (CA): CAs specialize in taxation, financial planning, and compliance. They can assist with GST registration, tax planning, and financial matters.Corporate Lawyer: Corporate lawyers specialize in legal aspects of business, including drafting contracts, agreements, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations. They can help with drafting NDAs, shareholder agreements, and other legal documents.Attorney: An attorney can provide legal advice and draft legal documents, but their expertise may vary depending on their specialization.It's often advisable to consult both a CA and a corporate lawyer to cover both financial and legal aspects of your business. They can provide comprehensive guidance on the setup and ongoing compliance requirements of your company.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear ClientEndorsement \"File\":The endorsement \"filed\" typically means that the court has accepted and received the Interlocutory Application (IA) filed by the opposite party. It indicates that the IA has been formally submitted to the court and is part of the court record.No Order for Org. Plaintiff to File a \"Say\":In some cases, when an IA is filed, the court may not immediately issue orders for the opposite party or the Org. Plaintiff (original plaintiff) to file their responses (commonly referred to as \"say\" or \"counter-affidavit\").The Org. Plaintiff may not be required to take any immediate steps unless the court specifically orders them to do so. However, it's crucial to monitor the progress of the case and follow any further directions or orders issued by the court.Filing a \"Say\" on IA:It is generally a good practice for the Org. Plaintiff to file a response (say) to the IA filed by the opposite party, even if the court has not explicitly ordered it. Filing a response allows the Org. Plaintiff to present their side of the case and arguments related to the IA.It is not always necessary for the court to call for a hearing before accepting or rejecting the IA. The court may decide the IA based on the written submissions of both parties unless it finds it necessary to conduct a hearing.Endorsing \"Filed\":Endorsing \"filed\" typically means that the IA has been officially received and recorded by the court. It does not necessarily render the IA invalid. The court will review the IA, along with any responses filed by the parties, before making a decision on the relief sought in the IA.It's important to note that legal procedures and practices can vary from one case to another and from one court to another. Therefore, it's crucial to consult with a qualified attorney who can provide specific guidance based on the details of your case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Should I go for RCR or Divorce?",
    "answer": "Dear ClientRestitution of Conjugal Rights(RCR): RCR is a legal remedy available underHindu Marriage Act, 1955. It's a legal provision that allows either spouse to request the other to return and cohabit. If the court grants an RCR decree and the other spouse refuses to comply, it can be used as evidence in a future divorce case. However, it's important to understand that an RCR decree doesn't force reconciliation, and it may not necessarily lead to a divorce.Grounds for Divorce: In Hindu law, there are several grounds for divorce, including cruelty, desertion, adultery, and mutual consent. You mentioned that the reasons you've cited are minor, but it's possible to file for divorce on grounds of cruelty if the behavior of your spouse is causing you mental or physical suffering. You should consult with a different lawyer for a second opinion on the grounds for divorce based on your specific circumstances.498A andDomestic Violence(DV): While your lawyer mentioned the threat of 498A (cruelty by husband or relatives) and DV cases, these should not deter you from seeking a legitimate divorce if your marriage is irretrievably broken. False allegations can be challenged in court, and it's crucial to gather evidence to support your case.Mediation: Consider exploring mediation as an option before proceeding with divorce. Mediation can sometimes help couples reach an amicable settlement and avoid prolonged legal battles.Documentation and Evidence: It's essential to document instances of cruelty, if any, and gather evidence to support your case. This can include text messages, emails, or witnesses who can testify to the issues in your marriage.Consult Another Attorney: Given the complexities of your situation, it may be advisable to consult a different attorney for a second opinion. Different lawyers may have different perspectives on your case and may suggest alternative legal strategies.Maintenance and Property: If you proceed with divorce, ensure you are aware of your rights and responsibilities regarding alimony (maintenance) and the division of property and assets.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Should I go for RCR or Divorce?",
    "answer": "RCR (restitution of conjugal rights) and divorce are two legal options available to spouses who are facing marital issues. RCR is a legal remedy that seeks to reunite spouses and provide them with an opportunity to work on their differences and rebuild their relationship, while divorce terminates the marriage. An RCR petition is typically filed when one spouse seeks the court’s intervention to enforce the other spouse’s return to the marital home and the resumption of marital relations. If the execution petition is unsuccessful or if the court determines that the conjugal rights cannot be restored, it may be possible to proceed with a divorce petition.If you are facing false cases ofdomestic violence(DV), maintenance,CrPC 125, or 498A from your wife, you should take some preventive measures to protect yourself and your family from legal harassment and extortion. Some of these measures are:Fight the interim maintenance case whether underCrPC 125or DV Act, as if your life depends on it. This is the most important case that can affect your finances and future prospects.Do not file RCR as it may weaken your case for divorce on the grounds of cruelty or irretrievable breakdown of marriage. It may also prolong your litigation and expose you to more false allegations.File for divorce on the grounds of cruelty or irretrievable breakdown of marriage as soon as possible. This will show your intention to end the marriage and avoid further disputes.Collect all evidence and documents that can prove your innocence and refute your wife’s claims. This may include phone records, bank statements, medical reports, photographs, videos, etc.Get an anticipatory bail if you think your wife may file an FIR underSection 498Aor other criminal charges against you or your family members. This will prevent your arrest and harassment by the police.I hope this information helps you to understand some aspects of RCR and divorce and how they may affect your situation.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

So even if you take decree even then you cannot enforce decree so it is better to file divorce case and if wife would agree then also she can join you.

    "answer": "- As per Bombay High Court, mere possession of a gun or cartridges is not a crime.- Since, it is a bailable offence , hence the person was not taken into custody after taking his documents including passport.- Further, under Section 438 of CrPC, a person having committed an offence anticipates his arrest wherein he can approach the High Court or the Sessions Court for anticipatory bail. It is at the discretion of the Court whether to grant bail or reject the same- Since, there is not apprehension of arrest , and due to that reason the ABP rejected.- You can move an application before the court of magistrate to get the passport released.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Anticipatory bail",
    "answer": "Dear ClientIt seems like you are dealing with a legal situation in India related to the Arms Act, anticipatory bail, and the seizure of a foreign passport.Anticipatory Bail: If your first application for anticipatory bail (ABP) was rejected on the grounds of non-maintainability, it's essential to understand why it was deemed non-maintainable. In India, anticipatory bail can be granted if the court is convinced that there is a reasonable apprehension of arrest. To file a second anticipatory bail application after the rejection of the first one, you would typically need to show changed circumstances or new evidence that was not considered in the first application. Discuss this with your attorney to determine if you have a valid basis for a new application.Seizure of Passport: If your foreign passport has been seized by Indian authorities, you may be able to file a petition for the release of your passport separately from your criminal case. However, this will depend on the reasons for the seizure, any ongoing investigations, and the specific circumstances of your case. Consult with your attorney to explore the possibility of seeking the release of your passport.Consult an Attorney: Given the complexity of your situation, it is crucial to consult with a qualified criminal defense attorney in India who specializes in arms-related cases and anticipatory bail matters. They can provide you with the most accurate legal advice and help you navigate the legal processes effectively.Comply with Legal Procedures: While pursuing legal remedies, it's important to comply with all legal procedures, court orders, and cooperate with the authorities as required. Failure to do so could negatively impact your case.Keep Records: Maintain detailed records of all interactions with law enforcement, court documents, and communications related to your case. These records may be useful in building your defense.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear ClientCompromise Decree: The compromise decree issued by the Bangalore magistrate court in 2001 is a legally binding document. It specified that D agreed to accept 4 lakhs in cash instead of the 8 lakhs initially sought. The court also ordered the land to be registered within 15 days.Non-Registration of Land: Since the land was not registered as per the court order within 15 days, there may be issues related to the compliance with the court's decree.Subdivision and Sale: The subdivision of the land into multiple plots and the subsequent sale of those plots to various individuals, including Party E, could potentially raise legal issues. The sale deeds mentioning the case number from the lawsuit may indicate that there is a legal dispute associated with the land.Property Taxes: Party E has been paying property taxes since 2001. This may establish their possession or claim to the property, but it does not necessarily resolve the legal complexities arising from the compromise decree and the subsequent sale of the land.Party F's Purchase: If Party F is interested in buying the land from Party E, they should conduct thorough due diligence, including a title search and verification of all legal documents associated with the property. This will help identify any potential legal issues or encumbrances on the land.Potential Issues: There are several potential issues that could arise in the future, including challenges related to the validity of the compromise decree, the court's order for land registration, and the subdivision and sale of the land without proper registration. Party F should be aware of these potential issues and seek legal advice to assess the risks involved.It's crucial for Party F to consult with a qualified property lawyer in India who can review all relevant documents, assess the legal status of the land, and provide guidance on whether it is advisable to proceed with the purchase. Resolving these legal complexities may require further legal action or negotiations with the parties involved in the original lawsuit.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear ClientEndorsement \"File\":The endorsement \"filed\" typically means that the court has accepted and received the Interlocutory Application (IA) filed by the opposite party. It indicates that the IA has been formally submitted to the court and is part of the court record.No Order for Org. Plaintiff to File a \"Say\":In some cases, when an IA is filed, the court may not immediately issue orders for the opposite party or the Org. Plaintiff (original plaintiff) to file their responses (commonly referred to as \"say\" or \"counter-affidavit\").The Org. Plaintiff may not be required to take any immediate steps unless the court specifically orders them to do so. However, it's crucial to monitor the progress of the case and follow any further directions or orders issued by the court.Filing a \"Say\" on IA:It is generally a good practice for the Org. Plaintiff to file a response (say) to the IA filed by the opposite party, even if the court has not explicitly ordered it. Filing a response allows the Org. Plaintiff to present their side of the case and arguments related to the IA.It is not always necessary for the court to call for a hearing before accepting or rejecting the IA. The court may decide the IA based on the written submissions of both parties unless it finds it necessary to conduct a hearing.Endorsing \"Filed\":Endorsing \"filed\" typically means that the IA has been officially received and recorded by the court. It does not necessarily render the IA invalid. The court will review the IA, along with any responses filed by the parties, before making a decision on the relief sought in the IA.It's important to note that legal procedures and practices can vary from one case to another and from one court to another.

    "answer": "Dear ClientRestitution of Conjugal Rights(RCR): RCR is a legal remedy available underHindu Marriage Act, 1955. It's a legal provision that allows either spouse to request the other to return and cohabit. If the court grants an RCR decree and the other spouse refuses to comply, it can be used as evidence in a future divorce case. However, it's important to understand that an RCR decree doesn't force reconciliation, and it may not necessarily lead to a divorce.Grounds for Divorce: In Hindu law, there are several grounds for divorce, including cruelty, desertion, adultery, and mutual consent. You mentioned that the reasons you've cited are minor, but it's possible to file for divorce on grounds of cruelty if the behavior of your spouse is causing you mental or physical suffering. You should consult with a different lawyer for a second opinion on the grounds for divorce based on your specific circumstances.498A andDomestic Violence(DV): While your lawyer mentioned the threat of 498A (cruelty by husband or relatives) and DV cases, these should not deter you from seeking a legitimate divorce if your marriage is irretrievably broken. False allegations can be challenged in court, and it's crucial to gather evidence to support your case.Mediation: Consider exploring mediation as an option before proceeding with divorce. Mediation can sometimes help couples reach an amicable settlement and avoid prolonged legal battles.Documentation and Evidence: It's essential to document instances of cruelty, if any, and gather evidence to support your case. This can include text messages, emails, or witnesses who can testify to the issues in your marriage.Consult Another Attorney: Given the complexities of your situation, it may be advisable to consult a different attorney for a second opinion. Different lawyers may have different perspectives on your case and may suggest alternative legal strategies.Maintenance and Property: If you proceed with divorce, ensure you are aware of your rights and responsibilities regarding alimony (maintenance) and the division of property and assets.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Should I go for RCR or Divorce?",
    "answer": "RCR (restitution of conjugal rights) and divorce are two legal options available to spouses who are facing marital issues. RCR is a legal remedy that seeks to reunite spouses and provide them with an opportunity to work on their differences and rebuild their relationship, while divorce terminates the marriage. An RCR petition is typically filed when one spouse seeks the court’s intervention to enforce the other spouse’s return to the marital home and the resumption of marital relations. If the execution petition is unsuccessful or if the court determines that the conjugal rights cannot be restored, it may be possible to proceed with a divorce petition.If you are facing false cases ofdomestic violence(DV), maintenance,CrPC 125, or 498A from your wife, you should take some preventive measures to protect yourself and your family from legal harassment and extortion. Some of these measures are:Fight the interim maintenance case whether underCrPC 125or DV Act, as if your life depends on it. This is the most important case that can affect your finances and future prospects.Do not file RCR as it may weaken your case for divorce on the grounds of cruelty or irretrievable breakdown of marriage. It may also prolong your litigation and expose you to more false allegations.File for divorce on the grounds of cruelty or irretrievable breakdown of marriage as soon as possible. This will show your intention to end the marriage and avoid further disputes.Collect all evidence and documents that can prove your innocence and refute your wife’s claims. This may include phone records, bank statements, medical reports, photographs, videos, etc.Get an anticipatory bail if you think your wife may file an FIR underSection 498Aor other criminal charges against you or your family members. This will prevent your arrest and harassment by the police.I hope this information helps you to understand some aspects of RCR and divorce and how they may affect your situation.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

In India, anticipatory bail can be granted if the court is convinced that there is a reasonable apprehension of arrest. To file a second anticipatory bail application after the rejection of the first one, you would typically need to show changed circumstances or new evidence that was not considered in the first application. Discuss this with your attorney to determine if you have a valid basis for a new application.Seizure of Passport: If your foreign passport has been seized by Indian authorities, you may be able to file a petition for the release of your passport separately from your criminal case. However, this will depend on the reasons for the seizure, any ongoing investigations, and the specific circumstances of your case. Consult with your attorney to explore the possibility of seeking the release of your passport.Consult an Attorney: Given the complexity of your situation, it is crucial to consult with a qualified criminal defense attorney in India who specializes in arms-related cases and anticipatory bail matters. They can provide you with the most accurate legal advice and help you navigate the legal processes effectively.Comply with Legal Procedures: While pursuing legal remedies, it's important to comply with all legal procedures, court orders, and cooperate with the authorities as required.

Your attorney can assist you in drafting an appropriate application.Prepare a Request Petition: Your attorney can help you draft a request petition to the court explaining your situation and requesting that the court specify the number of years for the passport in accordance with the notification. The petition should state the relevant section of the notification and any legal arguments supporting your request.Identify the Respondents: The respondents in your petition may include the passport authorities, the police department, and any other relevant authorities involved in the passport renewal process. Your attorney will advise you on the specific parties to name.Court Representation: Your attorney will represent you in court and present your case, providing arguments as to why your passport should be issued for the desired number of years without an NOC.

    "question": "Regarding the NOC",
    "answer": "Amere pendency of a criminal case or a proceeding cannot be considered the only reason to deny the request to obtain or renew a passport/visa application.The Andhra Pradesh High Court has held that where the applicant, who had applied for renewal of passport, was facing a criminal trial in a Criminal Court in India, the applicant will have to produce an order from the Court concerned permitting him to depart from India. The Bench of Justice Ravi Nath Tilhari held that \"\"Issue‟ of passport in Section 5 of the Passports Act includes “renewal‟ of the passport as well; While considering the renewal of the passport, the passport authority would be within its jurisdiction and authority to refuse renewal, on the same grounds as in the cases of issuance of the passport for \"the first time‟, provided by Section 6 (2) of the Passport Act.\"The following  conditions of thenotification No. GSR 570(E) states as under:(b) any passport issued in terms of (a) (ii) and (a) (iii) above can be furtherrenewed for one year at a time, provided the applicant has not travelledabroad for the period sanctioned by the court; and provided further that,in the meantime, the order of the court is not cancelled or modified;(c) any passport issued in terms of (a) (i) above can be further renewed onlyon the basis of a fresh court order specifying a further period of validityof the passport or specifying a period for travel abroad;(d) the said citizen shall give an undertaking in writing to the passportissuing authority that he shall, if required by the court concerned, appearbefore it at any time during the continuance in force of the passport soissued.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

Similarly, the passport authoritiesseeking such information as in the Form EA(P)-2 is not without any purposeand it is not any empty rhetoric. If any criminal cases are pending against theapplicant who seeks renewal or he attains disqualification in terms of Section 10(3), the authorities can reconsider to renew the passport and such right ordiscretion is implicit in Rule-5.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "According to the notification No. GSR 570(E) released (25.08.1993) from the Ministry of External Affairs, PSP Division, you are right that FIR and cases under investigation do not require NOC from court for passport issuance. However, if the court has issued any order restricting your travel abroad or requiring you to surrender your passport, then you will need to obtain NOC from the court before applying for passport renewal.To draft a petition for NOC from court, you will need to follow the format of petitions as prescribed by the court rules and procedures. You will also need to attach the relevant documents to support your petition, such as copies of FIR, charge sheet, court order, passport application, etc.The petition should be filed under the appropriate section of law depending on the nature of your case and the relief sought. For example, if you want to challenge the validity of the FIR or the charge sheet, you can file a petition under Section 482 of CrPC for quashing of FIR or charge sheet. If you want to seek permission from the court to travel abroad for a specific purpose and duration, you can file a petition under Section 438 of CrPC for anticipatory bail with conditions.The respondents in your petition will be the state government and the police authorities who are investigating your case. You will need to serve them a copy of your petition and notify them about the date and time of hearing. You will also need to appear before the court and argue your case or engage a lawyer to represent you.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Registry through POA",
    "answer": "Dear ClientThe validity of a property registry arrangement where the seller appoints a relative via a registered Power of Attorney (POA) can vary depending on the laws and regulations of the specific jurisdiction where the property is located. Here are some general considerations:Validity of the POA: First and foremost, the POA itself must be valid and legally recognized in the jurisdiction where the property is located. This typically involves ensuring that the POA is properly executed, notarized, and complies with local laws.Specific Powers Granted: The POA document should clearly state the specific powers granted to the relative. It's essential that the POA explicitly authorizes the relative to execute the property sale or registry on behalf of the seller.Local Laws and Regulations: Different jurisdictions may have specific rules and regulations regarding the use of POAs in property transactions. Some jurisdictions may require additional documentation or may limit the use of POAs in property transactions.Verification of the Relative's Identity: The authorities overseeing the property registry may require verification of the relative's identity and relationship to the seller to ensure that the POA is not being misused.Title Search and Due Diligence: It's crucial to conduct a thorough title search and due diligence on the property to ensure that there are no existing disputes or encumbrances that could affect the validity of the sale.Legal Advice: It's highly advisable to consult with a local attorney who specializes in real estate law in the jurisdiction where the property is located. They can provide guidance on the specific legal requirements and potential challenges related to the use of a POA in property transactions.Consular Attestation: If the seller is a non-resident of the country where the property is located, consular attestation of the POA may be required in some cases. This involves having the POA authenticated by the consulate or embassy of the seller's home country.Recording the Deed: After the property registry is completed, it's important to ensure that the deed is properly recorded with the relevant local authorities to establish clear ownership.In summary, the validity of a property registry arrangement using a POA appointed to a relative can depend on a variety of factors, including local laws, the specific language and powers granted in the POA, and any additional requirements in the jurisdiction. It's crucial to seek legal advice and follow the proper procedures to ensure the transaction is valid and legally recognized.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "In India, a Power of Attorney is a legal document that allows one person (the principal) to give another person (the attorney-in-fact or agent) the authority to act on their behalf in various legal and financial matters. The PoA can be specific or general, and it can be used for a variety of purposes, including property transactions.Dear ClientIn your case, if you and your wife want to appoint your father as your attorney-in-fact to represent both of you in the sale of your flat in Bengaluru, you can do so. However, you will typically need to execute separate PoAs, one for you and one for your wife, as you both are co-owners of the property. Each PoA should name your father as the agent and specify the powers you are granting to him.Here are the general steps to create and use a PoA for property transactions in India:Draft the PoA: The PoA document should clearly outline the powers you are granting to your father, including the authority to sell the property and handle all related transactions.Get it notarized: The PoA should be executed on a non-judicial stamp paper of the appropriate value and should be signed by you and your wife in the presence of a notary public or magistrate. You may also need to sign it at the Indian consulate in Canada to make it legally valid in India.Register the PoA: If the PoA is for selling immovable property, it is advisable to register it at the local sub-registrar's office where the property is located. This will provide additional legal validity and prevent misuse.Use the PoA: Your father can use the PoA to complete the sale of the property on your behalf. He will need to provide the PoA document to the buyer, and the buyer's lawyer will likely want to verify its authenticity.Revocation of PoA: If needed, you can revoke the PoA at any time by following the legal process, which may involve notifying your father and registering the revocation with the relevant authorities.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear ClientCompromise Decree: The compromise decree issued by the Bangalore magistrate court in 2001 is a legally binding document. It specified that D agreed to accept 4 lakhs in cash instead of the 8 lakhs initially sought. The court also ordered the land to be registered within 15 days.Non-Registration of Land: Since the land was not registered as per the court order within 15 days, there may be issues related to the compliance with the court's decree.Subdivision and Sale: The subdivision of the land into multiple plots and the subsequent sale of those plots to various individuals, including Party E, could potentially raise legal issues. The sale deeds mentioning the case number from the lawsuit may indicate that there is a legal dispute associated with the land.Property Taxes: Party E has been paying property taxes since 2001. This may establish their possession or claim to the property, but it does not necessarily resolve the legal complexities arising from the compromise decree and the subsequent sale of the land.Party F's Purchase: If Party F is interested in buying the land from Party E, they should conduct thorough due diligence, including a title search and verification of all legal documents associated with the property. This will help identify any potential legal issues or encumbrances on the land.Potential Issues: There are several potential issues that could arise in the future, including challenges related to the validity of the compromise decree, the court's order for land registration, and the subdivision and sale of the land without proper registration. Party F should be aware of these potential issues and seek legal advice to assess the risks involved.It's crucial for Party F to consult with a qualified property lawyer in India who can review all relevant documents, assess the legal status of the land, and provide guidance on whether it is advisable to proceed with the purchase.

    "answer": "- As per Bombay High Court, mere possession of a gun or cartridges is not a crime.- Since, it is a bailable offence , hence the person was not taken into custody after taking his documents including passport.- Further, under Section 438 of CrPC, a person having committed an offence anticipates his arrest wherein he can approach the High Court or the Sessions Court for anticipatory bail. It is at the discretion of the Court whether to grant bail or reject the same- Since, there is not apprehension of arrest , and due to that reason the ABP rejected.- You can move an application before the court of magistrate to get the passport released.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Anticipatory bail",
    "answer": "Dear ClientIt seems like you are dealing with a legal situation in India related to the Arms Act, anticipatory bail, and the seizure of a foreign passport.Anticipatory Bail: If your first application for anticipatory bail (ABP) was rejected on the grounds of non-maintainability, it's essential to understand why it was deemed non-maintainable. In India, anticipatory bail can be granted if the court is convinced that there is a reasonable apprehension of arrest. To file a second anticipatory bail application after the rejection of the first one, you would typically need to show changed circumstances or new evidence that was not considered in the first application. Discuss this with your attorney to determine if you have a valid basis for a new application.Seizure of Passport: If your foreign passport has been seized by Indian authorities, you may be able to file a petition for the release of your passport separately from your criminal case. However, this will depend on the reasons for the seizure, any ongoing investigations, and the specific circumstances of your case. Consult with your attorney to explore the possibility of seeking the release of your passport.Consult an Attorney: Given the complexity of your situation, it is crucial to consult with a qualified criminal defense attorney in India who specializes in arms-related cases and anticipatory bail matters. They can provide you with the most accurate legal advice and help you navigate the legal processes effectively.Comply with Legal Procedures: While pursuing legal remedies, it's important to comply with all legal procedures, court orders, and cooperate with the authorities as required. Failure to do so could negatively impact your case.Keep Records: Maintain detailed records of all interactions with law enforcement, court documents, and communications related to your case. These records may be useful in building your defense.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear ClientRestitution of Conjugal Rights(RCR): RCR is a legal remedy available underHindu Marriage Act, 1955. It's a legal provision that allows either spouse to request the other to return and cohabit. If the court grants an RCR decree and the other spouse refuses to comply, it can be used as evidence in a future divorce case. However, it's important to understand that an RCR decree doesn't force reconciliation, and it may not necessarily lead to a divorce.Grounds for Divorce: In Hindu law, there are several grounds for divorce, including cruelty, desertion, adultery, and mutual consent. You mentioned that the reasons you've cited are minor, but it's possible to file for divorce on grounds of cruelty if the behavior of your spouse is causing you mental or physical suffering. You should consult with a different lawyer for a second opinion on the grounds for divorce based on your specific circumstances.498A andDomestic Violence(DV): While your lawyer mentioned the threat of 498A (cruelty by husband or relatives) and DV cases, these should not deter you from seeking a legitimate divorce if your marriage is irretrievably broken. False allegations can be challenged in court, and it's crucial to gather evidence to support your case.Mediation: Consider exploring mediation as an option before proceeding with divorce. Mediation can sometimes help couples reach an amicable settlement and avoid prolonged legal battles.Documentation and Evidence: It's essential to document instances of cruelty, if any, and gather evidence to support your case. This can include text messages, emails, or witnesses who can testify to the issues in your marriage.Consult Another Attorney: Given the complexities of your situation, it may be advisable to consult a different attorney for a second opinion. Different lawyers may have different perspectives on your case and may suggest alternative legal strategies.Maintenance and Property: If you proceed with divorce, ensure you are aware of your rights and responsibilities regarding alimony (maintenance) and the division of property and assets.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Should I go for RCR or Divorce?",
    "answer": "RCR (restitution of conjugal rights) and divorce are two legal options available to spouses who are facing marital issues. RCR is a legal remedy that seeks to reunite spouses and provide them with an opportunity to work on their differences and rebuild their relationship, while divorce terminates the marriage. An RCR petition is typically filed when one spouse seeks the court’s intervention to enforce the other spouse’s return to the marital home and the resumption of marital relations. If the execution petition is unsuccessful or if the court determines that the conjugal rights cannot be restored, it may be possible to proceed with a divorce petition.If you are facing false cases ofdomestic violence(DV), maintenance,CrPC 125, or 498A from your wife, you should take some preventive measures to protect yourself and your family from legal harassment and extortion. Some of these measures are:Fight the interim maintenance case whether underCrPC 125or DV Act, as if your life depends on it. This is the most important case that can affect your finances and future prospects.Do not file RCR as it may weaken your case for divorce on the grounds of cruelty or irretrievable breakdown of marriage. It may also prolong your litigation and expose you to more false allegations.File for divorce on the grounds of cruelty or irretrievable breakdown of marriage as soon as possible. This will show your intention to end the marriage and avoid further disputes.Collect all evidence and documents that can prove your innocence and refute your wife’s claims. This may include phone records, bank statements, medical reports, photographs, videos, etc.Get an anticipatory bail if you think your wife may file an FIR underSection 498Aor other criminal charges against you or your family members. This will prevent your arrest and harassment by the police.I hope this information helps you to understand some aspects of RCR and divorce and how they may affect your situation.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Registry through POA",
    "answer": "Dear ClientThe validity of a property registry arrangement where the seller appoints a relative via a registered Power of Attorney (POA) can vary depending on the laws and regulations of the specific jurisdiction where the property is located. Here are some general considerations:Validity of the POA: First and foremost, the POA itself must be valid and legally recognized in the jurisdiction where the property is located. This typically involves ensuring that the POA is properly executed, notarized, and complies with local laws.Specific Powers Granted: The POA document should clearly state the specific powers granted to the relative. It's essential that the POA explicitly authorizes the relative to execute the property sale or registry on behalf of the seller.Local Laws and Regulations: Different jurisdictions may have specific rules and regulations regarding the use of POAs in property transactions. Some jurisdictions may require additional documentation or may limit the use of POAs in property transactions.Verification of the Relative's Identity: The authorities overseeing the property registry may require verification of the relative's identity and relationship to the seller to ensure that the POA is not being misused.Title Search and Due Diligence: It's crucial to conduct a thorough title search and due diligence on the property to ensure that there are no existing disputes or encumbrances that could affect the validity of the sale.Legal Advice: It's highly advisable to consult with a local attorney who specializes in real estate law in the jurisdiction where the property is located. They can provide guidance on the specific legal requirements and potential challenges related to the use of a POA in property transactions.Consular Attestation: If the seller is a non-resident of the country where the property is located, consular attestation of the POA may be required in some cases. This involves having the POA authenticated by the consulate or embassy of the seller's home country.Recording the Deed: After the property registry is completed, it's important to ensure that the deed is properly recorded with the relevant local authorities to establish clear ownership.In summary, the validity of a property registry arrangement using a POA appointed to a relative can depend on a variety of factors, including local laws, the specific language and powers granted in the POA, and any additional requirements in the jurisdiction. It's crucial to seek legal advice and follow the proper procedures to ensure the transaction is valid and legally recognized.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Power of Attorney",
    "answer": "In India, a Power of Attorney is a legal document that allows one person (the principal) to give another person (the attorney-in-fact or agent) the authority to act on their behalf in various legal and financial matters. The PoA can be specific or general, and it can be used for a variety of purposes, including property transactions.Dear ClientIn your case, if you and your wife want to appoint your father as your attorney-in-fact to represent both of you in the sale of your flat in Bengaluru, you can do so. However, you will typically need to execute separate PoAs, one for you and one for your wife, as you both are co-owners of the property. Each PoA should name your father as the agent and specify the powers you are granting to him.Here are the general steps to create and use a PoA for property transactions in India:Draft the PoA: The PoA document should clearly outline the powers you are granting to your father, including the authority to sell the property and handle all related transactions.Get it notarized: The PoA should be executed on a non-judicial stamp paper of the appropriate value and should be signed by you and your wife in the presence of a notary public or magistrate. You may also need to sign it at the Indian consulate in Canada to make it legally valid in India.Register the PoA: If the PoA is for selling immovable property, it is advisable to register it at the local sub-registrar's office where the property is located. This will provide additional legal validity and prevent misuse.Use the PoA: Your father can use the PoA to complete the sale of the property on your behalf. He will need to provide the PoA document to the buyer, and the buyer's lawyer will likely want to verify its authenticity.Revocation of PoA: If needed, you can revoke the PoA at any time by following the legal process, which may involve notifying your father and registering the revocation with the relevant authorities.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Should I go for RCR or Divorce?",
    "answer": "Dear ClientRestitution of Conjugal Rights(RCR): RCR is a legal remedy available underHindu Marriage Act, 1955. It's a legal provision that allows either spouse to request the other to return and cohabit. If the court grants an RCR decree and the other spouse refuses to comply, it can be used as evidence in a future divorce case. However, it's important to understand that an RCR decree doesn't force reconciliation, and it may not necessarily lead to a divorce.Grounds for Divorce: In Hindu law, there are several grounds for divorce, including cruelty, desertion, adultery, and mutual consent. You mentioned that the reasons you've cited are minor, but it's possible to file for divorce on grounds of cruelty if the behavior of your spouse is causing you mental or physical suffering. You should consult with a different lawyer for a second opinion on the grounds for divorce based on your specific circumstances.498A andDomestic Violence(DV): While your lawyer mentioned the threat of 498A (cruelty by husband or relatives) and DV cases, these should not deter you from seeking a legitimate divorce if your marriage is irretrievably broken. False allegations can be challenged in court, and it's crucial to gather evidence to support your case.Mediation: Consider exploring mediation as an option before proceeding with divorce. Mediation can sometimes help couples reach an amicable settlement and avoid prolonged legal battles.Documentation and Evidence: It's essential to document instances of cruelty, if any, and gather evidence to support your case. This can include text messages, emails, or witnesses who can testify to the issues in your marriage.Consult Another Attorney: Given the complexities of your situation, it may be advisable to consult a different attorney for a second opinion. Different lawyers may have different perspectives on your case and may suggest alternative legal strategies.Maintenance and Property: If you proceed with divorce, ensure you are aware of your rights and responsibilities regarding alimony (maintenance) and the division of property and assets.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Should I go for RCR or Divorce?",
    "answer": "RCR (restitution of conjugal rights) and divorce are two legal options available to spouses who are facing marital issues. RCR is a legal remedy that seeks to reunite spouses and provide them with an opportunity to work on their differences and rebuild their relationship, while divorce terminates the marriage. An RCR petition is typically filed when one spouse seeks the court’s intervention to enforce the other spouse’s return to the marital home and the resumption of marital relations. If the execution petition is unsuccessful or if the court determines that the conjugal rights cannot be restored, it may be possible to proceed with a divorce petition.If you are facing false cases ofdomestic violence(DV), maintenance,CrPC 125, or 498A from your wife, you should take some preventive measures to protect yourself and your family from legal harassment and extortion. Some of these measures are:Fight the interim maintenance case whether underCrPC 125or DV Act, as if your life depends on it. This is the most important case that can affect your finances and future prospects.Do not file RCR as it may weaken your case for divorce on the grounds of cruelty or irretrievable breakdown of marriage. It may also prolong your litigation and expose you to more false allegations.File for divorce on the grounds of cruelty or irretrievable breakdown of marriage as soon as possible. This will show your intention to end the marriage and avoid further disputes.Collect all evidence and documents that can prove your innocence and refute your wife’s claims. This may include phone records, bank statements, medical reports, photographs, videos, etc.Get an anticipatory bail if you think your wife may file an FIR underSection 498Aor other criminal charges against you or your family members. This will prevent your arrest and harassment by the police.I hope this information helps you to understand some aspects of RCR and divorce and how they may affect your situation.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear ClientSubstitution of Appellant/Revisionist:In cases like this, where your mother transferred her share in the agricultural land to you, it might be possible for you to substitute yourself as the appellant/revisionist. The procedure for substitution would typically be governed by the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) or other relevant laws. You should consult with a legal expert to understand the specific requirements and procedures for substitution in your case.Effect on Notices:If you are allowed to substitute yourself as the appellant/revisionist, the court may issue fresh notices to all parties involved, including the defendants. However, this can vary depending on the specific circumstances and the discretion of the court. The court may also consider the stage the case is at and whether there is a need to start the proceedings afresh or continue from the existing stage.Multiple Appeals:In general, there can be multiple appeals against the same ex-parte decree, especially if different parties are affected by the same decree. Whether or not the court will merge these appeals depends on the court's discretion and the specific facts of the case. The court may choose to consolidate or hear them separately, depending on the interests of justice.To navigate these legal matters effectively, it is crucial to consult with an experienced lawyer who can assess the current status of your case, review the relevant laws, and provide you with the most accurate informationAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear ClientEndorsement \"File\":The endorsement \"filed\" typically means that the court has accepted and received the Interlocutory Application (IA) filed by the opposite party. It indicates that the IA has been formally submitted to the court and is part of the court record.No Order for Org. Plaintiff to File a \"Say\":In some cases, when an IA is filed, the court may not immediately issue orders for the opposite party or the Org. Plaintiff (original plaintiff) to file their responses (commonly referred to as \"say\" or \"counter-affidavit\").The Org. Plaintiff may not be required to take any immediate steps unless the court specifically orders them to do so. However, it's crucial to monitor the progress of the case and follow any further directions or orders issued by the court.Filing a \"Say\" on IA:It is generally a good practice for the Org. Plaintiff to file a response (say) to the IA filed by the opposite party, even if the court has not explicitly ordered it. Filing a response allows the Org. Plaintiff to present their side of the case and arguments related to the IA.It is not always necessary for the court to call for a hearing before accepting or rejecting the IA. The court may decide the IA based on the written submissions of both parties unless it finds it necessary to conduct a hearing.Endorsing \"Filed\":Endorsing \"filed\" typically means that the IA has been officially received and recorded by the court. It does not necessarily render the IA invalid. The court will review the IA, along with any responses filed by the parties, before making a decision on the relief sought in the IA.It's important to note that legal procedures and practices can vary from one case to another and from one court to another. Therefore, it's crucial to consult with a qualified attorney who can provide specific guidance based on the details of your case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Anticipatory bail",
    "answer": "Dear ClientIt seems like you are dealing with a legal situation in India related to the Arms Act, anticipatory bail, and the seizure of a foreign passport.Anticipatory Bail: If your first application for anticipatory bail (ABP) was rejected on the grounds of non-maintainability, it's essential to understand why it was deemed non-maintainable. In India, anticipatory bail can be granted if the court is convinced that there is a reasonable apprehension of arrest. To file a second anticipatory bail application after the rejection of the first one, you would typically need to show changed circumstances or new evidence that was not considered in the first application. Discuss this with your attorney to determine if you have a valid basis for a new application.Seizure of Passport: If your foreign passport has been seized by Indian authorities, you may be able to file a petition for the release of your passport separately from your criminal case. However, this will depend on the reasons for the seizure, any ongoing investigations, and the specific circumstances of your case. Consult with your attorney to explore the possibility of seeking the release of your passport.Consult an Attorney: Given the complexity of your situation, it is crucial to consult with a qualified criminal defense attorney in India who specializes in arms-related cases and anticipatory bail matters. They can provide you with the most accurate legal advice and help you navigate the legal processes effectively.Comply with Legal Procedures: While pursuing legal remedies, it's important to comply with all legal procedures, court orders, and cooperate with the authorities as required. Failure to do so could negatively impact your case.Keep Records: Maintain detailed records of all interactions with law enforcement, court documents, and communications related to your case. These records may be useful in building your defense.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "In India, a Power of Attorney is a legal document that allows one person (the principal) to give another person (the attorney-in-fact or agent) the authority to act on their behalf in various legal and financial matters. The PoA can be specific or general, and it can be used for a variety of purposes, including property transactions.Dear ClientIn your case, if you and your wife want to appoint your father as your attorney-in-fact to represent both of you in the sale of your flat in Bengaluru, you can do so. However, you will typically need to execute separate PoAs, one for you and one for your wife, as you both are co-owners of the property. Each PoA should name your father as the agent and specify the powers you are granting to him.Here are the general steps to create and use a PoA for property transactions in India:Draft the PoA: The PoA document should clearly outline the powers you are granting to your father, including the authority to sell the property and handle all related transactions.Get it notarized: The PoA should be executed on a non-judicial stamp paper of the appropriate value and should be signed by you and your wife in the presence of a notary public or magistrate. You may also need to sign it at the Indian consulate in Canada to make it legally valid in India.Register the PoA: If the PoA is for selling immovable property, it is advisable to register it at the local sub-registrar's office where the property is located. This will provide additional legal validity and prevent misuse.Use the PoA: Your father can use the PoA to complete the sale of the property on your behalf. He will need to provide the PoA document to the buyer, and the buyer's lawyer will likely want to verify its authenticity.Revocation of PoA: If needed, you can revoke the PoA at any time by following the legal process, which may involve notifying your father and registering the revocation with the relevant authorities.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Registry through POA",
    "answer": "Dear ClientThe validity of a property registry arrangement where the seller appoints a relative via a registered Power of Attorney (POA) can vary depending on the laws and regulations of the specific jurisdiction where the property is located. Here are some general considerations:Validity of the POA: First and foremost, the POA itself must be valid and legally recognized in the jurisdiction where the property is located. This typically involves ensuring that the POA is properly executed, notarized, and complies with local laws.Specific Powers Granted: The POA document should clearly state the specific powers granted to the relative. It's essential that the POA explicitly authorizes the relative to execute the property sale or registry on behalf of the seller.Local Laws and Regulations: Different jurisdictions may have specific rules and regulations regarding the use of POAs in property transactions. Some jurisdictions may require additional documentation or may limit the use of POAs in property transactions.Verification of the Relative's Identity: The authorities overseeing the property registry may require verification of the relative's identity and relationship to the seller to ensure that the POA is not being misused.Title Search and Due Diligence: It's crucial to conduct a thorough title search and due diligence on the property to ensure that there are no existing disputes or encumbrances that could affect the validity of the sale.Legal Advice: It's highly advisable to consult with a local attorney who specializes in real estate law in the jurisdiction where the property is located. They can provide guidance on the specific legal requirements and potential challenges related to the use of a POA in property transactions.Consular Attestation: If the seller is a non-resident of the country where the property is located, consular attestation of the POA may be required in some cases. This involves having the POA authenticated by the consulate or embassy of the seller's home country.Recording the Deed: After the property registry is completed, it's important to ensure that the deed is properly recorded with the relevant local authorities to establish clear ownership.In summary, the validity of a property registry arrangement using a POA appointed to a relative can depend on a variety of factors, including local laws, the specific language and powers granted in the POA, and any additional requirements in the jurisdiction. It's crucial to seek legal advice and follow the proper procedures to ensure the transaction is valid and legally recognized.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Registry through POA",
    "answer": "Dear ClientThe validity of a property registry arrangement where the seller appoints a relative via a registered Power of Attorney (POA) can vary depending on the laws and regulations of the specific jurisdiction where the property is located. Here are some general considerations:Validity of the POA: First and foremost, the POA itself must be valid and legally recognized in the jurisdiction where the property is located. This typically involves ensuring that the POA is properly executed, notarized, and complies with local laws.Specific Powers Granted: The POA document should clearly state the specific powers granted to the relative. It's essential that the POA explicitly authorizes the relative to execute the property sale or registry on behalf of the seller.Local Laws and Regulations: Different jurisdictions may have specific rules and regulations regarding the use of POAs in property transactions. Some jurisdictions may require additional documentation or may limit the use of POAs in property transactions.Verification of the Relative's Identity: The authorities overseeing the property registry may require verification of the relative's identity and relationship to the seller to ensure that the POA is not being misused.Title Search and Due Diligence: It's crucial to conduct a thorough title search and due diligence on the property to ensure that there are no existing disputes or encumbrances that could affect the validity of the sale.Legal Advice: It's highly advisable to consult with a local attorney who specializes in real estate law in the jurisdiction where the property is located. They can provide guidance on the specific legal requirements and potential challenges related to the use of a POA in property transactions.Consular Attestation: If the seller is a non-resident of the country where the property is located, consular attestation of the POA may be required in some cases. This involves having the POA authenticated by the consulate or embassy of the seller's home country.Recording the Deed: After the property registry is completed, it's important to ensure that the deed is properly recorded with the relevant local authorities to establish clear ownership.In summary, the validity of a property registry arrangement using a POA appointed to a relative can depend on a variety of factors, including local laws, the specific language and powers granted in the POA, and any additional requirements in the jurisdiction. It's crucial to seek legal advice and follow the proper procedures to ensure the transaction is valid and legally recognized.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Power of Attorney",
    "answer": "In India, a Power of Attorney is a legal document that allows one person (the principal) to give another person (the attorney-in-fact or agent) the authority to act on their behalf in various legal and financial matters. The PoA can be specific or general, and it can be used for a variety of purposes, including property transactions.Dear ClientIn your case, if you and your wife want to appoint your father as your attorney-in-fact to represent both of you in the sale of your flat in Bengaluru, you can do so. However, you will typically need to execute separate PoAs, one for you and one for your wife, as you both are co-owners of the property. Each PoA should name your father as the agent and specify the powers you are granting to him.Here are the general steps to create and use a PoA for property transactions in India:Draft the PoA: The PoA document should clearly outline the powers you are granting to your father, including the authority to sell the property and handle all related transactions.Get it notarized: The PoA should be executed on a non-judicial stamp paper of the appropriate value and should be signed by you and your wife in the presence of a notary public or magistrate. You may also need to sign it at the Indian consulate in Canada to make it legally valid in India.Register the PoA: If the PoA is for selling immovable property, it is advisable to register it at the local sub-registrar's office where the property is located. This will provide additional legal validity and prevent misuse.Use the PoA: Your father can use the PoA to complete the sale of the property on your behalf. He will need to provide the PoA document to the buyer, and the buyer's lawyer will likely want to verify its authenticity.Revocation of PoA: If needed, you can revoke the PoA at any time by following the legal process, which may involve notifying your father and registering the revocation with the relevant authorities.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear ClientSale Agreement: Ensure that you have a legally binding sale agreement in place with the buyer. This agreement should outline all the terms and conditions of the sale, including the sale price, payment schedule, and the timeline for completion of the transaction.Escrow Account: Consider using an escrow account to facilitate the transaction. An escrow account is a neutral third-party account that holds the funds until all conditions of the sale are met. The funds are released to you once the conditions specified in the agreement are satisfied. You can include a clause in the agreement that requires the buyer to deposit the entire sale amount into the escrow account.Legal Consultation: Consult with a qualified lawyer experienced in property transactions. They can help you draft a sale agreement that protects your interests and complies with Indian property laws. They can also provide guidance on the legal aspects of the transaction.Verification of Buyer's Financial Capability: Before proceeding with the sale, verify the buyer's financial capability to pay off your bank loan and complete the purchase. You can request financial documents and bank statements to ensure that they have the necessary funds or loan approval.Letter of Undertaking: Ask the buyer to provide a Letter of Undertaking from their bank, confirming that they will clear your bank loan and transfer the remaining amount to you upon the completion of the sale. This letter should be legally binding and can be included as an annexure to the sale agreement.Advance Payment: Consider requesting an initial advance payment from the buyer as a sign of commitment. This amount can be deducted from the total sale price upon completion of the transaction.Monitor the Bank Loan Process: Stay in regular contact with the buyer's bank to ensure that your loan is being cleared as agreed upon. You may also request periodic updates from the buyer regarding the loan approval process.Document Compliance: Ensure that all the documents required by the builder for flat transfer are completed accurately and submitted on time. Failure to comply with these requirements may cause delays in the transfer process.Legal Action: If the buyer fails to fulfill their obligations as per the sale agreement, consult your lawyer about taking legal action, such as filing a civil suit for specific performance or breach of contract.Registration: Ensure that the sale deed is registered with the appropriate authority to make the transaction legally valid.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "According to my web search results, you have two options to get married to your future wife, who is a citizen of Romania, in India. You can either register your marriage under theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, or under the Foreign Marriage Act, 1969. The difference between these two acts is that theSpecial Marriage Actapplies to marriages that take place in India, while the Foreign Marriage Act applies to marriages that take place outside India. Therefore, if you want to get married in India, you should follow the procedure under theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954.TheSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, allows any two persons to marry under this act, regardless of their religion, caste, or nationality. However, you will have to satisfy certain conditions and procedures to register your marriage under this act. Some of the conditions and procedures are:You and your future wife should be of legal age to marry in India, which is 18 years for girls and 21 years for boys.You and your future wife should not be within the degrees of prohibited relationship, which are specified in the act.You and your future wife should give a notice of your intended marriage to the Marriage Officer of the district where at least one of you has resided for not less than thirty days immediately preceding the date on which such notice is given. This means that your girlfriend will have to stay in India for at least thirty days before you can apply for your marriage registration. The thirty days can be consecutive or cumulative, as long as they fall within the period of six months before the date of notice.The notice will be published by the Marriage Officer and any person may raise an objection to your marriage within thirty days from the date of publication. If no objection is raised, or if the objection is dismissed by the Marriage Officer, you can solemnize your marriage within three months from the date of notice.The marriage can be performed according to any form or custom, as long as it does not violate any essential condition of a valid marriage.After the marriage is solemnized, you have to sign a declaration in the presence of three witnesses and the Marriage Officer, who will issue a certificate of marriage.The documents that you have to provide for your marriage registration under theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 are:Birth certificates (for age proof)A valid visa of more than thirty days for your future wifeA single-status affidavit or a no objection certificate from the respective embassy or consulate for both of youA divorce decree or death certificate, if any of you was previously marriedA proof of residence in India for at least thirty days for either of youA passport size photograph for both of youA fee as prescribed by the Marriage OfficerYou can consult a lawyer who specializes in family law and cross-border marriages for further guidance and assistance.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

The notice period of 30 days allows for verification and objections, if any, to be raised.Documents Required: You will need to provide certain documents when submitting the Notice of Intended Marriage.

The procedure for substitution would typically be governed by the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) or other relevant laws.

The court may also consider the stage the case is at and whether there is a need to start the proceedings afresh or continue from the existing stage.Multiple Appeals:In general, there can be multiple appeals against the same ex-parte decree, especially if different parties are affected by the same decree. Whether or not the court will merge these appeals depends on the court's discretion and the specific facts of the case.

    "question": "Power of Attorney",
    "answer": "In India, a Power of Attorney is a legal document that allows one person (the principal) to give another person (the attorney-in-fact or agent) the authority to act on their behalf in various legal and financial matters. The PoA can be specific or general, and it can be used for a variety of purposes, including property transactions.Dear ClientIn your case, if you and your wife want to appoint your father as your attorney-in-fact to represent both of you in the sale of your flat in Bengaluru, you can do so. However, you will typically need to execute separate PoAs, one for you and one for your wife, as you both are co-owners of the property. Each PoA should name your father as the agent and specify the powers you are granting to him.Here are the general steps to create and use a PoA for property transactions in India:Draft the PoA: The PoA document should clearly outline the powers you are granting to your father, including the authority to sell the property and handle all related transactions.Get it notarized: The PoA should be executed on a non-judicial stamp paper of the appropriate value and should be signed by you and your wife in the presence of a notary public or magistrate. You may also need to sign it at the Indian consulate in Canada to make it legally valid in India.Register the PoA: If the PoA is for selling immovable property, it is advisable to register it at the local sub-registrar's office where the property is located. This will provide additional legal validity and prevent misuse.Use the PoA: Your father can use the PoA to complete the sale of the property on your behalf. He will need to provide the PoA document to the buyer, and the buyer's lawyer will likely want to verify its authenticity.Revocation of PoA: If needed, you can revoke the PoA at any time by following the legal process, which may involve notifying your father and registering the revocation with the relevant authorities.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear ClientSale Agreement: Ensure that you have a legally binding sale agreement in place with the buyer. This agreement should outline all the terms and conditions of the sale, including the sale price, payment schedule, and the timeline for completion of the transaction.Escrow Account: Consider using an escrow account to facilitate the transaction. An escrow account is a neutral third-party account that holds the funds until all conditions of the sale are met. The funds are released to you once the conditions specified in the agreement are satisfied. You can include a clause in the agreement that requires the buyer to deposit the entire sale amount into the escrow account.Legal Consultation: Consult with a qualified lawyer experienced in property transactions. They can help you draft a sale agreement that protects your interests and complies with Indian property laws. They can also provide guidance on the legal aspects of the transaction.Verification of Buyer's Financial Capability: Before proceeding with the sale, verify the buyer's financial capability to pay off your bank loan and complete the purchase. You can request financial documents and bank statements to ensure that they have the necessary funds or loan approval.Letter of Undertaking: Ask the buyer to provide a Letter of Undertaking from their bank, confirming that they will clear your bank loan and transfer the remaining amount to you upon the completion of the sale. This letter should be legally binding and can be included as an annexure to the sale agreement.Advance Payment: Consider requesting an initial advance payment from the buyer as a sign of commitment. This amount can be deducted from the total sale price upon completion of the transaction.Monitor the Bank Loan Process: Stay in regular contact with the buyer's bank to ensure that your loan is being cleared as agreed upon. You may also request periodic updates from the buyer regarding the loan approval process.Document Compliance: Ensure that all the documents required by the builder for flat transfer are completed accurately and submitted on time. Failure to comply with these requirements may cause delays in the transfer process.Legal Action: If the buyer fails to fulfill their obligations as per the sale agreement, consult your lawyer about taking legal action, such as filing a civil suit for specific performance or breach of contract.Registration: Ensure that the sale deed is registered with the appropriate authority to make the transaction legally valid.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

You may have to hire a lawyer for this purpose and pay the applicable fees.As for filing an RTI for verification of your marksheet, it may not be possible or easy to do so, as private universities are not directly covered under the RTI Act. According to the RTI Act, only those public authorities that are established or constituted by or under the Constitution, by any other law made by Parliament, by any other law made by State Legislature, by notification issued or order made by the appropriate Government are obliged to provide information under the RTI Act. However, some private entities can also be covered under the RTI Act if they are substantially financed by the appropriate Government or if they perform a public function or duty.Private deemed universities can be considered as public authorities under the RTI Act, as they are established by a notification issued by the Central Government on the advice of UGC and they receive substantial funds from the Government in various forms. However, this may not apply to all private universities, especially those that are not deemed universities or do not receive any Government funding. Therefore, you may have to check whether Himalayan University falls under any of these categories before filing an RTI.If you decide to file an RTI for verification of your marksheet from Himalayan University, you may have to follow these steps:First, you have to find out the appropriate authority or body that can provide you with the information. It may be either the UGC or the Ministry of Education or any other competent authority that regulates or oversees the functioning of Himalayan University.Second, you have to draft an RTI application in a prescribed format and pay the requisite fee of Rs. 10/- either online or offline.

You have to obtain an acknowledgement receipt and keep a copy of your application for future reference.Fourth, you have to wait for a response from the PIO within 30 days from the date of receipt of your application. If you do not receive any response or receive an unsatisfactory response, you can file an appeal with the Appellate Authority within 30 days from the expiry of the initial period or from the receipt of the response.Fifth, if you are still not satisfied with the response or do not receive any response from the Appellate Authority within 30 days, you can file a second appeal with the Central Information Commission (CIC) or the State Information Commission (SIC) within 90 days from the date on which the decision should have been made by the Appellate Authority or was actually received by you.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Marriage with foreigner in India",
    "answer": "According to my web search results, you have two options to get married to your future wife, who is a citizen of Romania, in India. You can either register your marriage under theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, or under the Foreign Marriage Act, 1969. The difference between these two acts is that theSpecial Marriage Actapplies to marriages that take place in India, while the Foreign Marriage Act applies to marriages that take place outside India. Therefore, if you want to get married in India, you should follow the procedure under theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954.TheSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, allows any two persons to marry under this act, regardless of their religion, caste, or nationality. However, you will have to satisfy certain conditions and procedures to register your marriage under this act. Some of the conditions and procedures are:You and your future wife should be of legal age to marry in India, which is 18 years for girls and 21 years for boys.You and your future wife should not be within the degrees of prohibited relationship, which are specified in the act.You and your future wife should give a notice of your intended marriage to the Marriage Officer of the district where at least one of you has resided for not less than thirty days immediately preceding the date on which such notice is given. This means that your girlfriend will have to stay in India for at least thirty days before you can apply for your marriage registration. The thirty days can be consecutive or cumulative, as long as they fall within the period of six months before the date of notice.The notice will be published by the Marriage Officer and any person may raise an objection to your marriage within thirty days from the date of publication. If no objection is raised, or if the objection is dismissed by the Marriage Officer, you can solemnize your marriage within three months from the date of notice.The marriage can be performed according to any form or custom, as long as it does not violate any essential condition of a valid marriage.After the marriage is solemnized, you have to sign a declaration in the presence of three witnesses and the Marriage Officer, who will issue a certificate of marriage.The documents that you have to provide for your marriage registration under theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 are:Birth certificates (for age proof)A valid visa of more than thirty days for your future wifeA single-status affidavit or a no objection certificate from the respective embassy or consulate for both of youA divorce decree or death certificate, if any of you was previously marriedA proof of residence in India for at least thirty days for either of youA passport size photograph for both of youA fee as prescribed by the Marriage OfficerYou can consult a lawyer who specializes in family law and cross-border marriages for further guidance and assistance.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

This notice is typically required to be filed at least 30 days before the intended date of marriage.Residency Requirement: As per the Act, there is no specific requirement for the foreigner (in your case, your girlfriend) to stay in India for a certain number of consecutive days before getting married. The notice period of 30 days allows for verification and objections, if any, to be raised.Documents Required: You will need to provide certain documents when submitting the Notice of Intended Marriage.

You have the right to get back the property. Legal action can only be taken when already legal notice through Advocate has been served upon the entity or person you wish to bring to court. It is only this method that legalizes producing a matter to court. The intimation given is known as 'legal notice.' A legal notice is, hence, formal notification to a person or an entity, notifying the other party of your purpose to commence legal proceedings against them. Legal notice can serve as a target of negotiations among the parties and save time, effort, and money spent in court cases.This makes the party aware of your complaint. Many times, a legal notice served will bring the other party on heels, and the difficulty can get resolved out of court, too, with fruitful arguments on both sides. If the opposite party is still not heeding to the grievance, one can always start the court procedures after a particular interval, as pronounced by the law.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete documents.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, Delhi418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma"

    "answer": "If you have signed a contract or an offer letter with the IT company that contains a clause regarding the notice period or the recovery amount, then you may be legally bound by it and liable to pay the amount or face legal action. However, if you have not signed any such contract or offer letter, or if the clause is vague, unreasonable, or unfair, then you may not be legally bound by it and you may challenge the legal notice or the claim of the IT company.If you have received a legal notice from the IT company, you should reply to it within the stipulated time mentioned in the notice, usually 15 to 30 days. You should reply to the legal notice through a lawyer who can draft a proper and professional response on your behalf. You should also keep a copy of the legal notice and your reply for future reference. You should address all the points raised in the legal notice and refute them with facts and evidence. You should also state your position and intention clearly and assertively. You should avoid any admission of guilt or liability or any abusive or threatening language in your reply.If you want to avoid paying the recovery amount or facing legal action from the IT company, you may try to negotiate with them and settle the matter amicably. You may offer to pay a lesser amount or waive off the amount altogether, depending on your situation and circumstances. You may also seek an apology or a clarification from them, if applicable. You may also invoke any mitigating factors or defenses that may absolve you from liability, such as coercion, fraud, mistake, breach of contract, etc.Giving a complaint to the nearest police station against the IT Company.

The court may need time to thoroughly examine all the evidence presented.Legal Representation: Ensure that you have legal representation for your case. Having an experienced lawyer can make a significant difference in the progress and outcome of your case. Your lawyer can also provide guidance on the next steps to take.Settlement: You may want to explore the possibility of a settlement with the other party, if you haven't already. Sometimes, parties can reach an agreement outside of court to resolve the matter more quickly and with less expense.Court Updates: Regularly check the status of your case with your lawyer and inquire about the reasons for any delays. They should be able to provide insights into the specific circumstances surrounding your case.Escalation: If you believe there are undue delays or irregularities in the handling of your case, you can consider seeking legal remedies to expedite the process. Your lawyer can advise you on the appropriate legal steps to take in such situations.Political Affiliation: It's essential to focus on the legal aspects of the case rather than the political affiliations of the involved parties. Legal matters should be resolved impartially, and your lawyer will work to ensure that the law is upheld.In summary, civil cases in India can take time to reach a resolution, and it's essential to have patience and continue working closely with your legal counsel.

    "answer": "Dear ClientSale Agreement: Ensure that you have a legally binding sale agreement in place with the buyer. This agreement should outline all the terms and conditions of the sale, including the sale price, payment schedule, and the timeline for completion of the transaction.Escrow Account: Consider using an escrow account to facilitate the transaction. An escrow account is a neutral third-party account that holds the funds until all conditions of the sale are met. The funds are released to you once the conditions specified in the agreement are satisfied. You can include a clause in the agreement that requires the buyer to deposit the entire sale amount into the escrow account.Legal Consultation: Consult with a qualified lawyer experienced in property transactions. They can help you draft a sale agreement that protects your interests and complies with Indian property laws. They can also provide guidance on the legal aspects of the transaction.Verification of Buyer's Financial Capability: Before proceeding with the sale, verify the buyer's financial capability to pay off your bank loan and complete the purchase. You can request financial documents and bank statements to ensure that they have the necessary funds or loan approval.Letter of Undertaking: Ask the buyer to provide a Letter of Undertaking from their bank, confirming that they will clear your bank loan and transfer the remaining amount to you upon the completion of the sale. This letter should be legally binding and can be included as an annexure to the sale agreement.Advance Payment: Consider requesting an initial advance payment from the buyer as a sign of commitment. This amount can be deducted from the total sale price upon completion of the transaction.Monitor the Bank Loan Process: Stay in regular contact with the buyer's bank to ensure that your loan is being cleared as agreed upon. You may also request periodic updates from the buyer regarding the loan approval process.Document Compliance: Ensure that all the documents required by the builder for flat transfer are completed accurately and submitted on time. Failure to comply with these requirements may cause delays in the transfer process.Legal Action: If the buyer fails to fulfill their obligations as per the sale agreement, consult your lawyer about taking legal action, such as filing a civil suit for specific performance or breach of contract.Registration: Ensure that the sale deed is registered with the appropriate authority to make the transaction legally valid.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Celebrating child birthday",
    "answer": "Celebrating your child’s birthday in school is a common and acceptable practice, as long as you follow the rules and regulations of the school and obtain the prior permission of the principal or the teacher. You may need to inform the school about the date, time, duration, and number of guests for the celebration. You may also need to ensure that the celebration does not disturb the academic activities or discipline of the school. You may also need to arrange for the cake, snacks, drinks, decorations, gifts, etc., for the celebration.However, since you are involved in a legal dispute with your wife over the custody and maintenance of your child, you may face some difficulties or challenges in celebrating your child’s birthday in school. Some of them are:Your wife may object to your presence or participation in the celebration and may try to prevent you from meeting or interacting with your child. She may also accuse you of violating her rights or harassing her or your child.Your child may be confused or upset by seeing you and your wife in conflict and may not enjoy the celebration. He or she may also feel pressured or guilty to choose between you and your wife.The school authorities may be reluctant or hesitant to allow you to celebrate your child’s birthday in school, as they may not want to get involved in your personal or legal matters. They may also fear any trouble or disturbance that may arise from your visit.To answer your specific questions:How should i approach school that i want to celebrate my child birthday in recess and what could be the legal implications of it?You should approach the school in a polite and respectful manner and request them to grant you permission to celebrate your child’s birthday in recess. You should explain to them your situation and your intention to make your child happy and show him your love and care. You should also assure them that you will not cause any trouble or inconvenience to the school or anyone else. You should also provide them with all the details and documents that they may require for verification or approval.The legal implications of celebrating your child’s birthday in school may depend on various factors, such as the status of your case, the orders of the court, the consent of your wife, etc. Generally, there is no legal prohibition on celebrating your child’s birthday in school, as long as you do not violate any law or court order or infringe on anyone’s rights. However, if your wife objects to your visit or files a complaint against you, you may have to face some legal consequences, such as contempt of court, criminal charges, etc.Since today is 10-September , Should i go and request court that i want to meet my child on school birthday in school?It may be advisable to go and request the court that you want to meet your child on his birthday in school, as this may help you avoid any legal complications or conflicts with your wife. The court may grant you permission to meet your child on his birthday in school, subject to certain conditions and restrictions. The court may also order your wife to cooperate with you and not interfere with your visit. The court may also consider your request as a positive sign of your interest and involvement in your child’s welfare.My wife also teaches in same school and also giving montlhy 7k for last 1 year even without court order as responisibilityThis information may not have much relevance or impact on your request to celebrate your child’s birthday in school.

This may have an adverse effect on your case and your relationship with your son. It may also create problems for the school and other people involved. It may also expose you to legal risks and liabilities.Therefore, I would suggest that you approach the court first and seek its approval for meeting your son on his birthday in school.

    "answer": "Dear ClientCelebrating Your Child's Birthday in School:You can approach the school to request permission to celebrate your child's birthday during the school recess. It is typically a common practice for parents to celebrate their children's birthdays in school. However, given the circumstances, it's essential to ensure that both you and your wife are on the same page regarding the celebration.There should not be any significant legal implications for celebrating your child's birthday at school as long as it is done in a non-disruptive and respectful manner.Requesting Court Access for the Birthday:Since the birthday is approaching on September 21st, it may be challenging to obtain a court order in such a short time frame. Courts may require time to process your request and schedule a hearing.If you believe it's essential to have access to your child on their birthday, you can consult with a family law attorney immediately to explore your options. They can advise you on whether an emergency hearing is feasible or if there are other steps you can take to secure your visitation rights.Meeting Your Son in School:Given that your wife teaches in the same school and you have been providing financial support, it may be reasonable to approach the school directly to discuss your desire to meet your child on his birthday. However, you should do this with utmost respect for the school's policies and your wife's position.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "According to my web search results, you have two options to get married to your future wife, who is a citizen of Romania, in India. You can either register your marriage under theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, or under the Foreign Marriage Act, 1969. The difference between these two acts is that theSpecial Marriage Actapplies to marriages that take place in India, while the Foreign Marriage Act applies to marriages that take place outside India. Therefore, if you want to get married in India, you should follow the procedure under theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954.TheSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, allows any two persons to marry under this act, regardless of their religion, caste, or nationality. However, you will have to satisfy certain conditions and procedures to register your marriage under this act. Some of the conditions and procedures are:You and your future wife should be of legal age to marry in India, which is 18 years for girls and 21 years for boys.You and your future wife should not be within the degrees of prohibited relationship, which are specified in the act.You and your future wife should give a notice of your intended marriage to the Marriage Officer of the district where at least one of you has resided for not less than thirty days immediately preceding the date on which such notice is given. This means that your girlfriend will have to stay in India for at least thirty days before you can apply for your marriage registration. The thirty days can be consecutive or cumulative, as long as they fall within the period of six months before the date of notice.The notice will be published by the Marriage Officer and any person may raise an objection to your marriage within thirty days from the date of publication. If no objection is raised, or if the objection is dismissed by the Marriage Officer, you can solemnize your marriage within three months from the date of notice.The marriage can be performed according to any form or custom, as long as it does not violate any essential condition of a valid marriage.After the marriage is solemnized, you have to sign a declaration in the presence of three witnesses and the Marriage Officer, who will issue a certificate of marriage.The documents that you have to provide for your marriage registration under theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 are:Birth certificates (for age proof)A valid visa of more than thirty days for your future wifeA single-status affidavit or a no objection certificate from the respective embassy or consulate for both of youA divorce decree or death certificate, if any of you was previously marriedA proof of residence in India for at least thirty days for either of youA passport size photograph for both of youA fee as prescribed by the Marriage OfficerYou can consult a lawyer who specializes in family law and cross-border marriages for further guidance and assistance.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Conditional gift deed, revoked if filed for divorce. Can this be legal",
    "answer": "Giftis a transfer of property where interest is transferred from one living person to another, without any consideration. It is a gratuitous and inter vivos in nature. Gift Deed is a legally binding written document defined in Section 122 of theTransfer of Property Act, 1822, through which the donor can transfer an existing movable or immovable property to the donee voluntarily. A Gift Deed is valid only if it is given out of love and affection, without any consideration in return by one family member/ friend to another.A gift once made and registered with due process of law cannot be revoked. After the acceptance, it becomes the property of the donee. The donor cannot independently revoke the deed. Also, in a deed where the parties have agreed that the deed shall be revocable in part or whole, by the mere will of the donor, is not a valid Gift Deed.However, under Section 126 of theTransfer of Property Act, 1882 there are certain grounds when gifts can be revoked. The revocation in itself incorporates the cancellation of the Gift Deed and the possession of the property is returned to the donor. The grounds are –If there is an agreement between the donor and donee, that if certain specified events happen or do not happen, the gift shall be revoked. The point to note here is that the occurrence of such an event should not be controlled by the donor. And both parties must have agreed to such a condition in terms of the Gift Deed.The conditions stipulated should not be immoral, illegal or reprehensible to the property.In case of Thakur Raghunathjee Maharaj v. Ramesh Chandra, Hon’ble Supreme Court state that“even though a condition is not laid down in the Gift Deed itself, and has been provided under a mutual agreement separately but forms part of the transaction of the gift, the condition would be valid and enforceable”.Another instance, when a gift can be revoked is, if they violate Section 19 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 which says“Where consent to an agreement is caused by coercion, undue influence, fraud or misrepresentation, the agreement is a contract voidable at the option of the party whose consent was so obtained”.So if the gift was made by obtaining consent on the above grounds it can be revoked. And in case, the donor dies, his heirs have the right to file for revocation of the deed.It is most important is that ;If the donee doesn’t accept the gift, the donor cannot force the recipient to accept the same. The deed shall stand invalid unless the donee records the acceptance.A donor can impose conditions that allow them to retain certain rights over the property, such as a life interest..According to thetransfer of property Act1882,a gift Deed is valid only if registered.But the same time aFree Consent(Both the donor and the donee must give their free and voluntary consent to the terms and conditions of the gift deed ) is important if it is conditional .Ajay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

    "question": "Conditional gift deed, revoked if filed for divorce. Can this be legal",
    "answer": "A valid conditional gift deed is:The donee can have a choice to oblige to the condition or not.The donor cannot state any extreme or immoral conditions against the law. It should not be immoral, harmful, criminal, or vengeful.Any kind of condition that might be like a punishment for the donee is not enforceable by law.All the four conditions what you have proposed to incorporate in the gift deed is not lawful hence the gift deed will not be legally valid.The conditions what you have mentioned appears like compensation.A gift deed would be invalidif it included any compensation for the gift.A conditional gift with no recital of acceptance and no evidence in proof of acceptance, where possession remains with the donor as long as he is alive, does not become complete during lifetime of the donor.When a gift is incomplete and title remains with the donor the deed of gift might be cancelled.To understand what constitutes as a Gift, the Supreme Court in the case ofNaramadaben Maganlal Thakker v. Pranivandas Maganlal Thakker and others, held “Gift means to transfer certain existing moveable or immoveable property voluntarily and without consideration by one person called the donor to another called the donee.section 122 of theTransfer of Property Act, 1882 also defines the same that gift is without consideration.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Dear ClientMaintenance and Care of Donor: You can include a condition in the gift deed that requires the donee to take care of the donor during their lifetime, provide medical care when needed, and not sell or mortgage the gifted property during the donor's lifetime. This can help ensure your financial and healthcare needs are met.Transfer to Children: You can specify in the gift deed that the property can be transferred only to the children of the donor. This condition can help preserve the property within the family.Sharing Rental Income: You can include a condition that the rental income from the gifted property will be shared with the donor by a percentage mentioned in the condition. This can provide you with some financial support during your retirement.Cancellation of Gift Deed: You may include a clause in the gift deed that allows the donor and donee to mutually agree to cancel the gift deed in specific situations, such as the need to sell the property partly or fully for educational needs or life-threatening medical conditions. This condition should be carefully worded to ensure clarity and enforceability.Sale of Property During Donor's Lifetime: You can restrict the donee from selling the property during the donor's lifetime by including a condition to that effect. This condition can help protect your intended use of the property during your retirement.Please note that the enforceability of these conditions may depend on various factors, including the wording of the conditions, local laws, and specific circumstances.

    "question": "Registered Gift cancellation through unregistered will deed",
    "answer": "A gift deed can be cancelled by the donor or the donee under certain circumstances, such as fraud, coercion, mutual agreement, rescission, etc. However, the cancellation of a gift deed requires a legal procedure and a court order. The steps involved in cancelling a gift deed are as follows:File a petition: The person who wants to cancel the gift deed has to file a petition in the court where the property is situated. The petition should state the grounds for cancellation and be verified by an affidavit.Pay the court fees: The petitioner has to pay the court fees according to the value of the property involved in the gift deed.Publish a notice: The petitioner has to publish a notice in a newspaper and serve a notice to the other party involved in the gift deed. The notice should inform them about the petition and the date and time of hearing.Produce evidence: The petitioner has to produce evidence and witnesses to prove their case for cancellation. The evidence may include documents, photographs, recordings, etc.Obtain court order: The court will hear both sides and examine the evidence before passing an order. If the court is satisfied with the grounds for cancellation, it will issue an order to cancel the gift deed and restore the property to its original owner.In your case, it seems that your granny had filed a petition for cancellation of gift deed under misrepresentation in lower court, but she died before getting an order from the court. She also left an unregistered will in your favour, which you claim to have in your possession. An unregistered will is valid in India if it fulfils the following conditions:It is written by the testator with their own free will and sound mind.It is signed by the testator and attested by two witnesses.It clearly expresses the intention of the testator to dispose of their property after their death.However, an unregistered will may also face some challenges and difficulties in proving its authenticity and validity, such as:It may be easily tampered with or destroyed by someone who is not happy with its contents.It may be contested by someone who claims to have a better right over the property or who alleges that the will was made under coercion, fraud, undue influence, etc.It may not be accepted by some authorities or institutions who require a registered will or a probate order for transferring or dealing with the property.Therefore, if you want to execute your granny’s unregistered will and cancel her gift deed in favour of your elder uncle, you may have to follow these steps:Apply for probate: You have to apply for probate of your granny’s unregistered will in the competent court where she resided or where her property is situated. Probate is a legal process that certifies that the will is genuine and valid. You have to submit the original will along with other documents, such as death certificate, identity proof, etc., to the court. You also have to pay the court fees and publish a notice in a newspaper inviting objections from anyone who may have a claim over your granny’s property.Obtain probate order: The court will examine your granny’s unregistered will and hear any objections or claims from other parties. If the court is satisfied that your granny’s unregistered will is valid and reflects her true wishes, it will issue a probate order in your favour. The probate order will grant you the authority to execute your granny’s unregistered will and dispose of her property according to her wishes.Pursue cancellation of gift deed: You have to pursue the cancellation of gift deed that your granny had filed against your elder uncle in lower court. You have to inform the court about your granny’s death and your probate order. You have to continue with her petition for cancellation of gift deed under misrepresentation and produce evidence and witnesses to support her case. You have to also defend yourself against any counterclaims or arguments from your elder uncle or his lawyer. You have to obtain a court order that cancels the gift deed and restores your granny’s property to you as per her unregistered will.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Orencia 125.mg  Injection medication",
    "answer": "Orencia is a medicine used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. It is also used to prevent acute graft-versus-host disease in some people undergoing stem cell transplantation. Orencia works by blocking the activity of certain immune cells that cause inflammation and damage to the joints and other tissues.Orencia can cause serious side effects, such as infections, cancer, liver problems, allergic reactions, and infusion reactions. Some of these side effects can be fatal. Orencia can also interact with other drugs, such as vaccines, biologics, and immunosuppressants.According to some sources, there have been lawsuits filed against the manufacturer of Orencia, Bristol-Myers Squibb, by people who claimed that they suffered from severe or life-threatening complications after taking the drug. Some of these lawsuits alleged that Orencia caused heart attacks, strokes, heart failure, lung diseases, and blood disorders. Some of these lawsuits also alleged that the company failed to warn the public and the medical community about the risks and dangers of Orencia.If you believe that you have been harmed by Orencia, you may have a legal right to seek compensation for your damages. You may be able to join a class action lawsuit or file an individual lawsuit against Bristol-Myers Squibb in the US. However, you should be aware that there are time limits and other requirements for filing a lawsuit. You should also be aware that there are risks and costs involved in pursuing a legal action.Therefore, I suggest that you consult a lawyer who specializes in civil law and drug injury cases as soon as possible.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Advocate without Vakalatnama",
    "answer": "Dear ClientEnforce Applicable Rules and Regulations: You have correctly pointed out various provisions from the Bombay High Court and Advocates Act that require proper authorization (Vakaltnama) and/or a No Objection Certificate (NOC) when changing legal representation. You can continue to argue before the court that the senior advocate's appearance is in violation of these rules.Request Discharge of Earlier Advocate: You can emphasize that the junior advocate who initially appeared on behalf of JD has not been discharged by JD, and his Vakaltnama is still on record. This is a valid point, and it should be brought to the court's attention. It's important to highlight the need for a formal discharge or NOC in such situations.Invoke Supreme Court Precedent: The decision of the Supreme Court in the case sets a precedent that obtaining a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the previous counsel is crucial. You can refer to this case and argue that the senior advocate's failure to obtain an NOC should disqualify him from representing JD.Emphasize the Distinction Between Senior Counsel and District Advocates: You've rightly mentioned the distinction between senior counsel in high courts and district-level advocates. Emphasize the local court's requirement for proper authorization through a Vakaltnama and the need for adherence to local court rules.Argue the Lack of Consent from the Previous Advocate: Stress that the junior advocate and the senior advocate did not provide any evidence of consent or an arrangement between them regarding representation in this case. Highlight that this absence of consent or arrangement violates the established rules and norms.Seek Dismissal of the Senior Advocate's Application: Before the senior advocate begins his arguments on the merits of the case, you can request that the court dismiss his application on the grounds that he has not satisfied the court regarding his authorization to represent JD. You can refer to the relevant rules and precedents as discussed above to support your argument.Ultimately, the court will decide how to proceed based on the arguments presented by both parties. It's important to ensure that your objections are well-documented and supported by relevant legal provisions and precedents. Additionally, consulting with a senior advocate or legal expert who specializes in such matters in the specific jurisdiction may provide valuable insights and strategiesAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Registered Gift cancellation through unregistered will deed",
    "answer": "A gift deed can be cancelled by the donor or the donee under certain circumstances, such as fraud, coercion, mutual agreement, rescission, etc. However, the cancellation of a gift deed requires a legal procedure and a court order. The steps involved in cancelling a gift deed are as follows:File a petition: The person who wants to cancel the gift deed has to file a petition in the court where the property is situated. The petition should state the grounds for cancellation and be verified by an affidavit.Pay the court fees: The petitioner has to pay the court fees according to the value of the property involved in the gift deed.Publish a notice: The petitioner has to publish a notice in a newspaper and serve a notice to the other party involved in the gift deed. The notice should inform them about the petition and the date and time of hearing.Produce evidence: The petitioner has to produce evidence and witnesses to prove their case for cancellation. The evidence may include documents, photographs, recordings, etc.Obtain court order: The court will hear both sides and examine the evidence before passing an order. If the court is satisfied with the grounds for cancellation, it will issue an order to cancel the gift deed and restore the property to its original owner.In your case, it seems that your granny had filed a petition for cancellation of gift deed under misrepresentation in lower court, but she died before getting an order from the court. She also left an unregistered will in your favour, which you claim to have in your possession. An unregistered will is valid in India if it fulfils the following conditions:It is written by the testator with their own free will and sound mind.It is signed by the testator and attested by two witnesses.It clearly expresses the intention of the testator to dispose of their property after their death.However, an unregistered will may also face some challenges and difficulties in proving its authenticity and validity, such as:It may be easily tampered with or destroyed by someone who is not happy with its contents.It may be contested by someone who claims to have a better right over the property or who alleges that the will was made under coercion, fraud, undue influence, etc.It may not be accepted by some authorities or institutions who require a registered will or a probate order for transferring or dealing with the property.Therefore, if you want to execute your granny’s unregistered will and cancel her gift deed in favour of your elder uncle, you may have to follow these steps:Apply for probate: You have to apply for probate of your granny’s unregistered will in the competent court where she resided or where her property is situated. Probate is a legal process that certifies that the will is genuine and valid. You have to submit the original will along with other documents, such as death certificate, identity proof, etc., to the court. You also have to pay the court fees and publish a notice in a newspaper inviting objections from anyone who may have a claim over your granny’s property.Obtain probate order: The court will examine your granny’s unregistered will and hear any objections or claims from other parties. If the court is satisfied that your granny’s unregistered will is valid and reflects her true wishes, it will issue a probate order in your favour. The probate order will grant you the authority to execute your granny’s unregistered will and dispose of her property according to her wishes.Pursue cancellation of gift deed: You have to pursue the cancellation of gift deed that your granny had filed against your elder uncle in lower court. You have to inform the court about your granny’s death and your probate order. You have to continue with her petition for cancellation of gift deed under misrepresentation and produce evidence and witnesses to support her case. You have to also defend yourself against any counterclaims or arguments from your elder uncle or his lawyer. You have to obtain a court order that cancels the gift deed and restores your granny’s property to you as per her unregistered will.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Registered Gift cancellation through unregistered will deed",
    "answer": "A gift deed can be cancelled by the donor or the donee under certain circumstances, such as fraud, coercion, mutual agreement, rescission, etc. However, the cancellation of a gift deed requires a legal procedure and a court order. The steps involved in cancelling a gift deed are as follows:File a petition: The person who wants to cancel the gift deed has to file a petition in the court where the property is situated. The petition should state the grounds for cancellation and be verified by an affidavit.Pay the court fees: The petitioner has to pay the court fees according to the value of the property involved in the gift deed.Publish a notice: The petitioner has to publish a notice in a newspaper and serve a notice to the other party involved in the gift deed. The notice should inform them about the petition and the date and time of hearing.Produce evidence: The petitioner has to produce evidence and witnesses to prove their case for cancellation. The evidence may include documents, photographs, recordings, etc.Obtain court order: The court will hear both sides and examine the evidence before passing an order. If the court is satisfied with the grounds for cancellation, it will issue an order to cancel the gift deed and restore the property to its original owner.In your case, it seems that your granny had filed a petition for cancellation of gift deed under misrepresentation in lower court, but she died before getting an order from the court. She also left an unregistered will in your favour, which you claim to have in your possession. An unregistered will is valid in India if it fulfils the following conditions:It is written by the testator with their own free will and sound mind.It is signed by the testator and attested by two witnesses.It clearly expresses the intention of the testator to dispose of their property after their death.However, an unregistered will may also face some challenges and difficulties in proving its authenticity and validity, such as:It may be easily tampered with or destroyed by someone who is not happy with its contents.It may be contested by someone who claims to have a better right over the property or who alleges that the will was made under coercion, fraud, undue influence, etc.It may not be accepted by some authorities or institutions who require a registered will or a probate order for transferring or dealing with the property.Therefore, if you want to execute your granny’s unregistered will and cancel her gift deed in favour of your elder uncle, you may have to follow these steps:Apply for probate: You have to apply for probate of your granny’s unregistered will in the competent court where she resided or where her property is situated. Probate is a legal process that certifies that the will is genuine and valid. You have to submit the original will along with other documents, such as death certificate, identity proof, etc., to the court. You also have to pay the court fees and publish a notice in a newspaper inviting objections from anyone who may have a claim over your granny’s property.Obtain probate order: The court will examine your granny’s unregistered will and hear any objections or claims from other parties. If the court is satisfied that your granny’s unregistered will is valid and reflects her true wishes, it will issue a probate order in your favour. The probate order will grant you the authority to execute your granny’s unregistered will and dispose of her property according to her wishes.Pursue cancellation of gift deed: You have to pursue the cancellation of gift deed that your granny had filed against your elder uncle in lower court. You have to inform the court about your granny’s death and your probate order. You have to continue with her petition for cancellation of gift deed under misrepresentation and produce evidence and witnesses to support her case. You have to also defend yourself against any counterclaims or arguments from your elder uncle or his lawyer. You have to obtain a court order that cancels the gift deed and restores your granny’s property to you as per her unregistered will.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Undisclosed registered lease deed",
    "answer": "First of all, I would advise you to be very cautious and careful before proceeding with this transaction. The fact that the seller did not disclose the registered lease deed and its suspicious clauses is a red flag that indicates a possible fraud or hidden defect in the title of the property. You should also verify the authenticity and validity of the lease deed and the other documents related to the property. You should also check if there are any pending or potential disputes, claims, liens, court judgments, government actions, or any other encumbrances on the property. You should also consult a lawyer and get a legal opinion on the property before making any decision.Secondly, if you decide to proceed with this transaction and get a registered sale deed in your favour, you may have some rights as a bona fide purchaser for value without notice. According to the Indian law of property, a bona fide purchaser is a person who purchases property for a valid consideration without knowing of any other party’s claim to the title of that property. A bona fide purchaser can acquire a good title to the property even if the seller had a defective title or no title at all. However, this rule is not absolute and there are some exceptions and limitations to it.Some of the exceptions and limitations are as follows:The rule does not apply to properties that are subject to statutory restrictions or prohibitions on transfer, such as wakf properties, trust properties, enemy properties, etc.The rule does not apply to properties that are subject to public notice or registration requirements, such as properties under theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, the Registration Act, 1908, etc.The rule does not apply to properties that are subject to equitable interests or rights of third parties, such as mortgages, charges, easements, etc.The rule does not apply to properties that are subject to adverse possession or prescriptive rights of third parties.The rule does not apply to properties that are subject to fraud or collusion between the seller and the buyer or between the seller and the third party.The rule does not apply to properties that are subject to estoppel or waiver by the buyer or by the third party.Therefore, depending on the nature and circumstances of your case, you may or may not have a superior right over any other charges/claims/liens/court judgments/government actions that may arise in future.

Your lawyer can advise you on whether these clauses could pose future problems or if they can be challenged or invalidated.Proceeding with the Transaction: Your decision to proceed with the transaction should be based on a careful assessment of the risks and potential consequences. If you decide to proceed, consider negotiating with the seller to address your concerns or seek indemnities if issues arise from the hidden lease deed in the future. Make sure to consult with your lawyer on the best way to protect your interests in the transaction.Rights as a Bona Fide Purchaser: In India, a bona fide purchaser for value without notice can have certain protections. If you can demonstrate that you acted in good faith, paid a fair price, and had no knowledge of any encumbrances or adverse claims when you purchased the property, you may have priority over subsequent claims, liens, or judgments that arise after your purchase. However, the specific legal protection you have will depend on the circumstances and applicable laws, and your lawyer can provide more detailed guidance.Legal Due Diligence: Continue to conduct a thorough legal due diligence process with the assistance of your lawyer. Ensure that all necessary searches and investigations are completed to uncover any potential issues or claims on the property. This will help you make an informed decision about whether to proceed with the transaction.Ultimately, you should rely on the advice of your legal counsel to assess the risks associated with this property transaction, negotiate with the seller if necessary, and take appropriate steps to protect your interests. Property transactions can be complex, and legal guidance is crucial to navigate them successfully.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "IT company sent me a legal notice after 1 year",
    "answer": "If you have signed a contract or an offer letter with the IT company that contains a clause regarding the notice period or the recovery amount, then you may be legally bound by it and liable to pay the amount or face legal action. However, if you have not signed any such contract or offer letter, or if the clause is vague, unreasonable, or unfair, then you may not be legally bound by it and you may challenge the legal notice or the claim of the IT company.If you have received a legal notice from the IT company, you should reply to it within the stipulated time mentioned in the notice, usually 15 to 30 days. You should reply to the legal notice through a lawyer who can draft a proper and professional response on your behalf. You should also keep a copy of the legal notice and your reply for future reference. You should address all the points raised in the legal notice and refute them with facts and evidence. You should also state your position and intention clearly and assertively. You should avoid any admission of guilt or liability or any abusive or threatening language in your reply.If you want to avoid paying the recovery amount or facing legal action from the IT company, you may try to negotiate with them and settle the matter amicably. You may offer to pay a lesser amount or waive off the amount altogether, depending on your situation and circumstances. You may also seek an apology or a clarification from them, if applicable. You may also invoke any mitigating factors or defenses that may absolve you from liability, such as coercion, fraud, mistake, breach of contract, etc.Giving a complaint to the nearest police station against the IT Company.

    "answer": "Blackmailing is a form of extortion in which a person threatens to reveal or publicize some information that is damaging or embarrassing to another person, unless the latter complies with certain demands, such as money, sexual favors, or other benefits. Blackmailing is a criminal offense in India, punishable under sections 383 to 389 of theIndian Penal Code(IPC), 1860. The punishment for blackmailing can be imprisonment for up to three years, or fine, or both.Some of the steps that you can take to deal with blackmailing are as follows:Do not panic or give in to the blackmailer’s demands. Paying the blackmailer may not stop him or her from asking for more money or favors, or from releasing the information anyway. It may also encourage him or her to target more victims.Do not delete or destroy any evidence of the blackmailing, such as messages, emails, photos, videos, etc. Preserve them as proof of the crime and the identity of the blackmailer.Report the blackmailer to the local police and file a complaint under sections 384 (extortion) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC. You can also file a complaint online at www.cybercrime.gov.in if the blackmailing is done through electronic means.

    "question": "Regarding verification of my mark sheet from Himalayan University - a private university",
    "answer": "There are some ways to check the authenticity of your marksheet, such as:You can visit the official website of Himalayan University and log in with your student ID and password to access your student portal. There you can view and download your marksheet and other academic records.You can contact the Himalayan University directly by phone, email, or post and request them to verify your marksheet. You may have to provide them with your name, roll number, course name, year of passing, and a copy of your marksheet.You can send a legal notice to the Himalayan University demanding the verification of your marksheet and the issuance of a certificate of authenticity. You may have to hire a lawyer for this purpose and pay the applicable fees.As for filing an RTI for verification of your marksheet, it may not be possible or easy to do so, as private universities are not directly covered under the RTI Act. According to the RTI Act, only those public authorities that are established or constituted by or under the Constitution, by any other law made by Parliament, by any other law made by State Legislature, by notification issued or order made by the appropriate Government are obliged to provide information under the RTI Act. However, some private entities can also be covered under the RTI Act if they are substantially financed by the appropriate Government or if they perform a public function or duty.Private deemed universities can be considered as public authorities under the RTI Act, as they are established by a notification issued by the Central Government on the advice of UGC and they receive substantial funds from the Government in various forms. However, this may not apply to all private universities, especially those that are not deemed universities or do not receive any Government funding. Therefore, you may have to check whether Himalayan University falls under any of these categories before filing an RTI.If you decide to file an RTI for verification of your marksheet from Himalayan University, you may have to follow these steps:First, you have to find out the appropriate authority or body that can provide you with the information. It may be either the UGC or the Ministry of Education or any other competent authority that regulates or oversees the functioning of Himalayan University.Second, you have to draft an RTI application in a prescribed format and pay the requisite fee of Rs. 10/- either online or offline. You have to mention your name, address, contact details, information sought, and reason for seeking information.

You have to obtain an acknowledgement receipt and keep a copy of your application for future reference.Fourth, you have to wait for a response from the PIO within 30 days from the date of receipt of your application. If you do not receive any response or receive an unsatisfactory response, you can file an appeal with the Appellate Authority within 30 days from the expiry of the initial period or from the receipt of the response.Fifth, if you are still not satisfied with the response or do not receive any response from the Appellate Authority within 30 days, you can file a second appeal with the Central Information Commission (CIC) or the State Information Commission (SIC) within 90 days from the date on which the decision should have been made by the Appellate Authority or was actually received by you.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "To implement e-voting for Housing Society AGM Meetings",
    "answer": "According to the e-SahakaraSeva, e-voting is a facility provided by the Telangana State Cooperative Election Authority (TSCEA) to conduct online elections for cooperative societies in Telangana. The TSCEA is responsible for conducting, supervising, and controlling the elections of cooperative societies in accordance with the Telangana Mutually Aided Cooperative Societies Act, 1995 and the rules and regulations made thereunder. Therefore, it seems that e-voting is valid in RWAs under the TMACS Act 1995, subject to the approval and guidance of the TSCEA.According to the e-SahakaraSeva, e-voting will be conducted by the TSCEA or its authorized agency or third party person to monitor the process. The TSCEA will provide the necessary software, hardware, and manpower for conducting e-voting. The TSCEA will also prepare the voter list, issue voter ID cards, generate passwords, and declare the results of e-voting.According to the e-SahakaraSeva, e-voting is supposed to be free, fair, transparent, and impartial. The committee or any other person cannot influence or coerce the voters to vote according to their wish. The voters have the right to exercise their franchise independently and confidentially. The TSCEA or its authorized agency or third party person will ensure that there is no malpractice or manipulation in e-voting.According to the Model Bye-Laws, there is no mention of e-voting process in the bye-laws of cooperative housing societies under TMACS Act 1995. However, according to the Cooperative Housing Society Election Procedure, if a society wants to adopt e-voting, it has to amend its bye-laws accordingly and get approval from the Registrar of Cooperative Societies. The society also has to follow the guidelines and instructions issued by the TSCEA or any other competent authority for conducting e-voting.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "To implement e-voting for Housing Society AGM Meetings",
    "answer": "1. eVoting is legal in housing societies all across India. It is legal in all the states in India without exception.Anything is legal or illegal by basis of what is written in black and white and not on the basis of anybody’s interpretation2. E-voting is the process of election which will be decided before the notification of election.3. There is no Bye-law in the Model Bye-laws which provide for the appointment of the Election Committee for conducting elections and voting.  However, to ensure a free and fair election, general practice is followed of appointing an Election Committee in the Annual General Body meeting of the association from and amongst the members present in the meeting.  The Election Committee so appointed should aspire the confidence of the members of the association with respect to their integrity, knowledge about elections and Bye-laws of the association, neutrality towards candidates and uprightness.  The Election Committee appointed by the Board of Management independently will not aspire to be an independent committee, thereby jeopardizing from facing tenet of election i.e. free and fair election.4. Society bylaws and the State Cooperative Act are the two relevant documents for the same. Most society adopt the bylaws based on model bylaws provided in State Cooperative Act. Most of these bylaws just mention that voting should happen. Nowhere it mentions that voting should be online or offline or booth based or remote.The fact is, as technology was not advanced when these laws were written, the Act might specifically not mention about online voting. However, that does not exclude online voting.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

The notice shall also specify the mode of voting, whether by show of hands or by ballot or by electronic means.According to the Important information related to Society AGM Meeting Rules, every active member of the society and in his absence, his associate member shall have one vote only at the AGM meeting. In case of equality of votes, the chairman of the meeting shall have a casting vote. The quorum for every AGM meeting shall be 2/3rd of the total number of members of the society or 20, whichever is less. If there is no quorum, the meeting shall be adjourned to a later hour on the same day and at the same place.According to the Services - Telangana, if a society wants to adopt e-voting for AGM meeting, it has to amend its bye-laws accordingly and get approval from the Registrar of Cooperative Societies.

    "answer": "Dear ClientValidity of E-Voting under TMACS Act 1995:The validity of e-voting in an apartment registered under the TMACS Act 1995 would depend on the rules and regulations framed by the cooperative society and whether they allow for electronic voting.It's essential to review the cooperative society's by-laws and any amendments made to determine if e-voting is permitted.Conducting E-Voting:If e-voting is allowed by the cooperative society's by-laws, the specific procedures for conducting e-voting should also be outlined in the by-laws or determined through a resolution passed during the Annual General Meeting (AGM).In many cases, the society's managing committee may be responsible for organizing and overseeing the e-voting process.The committee may choose to appoint a third-party agency to facilitate and monitor the e-voting process to ensure fairness and transparency.Preventing Influence on Voting:To prevent any undue influence on the voting process, it is essential that the e-voting process is conducted impartially and in accordance with the cooperative society's rules.The committee should not exert pressure on owners to vote in a particular manner, as this could be considered a violation of cooperative society laws.By-Laws and E-Voting:If your cooperative society's by-laws do not mention the process for conducting e-voting for AGM decisions, you may need to consider amending the by-laws to include provisions related to e-voting.Consult with a legal expert or the cooperative society registrar's office in your jurisdiction for guidance on amending the by-laws and ensuring compliance with the TMACS Act 1995.In summary, the specific procedures for conducting e-voting in your cooperative society under the TMACS Act 1995 would depend on the society's by-laws, any amendments made, and the regulations in place.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Three years may seem like a long time, but it's not uncommon for civil cases to take several years to reach a conclusion.Evidence: It's positive that you've submitted CCTV footage as evidence. In civil cases, evidence plays a crucial role, and the court will review the evidence before making a decision. The court may need time to thoroughly examine all the evidence presented.Legal Representation: Ensure that you have legal representation for your case. Having an experienced lawyer can make a significant difference in the progress and outcome of your case. Your lawyer can also provide guidance on the next steps to take.Settlement: You may want to explore the possibility of a settlement with the other party, if you haven't already. Sometimes, parties can reach an agreement outside of court to resolve the matter more quickly and with less expense.Court Updates: Regularly check the status of your case with your lawyer and inquire about the reasons for any delays. They should be able to provide insights into the specific circumstances surrounding your case.Escalation: If you believe there are undue delays or irregularities in the handling of your case, you can consider seeking legal remedies to expedite the process. Your lawyer can advise you on the appropriate legal steps to take in such situations.Political Affiliation: It's essential to focus on the legal aspects of the case rather than the political affiliations of the involved parties.

You may have to hire a lawyer for this purpose and pay the applicable fees.As for filing an RTI for verification of your marksheet, it may not be possible or easy to do so, as private universities are not directly covered under the RTI Act. According to the RTI Act, only those public authorities that are established or constituted by or under the Constitution, by any other law made by Parliament, by any other law made by State Legislature, by notification issued or order made by the appropriate Government are obliged to provide information under the RTI Act. However, some private entities can also be covered under the RTI Act if they are substantially financed by the appropriate Government or if they perform a public function or duty.Private deemed universities can be considered as public authorities under the RTI Act, as they are established by a notification issued by the Central Government on the advice of UGC and they receive substantial funds from the Government in various forms. However, this may not apply to all private universities, especially those that are not deemed universities or do not receive any Government funding. Therefore, you may have to check whether Himalayan University falls under any of these categories before filing an RTI.If you decide to file an RTI for verification of your marksheet from Himalayan University, you may have to follow these steps:First, you have to find out the appropriate authority or body that can provide you with the information.

If you do not receive any response or receive an unsatisfactory response, you can file an appeal with the Appellate Authority within 30 days from the expiry of the initial period or from the receipt of the response.Fifth, if you are still not satisfied with the response or do not receive any response from the Appellate Authority within 30 days, you can file a second appeal with the Central Information Commission (CIC) or the State Information Commission (SIC) within 90 days from the date on which the decision should have been made by the Appellate Authority or was actually received by you.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Celebrating child birthday",
    "answer": "Celebrating your child’s birthday in school is a common and acceptable practice, as long as you follow the rules and regulations of the school and obtain the prior permission of the principal or the teacher. You may need to inform the school about the date, time, duration, and number of guests for the celebration. You may also need to ensure that the celebration does not disturb the academic activities or discipline of the school. You may also need to arrange for the cake, snacks, drinks, decorations, gifts, etc., for the celebration.However, since you are involved in a legal dispute with your wife over the custody and maintenance of your child, you may face some difficulties or challenges in celebrating your child’s birthday in school. Some of them are:Your wife may object to your presence or participation in the celebration and may try to prevent you from meeting or interacting with your child. She may also accuse you of violating her rights or harassing her or your child.Your child may be confused or upset by seeing you and your wife in conflict and may not enjoy the celebration. He or she may also feel pressured or guilty to choose between you and your wife.The school authorities may be reluctant or hesitant to allow you to celebrate your child’s birthday in school, as they may not want to get involved in your personal or legal matters. They may also fear any trouble or disturbance that may arise from your visit.To answer your specific questions:How should i approach school that i want to celebrate my child birthday in recess and what could be the legal implications of it?You should approach the school in a polite and respectful manner and request them to grant you permission to celebrate your child’s birthday in recess. You should explain to them your situation and your intention to make your child happy and show him your love and care. You should also assure them that you will not cause any trouble or inconvenience to the school or anyone else. You should also provide them with all the details and documents that they may require for verification or approval.The legal implications of celebrating your child’s birthday in school may depend on various factors, such as the status of your case, the orders of the court, the consent of your wife, etc. Generally, there is no legal prohibition on celebrating your child’s birthday in school, as long as you do not violate any law or court order or infringe on anyone’s rights. However, if your wife objects to your visit or files a complaint against you, you may have to face some legal consequences, such as contempt of court, criminal charges, etc.Since today is 10-September , Should i go and request court that i want to meet my child on school birthday in school?It may be advisable to go and request the court that you want to meet your child on his birthday in school, as this may help you avoid any legal complications or conflicts with your wife. The court may grant you permission to meet your child on his birthday in school, subject to certain conditions and restrictions. The court may also order your wife to cooperate with you and not interfere with your visit. The court may also consider your request as a positive sign of your interest and involvement in your child’s welfare.My wife also teaches in same school and also giving montlhy 7k for last 1 year even without court order as responisibilityThis information may not have much relevance or impact on your request to celebrate your child’s birthday in school. However, it may show that your wife is financially capable and willing to support your child’s education and maintenance. It may also show that she has a close relationship with your child and his school.Pls help if go directly to meet my son in school would it have adverse affect as father is natural guardian or should i approach court first … since time is short need your expert advice and only want to meet my son thats it for few hoursIt may not be wise to go directly to meet your son in school without informing or obtaining permission from the court or the school or your wife. This may have an adverse effect on your case and your relationship with your son. It may also create problems for the school and other people involved. It may also expose you to legal risks and liabilities.Therefore, I would suggest that you approach the court first and seek its approval for meeting your son on his birthday in school. You can also consult a lawyer who specializes in family law and seek his or her guidance on how to handle this situation.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear ClientCelebrating Your Child's Birthday in School:You can approach the school to request permission to celebrate your child's birthday during the school recess. It is typically a common practice for parents to celebrate their children's birthdays in school. However, given the circumstances, it's essential to ensure that both you and your wife are on the same page regarding the celebration.There should not be any significant legal implications for celebrating your child's birthday at school as long as it is done in a non-disruptive and respectful manner.Requesting Court Access for the Birthday:Since the birthday is approaching on September 21st, it may be challenging to obtain a court order in such a short time frame. Courts may require time to process your request and schedule a hearing.If you believe it's essential to have access to your child on their birthday, you can consult with a family law attorney immediately to explore your options. They can advise you on whether an emergency hearing is feasible or if there are other steps you can take to secure your visitation rights.Meeting Your Son in School:Given that your wife teaches in the same school and you have been providing financial support, it may be reasonable to approach the school directly to discuss your desire to meet your child on his birthday. However, you should do this with utmost respect for the school's policies and your wife's position.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The second option would be to serve the party a legal notice seeking visitation right of the child and give her one day only to wither assent in writing. if no reponse, file the case above mentioned.when litigations are going between the parents, schools are usually reluctant to allow it in case if your will approach them directly. so my advise would be the abovementioned recourse.Yuganshu SharmaAdvocate, Delhi437 Answers1 ConsultationTalk to Advocate Yuganshu Sharma"

The TSCEA is responsible for conducting, supervising, and controlling the elections of cooperative societies in accordance with the Telangana Mutually Aided Cooperative Societies Act, 1995 and the rules and regulations made thereunder.

    "question": "To implement e-voting for Housing Society AGM Meetings",
    "answer": "1. eVoting is legal in housing societies all across India. It is legal in all the states in India without exception.Anything is legal or illegal by basis of what is written in black and white and not on the basis of anybody’s interpretation2. E-voting is the process of election which will be decided before the notification of election.3. There is no Bye-law in the Model Bye-laws which provide for the appointment of the Election Committee for conducting elections and voting.  However, to ensure a free and fair election, general practice is followed of appointing an Election Committee in the Annual General Body meeting of the association from and amongst the members present in the meeting.  The Election Committee so appointed should aspire the confidence of the members of the association with respect to their integrity, knowledge about elections and Bye-laws of the association, neutrality towards candidates and uprightness.  The Election Committee appointed by the Board of Management independently will not aspire to be an independent committee, thereby jeopardizing from facing tenet of election i.e. free and fair election.4. Society bylaws and the State Cooperative Act are the two relevant documents for the same. Most society adopt the bylaws based on model bylaws provided in State Cooperative Act. Most of these bylaws just mention that voting should happen. Nowhere it mentions that voting should be online or offline or booth based or remote.The fact is, as technology was not advanced when these laws were written, the Act might specifically not mention about online voting. However, that does not exclude online voting.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Dear ClientValidity of E-Voting under TMACS Act 1995:The validity of e-voting in an apartment registered under the TMACS Act 1995 would depend on the rules and regulations framed by the cooperative society and whether they allow for electronic voting.It's essential to review the cooperative society's by-laws and any amendments made to determine if e-voting is permitted.Conducting E-Voting:If e-voting is allowed by the cooperative society's by-laws, the specific procedures for conducting e-voting should also be outlined in the by-laws or determined through a resolution passed during the Annual General Meeting (AGM).In many cases, the society's managing committee may be responsible for organizing and overseeing the e-voting process.The committee may choose to appoint a third-party agency to facilitate and monitor the e-voting process to ensure fairness and transparency.Preventing Influence on Voting:To prevent any undue influence on the voting process, it is essential that the e-voting process is conducted impartially and in accordance with the cooperative society's rules.The committee should not exert pressure on owners to vote in a particular manner, as this could be considered a violation of cooperative society laws.By-Laws and E-Voting:If your cooperative society's by-laws do not mention the process for conducting e-voting for AGM decisions, you may need to consider amending the by-laws to include provisions related to e-voting.Consult with a legal expert or the cooperative society registrar's office in your jurisdiction for guidance on amending the by-laws and ensuring compliance with the TMACS Act 1995.In summary, the specific procedures for conducting e-voting in your cooperative society under the TMACS Act 1995 would depend on the society's by-laws, any amendments made, and the regulations in place.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "To implement e-voting for Housing Society AGM Meetings",
    "answer": "1. eVoting is legal in housing societies all across India. It is legal in all the states in India without exception.Anything is legal or illegal by basis of what is written in black and white and not on the basis of anybody’s interpretation2. E-voting is the process of election which will be decided before the notification of election.3. There is no Bye-law in the Model Bye-laws which provide for the appointment of the Election Committee for conducting elections and voting.  However, to ensure a free and fair election, general practice is followed of appointing an Election Committee in the Annual General Body meeting of the association from and amongst the members present in the meeting.  The Election Committee so appointed should aspire the confidence of the members of the association with respect to their integrity, knowledge about elections and Bye-laws of the association, neutrality towards candidates and uprightness.  The Election Committee appointed by the Board of Management independently will not aspire to be an independent committee, thereby jeopardizing from facing tenet of election i.e. free and fair election.4. Society bylaws and the State Cooperative Act are the two relevant documents for the same. Most society adopt the bylaws based on model bylaws provided in State Cooperative Act. Most of these bylaws just mention that voting should happen. Nowhere it mentions that voting should be online or offline or booth based or remote.The fact is, as technology was not advanced when these laws were written, the Act might specifically not mention about online voting. However, that does not exclude online voting.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "To implement e-voting for Housing Society AGM Meetings",
    "answer": "I understand that your question is not about election voting, but about voting in AGM meeting for choosing maintenance model. Based on the web search results, I can provide you some information about the process and rules of voting in AGM meeting for cooperative societies in Telangana.According to the Society Model Bye Law No 96 to 109 - Special General Body Meeting, the committee shall decide the date, time and place of AGM meeting of the society and the business to be transacted thereat. The committee shall also issue a notice of the meeting to all the members at least 14 days before the date of the meeting, along with the agenda and the explanatory statement. The notice shall also specify the mode of voting, whether by show of hands or by ballot or by electronic means.According to the Important information related to Society AGM Meeting Rules, every active member of the society and in his absence, his associate member shall have one vote only at the AGM meeting. In case of equality of votes, the chairman of the meeting shall have a casting vote. The quorum for every AGM meeting shall be 2/3rd of the total number of members of the society or 20, whichever is less. If there is no quorum, the meeting shall be adjourned to a later hour on the same day and at the same place.According to the Services - Telangana, if a society wants to adopt e-voting for AGM meeting, it has to amend its bye-laws accordingly and get approval from the Registrar of Cooperative Societies. The society also has to follow the guidelines and instructions issued by the TSCEA or any other competent authority for conducting e-voting. E-voting will be conducted by the TSCEA or its authorized agency or third party person to monitor the process. The TSCEA will provide the necessary software, hardware, and manpower for conducting e-voting. The TSCEA will also prepare the voter list, issue voter ID cards, generate passwords, and declare the results of e-voting.Therefore, based on the information available, it seems that voting in AGM meeting for choosing maintenance model can be conducted by either show of hands or ballot or electronic means, depending on the preference and approval of the society and its members. If e-voting is adopted, then it will be conducted by TSCEA or its authorized agency or third party person. The committee or any other person cannot influence or coerce the voters to vote according to their wish. The voters have the right to exercise their franchise independently and confidentially. I hope this helps you to understand how voting works for AGM meeting for cooperative societies in Telangana.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear ClientValidity of E-Voting under TMACS Act 1995:The validity of e-voting in an apartment registered under the TMACS Act 1995 would depend on the rules and regulations framed by the cooperative society and whether they allow for electronic voting.It's essential to review the cooperative society's by-laws and any amendments made to determine if e-voting is permitted.Conducting E-Voting:If e-voting is allowed by the cooperative society's by-laws, the specific procedures for conducting e-voting should also be outlined in the by-laws or determined through a resolution passed during the Annual General Meeting (AGM).In many cases, the society's managing committee may be responsible for organizing and overseeing the e-voting process.The committee may choose to appoint a third-party agency to facilitate and monitor the e-voting process to ensure fairness and transparency.Preventing Influence on Voting:To prevent any undue influence on the voting process, it is essential that the e-voting process is conducted impartially and in accordance with the cooperative society's rules.The committee should not exert pressure on owners to vote in a particular manner, as this could be considered a violation of cooperative society laws.By-Laws and E-Voting:If your cooperative society's by-laws do not mention the process for conducting e-voting for AGM decisions, you may need to consider amending the by-laws to include provisions related to e-voting.Consult with a legal expert or the cooperative society registrar's office in your jurisdiction for guidance on amending the by-laws and ensuring compliance with the TMACS Act 1995.In summary, the specific procedures for conducting e-voting in your cooperative society under the TMACS Act 1995 would depend on the society's by-laws, any amendments made, and the regulations in place.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "There are some ways to check the authenticity of your marksheet, such as:You can visit the official website of Himalayan University and log in with your student ID and password to access your student portal. There you can view and download your marksheet and other academic records.You can contact the Himalayan University directly by phone, email, or post and request them to verify your marksheet. You may have to provide them with your name, roll number, course name, year of passing, and a copy of your marksheet.You can send a legal notice to the Himalayan University demanding the verification of your marksheet and the issuance of a certificate of authenticity. You may have to hire a lawyer for this purpose and pay the applicable fees.As for filing an RTI for verification of your marksheet, it may not be possible or easy to do so, as private universities are not directly covered under the RTI Act. According to the RTI Act, only those public authorities that are established or constituted by or under the Constitution, by any other law made by Parliament, by any other law made by State Legislature, by notification issued or order made by the appropriate Government are obliged to provide information under the RTI Act. However, some private entities can also be covered under the RTI Act if they are substantially financed by the appropriate Government or if they perform a public function or duty.Private deemed universities can be considered as public authorities under the RTI Act, as they are established by a notification issued by the Central Government on the advice of UGC and they receive substantial funds from the Government in various forms. However, this may not apply to all private universities, especially those that are not deemed universities or do not receive any Government funding. Therefore, you may have to check whether Himalayan University falls under any of these categories before filing an RTI.If you decide to file an RTI for verification of your marksheet from Himalayan University, you may have to follow these steps:First, you have to find out the appropriate authority or body that can provide you with the information. It may be either the UGC or the Ministry of Education or any other competent authority that regulates or oversees the functioning of Himalayan University.Second, you have to draft an RTI application in a prescribed format and pay the requisite fee of Rs. 10/- either online or offline.

You have to obtain an acknowledgement receipt and keep a copy of your application for future reference.Fourth, you have to wait for a response from the PIO within 30 days from the date of receipt of your application. If you do not receive any response or receive an unsatisfactory response, you can file an appeal with the Appellate Authority within 30 days from the expiry of the initial period or from the receipt of the response.Fifth, if you are still not satisfied with the response or do not receive any response from the Appellate Authority within 30 days, you can file a second appeal with the Central Information Commission (CIC) or the State Information Commission (SIC) within 90 days from the date on which the decision should have been made by the Appellate Authority or was actually received by you.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "To implement e-voting for Housing Society AGM Meetings",
    "answer": "1. eVoting is legal in housing societies all across India. It is legal in all the states in India without exception.Anything is legal or illegal by basis of what is written in black and white and not on the basis of anybody’s interpretation2. E-voting is the process of election which will be decided before the notification of election.3. There is no Bye-law in the Model Bye-laws which provide for the appointment of the Election Committee for conducting elections and voting.  However, to ensure a free and fair election, general practice is followed of appointing an Election Committee in the Annual General Body meeting of the association from and amongst the members present in the meeting.  The Election Committee so appointed should aspire the confidence of the members of the association with respect to their integrity, knowledge about elections and Bye-laws of the association, neutrality towards candidates and uprightness.  The Election Committee appointed by the Board of Management independently will not aspire to be an independent committee, thereby jeopardizing from facing tenet of election i.e. free and fair election.4. Society bylaws and the State Cooperative Act are the two relevant documents for the same. Most society adopt the bylaws based on model bylaws provided in State Cooperative Act. Most of these bylaws just mention that voting should happen. Nowhere it mentions that voting should be online or offline or booth based or remote.The fact is, as technology was not advanced when these laws were written, the Act might specifically not mention about online voting. However, that does not exclude online voting.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "To implement e-voting for Housing Society AGM Meetings",
    "answer": "I understand that your question is not about election voting, but about voting in AGM meeting for choosing maintenance model. Based on the web search results, I can provide you some information about the process and rules of voting in AGM meeting for cooperative societies in Telangana.According to the Society Model Bye Law No 96 to 109 - Special General Body Meeting, the committee shall decide the date, time and place of AGM meeting of the society and the business to be transacted thereat. The committee shall also issue a notice of the meeting to all the members at least 14 days before the date of the meeting, along with the agenda and the explanatory statement. The notice shall also specify the mode of voting, whether by show of hands or by ballot or by electronic means.According to the Important information related to Society AGM Meeting Rules, every active member of the society and in his absence, his associate member shall have one vote only at the AGM meeting. In case of equality of votes, the chairman of the meeting shall have a casting vote. The quorum for every AGM meeting shall be 2/3rd of the total number of members of the society or 20, whichever is less. If there is no quorum, the meeting shall be adjourned to a later hour on the same day and at the same place.According to the Services - Telangana, if a society wants to adopt e-voting for AGM meeting, it has to amend its bye-laws accordingly and get approval from the Registrar of Cooperative Societies. The society also has to follow the guidelines and instructions issued by the TSCEA or any other competent authority for conducting e-voting. E-voting will be conducted by the TSCEA or its authorized agency or third party person to monitor the process. The TSCEA will provide the necessary software, hardware, and manpower for conducting e-voting. The TSCEA will also prepare the voter list, issue voter ID cards, generate passwords, and declare the results of e-voting.Therefore, based on the information available, it seems that voting in AGM meeting for choosing maintenance model can be conducted by either show of hands or ballot or electronic means, depending on the preference and approval of the society and its members. If e-voting is adopted, then it will be conducted by TSCEA or its authorized agency or third party person. The committee or any other person cannot influence or coerce the voters to vote according to their wish. The voters have the right to exercise their franchise independently and confidentially. I hope this helps you to understand how voting works for AGM meeting for cooperative societies in Telangana.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear ClientValidity of E-Voting under TMACS Act 1995:The validity of e-voting in an apartment registered under the TMACS Act 1995 would depend on the rules and regulations framed by the cooperative society and whether they allow for electronic voting.It's essential to review the cooperative society's by-laws and any amendments made to determine if e-voting is permitted.Conducting E-Voting:If e-voting is allowed by the cooperative society's by-laws, the specific procedures for conducting e-voting should also be outlined in the by-laws or determined through a resolution passed during the Annual General Meeting (AGM).In many cases, the society's managing committee may be responsible for organizing and overseeing the e-voting process.The committee may choose to appoint a third-party agency to facilitate and monitor the e-voting process to ensure fairness and transparency.Preventing Influence on Voting:To prevent any undue influence on the voting process, it is essential that the e-voting process is conducted impartially and in accordance with the cooperative society's rules.The committee should not exert pressure on owners to vote in a particular manner, as this could be considered a violation of cooperative society laws.By-Laws and E-Voting:If your cooperative society's by-laws do not mention the process for conducting e-voting for AGM decisions, you may need to consider amending the by-laws to include provisions related to e-voting.Consult with a legal expert or the cooperative society registrar's office in your jurisdiction for guidance on amending the by-laws and ensuring compliance with the TMACS Act 1995.In summary, the specific procedures for conducting e-voting in your cooperative society under the TMACS Act 1995 would depend on the society's by-laws, any amendments made, and the regulations in place.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Wait till land is registered in your father and uncles name2)Section 171 of the Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms, 1950 Act clearly lays down that in case a male tenure holder dies then his son or his male descendants will come to inherit his rights in the holding of land. His own daughter and son’s daughter and the descendants of daughters have been excluded for this purpose3)A married daughter has been completely excluded. If no male descendant is there, the rights of the deceased would come to be inherited even by his brothers or other male relatives but not by his own daughter. In categorical terms, the Act has preferred the brother of a deceased to a married daughter of the deceased for inheritance in tenure holding. Thus, even in a nuclear family where there is no male survivor, the married daughter cannot inherit the rights, rather her uncle has been found by our legislature in its wisdom, to be a suitable heir to inherit the tenure holding.Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

In case the property inherited (not purchased) by your great - grandfather before 1956 its an ancestral/co - parcenary property then you can claim right in that property at this time itself while he is passing property neglecting you to your father and his brothers, what he cannot do with all property.2. In case it is purchased by your great grand - father anytime irrespective of year or inherited after 1956 it is his own property, he can deal with it in any manner he likes and you cannot raise any objection.3. Now in case its an ancestral property in hands of your great grand - father and registered in name of your father and his brother while your great grand - father is alive the nature of property will change to individual property of your fathers wherein you cannot claim any right and they can will it to anyone neglecting you.Registration by your great - grand father can be challenged till three years from the date registration came to your knowledge.So you can choose your right time accordingly.ThanksJagvir Singh SoroutAdvocate, Hodal, Haryana11 AnswersTalk to Advocate Jagvir Singh Sorout"

    "question": "Daughter's right",
    "answer": "Dear Client1. Registration of Land in the Names of Father and His Brothers:In India, agricultural land can typically be registered jointly in the names of family members, including brothers, if they are the legal heirs and co-owners of the property. However, the specific laws governing land registration may vary by state, so it's essential to follow the local land registration procedures and requirements in Uttar Pradesh.2. Passing on Property as per Will:If your father and his brothers become the legal owners of the land, they have the right to make a will specifying how they want to distribute the property after their demise. They can choose to pass on the property as per their individual wills, subject to the legal requirements for wills in India.3. Rights in the Property If Excluded from the Will:If your father and his brothers make wills that exclude you from inheriting the property, you may not have a direct right to the property specified in those wills. However, under theHindu Succession Act, daughters have equal rights to ancestral property as sons. If the property is ancestral and you are being denied your rightful share, you may have legal recourse to challenge the wills and claim your share in the property.Regarding the timing of your potential legal action:4. Timing for Legal Action:It is generally advisable to address property disputes as early as possible. If you believe that your rights to the property may be compromised, it may be best to consult with a lawyer and take legal action before the property is registered in your father and his brothers' names. This can help protect your interests and potentially avoid complications in the future.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Conditional gift deed, revoked if filed for divorce. Can this be legal",
    "answer": "Giftis a transfer of property where interest is transferred from one living person to another, without any consideration. It is a gratuitous and inter vivos in nature. Gift Deed is a legally binding written document defined in Section 122 of theTransfer of Property Act, 1822, through which the donor can transfer an existing movable or immovable property to the donee voluntarily. A Gift Deed is valid only if it is given out of love and affection, without any consideration in return by one family member/ friend to another.A gift once made and registered with due process of law cannot be revoked. After the acceptance, it becomes the property of the donee. The donor cannot independently revoke the deed. Also, in a deed where the parties have agreed that the deed shall be revocable in part or whole, by the mere will of the donor, is not a valid Gift Deed.However, under Section 126 of theTransfer of Property Act, 1882 there are certain grounds when gifts can be revoked. The revocation in itself incorporates the cancellation of the Gift Deed and the possession of the property is returned to the donor. The grounds are –If there is an agreement between the donor and donee, that if certain specified events happen or do not happen, the gift shall be revoked. The point to note here is that the occurrence of such an event should not be controlled by the donor. And both parties must have agreed to such a condition in terms of the Gift Deed.The conditions stipulated should not be immoral, illegal or reprehensible to the property.In case of Thakur Raghunathjee Maharaj v. Ramesh Chandra, Hon’ble Supreme Court state that“even though a condition is not laid down in the Gift Deed itself, and has been provided under a mutual agreement separately but forms part of the transaction of the gift, the condition would be valid and enforceable”.Another instance, when a gift can be revoked is, if they violate Section 19 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 which says“Where consent to an agreement is caused by coercion, undue influence, fraud or misrepresentation, the agreement is a contract voidable at the option of the party whose consent was so obtained”.So if the gift was made by obtaining consent on the above grounds it can be revoked. And in case, the donor dies, his heirs have the right to file for revocation of the deed.It is most important is that ;If the donee doesn’t accept the gift, the donor cannot force the recipient to accept the same. The deed shall stand invalid unless the donee records the acceptance.A donor can impose conditions that allow them to retain certain rights over the property, such as a life interest..According to thetransfer of property Act1882,a gift Deed is valid only if registered.But the same time aFree Consent(Both the donor and the donee must give their free and voluntary consent to the terms and conditions of the gift deed ) is important if it is conditional .Ajay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

    "answer": "A valid conditional gift deed is:The donee can have a choice to oblige to the condition or not.The donor cannot state any extreme or immoral conditions against the law. It should not be immoral, harmful, criminal, or vengeful.Any kind of condition that might be like a punishment for the donee is not enforceable by law.All the four conditions what you have proposed to incorporate in the gift deed is not lawful hence the gift deed will not be legally valid.The conditions what you have mentioned appears like compensation.A gift deed would be invalidif it included any compensation for the gift.A conditional gift with no recital of acceptance and no evidence in proof of acceptance, where possession remains with the donor as long as he is alive, does not become complete during lifetime of the donor.When a gift is incomplete and title remains with the donor the deed of gift might be cancelled.To understand what constitutes as a Gift, the Supreme Court in the case ofNaramadaben Maganlal Thakker v. Pranivandas Maganlal Thakker and others, held “Gift means to transfer certain existing moveable or immoveable property voluntarily and without consideration by one person called the donor to another called the donee.section 122 of theTransfer of Property Act, 1882 also defines the same that gift is without consideration.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Dear ClientIn a civil case, if multiple defendants have been named, and some of them have not appeared or filed a written statement, the court may proceed in the following manner:Framing of Issues: In a civil case, issues are framed based on the pleadings of the parties. Pleadings include the plaintiff's complaint and the written statements of the defendants. If some defendants have not filed a written statement, the court may still frame issues based on the pleadings of the parties who have submitted their written statements.Ex Parte Proceedings: For defendants who have not appeared or filed a written statement, the court may proceed with ex parte proceedings. This means that the court may decide the case in the absence of these defendants. However, the court must follow due process and ensure that the absent defendants are properly served with notice of the proceedings.Evidence: The court may consider the evidence presented by the parties who are present and have filed written statements. The court will evaluate the evidence on record to make its decision.Judgment: Based on the pleadings and evidence, the court will deliver a judgment. This judgment will be based on the merits of the case as presented by the parties who are actively participating.Consequences for Absent Defendants: If the absent defendants are found to be liable, the court may pass a judgment against them in their absence. However, they may have the option to apply for setting aside the ex parte judgment if they can show sufficient cause for their non-appearance.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. My team is dealing with various such cases. You have the right to get back the property. Legal action can only be taken when already legal notice through Advocate has been served upon the entity or person you wish to bring to court. It is only this method that legalizes producing a matter to court. The intimation given is known as 'legal notice.' A legal notice is, hence, formal notification to a person or an entity, notifying the other party of your purpose to commence legal proceedings against them. Legal notice can serve as a target of negotiations among the parties and save time, effort, and money spent in court cases.This makes the party aware of your complaint. Many times, a legal notice served will bring the other party on heels, and the difficulty can get resolved out of court, too, with fruitful arguments on both sides. If the opposite party is still not heeding to the grievance, one can always start the court procedures after a particular interval, as pronounced by the law.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete documents.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, Delhi418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma"

Three years may seem like a long time, but it's not uncommon for civil cases to take several years to reach a conclusion.Evidence: It's positive that you've submitted CCTV footage as evidence. In civil cases, evidence plays a crucial role, and the court will review the evidence before making a decision. The court may need time to thoroughly examine all the evidence presented.Legal Representation: Ensure that you have legal representation for your case. Having an experienced lawyer can make a significant difference in the progress and outcome of your case. Your lawyer can also provide guidance on the next steps to take.Settlement: You may want to explore the possibility of a settlement with the other party, if you haven't already. Sometimes, parties can reach an agreement outside of court to resolve the matter more quickly and with less expense.Court Updates: Regularly check the status of your case with your lawyer and inquire about the reasons for any delays. They should be able to provide insights into the specific circumstances surrounding your case.Escalation: If you believe there are undue delays or irregularities in the handling of your case, you can consider seeking legal remedies to expedite the process. Your lawyer can advise you on the appropriate legal steps to take in such situations.Political Affiliation: It's essential to focus on the legal aspects of the case rather than the political affiliations of the involved parties. Legal matters should be resolved impartially, and your lawyer will work to ensure that the law is upheld.In summary, civil cases in India can take time to reach a resolution, and it's essential to have patience and continue working closely with your legal counsel.

    "question": "Anticipatory Bail application u/s 438 CrPC & Relaxing Conditions application u/s 439(1)(b) CrPC",
    "answer": "Anticipatory Bail or Pre-arrest Bail: It is a legal provision that allows an accused person to apply for bail before being arrested. In India, pre-arrest bail is granted undersection 438 of theCode of Criminal Procedure, 1973. It is issued only by the Sessions Court and High Court.The AB is granted under section 438 after which the accused has to file an application for regular bail under section 439.While the court which grants bail under Section 439 of theCode of Criminal Procedure1973 can impose conditions which ensure the presence of the accused to face trial,While exercising power Under Section 438 of the Code, the Court is duty bound to strike a balance between the individual's right to personal freedom and the right of investigation of the police. For the same, while granting relief under Section 438(1), appropriate conditions can be imposed Under Section 438(2) so as to ensure an uninterrupted investigation. The object of putting such conditions should be to avoid the possibility of the person hampering the investigation.Section 439 of theCode of Criminal Procedure, 1973 grants significant discretionary powers to the High Court and the Court of Session to grant or deny bail in certain circumstances and also allows them to modify or set aside bail conditions imposed by a Magistrate. One has to file an application under Section 439(1)(b) CrPC before the concerned Court of Session or High Court to be allowed relaxation of bail conditions.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "- As per criminal law, Regular bail is granted after an arrest has been made, while anticipatory bail is granted before an arrest is made.- Further, as per Supreme Court in the matter of Sushila Aggarwal versus. NCT of Delhi  there is no provision of time restriction in the applicability of an anticipatory bail, granted under Section 438 of theCode of Criminal Procedure(Cr. P.C), 1973.- Hence, after getting the anticipatory bail , it is not mandatory to take regular bail from the court , and the accused will be considered as on bail for whole trial of the case.- Further, under Section 439(1) (b), the High Court or the Court of Sessions can set aside or modify any condition imposed by a magistrate when releasing an accused on bail- So, the Session court is rightly allowed his application u/s 439(1)(b) , as this application is maintainable even after getting the anticipatory bail as well.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

As far as cases decided by Hon'ble High Court are concerned, it has wide appellate powers as well as inherent powers under section 482 Cr.P.C.

    "question": "Anticipatory Bail application u/s 438 CrPC & Relaxing Conditions application u/s 439(1)(b) CrPC",
    "answer": "Dear QueristMy opinion on your queries are as under:Accused got the anticipatory bail u/s 438 of CrPC with a condition: \"Everyday accused to attend Police Station at 10am\"Subsequently, by mentioning certain reasons, accused applied for the relaxation of conditions in the said anticipatory bail u/s 439(1)(b).Learned Sessions court considered the said relaxing conditions application u/s 439(1)(b) and gave the order in favour of the accused as: \"Accused to attend Police Station once a month\".Is it possible because 439 section of CrPC is for the person who is already arrested or in custody? Accused was never arrested and he was never in custody.Opinion: As per section 439Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 the High Court and Session Court has special power. After careful reading of the section it is very much clear. The section 439 crpc is reproduced herein for ready reference:I'm planning to challenge the application u/s 439(1)(b) as I believe its illegal. I might be incorrect, kindly advise.Special powers of High Court or Court of Session regarding bail.(1) A High Court or Court of Session may direct-(a) that any person accused of an offence and in custody be released on bail, and if the offence is of the nature specified in subsection (3) of section 437, may impose any condition which it considers necessary for the purposes mentioned in that sub- section;(b) that any condition imposed by a Magistrate when releasing an person on bail be set aside or modified:When a bail was granted under section 438 Cr.P.C. then section 439 (1)(b) of Crpc shall not apply as this clause of sub section 1 is related to only the modification of conditions imposed by the Magistrate and not otherwise. Only the High Court may modify the conditions imposed in the bail order under section 482 Cr.P.C. and not under section 439(1)(b) of Cr.P.C.You may challenge the same by filing Criminal Misc. Petition before Hon’ble High Court challenging the order of modification if passed under section 439 (1)(b) of Cr.P.C.Section 438 CrPC is before arrest and 439(1)(b) CrPC is after arrest. But in my case, accused was never arrested. How is that they can use this section 439(1)(b) CrPC to relax the conditions when they were never arrested?Opinion: In anticipatory bail, the Police arrested the accused and then released him/her and investigate the matter and for the interogation arresting is required, so the person arrested after the anticipatory bail shall be cover by this section but the modification is related to order of the magistrate and not session court or high court passed in anticipatory bail u/s 438 crpc.\"If the accused is able to satisfy the court that he has followed all the bail conditions and cooperated with the police or investigating authorities then the court may modify or relax the bail conditions\" -- Agree with this but the section 439(1)(b) CrPC under which they applied for relaxing the conditions is not applicable I assume because 439(1)(b) CrPC is after arrest.Opinion; As above.Shouldn't they be applying for regular bail under 439 first and once they get the regular bail, they can use 439(1)(b) to relax the conditions? Here, they directly jumped from 438 CrPC of anticipatory bail to 439(1)(b) of regular bail for relaxing the conditions?439 regular bail application is missing by them. Am I right here?Opinion: As above. 439 (1)(b) will not be apply in this senerio.I'm reading \"Union Of India vs Mansoor Abdulla K.S on 26 July, 2022\" IN THE HIGH COURT OF KARNATAKA AT BENGALURU - https://indiankanoon.org/doc/140372397/Para 9 of the judgment says, “The respondent/accused No.3 files an application seeking anticipatory bail under Section 438 of the Cr.P.C. and the concerned Court grants him bail by the following order: Petition filed by the petitioner under Section 438 of the Cr.P.C. is hereby allowed. Bail was granted subject to the condition that the petitioner shall give attendance before the Investigating Officer once in 15 days at a particular time till filing of the charge sheet”.Para 10 of the said judgment says,” The respondent/accused No.3 files application for regular bail in Special C.C.No.271 of 2020 before the learned Sessions Judge under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. Regular bail was granted with certain set of conditions.After grant of bail on [deleted] subject to the afore-quoted conditions the respondent/accused No.3 files an application under Section 439(1)(b) of the Cr.P.C. for relaxation of bail conditions imposed on [deleted] and permit him to travel abroad for his avocation.”Question:Why the respondent/accused No.3 did not directly go from 438 CRPC to 439(1)(b)?Opinion: in some of the state in India, the procedure has been adopted for regular bail after filing of the chargesheet even after obtaining the anticipatory bail. Even the Hon’ble APex Court held in sushila case that the period of anticipatory is for whole trial and there is no requirement for filing regilar bail again before the Trial court during the trail.Why did respondent/accused No.3 took regular bail under 439 of the Cr.P.C after AB bail under 438 CRPC and then finally moved to 439(1)(b) of the Cr.P.C for relaxing the conditions?Opinion: there is no answer of “Why”, its upto the accused and his counsel.I might be missing on certain other conditions or some circumstances clause. Please correct me as I am in the learning phase.This is what I'm trying to say that \"Accused did not apply for regular bail\". Directly after 438 CrPC, Accused applied for 439(1)(b). I can confirm from the ecourts website as well.Sessions court considered the application of accused under 439(1)(b) and relaxed his conditions. There is no mentioning of regular bail or asking accused to apply for regular bail under 439 anywhere.From section 6.3.12 - https://www.advocatekhoj.com/library/lawreports/criminalprocedure/8.php\"When is a person in custody, within the meaning of Section 439 Cr.P.C.? When he is in duress either because he is held by the investigating agency or other police or allied authority or is under the control of the court having been rem&ed by judicial order, or having offered himself to the Court's jurisdiction & submitted to its orders by physical presence. No lexical dexterity nor precedential profusion is needed to come to the realistic conclusion that he who is under the control of the court or is in the physical hold of an officer with coercive power is in custody for the purpose of Section 439. This word is of elastic semantics but its core meaning is that the law has taken control of the person.The equivocatory quibbling & hide-&seek niceties sometimes heard in court that the police have taken a man into informal custody but not arrested him, have detained him for interrogation but not taken him into formal custody & other like terminological dubieties are unfair evasions of the straightforwardness of the law. We need not dilate on this shady facet here because we are satisfied that the accused did physically submit before the Session Judge & the jurisdiction to grant bail thus arose.Custody, in the context of Section 439, (we are not, be it noted, dealing with anticipatory bail under Section 438) is physical control or at least physical presence of the accused in court coupled with submission to the jurisdiction & orders of the Court.Opinion: In anticipatory bail there is a condition that “ in the event of arrest by the police the petitioner be released on bail” so at the time of arrest the accused is in custody.He can be in custody not merely when the police arrests him, produces him before a Magistrate & gets a rem& to judicial or other custody. He can be stated to be in judicial custody when he surrenders before the court & submits to its directions\"In my case, accused got anticipatory bail u/s 438 of CrPC with a condition & then condition is relaxed u/s 439(1)(b) of CrPC. Both by Sessions Court. Were they in custody ever?Opinion: yes, he was in custody and section 439(1)(b) is nowhere mentioned that the acccused should be in custody at the time of applying relaxation/modification of bail’s conditions.Section 362 of Crpc bar the court to relax/modify the conditions of the bail. Only the high court has power to modify the condition imposed under section 438 Crpc under section 482 of Cr.P.C.Feel Free to CallNadeem QureshiAdvocate, New Delhi6319 Answers302 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Nadeem Qureshi"

    "question": "Adding to a WhatsApp group without permission",
    "answer": "According to the WhatsApp group privacy settings, you can choose who can add you to groups without your consent. You can select one of the three options: “Nobody”, “My Contacts”, or “Everyone”. If you select “Nobody”, no one will be able to add you to a group except through an invitation link, which you can accept or reject. If you select “My Contacts”, only people in your contact list will be able to add you to a group without an invitation link. If you select “Everyone”, anyone can add you to a group without your consent.If someone has added you to a group without your permission, you can report the group to WhatsApp by following these steps:Open the group chat.Tap on the group subject.Scroll down and tap Report Group.Tap REPORT AND EXIT or REPORT AND BLOCK.This will send a report to WhatsApp and exit the group or block the admin.As for the legal aspect of adding someone to a WhatsApp group without their consent, there is no clear law in India that prohibits this act. However, if the group is used for spreading false or defamatory information, harassing or threatening someone, or violating someone’s privacy, then it may attract legal action under various sections of theIndian Penal Code(IPC) and the Information Technology (IT) Act.For example, if someone creates a WhatsApp group and adds women without their consent and sends them obscene messages or images, then it may amount to outraging their modesty under Section 354A of the IPC or sending sexually explicit material under Section 67A of the IT Act. Similarly, if someone creates a WhatsApp group and adds people without their consent and spreads rumours or fake news that cause public disorder or communal violence, then it may amount to creating enmity between different groups under Section 153A of the IPC or sending offensive messages under Section 66A of the IT Act.Therefore, depending on the nature and purpose of the WhatsApp group, adding someone without their consent may or may not be illegal in India. However, it is always advisable to respect the privacy and preferences of others and seek their permission before adding them to any group.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Adding to a WhatsApp group without permission",
    "answer": "Dear ClientThere were no specific Indian laws that directly addressed the act of adding someone to a WhatsApp group without their consent. However, this situation may involve several legal considerations:Privacy Concerns: Adding someone to a WhatsApp group without their consent may raise privacy concerns, especially if personal contact information is shared without permission. This could potentially be seen as an invasion of privacy, and individuals may have the right to take legal action if they believe their privacy has been violated.Cyberbullying or Harassment: If the addition to the group is part of a pattern of harassment, cyberbullying, or stalking, it may be possible to pursue legal action under the Information Technology Act, 2000, or other relevant laws.WhatsApp Policies: WhatsApp has its own policies regarding group creation and membership. Violating these policies could result in the user's account being restricted or banned. WhatsApp allows group admins to control who can join their groups, so individuals who have been added without consent can leave the group themselves.Consent: Consent is a fundamental principle in privacy and data protection. If someone's personal information, including their phone number, is being shared without their consent, it may be a breach of their privacy rights.To address this situation, individuals who have been added to the group without their consent can take the following steps:Leave the Group: WhatsApp allows users to leave groups they do not want to be part of. Simply tap on the group, go to Group Info, and choose the \"Exit Group\" option.Report to WhatsApp: Users can report the issue to WhatsApp by using the in-app reporting feature, which can be found in the group settings.Consult Legal Counsel: If the situation escalates and individuals believe their privacy has been violated or they are being harassed, they should consider consulting with a legal professional to explore potential legal actions based on existing laws related to privacy, harassment, or cyberbullying.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear ClientIn a civil case, if multiple defendants have been named, and some of them have not appeared or filed a written statement, the court may proceed in the following manner:Framing of Issues: In a civil case, issues are framed based on the pleadings of the parties. Pleadings include the plaintiff's complaint and the written statements of the defendants. If some defendants have not filed a written statement, the court may still frame issues based on the pleadings of the parties who have submitted their written statements.Ex Parte Proceedings: For defendants who have not appeared or filed a written statement, the court may proceed with ex parte proceedings. This means that the court may decide the case in the absence of these defendants. However, the court must follow due process and ensure that the absent defendants are properly served with notice of the proceedings.Evidence: The court may consider the evidence presented by the parties who are present and have filed written statements. The court will evaluate the evidence on record to make its decision.Judgment: Based on the pleadings and evidence, the court will deliver a judgment. This judgment will be based on the merits of the case as presented by the parties who are actively participating.Consequences for Absent Defendants: If the absent defendants are found to be liable, the court may pass a judgment against them in their absence.

    "question": "Cancelling an engagement",
    "answer": "Cancelling an engagement can be a difficult and emotional decision, and it may have legal consequences depending on the laws of the country where you live or where the engagement took place.I searched the web for some information on legal advice on cancelling an engagement in Turkey, and here are some of the results I found:As per legal information on family law in Turkey, there are two types of engagements: official and unofficial. An official engagement is registered at the civil registry office and requires the consent of both parties and their families. An unofficial engagement is based on a verbal or written agreement between the parties and does not have any legal status. If you cancel an official engagement, you may have to pay compensation for the expenses incurred by the other party for the wedding preparations, such as invitations, clothes, jewelry, etc. If you cancel an unofficial engagement, you may have to return the gifts that you received from the other party or their family, such as rings, money, etc. However, you are not obliged to pay any compensation for emotional damages or loss of reputation, unless there is a specific clause in your agreement that stipulates otherwise.If you cancel an engagement in India, you may face a civil suit for breach of promise to marry, which is a contractual obligation that can be enforced by the court. The other party may claim damages for the loss of marriage prospects, mental anguish, social stigma, etc. However, the court will consider various factors, such as the duration of the engagement, the reason for breaking it off, the conduct of both parties, etc., before awarding any compensation. Moreover, if you cancel an engagement after having sexual relations with the other party, you may also face a criminal charge of cheating or rape, depending on the circumstances and the consent of the parties involved.Based on these results, it seems that cancelling an engagement may have different legal implications depending on where it took place and what kind of agreement you had with your partner.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Cancelling an engagement",
    "answer": "Dear ClientEngagement Breakup: In India, engagements are not legally binding contracts. You are generally not obligated to pay compensation for emotional damages or accommodation expenses in case of a canceled engagement. However, Indian courts have sometimes awarded compensation in cases involving promises or agreements made during the engagement period, but this can vary based on the specific circumstances.Accommodation Expenses: Whether you are obligated to pay for her accommodation expenses in Turkey would depend on any prior agreements or arrangements you had. If you both agreed to share expenses during your stay in Turkey, you might be responsible for your share. However, if there was no such agreement, it may be challenging for her to legally claim compensation for accommodation.Emotional Damages: Proving emotional damages in Indian courts can be difficult. While emotional distress can be a factor in some cases, it's typically not easy to quantify or prove unless there was a specific action or event that caused severe emotional distress and can be legally proven.Financial Contributions: If you voluntarily contributed money to her during your relationship, it could be considered a gift unless there was a clear agreement or understanding that it would be repaid. Gifts, generally, cannot be legally reclaimed.Property Ownership: It's essential to understand the legal status of her property in India, such as the office building and the farmhouse. These assets may come into play if there are any financial disputes.Settlement Negotiations: It's often better to reach an amicable settlement outside of court to avoid prolonged legal battles. If you're willing to provide some financial support, you can negotiate with her to reach a mutually agreeable settlement amount that both parties find fair.Legal Advice: To get a clear understanding of your legal obligations and rights in this situation, it's strongly recommended that you consult with a qualified attorney in India. They can provide you with legal guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Resignation from Central Governement",
    "answer": "According to the Central Civil Services (Leave) Rules, 1972, a government servant who has been granted leave cannot resign from service during the period of leave, except with the permission of the President. A government servant who resigns from service shall be required to refund the amount of leave salary and allowances paid to him during the period of leave not due, which shall be calculated in the same manner as prescribed for calculation of such amount in case of dismissal or removal from service.According to the Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965, a government servant who is under suspension shall be required to obtain the permission of the authority competent to appoint him to resign his post. If a government servant submits his resignation while under suspension, the competent authority shall examine with reference to the merits of the disciplinary case pending against him whether it would be in public interest to accept the resignation. Normally, as government servants are placed under suspension only in cases of grave delinquency, it would not be correct to accept a resignation from a government servant under suspension.According to the Central Civil Services (Temporary Service) Rules, 1965, a temporary government servant who has been in continuous service for more than three years may terminate his service by giving notice of not less than three months in writing to the appointing authority. The appointing authority may also terminate the service of any temporary government servant by giving him notice of not less than three months in writing or three months’ pay and allowances in lieu of such notice. However, this rule does not apply to a temporary government servant appointed on probation or on contract or on deputation.According to the Department of Personnel and Training’s Office Memorandum dated 11.02.1988, a resignation has to be clear and unconditional. It is not in the interest of government to retain an unwilling government servant in service. The general rule, therefore, is that a resignation of a government servant from service should be accepted, except in certain circumstances, such as where the government servant is engaged on work of importance and it would take time to make alternative arrangements for filling the post, or where the government servant is under suspension or facing disciplinary proceedings. A resignation becomes effective when it is accepted and the government servant is relieved of his duties.Based on these results, it seems that there is no provision for paying three months’ salary and resigning from service without serving the notice period for a permanent government employee. However, this may vary depending on the terms and conditions of appointment and the nature and status of service. Therefore, I suggest that you consult your appointing authority or your administrative department for clarification and guidance on your specific case.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Resignation from Central Governement",
    "answer": "Dear ClientIn India, as per Central Government (CG) rules, employees are typically required to serve a notice period before resigning from their employment. The notice period duration may vary depending on the specific rules and regulations of the organization or department. However, in the scenario you described, where an employee is willing to pay the equivalent of three months' salary in lieu of serving the notice period, it's essential to consider the specific rules and policies of the Central Government or the department in which the individual is employed.As per the update in September 2021, the rules governing notice periods and the possibility of paying in lieu of notice vary among government departments and organizations. Typically, notice periods are meant to ensure a smooth transition and allow the employer to find a suitable replacement for the departing employee.If the CG rules only mention a three-month notice period without specifying the option to pay in lieu of notice, it is advisable to consult with the organization's human resources department or seek legal advice to understand the specific policies and procedures applicable to your situation. These policies can sometimes be outlined in the employee's appointment letter, service rules, or other relevant documents.It's important to note that government rules and regulations can change over time, so it's crucial to consult with the relevant authorities or legal experts for the most up-to-date and accurate information regarding notice periods and resignation procedures within the Central Government or specific departments. Additionally, employment contracts and rules may be subject to negotiation and customization, so individual circumstances may vary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Three years may seem like a long time, but it's not uncommon for civil cases to take several years to reach a conclusion.Evidence: It's positive that you've submitted CCTV footage as evidence. In civil cases, evidence plays a crucial role, and the court will review the evidence before making a decision. The court may need time to thoroughly examine all the evidence presented.Legal Representation: Ensure that you have legal representation for your case. Having an experienced lawyer can make a significant difference in the progress and outcome of your case. Your lawyer can also provide guidance on the next steps to take.Settlement: You may want to explore the possibility of a settlement with the other party, if you haven't already. Sometimes, parties can reach an agreement outside of court to resolve the matter more quickly and with less expense.Court Updates: Regularly check the status of your case with your lawyer and inquire about the reasons for any delays. They should be able to provide insights into the specific circumstances surrounding your case.Escalation: If you believe there are undue delays or irregularities in the handling of your case, you can consider seeking legal remedies to expedite the process. Your lawyer can advise you on the appropriate legal steps to take in such situations.Political Affiliation: It's essential to focus on the legal aspects of the case rather than the political affiliations of the involved parties. Legal matters should be resolved impartially, and your lawyer will work to ensure that the law is upheld.In summary, civil cases in India can take time to reach a resolution, and it's essential to have patience and continue working closely with your legal counsel.

If you select “Everyone”, anyone can add you to a group without your consent.If someone has added you to a group without your permission, you can report the group to WhatsApp by following these steps:Open the group chat.Tap on the group subject.Scroll down and tap Report Group.Tap REPORT AND EXIT or REPORT AND BLOCK.This will send a report to WhatsApp and exit the group or block the admin.As for the legal aspect of adding someone to a WhatsApp group without their consent, there is no clear law in India that prohibits this act. However, if the group is used for spreading false or defamatory information, harassing or threatening someone, or violating someone’s privacy, then it may attract legal action under various sections of theIndian Penal Code(IPC) and the Information Technology (IT) Act.For example, if someone creates a WhatsApp group and adds women without their consent and sends them obscene messages or images, then it may amount to outraging their modesty under Section 354A of the IPC or sending sexually explicit material under Section 67A of the IT Act. Similarly, if someone creates a WhatsApp group and adds people without their consent and spreads rumours or fake news that cause public disorder or communal violence, then it may amount to creating enmity between different groups under Section 153A of the IPC or sending offensive messages under Section 66A of the IT Act.Therefore, depending on the nature and purpose of the WhatsApp group, adding someone without their consent may or may not be illegal in India. However, it is always advisable to respect the privacy and preferences of others and seek their permission before adding them to any group.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Adding to a WhatsApp group without permission",
    "answer": "Dear ClientThere were no specific Indian laws that directly addressed the act of adding someone to a WhatsApp group without their consent. However, this situation may involve several legal considerations:Privacy Concerns: Adding someone to a WhatsApp group without their consent may raise privacy concerns, especially if personal contact information is shared without permission. This could potentially be seen as an invasion of privacy, and individuals may have the right to take legal action if they believe their privacy has been violated.Cyberbullying or Harassment: If the addition to the group is part of a pattern of harassment, cyberbullying, or stalking, it may be possible to pursue legal action under the Information Technology Act, 2000, or other relevant laws.WhatsApp Policies: WhatsApp has its own policies regarding group creation and membership. Violating these policies could result in the user's account being restricted or banned. WhatsApp allows group admins to control who can join their groups, so individuals who have been added without consent can leave the group themselves.Consent: Consent is a fundamental principle in privacy and data protection. If someone's personal information, including their phone number, is being shared without their consent, it may be a breach of their privacy rights.To address this situation, individuals who have been added to the group without their consent can take the following steps:Leave the Group: WhatsApp allows users to leave groups they do not want to be part of. Simply tap on the group, go to Group Info, and choose the \"Exit Group\" option.Report to WhatsApp: Users can report the issue to WhatsApp by using the in-app reporting feature, which can be found in the group settings.Consult Legal Counsel: If the situation escalates and individuals believe their privacy has been violated or they are being harassed, they should consider consulting with a legal professional to explore potential legal actions based on existing laws related to privacy, harassment, or cyberbullying.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Cancelling an engagement",
    "answer": "Cancelling an engagement can be a difficult and emotional decision, and it may have legal consequences depending on the laws of the country where you live or where the engagement took place.I searched the web for some information on legal advice on cancelling an engagement in Turkey, and here are some of the results I found:As per legal information on family law in Turkey, there are two types of engagements: official and unofficial. An official engagement is registered at the civil registry office and requires the consent of both parties and their families. An unofficial engagement is based on a verbal or written agreement between the parties and does not have any legal status. If you cancel an official engagement, you may have to pay compensation for the expenses incurred by the other party for the wedding preparations, such as invitations, clothes, jewelry, etc. If you cancel an unofficial engagement, you may have to return the gifts that you received from the other party or their family, such as rings, money, etc. However, you are not obliged to pay any compensation for emotional damages or loss of reputation, unless there is a specific clause in your agreement that stipulates otherwise.If you cancel an engagement in India, you may face a civil suit for breach of promise to marry, which is a contractual obligation that can be enforced by the court. The other party may claim damages for the loss of marriage prospects, mental anguish, social stigma, etc. However, the court will consider various factors, such as the duration of the engagement, the reason for breaking it off, the conduct of both parties, etc., before awarding any compensation. Moreover, if you cancel an engagement after having sexual relations with the other party, you may also face a criminal charge of cheating or rape, depending on the circumstances and the consent of the parties involved.Based on these results, it seems that cancelling an engagement may have different legal implications depending on where it took place and what kind of agreement you had with your partner.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Cancelling an engagement",
    "answer": "Dear ClientEngagement Breakup: In India, engagements are not legally binding contracts. You are generally not obligated to pay compensation for emotional damages or accommodation expenses in case of a canceled engagement. However, Indian courts have sometimes awarded compensation in cases involving promises or agreements made during the engagement period, but this can vary based on the specific circumstances.Accommodation Expenses: Whether you are obligated to pay for her accommodation expenses in Turkey would depend on any prior agreements or arrangements you had. If you both agreed to share expenses during your stay in Turkey, you might be responsible for your share. However, if there was no such agreement, it may be challenging for her to legally claim compensation for accommodation.Emotional Damages: Proving emotional damages in Indian courts can be difficult. While emotional distress can be a factor in some cases, it's typically not easy to quantify or prove unless there was a specific action or event that caused severe emotional distress and can be legally proven.Financial Contributions: If you voluntarily contributed money to her during your relationship, it could be considered a gift unless there was a clear agreement or understanding that it would be repaid. Gifts, generally, cannot be legally reclaimed.Property Ownership: It's essential to understand the legal status of her property in India, such as the office building and the farmhouse. These assets may come into play if there are any financial disputes.Settlement Negotiations: It's often better to reach an amicable settlement outside of court to avoid prolonged legal battles. If you're willing to provide some financial support, you can negotiate with her to reach a mutually agreeable settlement amount that both parties find fair.Legal Advice: To get a clear understanding of your legal obligations and rights in this situation, it's strongly recommended that you consult with a qualified attorney in India. They can provide you with legal guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Undisclosed registered lease deed",
    "answer": "First of all, I would advise you to be very cautious and careful before proceeding with this transaction. The fact that the seller did not disclose the registered lease deed and its suspicious clauses is a red flag that indicates a possible fraud or hidden defect in the title of the property. You should also verify the authenticity and validity of the lease deed and the other documents related to the property. You should also check if there are any pending or potential disputes, claims, liens, court judgments, government actions, or any other encumbrances on the property. You should also consult a lawyer and get a legal opinion on the property before making any decision.Secondly, if you decide to proceed with this transaction and get a registered sale deed in your favour, you may have some rights as a bona fide purchaser for value without notice. According to the Indian law of property, a bona fide purchaser is a person who purchases property for a valid consideration without knowing of any other party’s claim to the title of that property. A bona fide purchaser can acquire a good title to the property even if the seller had a defective title or no title at all. However, this rule is not absolute and there are some exceptions and limitations to it.Some of the exceptions and limitations are as follows:The rule does not apply to properties that are subject to statutory restrictions or prohibitions on transfer, such as wakf properties, trust properties, enemy properties, etc.The rule does not apply to properties that are subject to public notice or registration requirements, such as properties under theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, the Registration Act, 1908, etc.The rule does not apply to properties that are subject to equitable interests or rights of third parties, such as mortgages, charges, easements, etc.The rule does not apply to properties that are subject to adverse possession or prescriptive rights of third parties.The rule does not apply to properties that are subject to fraud or collusion between the seller and the buyer or between the seller and the third party.The rule does not apply to properties that are subject to estoppel or waiver by the buyer or by the third party.Therefore, depending on the nature and circumstances of your case, you may or may not have a superior right over any other charges/claims/liens/court judgments/government actions that may arise in future.

    "answer": "Dear ClientHidden Lease Deed: The fact that the seller did not disclose the registered lease deed is a significant concern. It raises questions about their transparency and intentions. You should continue to investigate the purpose of this lease deed and consult with your lawyer to understand its potential impact on your property rights.Lease Terms and Unusual Clauses: The unusual terms and clauses in the lease deed, such as the extended duration and the inclusion of the husband, do raise suspicions. It's advisable to seek legal counsel to thoroughly review the lease deed and assess its implications on your property rights. Your lawyer can advise you on whether these clauses could pose future problems or if they can be challenged or invalidated.Proceeding with the Transaction: Your decision to proceed with the transaction should be based on a careful assessment of the risks and potential consequences. If you decide to proceed, consider negotiating with the seller to address your concerns or seek indemnities if issues arise from the hidden lease deed in the future. Make sure to consult with your lawyer on the best way to protect your interests in the transaction.Rights as a Bona Fide Purchaser: In India, a bona fide purchaser for value without notice can have certain protections. If you can demonstrate that you acted in good faith, paid a fair price, and had no knowledge of any encumbrances or adverse claims when you purchased the property, you may have priority over subsequent claims, liens, or judgments that arise after your purchase. However, the specific legal protection you have will depend on the circumstances and applicable laws, and your lawyer can provide more detailed guidance.Legal Due Diligence: Continue to conduct a thorough legal due diligence process with the assistance of your lawyer. Ensure that all necessary searches and investigations are completed to uncover any potential issues or claims on the property. This will help you make an informed decision about whether to proceed with the transaction.Ultimately, you should rely on the advice of your legal counsel to assess the risks associated with this property transaction, negotiate with the seller if necessary, and take appropriate steps to protect your interests. Property transactions can be complex, and legal guidance is crucial to navigate them successfully.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Resignation from Central Governement",
    "answer": "According to the Central Civil Services (Leave) Rules, 1972, a government servant who has been granted leave cannot resign from service during the period of leave, except with the permission of the President. A government servant who resigns from service shall be required to refund the amount of leave salary and allowances paid to him during the period of leave not due, which shall be calculated in the same manner as prescribed for calculation of such amount in case of dismissal or removal from service.According to the Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965, a government servant who is under suspension shall be required to obtain the permission of the authority competent to appoint him to resign his post. If a government servant submits his resignation while under suspension, the competent authority shall examine with reference to the merits of the disciplinary case pending against him whether it would be in public interest to accept the resignation. Normally, as government servants are placed under suspension only in cases of grave delinquency, it would not be correct to accept a resignation from a government servant under suspension.According to the Central Civil Services (Temporary Service) Rules, 1965, a temporary government servant who has been in continuous service for more than three years may terminate his service by giving notice of not less than three months in writing to the appointing authority. The appointing authority may also terminate the service of any temporary government servant by giving him notice of not less than three months in writing or three months’ pay and allowances in lieu of such notice. However, this rule does not apply to a temporary government servant appointed on probation or on contract or on deputation.According to the Department of Personnel and Training’s Office Memorandum dated 11.02.1988, a resignation has to be clear and unconditional. It is not in the interest of government to retain an unwilling government servant in service. The general rule, therefore, is that a resignation of a government servant from service should be accepted, except in certain circumstances, such as where the government servant is engaged on work of importance and it would take time to make alternative arrangements for filling the post, or where the government servant is under suspension or facing disciplinary proceedings. A resignation becomes effective when it is accepted and the government servant is relieved of his duties.Based on these results, it seems that there is no provision for paying three months’ salary and resigning from service without serving the notice period for a permanent government employee. However, this may vary depending on the terms and conditions of appointment and the nature and status of service. Therefore, I suggest that you consult your appointing authority or your administrative department for clarification and guidance on your specific case.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Resignation from Central Governement",
    "answer": "Dear ClientIn India, as per Central Government (CG) rules, employees are typically required to serve a notice period before resigning from their employment. The notice period duration may vary depending on the specific rules and regulations of the organization or department. However, in the scenario you described, where an employee is willing to pay the equivalent of three months' salary in lieu of serving the notice period, it's essential to consider the specific rules and policies of the Central Government or the department in which the individual is employed.As per the update in September 2021, the rules governing notice periods and the possibility of paying in lieu of notice vary among government departments and organizations. Typically, notice periods are meant to ensure a smooth transition and allow the employer to find a suitable replacement for the departing employee.If the CG rules only mention a three-month notice period without specifying the option to pay in lieu of notice, it is advisable to consult with the organization's human resources department or seek legal advice to understand the specific policies and procedures applicable to your situation. These policies can sometimes be outlined in the employee's appointment letter, service rules, or other relevant documents.It's important to note that government rules and regulations can change over time, so it's crucial to consult with the relevant authorities or legal experts for the most up-to-date and accurate information regarding notice periods and resignation procedures within the Central Government or specific departments. Additionally, employment contracts and rules may be subject to negotiation and customization, so individual circumstances may vary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Acceptance of Foreign Marriage Certificates: India generally recognizes foreign marriage certificates for visa applications. However, there may be specific requirements and conditions that applicants need to meet.Translation: If your Czech marriage certificate is not in English, it is typically required to have an official translation of the certificate into English. The translation should be done by a certified translator or a recognized translation agency.Legalization and Apostille: In some cases, India may require that the marriage certificate and its translation be legalized or apostilled. Legalization or apostille is a process by which a document is certified as genuine by the government of the issuing country. This ensures that the document is legally recognized in India.X-Visa and e-FRRO: The specific requirements for obtaining an X-Visa and using a foreign marriage certificate for this purpose may vary depending on the category of X-Visa you are applying for (e.g., X1-Visa for long-term study or X2-Visa for accompanying a student). The e-FRRO (e-Foreigners Regional Registration Office) is an online platform for visa-related services in India, and you may need to follow their guidelines for document submission.Consult Local Authorities: It's highly recommended to contact the Indian embassy or consulate in your country or visit the official website of the e-FRRO for India to obtain the most accurate and current information regarding visa requirements and the use of foreign marriage certificates.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear ClientEnforce Applicable Rules and Regulations: You have correctly pointed out various provisions from the Bombay High Court and Advocates Act that require proper authorization (Vakaltnama) and/or a No Objection Certificate (NOC) when changing legal representation. You can continue to argue before the court that the senior advocate's appearance is in violation of these rules.Request Discharge of Earlier Advocate: You can emphasize that the junior advocate who initially appeared on behalf of JD has not been discharged by JD, and his Vakaltnama is still on record. This is a valid point, and it should be brought to the court's attention. It's important to highlight the need for a formal discharge or NOC in such situations.Invoke Supreme Court Precedent: The decision of the Supreme Court in the case sets a precedent that obtaining a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the previous counsel is crucial. You can refer to this case and argue that the senior advocate's failure to obtain an NOC should disqualify him from representing JD.Emphasize the Distinction Between Senior Counsel and District Advocates: You've rightly mentioned the distinction between senior counsel in high courts and district-level advocates. Emphasize the local court's requirement for proper authorization through a Vakaltnama and the need for adherence to local court rules.Argue the Lack of Consent from the Previous Advocate: Stress that the junior advocate and the senior advocate did not provide any evidence of consent or an arrangement between them regarding representation in this case. Highlight that this absence of consent or arrangement violates the established rules and norms.Seek Dismissal of the Senior Advocate's Application: Before the senior advocate begins his arguments on the merits of the case, you can request that the court dismiss his application on the grounds that he has not satisfied the court regarding his authorization to represent JD. You can refer to the relevant rules and precedents as discussed above to support your argument.Ultimately, the court will decide how to proceed based on the arguments presented by both parties. It's important to ensure that your objections are well-documented and supported by relevant legal provisions and precedents.

    "question": "Being blackmailed by a lady",
    "answer": "Blackmailing is a form of extortion in which a person threatens to reveal or publicize some information that is damaging or embarrassing to another person, unless the latter complies with certain demands, such as money, sexual favors, or other benefits. Blackmailing is a criminal offense in India, punishable under sections 383 to 389 of theIndian Penal Code(IPC), 1860. The punishment for blackmailing can be imprisonment for up to three years, or fine, or both.Some of the steps that you can take to deal with blackmailing are as follows:Do not panic or give in to the blackmailer’s demands. Paying the blackmailer may not stop him or her from asking for more money or favors, or from releasing the information anyway. It may also encourage him or her to target more victims.Do not delete or destroy any evidence of the blackmailing, such as messages, emails, photos, videos, etc. Preserve them as proof of the crime and the identity of the blackmailer.Report the blackmailer to the local police and file a complaint under sections 384 (extortion) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC. You can also file a complaint online at www.cybercrime.gov.in if the blackmailing is done through electronic means.

    "question": "Cancelling an engagement",
    "answer": "Cancelling an engagement can be a difficult and emotional decision, and it may have legal consequences depending on the laws of the country where you live or where the engagement took place.I searched the web for some information on legal advice on cancelling an engagement in Turkey, and here are some of the results I found:As per legal information on family law in Turkey, there are two types of engagements: official and unofficial. An official engagement is registered at the civil registry office and requires the consent of both parties and their families. An unofficial engagement is based on a verbal or written agreement between the parties and does not have any legal status. If you cancel an official engagement, you may have to pay compensation for the expenses incurred by the other party for the wedding preparations, such as invitations, clothes, jewelry, etc. If you cancel an unofficial engagement, you may have to return the gifts that you received from the other party or their family, such as rings, money, etc. However, you are not obliged to pay any compensation for emotional damages or loss of reputation, unless there is a specific clause in your agreement that stipulates otherwise.If you cancel an engagement in India, you may face a civil suit for breach of promise to marry, which is a contractual obligation that can be enforced by the court. The other party may claim damages for the loss of marriage prospects, mental anguish, social stigma, etc. However, the court will consider various factors, such as the duration of the engagement, the reason for breaking it off, the conduct of both parties, etc., before awarding any compensation. Moreover, if you cancel an engagement after having sexual relations with the other party, you may also face a criminal charge of cheating or rape, depending on the circumstances and the consent of the parties involved.Based on these results, it seems that cancelling an engagement may have different legal implications depending on where it took place and what kind of agreement you had with your partner.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Since she is still married then the life you both lived together cannot be considered as  married life neither she can allege that  it was on a false promise.Since you both wanted to marry each other so for some purpose you got engaged to each other and waited for the divorce to happen fr almost three years, which  is not forthcoming, you decided to call of the engagement, hence there is nothing that you can do about it neither it can be considered as an offence of cheating or breach of trust.The relationship between you both all these three years or more was on a consensual note without any promise and there was no terms and conditions between you both for the living together.Hence  she cannot demand compensation towards this because you have made your intention t break up.Besides you have already spent huge money on her on various occasions whether voluntarily or on her demand.Therefore any demands made by her in the garb of compensation would be nothing but an act of extortion or blackmail.You can refuse to pay even a single penny, she cannot do anything legally about it.If she continuous her harassment you may lodge a criminal complaint against her to the concerned police.You can make the complaint by online mode also.Nobody will call you from this forum for all your further queries, if at all you need any more clarification, you can call the chosen advocate.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Cancelling an engagement",
    "answer": "Dear ClientEngagement Breakup: In India, engagements are not legally binding contracts. You are generally not obligated to pay compensation for emotional damages or accommodation expenses in case of a canceled engagement. However, Indian courts have sometimes awarded compensation in cases involving promises or agreements made during the engagement period, but this can vary based on the specific circumstances.Accommodation Expenses: Whether you are obligated to pay for her accommodation expenses in Turkey would depend on any prior agreements or arrangements you had. If you both agreed to share expenses during your stay in Turkey, you might be responsible for your share. However, if there was no such agreement, it may be challenging for her to legally claim compensation for accommodation.Emotional Damages: Proving emotional damages in Indian courts can be difficult. While emotional distress can be a factor in some cases, it's typically not easy to quantify or prove unless there was a specific action or event that caused severe emotional distress and can be legally proven.Financial Contributions: If you voluntarily contributed money to her during your relationship, it could be considered a gift unless there was a clear agreement or understanding that it would be repaid. Gifts, generally, cannot be legally reclaimed.Property Ownership: It's essential to understand the legal status of her property in India, such as the office building and the farmhouse. These assets may come into play if there are any financial disputes.Settlement Negotiations: It's often better to reach an amicable settlement outside of court to avoid prolonged legal battles. If you're willing to provide some financial support, you can negotiate with her to reach a mutually agreeable settlement amount that both parties find fair.Legal Advice: To get a clear understanding of your legal obligations and rights in this situation, it's strongly recommended that you consult with a qualified attorney in India. They can provide you with legal guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Being blackmailed by a lady",
    "answer": "Blackmailing is a form of extortion in which a person threatens to reveal or publicize some information that is damaging or embarrassing to another person, unless the latter complies with certain demands, such as money, sexual favors, or other benefits. Blackmailing is a criminal offense in India, punishable under sections 383 to 389 of theIndian Penal Code(IPC), 1860. The punishment for blackmailing can be imprisonment for up to three years, or fine, or both.Some of the steps that you can take to deal with blackmailing are as follows:Do not panic or give in to the blackmailer’s demands. Paying the blackmailer may not stop him or her from asking for more money or favors, or from releasing the information anyway. It may also encourage him or her to target more victims.Do not delete or destroy any evidence of the blackmailing, such as messages, emails, photos, videos, etc. Preserve them as proof of the crime and the identity of the blackmailer.Report the blackmailer to the local police and file a complaint under sections 384 (extortion) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC. You can also file a complaint online at www.cybercrime.gov.in if the blackmailing is done through electronic means.

However, there may be specific requirements and conditions that applicants need to meet.Translation: If your Czech marriage certificate is not in English, it is typically required to have an official translation of the certificate into English. The translation should be done by a certified translator or a recognized translation agency.Legalization and Apostille: In some cases, India may require that the marriage certificate and its translation be legalized or apostilled. Legalization or apostille is a process by which a document is certified as genuine by the government of the issuing country. This ensures that the document is legally recognized in India.X-Visa and e-FRRO: The specific requirements for obtaining an X-Visa and using a foreign marriage certificate for this purpose may vary depending on the category of X-Visa you are applying for (e.g., X1-Visa for long-term study or X2-Visa for accompanying a student). The e-FRRO (e-Foreigners Regional Registration Office) is an online platform for visa-related services in India, and you may need to follow their guidelines for document submission.Consult Local Authorities: It's highly recommended to contact the Indian embassy or consulate in your country or visit the official website of the e-FRRO for India to obtain the most accurate and current information regarding visa requirements and the use of foreign marriage certificates.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Resignation from Central Governement",
    "answer": "According to the Central Civil Services (Leave) Rules, 1972, a government servant who has been granted leave cannot resign from service during the period of leave, except with the permission of the President. A government servant who resigns from service shall be required to refund the amount of leave salary and allowances paid to him during the period of leave not due, which shall be calculated in the same manner as prescribed for calculation of such amount in case of dismissal or removal from service.According to the Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965, a government servant who is under suspension shall be required to obtain the permission of the authority competent to appoint him to resign his post. If a government servant submits his resignation while under suspension, the competent authority shall examine with reference to the merits of the disciplinary case pending against him whether it would be in public interest to accept the resignation. Normally, as government servants are placed under suspension only in cases of grave delinquency, it would not be correct to accept a resignation from a government servant under suspension.According to the Central Civil Services (Temporary Service) Rules, 1965, a temporary government servant who has been in continuous service for more than three years may terminate his service by giving notice of not less than three months in writing to the appointing authority. The appointing authority may also terminate the service of any temporary government servant by giving him notice of not less than three months in writing or three months’ pay and allowances in lieu of such notice. However, this rule does not apply to a temporary government servant appointed on probation or on contract or on deputation.According to the Department of Personnel and Training’s Office Memorandum dated 11.02.1988, a resignation has to be clear and unconditional. It is not in the interest of government to retain an unwilling government servant in service. The general rule, therefore, is that a resignation of a government servant from service should be accepted, except in certain circumstances, such as where the government servant is engaged on work of importance and it would take time to make alternative arrangements for filling the post, or where the government servant is under suspension or facing disciplinary proceedings. A resignation becomes effective when it is accepted and the government servant is relieved of his duties.Based on these results, it seems that there is no provision for paying three months’ salary and resigning from service without serving the notice period for a permanent government employee. However, this may vary depending on the terms and conditions of appointment and the nature and status of service. Therefore, I suggest that you consult your appointing authority or your administrative department for clarification and guidance on your specific case.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Resignation from Central Governement",
    "answer": "As per Specific Relief Act, if any employee quits before the notice period, the Employer can only recover the Notice pay, and the Company cannot force to serve the entire notice period.- Further, the resignation decision is the employee's decision, and the employer cannot sue for breach of contract, if the employee leaves without serving contractual notice.- Further, asper the Employment Act, employees have the right to resign at any time, by serving notice or by compensating the employer with salary in lieu. It is an offence for employers to disallow employees to leave their job.- Further, the Supreme Court has declared in the judgement in the matter of Sanjay Jain versus National Aviation Company of India Ltd, , that to resign is a right of an employee who cannot be forced to serve in case he is not willing until and unless there is some stipulation in the rules or in the terms of appointment or disciplinary proceedings is pending or contemplated which is sought to be avoided by resigning from the service.- Hence , the said person can resign after paying  the 3 months notice period , and he cannot be forced to continue the work for the notice period.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Resignation from Central Governement",
    "answer": "Dear ClientIn India, as per Central Government (CG) rules, employees are typically required to serve a notice period before resigning from their employment. The notice period duration may vary depending on the specific rules and regulations of the organization or department. However, in the scenario you described, where an employee is willing to pay the equivalent of three months' salary in lieu of serving the notice period, it's essential to consider the specific rules and policies of the Central Government or the department in which the individual is employed.As per the update in September 2021, the rules governing notice periods and the possibility of paying in lieu of notice vary among government departments and organizations. Typically, notice periods are meant to ensure a smooth transition and allow the employer to find a suitable replacement for the departing employee.If the CG rules only mention a three-month notice period without specifying the option to pay in lieu of notice, it is advisable to consult with the organization's human resources department or seek legal advice to understand the specific policies and procedures applicable to your situation. These policies can sometimes be outlined in the employee's appointment letter, service rules, or other relevant documents.It's important to note that government rules and regulations can change over time, so it's crucial to consult with the relevant authorities or legal experts for the most up-to-date and accurate information regarding notice periods and resignation procedures within the Central Government or specific departments. Additionally, employment contracts and rules may be subject to negotiation and customization, so individual circumstances may vary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Adding to a WhatsApp group without permission",
    "answer": "According to the WhatsApp group privacy settings, you can choose who can add you to groups without your consent. You can select one of the three options: “Nobody”, “My Contacts”, or “Everyone”. If you select “Nobody”, no one will be able to add you to a group except through an invitation link, which you can accept or reject. If you select “My Contacts”, only people in your contact list will be able to add you to a group without an invitation link. If you select “Everyone”, anyone can add you to a group without your consent.If someone has added you to a group without your permission, you can report the group to WhatsApp by following these steps:Open the group chat.Tap on the group subject.Scroll down and tap Report Group.Tap REPORT AND EXIT or REPORT AND BLOCK.This will send a report to WhatsApp and exit the group or block the admin.As for the legal aspect of adding someone to a WhatsApp group without their consent, there is no clear law in India that prohibits this act. However, if the group is used for spreading false or defamatory information, harassing or threatening someone, or violating someone’s privacy, then it may attract legal action under various sections of theIndian Penal Code(IPC) and the Information Technology (IT) Act.For example, if someone creates a WhatsApp group and adds women without their consent and sends them obscene messages or images, then it may amount to outraging their modesty under Section 354A of the IPC or sending sexually explicit material under Section 67A of the IT Act. Similarly, if someone creates a WhatsApp group and adds people without their consent and spreads rumours or fake news that cause public disorder or communal violence, then it may amount to creating enmity between different groups under Section 153A of the IPC or sending offensive messages under Section 66A of the IT Act.Therefore, depending on the nature and purpose of the WhatsApp group, adding someone without their consent may or may not be illegal in India. However, it is always advisable to respect the privacy and preferences of others and seek their permission before adding them to any group.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Adding to a WhatsApp group without permission",
    "answer": "Dear ClientThere were no specific Indian laws that directly addressed the act of adding someone to a WhatsApp group without their consent. However, this situation may involve several legal considerations:Privacy Concerns: Adding someone to a WhatsApp group without their consent may raise privacy concerns, especially if personal contact information is shared without permission. This could potentially be seen as an invasion of privacy, and individuals may have the right to take legal action if they believe their privacy has been violated.Cyberbullying or Harassment: If the addition to the group is part of a pattern of harassment, cyberbullying, or stalking, it may be possible to pursue legal action under the Information Technology Act, 2000, or other relevant laws.WhatsApp Policies: WhatsApp has its own policies regarding group creation and membership. Violating these policies could result in the user's account being restricted or banned. WhatsApp allows group admins to control who can join their groups, so individuals who have been added without consent can leave the group themselves.Consent: Consent is a fundamental principle in privacy and data protection. If someone's personal information, including their phone number, is being shared without their consent, it may be a breach of their privacy rights.To address this situation, individuals who have been added to the group without their consent can take the following steps:Leave the Group: WhatsApp allows users to leave groups they do not want to be part of. Simply tap on the group, go to Group Info, and choose the \"Exit Group\" option.Report to WhatsApp: Users can report the issue to WhatsApp by using the in-app reporting feature, which can be found in the group settings.Consult Legal Counsel: If the situation escalates and individuals believe their privacy has been violated or they are being harassed, they should consider consulting with a legal professional to explore potential legal actions based on existing laws related to privacy, harassment, or cyberbullying.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Cancelling an engagement",
    "answer": "Cancelling an engagement can be a difficult and emotional decision, and it may have legal consequences depending on the laws of the country where you live or where the engagement took place.I searched the web for some information on legal advice on cancelling an engagement in Turkey, and here are some of the results I found:As per legal information on family law in Turkey, there are two types of engagements: official and unofficial. An official engagement is registered at the civil registry office and requires the consent of both parties and their families. An unofficial engagement is based on a verbal or written agreement between the parties and does not have any legal status. If you cancel an official engagement, you may have to pay compensation for the expenses incurred by the other party for the wedding preparations, such as invitations, clothes, jewelry, etc. If you cancel an unofficial engagement, you may have to return the gifts that you received from the other party or their family, such as rings, money, etc. However, you are not obliged to pay any compensation for emotional damages or loss of reputation, unless there is a specific clause in your agreement that stipulates otherwise.If you cancel an engagement in India, you may face a civil suit for breach of promise to marry, which is a contractual obligation that can be enforced by the court. The other party may claim damages for the loss of marriage prospects, mental anguish, social stigma, etc. However, the court will consider various factors, such as the duration of the engagement, the reason for breaking it off, the conduct of both parties, etc., before awarding any compensation. Moreover, if you cancel an engagement after having sexual relations with the other party, you may also face a criminal charge of cheating or rape, depending on the circumstances and the consent of the parties involved.Based on these results, it seems that cancelling an engagement may have different legal implications depending on where it took place and what kind of agreement you had with your partner.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Cancelling an engagement",
    "answer": "Dear ClientEngagement Breakup: In India, engagements are not legally binding contracts. You are generally not obligated to pay compensation for emotional damages or accommodation expenses in case of a canceled engagement. However, Indian courts have sometimes awarded compensation in cases involving promises or agreements made during the engagement period, but this can vary based on the specific circumstances.Accommodation Expenses: Whether you are obligated to pay for her accommodation expenses in Turkey would depend on any prior agreements or arrangements you had. If you both agreed to share expenses during your stay in Turkey, you might be responsible for your share. However, if there was no such agreement, it may be challenging for her to legally claim compensation for accommodation.Emotional Damages: Proving emotional damages in Indian courts can be difficult. While emotional distress can be a factor in some cases, it's typically not easy to quantify or prove unless there was a specific action or event that caused severe emotional distress and can be legally proven.Financial Contributions: If you voluntarily contributed money to her during your relationship, it could be considered a gift unless there was a clear agreement or understanding that it would be repaid. Gifts, generally, cannot be legally reclaimed.Property Ownership: It's essential to understand the legal status of her property in India, such as the office building and the farmhouse. These assets may come into play if there are any financial disputes.Settlement Negotiations: It's often better to reach an amicable settlement outside of court to avoid prolonged legal battles. If you're willing to provide some financial support, you can negotiate with her to reach a mutually agreeable settlement amount that both parties find fair.Legal Advice: To get a clear understanding of your legal obligations and rights in this situation, it's strongly recommended that you consult with a qualified attorney in India. They can provide you with legal guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Resignation from Central Governement",
    "answer": "According to the Central Civil Services (Leave) Rules, 1972, a government servant who has been granted leave cannot resign from service during the period of leave, except with the permission of the President. A government servant who resigns from service shall be required to refund the amount of leave salary and allowances paid to him during the period of leave not due, which shall be calculated in the same manner as prescribed for calculation of such amount in case of dismissal or removal from service.According to the Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965, a government servant who is under suspension shall be required to obtain the permission of the authority competent to appoint him to resign his post. If a government servant submits his resignation while under suspension, the competent authority shall examine with reference to the merits of the disciplinary case pending against him whether it would be in public interest to accept the resignation. Normally, as government servants are placed under suspension only in cases of grave delinquency, it would not be correct to accept a resignation from a government servant under suspension.According to the Central Civil Services (Temporary Service) Rules, 1965, a temporary government servant who has been in continuous service for more than three years may terminate his service by giving notice of not less than three months in writing to the appointing authority. The appointing authority may also terminate the service of any temporary government servant by giving him notice of not less than three months in writing or three months’ pay and allowances in lieu of such notice. However, this rule does not apply to a temporary government servant appointed on probation or on contract or on deputation.According to the Department of Personnel and Training’s Office Memorandum dated 11.02.1988, a resignation has to be clear and unconditional. It is not in the interest of government to retain an unwilling government servant in service. The general rule, therefore, is that a resignation of a government servant from service should be accepted, except in certain circumstances, such as where the government servant is engaged on work of importance and it would take time to make alternative arrangements for filling the post, or where the government servant is under suspension or facing disciplinary proceedings. A resignation becomes effective when it is accepted and the government servant is relieved of his duties.Based on these results, it seems that there is no provision for paying three months’ salary and resigning from service without serving the notice period for a permanent government employee. However, this may vary depending on the terms and conditions of appointment and the nature and status of service. Therefore, I suggest that you consult your appointing authority or your administrative department for clarification and guidance on your specific case.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "As per Specific Relief Act, if any employee quits before the notice period, the Employer can only recover the Notice pay, and the Company cannot force to serve the entire notice period.- Further, the resignation decision is the employee's decision, and the employer cannot sue for breach of contract, if the employee leaves without serving contractual notice.- Further, asper the Employment Act, employees have the right to resign at any time, by serving notice or by compensating the employer with salary in lieu. It is an offence for employers to disallow employees to leave their job.- Further, the Supreme Court has declared in the judgement in the matter of Sanjay Jain versus National Aviation Company of India Ltd, , that to resign is a right of an employee who cannot be forced to serve in case he is not willing until and unless there is some stipulation in the rules or in the terms of appointment or disciplinary proceedings is pending or contemplated which is sought to be avoided by resigning from the service.- Hence , the said person can resign after paying  the 3 months notice period , and he cannot be forced to continue the work for the notice period.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Resignation from Central Governement",
    "answer": "Dear ClientIn India, as per Central Government (CG) rules, employees are typically required to serve a notice period before resigning from their employment. The notice period duration may vary depending on the specific rules and regulations of the organization or department. However, in the scenario you described, where an employee is willing to pay the equivalent of three months' salary in lieu of serving the notice period, it's essential to consider the specific rules and policies of the Central Government or the department in which the individual is employed.As per the update in September 2021, the rules governing notice periods and the possibility of paying in lieu of notice vary among government departments and organizations. Typically, notice periods are meant to ensure a smooth transition and allow the employer to find a suitable replacement for the departing employee.If the CG rules only mention a three-month notice period without specifying the option to pay in lieu of notice, it is advisable to consult with the organization's human resources department or seek legal advice to understand the specific policies and procedures applicable to your situation. These policies can sometimes be outlined in the employee's appointment letter, service rules, or other relevant documents.It's important to note that government rules and regulations can change over time, so it's crucial to consult with the relevant authorities or legal experts for the most up-to-date and accurate information regarding notice periods and resignation procedures within the Central Government or specific departments. Additionally, employment contracts and rules may be subject to negotiation and customization, so individual circumstances may vary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Anticipatory Bail application u/s 438 CrPC & Relaxing Conditions application u/s 439(1)(b) CrPC",
    "answer": "Anticipatory Bail or Pre-arrest Bail: It is a legal provision that allows an accused person to apply for bail before being arrested. In India, pre-arrest bail is granted undersection 438 of theCode of Criminal Procedure, 1973. It is issued only by the Sessions Court and High Court.The AB is granted under section 438 after which the accused has to file an application for regular bail under section 439.While the court which grants bail under Section 439 of theCode of Criminal Procedure1973 can impose conditions which ensure the presence of the accused to face trial,While exercising power Under Section 438 of the Code, the Court is duty bound to strike a balance between the individual's right to personal freedom and the right of investigation of the police. For the same, while granting relief under Section 438(1), appropriate conditions can be imposed Under Section 438(2) so as to ensure an uninterrupted investigation. The object of putting such conditions should be to avoid the possibility of the person hampering the investigation.Section 439 of theCode of Criminal Procedure, 1973 grants significant discretionary powers to the High Court and the Court of Session to grant or deny bail in certain circumstances and also allows them to modify or set aside bail conditions imposed by a Magistrate. One has to file an application under Section 439(1)(b) CrPC before the concerned Court of Session or High Court to be allowed relaxation of bail conditions.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

NCT of Delhi  there is no provision of time restriction in the applicability of an anticipatory bail, granted under Section 438 of theCode of Criminal Procedure(Cr. P.C), 1973.- Hence, after getting the anticipatory bail , it is not mandatory to take regular bail from the court , and the accused will be considered as on bail for whole trial of the case.- Further, under Section 439(1) (b), the High Court or the Court of Sessions can set aside or modify any condition imposed by a magistrate when releasing an accused on bail- So, the Session court is rightly allowed his application u/s 439(1)(b) , as this application is maintainable even after getting the anticipatory bail as well.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "Dear QueristMy opinion on your queries are as under:Accused got the anticipatory bail u/s 438 of CrPC with a condition: \"Everyday accused to attend Police Station at 10am\"Subsequently, by mentioning certain reasons, accused applied for the relaxation of conditions in the said anticipatory bail u/s 439(1)(b).Learned Sessions court considered the said relaxing conditions application u/s 439(1)(b) and gave the order in favour of the accused as: \"Accused to attend Police Station once a month\".Is it possible because 439 section of CrPC is for the person who is already arrested or in custody? Accused was never arrested and he was never in custody.Opinion: As per section 439Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 the High Court and Session Court has special power. After careful reading of the section it is very much clear. The section 439 crpc is reproduced herein for ready reference:I'm planning to challenge the application u/s 439(1)(b) as I believe its illegal. I might be incorrect, kindly advise.Special powers of High Court or Court of Session regarding bail.(1) A High Court or Court of Session may direct-(a) that any person accused of an offence and in custody be released on bail, and if the offence is of the nature specified in subsection (3) of section 437, may impose any condition which it considers necessary for the purposes mentioned in that sub- section;(b) that any condition imposed by a Magistrate when releasing an person on bail be set aside or modified:When a bail was granted under section 438 Cr.P.C. then section 439 (1)(b) of Crpc shall not apply as this clause of sub section 1 is related to only the modification of conditions imposed by the Magistrate and not otherwise. Only the High Court may modify the conditions imposed in the bail order under section 482 Cr.P.C. and not under section 439(1)(b) of Cr.P.C.You may challenge the same by filing Criminal Misc. Petition before Hon’ble High Court challenging the order of modification if passed under section 439 (1)(b) of Cr.P.C.Section 438 CrPC is before arrest and 439(1)(b) CrPC is after arrest. But in my case, accused was never arrested. How is that they can use this section 439(1)(b) CrPC to relax the conditions when they were never arrested?Opinion: In anticipatory bail, the Police arrested the accused and then released him/her and investigate the matter and for the interogation arresting is required, so the person arrested after the anticipatory bail shall be cover by this section but the modification is related to order of the magistrate and not session court or high court passed in anticipatory bail u/s 438 crpc.\"If the accused is able to satisfy the court that he has followed all the bail conditions and cooperated with the police or investigating authorities then the court may modify or relax the bail conditions\" -- Agree with this but the section 439(1)(b) CrPC under which they applied for relaxing the conditions is not applicable I assume because 439(1)(b) CrPC is after arrest.Opinion; As above.Shouldn't they be applying for regular bail under 439 first and once they get the regular bail, they can use 439(1)(b) to relax the conditions? Here, they directly jumped from 438 CrPC of anticipatory bail to 439(1)(b) of regular bail for relaxing the conditions?439 regular bail application is missing by them. Am I right here?Opinion: As above. 439 (1)(b) will not be apply in this senerio.I'm reading \"Union Of India vs Mansoor Abdulla K.S on 26 July, 2022\" IN THE HIGH COURT OF KARNATAKA AT BENGALURU - https://indiankanoon.org/doc/140372397/Para 9 of the judgment says, “The respondent/accused No.3 files an application seeking anticipatory bail under Section 438 of the Cr.P.C. and the concerned Court grants him bail by the following order: Petition filed by the petitioner under Section 438 of the Cr.P.C. is hereby allowed. Bail was granted subject to the condition that the petitioner shall give attendance before the Investigating Officer once in 15 days at a particular time till filing of the charge sheet”.Para 10 of the said judgment says,” The respondent/accused No.3 files application for regular bail in Special C.C.No.271 of 2020 before the learned Sessions Judge under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. Regular bail was granted with certain set of conditions.After grant of bail on [deleted] subject to the afore-quoted conditions the respondent/accused No.3 files an application under Section 439(1)(b) of the Cr.P.C. for relaxation of bail conditions imposed on [deleted] and permit him to travel abroad for his avocation.”Question:Why the respondent/accused No.3 did not directly go from 438 CRPC to 439(1)(b)?Opinion: in some of the state in India, the procedure has been adopted for regular bail after filing of the chargesheet even after obtaining the anticipatory bail. Even the Hon’ble APex Court held in sushila case that the period of anticipatory is for whole trial and there is no requirement for filing regilar bail again before the Trial court during the trail.Why did respondent/accused No.3 took regular bail under 439 of the Cr.P.C after AB bail under 438 CRPC and then finally moved to 439(1)(b) of the Cr.P.C for relaxing the conditions?Opinion: there is no answer of “Why”, its upto the accused and his counsel.I might be missing on certain other conditions or some circumstances clause. Please correct me as I am in the learning phase.This is what I'm trying to say that \"Accused did not apply for regular bail\". Directly after 438 CrPC, Accused applied for 439(1)(b). I can confirm from the ecourts website as well.Sessions court considered the application of accused under 439(1)(b) and relaxed his conditions. There is no mentioning of regular bail or asking accused to apply for regular bail under 439 anywhere.From section 6.3.12 - https://www.advocatekhoj.com/library/lawreports/criminalprocedure/8.php\"When is a person in custody, within the meaning of Section 439 Cr.P.C.? When he is in duress either because he is held by the investigating agency or other police or allied authority or is under the control of the court having been rem&ed by judicial order, or having offered himself to the Court's jurisdiction & submitted to its orders by physical presence. No lexical dexterity nor precedential profusion is needed to come to the realistic conclusion that he who is under the control of the court or is in the physical hold of an officer with coercive power is in custody for the purpose of Section 439. This word is of elastic semantics but its core meaning is that the law has taken control of the person.The equivocatory quibbling & hide-&seek niceties sometimes heard in court that the police have taken a man into informal custody but not arrested him, have detained him for interrogation but not taken him into formal custody & other like terminological dubieties are unfair evasions of the straightforwardness of the law. We need not dilate on this shady facet here because we are satisfied that the accused did physically submit before the Session Judge & the jurisdiction to grant bail thus arose.Custody, in the context of Section 439, (we are not, be it noted, dealing with anticipatory bail under Section 438) is physical control or at least physical presence of the accused in court coupled with submission to the jurisdiction & orders of the Court.Opinion: In anticipatory bail there is a condition that “ in the event of arrest by the police the petitioner be released on bail” so at the time of arrest the accused is in custody.He can be in custody not merely when the police arrests him, produces him before a Magistrate & gets a rem& to judicial or other custody. He can be stated to be in judicial custody when he surrenders before the court & submits to its directions\"In my case, accused got anticipatory bail u/s 438 of CrPC with a condition & then condition is relaxed u/s 439(1)(b) of CrPC. Both by Sessions Court. Were they in custody ever?Opinion: yes, he was in custody and section 439(1)(b) is nowhere mentioned that the acccused should be in custody at the time of applying relaxation/modification of bail’s conditions.Section 362 of Crpc bar the court to relax/modify the conditions of the bail. Only the high court has power to modify the condition imposed under section 438 Crpc under section 482 of Cr.P.C.Feel Free to CallNadeem QureshiAdvocate, New Delhi6319 Answers302 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Nadeem Qureshi"

    "answer": "Blackmailing is a form of extortion in which a person threatens to reveal or publicize some information that is damaging or embarrassing to another person, unless the latter complies with certain demands, such as money, sexual favors, or other benefits. Blackmailing is a criminal offense in India, punishable under sections 383 to 389 of theIndian Penal Code(IPC), 1860. The punishment for blackmailing can be imprisonment for up to three years, or fine, or both.Some of the steps that you can take to deal with blackmailing are as follows:Do not panic or give in to the blackmailer’s demands. Paying the blackmailer may not stop him or her from asking for more money or favors, or from releasing the information anyway. It may also encourage him or her to target more victims.Do not delete or destroy any evidence of the blackmailing, such as messages, emails, photos, videos, etc. Preserve them as proof of the crime and the identity of the blackmailer.Report the blackmailer to the local police and file a complaint under sections 384 (extortion) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC. You can also file a complaint online at www.cybercrime.gov.in if the blackmailing is done through electronic means. Provide all the details and evidence of the blackmailing to the police and cooperate with their investigation.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Adding to a WhatsApp group without permission",
    "answer": "According to the WhatsApp group privacy settings, you can choose who can add you to groups without your consent. You can select one of the three options: “Nobody”, “My Contacts”, or “Everyone”. If you select “Nobody”, no one will be able to add you to a group except through an invitation link, which you can accept or reject. If you select “My Contacts”, only people in your contact list will be able to add you to a group without an invitation link. If you select “Everyone”, anyone can add you to a group without your consent.If someone has added you to a group without your permission, you can report the group to WhatsApp by following these steps:Open the group chat.Tap on the group subject.Scroll down and tap Report Group.Tap REPORT AND EXIT or REPORT AND BLOCK.This will send a report to WhatsApp and exit the group or block the admin.As for the legal aspect of adding someone to a WhatsApp group without their consent, there is no clear law in India that prohibits this act. However, if the group is used for spreading false or defamatory information, harassing or threatening someone, or violating someone’s privacy, then it may attract legal action under various sections of theIndian Penal Code(IPC) and the Information Technology (IT) Act.For example, if someone creates a WhatsApp group and adds women without their consent and sends them obscene messages or images, then it may amount to outraging their modesty under Section 354A of the IPC or sending sexually explicit material under Section 67A of the IT Act. Similarly, if someone creates a WhatsApp group and adds people without their consent and spreads rumours or fake news that cause public disorder or communal violence, then it may amount to creating enmity between different groups under Section 153A of the IPC or sending offensive messages under Section 66A of the IT Act.Therefore, depending on the nature and purpose of the WhatsApp group, adding someone without their consent may or may not be illegal in India. However, it is always advisable to respect the privacy and preferences of others and seek their permission before adding them to any group.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Adding to a WhatsApp group without permission",
    "answer": "Dear ClientThere were no specific Indian laws that directly addressed the act of adding someone to a WhatsApp group without their consent. However, this situation may involve several legal considerations:Privacy Concerns: Adding someone to a WhatsApp group without their consent may raise privacy concerns, especially if personal contact information is shared without permission. This could potentially be seen as an invasion of privacy, and individuals may have the right to take legal action if they believe their privacy has been violated.Cyberbullying or Harassment: If the addition to the group is part of a pattern of harassment, cyberbullying, or stalking, it may be possible to pursue legal action under the Information Technology Act, 2000, or other relevant laws.WhatsApp Policies: WhatsApp has its own policies regarding group creation and membership. Violating these policies could result in the user's account being restricted or banned. WhatsApp allows group admins to control who can join their groups, so individuals who have been added without consent can leave the group themselves.Consent: Consent is a fundamental principle in privacy and data protection. If someone's personal information, including their phone number, is being shared without their consent, it may be a breach of their privacy rights.To address this situation, individuals who have been added to the group without their consent can take the following steps:Leave the Group: WhatsApp allows users to leave groups they do not want to be part of. Simply tap on the group, go to Group Info, and choose the \"Exit Group\" option.Report to WhatsApp: Users can report the issue to WhatsApp by using the in-app reporting feature, which can be found in the group settings.Consult Legal Counsel: If the situation escalates and individuals believe their privacy has been violated or they are being harassed, they should consider consulting with a legal professional to explore potential legal actions based on existing laws related to privacy, harassment, or cyberbullying.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Cancelling an engagement",
    "answer": "Cancelling an engagement can be a difficult and emotional decision, and it may have legal consequences depending on the laws of the country where you live or where the engagement took place.I searched the web for some information on legal advice on cancelling an engagement in Turkey, and here are some of the results I found:As per legal information on family law in Turkey, there are two types of engagements: official and unofficial. An official engagement is registered at the civil registry office and requires the consent of both parties and their families. An unofficial engagement is based on a verbal or written agreement between the parties and does not have any legal status. If you cancel an official engagement, you may have to pay compensation for the expenses incurred by the other party for the wedding preparations, such as invitations, clothes, jewelry, etc. If you cancel an unofficial engagement, you may have to return the gifts that you received from the other party or their family, such as rings, money, etc. However, you are not obliged to pay any compensation for emotional damages or loss of reputation, unless there is a specific clause in your agreement that stipulates otherwise.If you cancel an engagement in India, you may face a civil suit for breach of promise to marry, which is a contractual obligation that can be enforced by the court. The other party may claim damages for the loss of marriage prospects, mental anguish, social stigma, etc. However, the court will consider various factors, such as the duration of the engagement, the reason for breaking it off, the conduct of both parties, etc., before awarding any compensation. Moreover, if you cancel an engagement after having sexual relations with the other party, you may also face a criminal charge of cheating or rape, depending on the circumstances and the consent of the parties involved.Based on these results, it seems that cancelling an engagement may have different legal implications depending on where it took place and what kind of agreement you had with your partner.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Cancelling an engagement",
    "answer": "Dear ClientEngagement Breakup: In India, engagements are not legally binding contracts. You are generally not obligated to pay compensation for emotional damages or accommodation expenses in case of a canceled engagement. However, Indian courts have sometimes awarded compensation in cases involving promises or agreements made during the engagement period, but this can vary based on the specific circumstances.Accommodation Expenses: Whether you are obligated to pay for her accommodation expenses in Turkey would depend on any prior agreements or arrangements you had. If you both agreed to share expenses during your stay in Turkey, you might be responsible for your share. However, if there was no such agreement, it may be challenging for her to legally claim compensation for accommodation.Emotional Damages: Proving emotional damages in Indian courts can be difficult. While emotional distress can be a factor in some cases, it's typically not easy to quantify or prove unless there was a specific action or event that caused severe emotional distress and can be legally proven.Financial Contributions: If you voluntarily contributed money to her during your relationship, it could be considered a gift unless there was a clear agreement or understanding that it would be repaid. Gifts, generally, cannot be legally reclaimed.Property Ownership: It's essential to understand the legal status of her property in India, such as the office building and the farmhouse. These assets may come into play if there are any financial disputes.Settlement Negotiations: It's often better to reach an amicable settlement outside of court to avoid prolonged legal battles. If you're willing to provide some financial support, you can negotiate with her to reach a mutually agreeable settlement amount that both parties find fair.Legal Advice: To get a clear understanding of your legal obligations and rights in this situation, it's strongly recommended that you consult with a qualified attorney in India. They can provide you with legal guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Undisclosed registered lease deed",
    "answer": "First of all, I would advise you to be very cautious and careful before proceeding with this transaction. The fact that the seller did not disclose the registered lease deed and its suspicious clauses is a red flag that indicates a possible fraud or hidden defect in the title of the property. You should also verify the authenticity and validity of the lease deed and the other documents related to the property. You should also check if there are any pending or potential disputes, claims, liens, court judgments, government actions, or any other encumbrances on the property. You should also consult a lawyer and get a legal opinion on the property before making any decision.Secondly, if you decide to proceed with this transaction and get a registered sale deed in your favour, you may have some rights as a bona fide purchaser for value without notice. According to the Indian law of property, a bona fide purchaser is a person who purchases property for a valid consideration without knowing of any other party’s claim to the title of that property. A bona fide purchaser can acquire a good title to the property even if the seller had a defective title or no title at all. However, this rule is not absolute and there are some exceptions and limitations to it.Some of the exceptions and limitations are as follows:The rule does not apply to properties that are subject to statutory restrictions or prohibitions on transfer, such as wakf properties, trust properties, enemy properties, etc.The rule does not apply to properties that are subject to public notice or registration requirements, such as properties under theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, the Registration Act, 1908, etc.The rule does not apply to properties that are subject to equitable interests or rights of third parties, such as mortgages, charges, easements, etc.The rule does not apply to properties that are subject to adverse possession or prescriptive rights of third parties.The rule does not apply to properties that are subject to fraud or collusion between the seller and the buyer or between the seller and the third party.The rule does not apply to properties that are subject to estoppel or waiver by the buyer or by the third party.Therefore, depending on the nature and circumstances of your case, you may or may not have a superior right over any other charges/claims/liens/court judgments/government actions that may arise in future. You should always seek legal advice and protection before entering into any transaction involving property.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Undisclosed registered lease deed",
    "answer": "Dear ClientHidden Lease Deed: The fact that the seller did not disclose the registered lease deed is a significant concern. It raises questions about their transparency and intentions. You should continue to investigate the purpose of this lease deed and consult with your lawyer to understand its potential impact on your property rights.Lease Terms and Unusual Clauses: The unusual terms and clauses in the lease deed, such as the extended duration and the inclusion of the husband, do raise suspicions. It's advisable to seek legal counsel to thoroughly review the lease deed and assess its implications on your property rights. Your lawyer can advise you on whether these clauses could pose future problems or if they can be challenged or invalidated.Proceeding with the Transaction: Your decision to proceed with the transaction should be based on a careful assessment of the risks and potential consequences. If you decide to proceed, consider negotiating with the seller to address your concerns or seek indemnities if issues arise from the hidden lease deed in the future. Make sure to consult with your lawyer on the best way to protect your interests in the transaction.Rights as a Bona Fide Purchaser: In India, a bona fide purchaser for value without notice can have certain protections. If you can demonstrate that you acted in good faith, paid a fair price, and had no knowledge of any encumbrances or adverse claims when you purchased the property, you may have priority over subsequent claims, liens, or judgments that arise after your purchase. However, the specific legal protection you have will depend on the circumstances and applicable laws, and your lawyer can provide more detailed guidance.Legal Due Diligence: Continue to conduct a thorough legal due diligence process with the assistance of your lawyer. Ensure that all necessary searches and investigations are completed to uncover any potential issues or claims on the property. This will help you make an informed decision about whether to proceed with the transaction.Ultimately, you should rely on the advice of your legal counsel to assess the risks associated with this property transaction, negotiate with the seller if necessary, and take appropriate steps to protect your interests. Property transactions can be complex, and legal guidance is crucial to navigate them successfully.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Being blackmailed by a lady",
    "answer": "Blackmailing is a form of extortion in which a person threatens to reveal or publicize some information that is damaging or embarrassing to another person, unless the latter complies with certain demands, such as money, sexual favors, or other benefits. Blackmailing is a criminal offense in India, punishable under sections 383 to 389 of theIndian Penal Code(IPC), 1860. The punishment for blackmailing can be imprisonment for up to three years, or fine, or both.Some of the steps that you can take to deal with blackmailing are as follows:Do not panic or give in to the blackmailer’s demands. Paying the blackmailer may not stop him or her from asking for more money or favors, or from releasing the information anyway. It may also encourage him or her to target more victims.Do not delete or destroy any evidence of the blackmailing, such as messages, emails, photos, videos, etc. Preserve them as proof of the crime and the identity of the blackmailer.Report the blackmailer to the local police and file a complaint under sections 384 (extortion) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC. You can also file a complaint online at www.cybercrime.gov.in if the blackmailing is done through electronic means. Provide all the details and evidence of the blackmailing to the police and cooperate with their investigation.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

You may also need to ensure that the celebration does not disturb the academic activities or discipline of the school.

She may also accuse you of violating her rights or harassing her or your child.Your child may be confused or upset by seeing you and your wife in conflict and may not enjoy the celebration. He or she may also feel pressured or guilty to choose between you and your wife.The school authorities may be reluctant or hesitant to allow you to celebrate your child’s birthday in school, as they may not want to get involved in your personal or legal matters. They may also fear any trouble or disturbance that may arise from your visit.To answer your specific questions:How should i approach school that i want to celebrate my child birthday in recess and what could be the legal implications of it?You should approach the school in a polite and respectful manner and request them to grant you permission to celebrate your child’s birthday in recess.

You should also assure them that you will not cause any trouble or inconvenience to the school or anyone else. You should also provide them with all the details and documents that they may require for verification or approval.The legal implications of celebrating your child’s birthday in school may depend on various factors, such as the status of your case, the orders of the court, the consent of your wife, etc. Generally, there is no legal prohibition on celebrating your child’s birthday in school, as long as you do not violate any law or court order or infringe on anyone’s rights.

The court may grant you permission to meet your child on his birthday in school, subject to certain conditions and restrictions. The court may also order your wife to cooperate with you and not interfere with your visit. The court may also consider your request as a positive sign of your interest and involvement in your child’s welfare.My wife also teaches in same school and also giving montlhy 7k for last 1 year even without court order as responisibilityThis information may not have much relevance or impact on your request to celebrate your child’s birthday in school.
