    "answer": "Since you have agreed to the conditions and entered into a registered sale agreement with the builder, you are bound by the conditions stipulated therein.The cost of transfer would be heavy when you work it out @100/-sq ft.This is a kind of exploitation if you would opt for sale without having a registered title on your name and since this is a vital condition you are helpless to the situation.No doubt this appears to be one sided condition but what can you do about it at this stage.You can fight against it through consumer commission but it's a time consuming process besides there's no guarantee for a favorable decision.Alternately, you can wait for the registration of sale deed in your favour and then you can get the transfer by sale by getting NOC from society which will save you a big amount.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "My wife is getting abusive verbally and a little physically",
    "answer": "Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is a mental condition that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. People with NPD have an inflated sense of self-importance, a deep need for admiration, and a lack of empathy for others. They often exploit, manipulate, and hurt the people closest to them, such as their spouses, children, and family members.Living with a narcissistic spouse can be very stressful and damaging to your mental health and well-being. You may experience emotional abuse, verbal abuse, physical abuse, or financial abuse from your spouse. You may also feel isolated, lonely, guilty, ashamed, or worthless because of their constant criticism, blame, and contempt. You may lose your sense of identity, self-esteem, and self-respect because of their control and domination.However, you do not have to suffer in silence or endure this abuse forever. You have the right to protect yourself and your child from harm and seek happiness and peace in your life. You have the power to change your situation and reclaim your dignity and freedom.Here are some steps that you can take to deal with your narcissistic wife and improve your situation:Seek professional help. The first and most important step is to seek help from a qualified mental health professional who can provide you with counseling, therapy, support, and guidance. A therapist can help you cope with your emotions, heal from the trauma, and regain your confidence and self-worth. A therapist can also help you understand the nature of NPD and how it affects your spouse’s behavior and your relationship. A therapist can also help you decide whether to stay in the marriage or leave it.Educate yourself. The second step is to educate yourself about NPD and how to deal with it. You can read books, articles, blogs, or watch videos on this topic. You can also join online forums or support groups where you can share your experiences and learn from others who have faced similar situations. You can also consult a lawyer or a legal aid service to know your rights and options regarding divorce, custody, alimony, etc.Set boundaries. The third step is to set clear and firm boundaries with your spouse and stick to them. Boundaries are the rules or limits that you establish to protect yourself from harm and disrespect. You need to communicate your boundaries to your spouse and let them know what you will and will not tolerate from them. For example, you can tell them that you will not accept any verbal or physical abuse, that you will not give them money unless they contribute to the household expenses, that you will not let them interfere with your parenting decisions, etc. You also need to enforce your boundaries by taking action if they violate them. For example, you can hang up the phone, walk away, call the police, or file a complaint if they abuse you.Practice self-care. The fourth step is to practice self-care and take care of your physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual needs. Self-care is the act of doing things that make you feel good, healthy, happy, and relaxed. You need to prioritize your own well-being over pleasing your spouse or meeting their demands. You need to do things that nourish your body, mind, soul, and heart. For example, you can eat well, exercise regularly, sleep enough, meditate daily, pursue your hobbies or passions,Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

State of Haryana, a two-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court declared “power of attorney” sales to be an invalid mode of property transfer. Therefore, POA cannot be done your case. If one gets property through the PoA then mutation will not take place in municipal and revenue records as a PoA doesn't give ownership rights to the agent in whose favour the instrument has been made. In other words, any person who buys a property through a PoA may have the 'possession' of the property but in the absence of a genuine registered sale deed he would not be considered as the rightful legal owner of the said property.Under Muslim law no person is entitled to make will or gift of the whole property. Only for 1/3 property it can be done. Limitations are imposed in making will or gift. The reason being to pay the respect to the word of prophet in order to ensure the shares of the legal heirs.Signature of your siblings are not required in case of gift or will.  A Muslim may transfer his property in various ways. One of such way is Hiba. Hiba is a transfer of property in the form of gift governed as per Muslim Law. A transfer of gift is regulated byTransfer of Property Act,1882. However, there are many limitations on this act as Muslim Law prevails over this law to maintain the religious freedom. Hon’ble High Court of Kerela speaking through Hon'ble MR. Justice P. Bhavadasan in the case of Salekath Beevi v. Mumthas Beevi stated \"Hiba is an immediate and unconditional transfer of the corpus of the property without any return. Every Muslim, who has attained majority and has a sound mind can make a gift\".

Therefore, POA cannot be done your case. If one gets property through the PoA then mutation will not take place in municipal and revenue records as a PoA doesn't give ownership rights to the agent in whose favour the instrument has been made. In other words, any person who buys a property through a PoA may have the 'possession' of the property but in the absence of a genuine registered sale deed he would not be considered as the rightful legal owner of the said property.Under Muslim law no person is entitled to make will or gift of the whole property. Only for 1/3 property it can be done. Limitations are imposed in making will or gift. The reason being to pay the respect to the word of prophet in order to ensure the shares of the legal heirs.Signature of your siblings are not required in case of gift or will.  A Muslim may transfer his property in various ways. One of such way is Hiba. Hiba is a transfer of property in the form of gift governed as per Muslim Law. A transfer of gift is regulated byTransfer of Property Act,1882. However, there are many limitations on this act as Muslim Law prevails over this law to maintain the religious freedom. Hon’ble High Court of Kerela speaking through Hon'ble MR. Justice P. Bhavadasan in the case of Salekath Beevi v. Mumthas Beevi stated \"Hiba is an immediate and unconditional transfer of the corpus of the property without any return. Every Muslim, who has attained majority and has a sound mind can make a gift\".

    "question": "Property related legal question",
    "answer": "Power of Attorney (POA):You can obtain a Power of Attorney from your mother to manage the property. A POA allows you to act on her behalf.The process for acquiring a POA can vary, but it typically involves drafting a legal document specifying the powers granted.The necessity for your siblings to sign or witness the document may depend on the specific terms and local regulations. Consulting a local lawyer is advisable.Gift Deed:If your mother wishes to gift the property to you, you can create a Gift Deed. The associated registration fees and costs vary and are subject to state-specific rules.The involvement of your siblings in signing or witnessing the document may be required in some cases.Will:Creating a will is a way to specify how the property will be distributed after your mother's passing. Your siblings may not necessarily need to sign the will, but it's advisable to consult with a legal expert to ensure its validity.Bank Loan:Having a Power of Attorney may allow you to secure a bank loan against the property, but this can vary based on the bank's policies and the terms of the POA.The involvement of your siblings in signing the loan documents might depend on the bank's requirements and whether they have any legal claim to the property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Partition suit pending for final decree",
    "answer": "In a partition case, a preliminary decree is followed by a final decree that divides the property among co-owners. Your preliminary decree, issued in 2018, granted you a 4/7th (57.15%) share, while the other six co-owners received 7.15% each. However, you've observed construction activities on the property by co-owners holding a collective 42.85% share. You obtained a court-issued stay order, restraining further construction, and have informed the police and municipal authorities. You're located in Chennai, while the property is in Rajasthan, around 2500 km away. You have several questions:Impact of Present Construction:Allowing the ongoing construction could potentially harm your interests, as the new structure's valuation may affect the property's auction price.Property's Status Quo:You mentioned that the property has existed for more than 64 years, implying that the superstructure has fully depreciated. However, the concept of status quo pertains to the property's current physical condition and legal standing, which can change over time due to various factors.Lack of Objections by Co-Owners:Your notice about the construction did not receive objections or attempts to halt it from other co-owners. This, in your view, suggests their complicity in the ongoing construction.Demarcation Challenges:If metes and bounds demarcation of the property isn't feasible, auction may be the only viable solution.Online Case Contestation from Chennai:Whether you can contest the case online from Chennai depends on the nature of your case and the court's available online facilities. E-filing and virtual courts are potential options for online case participation. You'll need to check with the specific court where your case is pending to determine if these options are available.Overall, your concerns are valid, especially regarding the potential impact of the construction on the property's valuation and the need to proceed with an auction. However, the legal processes and options available to you will depend on the specific circumstances of your case and the jurisdiction of the court involved.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "1. Instead of obtaining a power of attorney from your mother, you may better get it transferred to your name by your mother executing a registered settlement deed by retaining life interest in the proeprty. Your brother and sister can sign as attesting witness to this registered settlement deed, which will doubly confirm that they were very well in the knowledge of this transfer.The POA deed stands automatically cancelled upon the death of the principal.2.  The stamp duty would be heavy for execution of gift duty when compared to that of the settlement deed, because the settlement deed is executed between the blood relations, hence it would be advisable that a settlement deed may be executed to effect this transfer as advised in the point number one above.3. Unfortunately by a Will, your mother can transfer only one third of her property in favor of the beneficiary as per muslim personal law. Under Muslim law no person is entitled to make will of the whole property.  Limitations are imposed in making will.  Therefore it is not an advisable mode of transfer of entire proeprty in your favor.4.

    "question": "My wife is getting abusive verbally and a little physically",
    "answer": "Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is a mental condition that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. People with NPD have an inflated sense of self-importance, a deep need for admiration, and a lack of empathy for others. They often exploit, manipulate, and hurt the people closest to them, such as their spouses, children, and family members.Living with a narcissistic spouse can be very stressful and damaging to your mental health and well-being. You may experience emotional abuse, verbal abuse, physical abuse, or financial abuse from your spouse. You may also feel isolated, lonely, guilty, ashamed, or worthless because of their constant criticism, blame, and contempt. You may lose your sense of identity, self-esteem, and self-respect because of their control and domination.However, you do not have to suffer in silence or endure this abuse forever. You have the right to protect yourself and your child from harm and seek happiness and peace in your life. You have the power to change your situation and reclaim your dignity and freedom.Here are some steps that you can take to deal with your narcissistic wife and improve your situation:Seek professional help. The first and most important step is to seek help from a qualified mental health professional who can provide you with counseling, therapy, support, and guidance. A therapist can help you cope with your emotions, heal from the trauma, and regain your confidence and self-worth. A therapist can also help you understand the nature of NPD and how it affects your spouse’s behavior and your relationship. A therapist can also help you decide whether to stay in the marriage or leave it.Educate yourself. The second step is to educate yourself about NPD and how to deal with it. You can read books, articles, blogs, or watch videos on this topic. You can also join online forums or support groups where you can share your experiences and learn from others who have faced similar situations. You can also consult a lawyer or a legal aid service to know your rights and options regarding divorce, custody, alimony, etc.Set boundaries. The third step is to set clear and firm boundaries with your spouse and stick to them. Boundaries are the rules or limits that you establish to protect yourself from harm and disrespect. You need to communicate your boundaries to your spouse and let them know what you will and will not tolerate from them. For example, you can tell them that you will not accept any verbal or physical abuse, that you will not give them money unless they contribute to the household expenses, that you will not let them interfere with your parenting decisions, etc. You also need to enforce your boundaries by taking action if they violate them. For example, you can hang up the phone, walk away, call the police, or file a complaint if they abuse you.Practice self-care. The fourth step is to practice self-care and take care of your physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual needs. Self-care is the act of doing things that make you feel good, healthy, happy, and relaxed. You need to prioritize your own well-being over pleasing your spouse or meeting their demands. You need to do things that nourish your body, mind, soul, and heart. For example, you can eat well, exercise regularly, sleep enough, meditate daily, pursue your hobbies or passions,Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Quiting the Directorship of company",
    "answer": "It's standard to give two weeks' notice when you resign, but when you're in a position of authority, it can be wise to provide your old company with more time to find a replacement.A new Director has to be appointed before the resignation of the existing director. For the simple reason , that the Companies Act mandates that there will be minimum of two directors at any time in a private limited Company.Practically, if you file a DIR -12 in the above situation, the DIR-12 will not be accepted by MCA quoting the requirement of minimum number of 2 Directors required under the Act..A Director can resign from the company at any time as per section 168 . The company may fill the resulting casual vacancy as per section 161(4) in case an additional director can not be brought. However , no time limit has been mentioned in the section 161(4) for filling up the resulting vacancy.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Dear client,In the context of society redevelopment, the consideration of area and how it impacts the distribution of benefits can be complex and may depend on the society's bylaws, redevelopment agreement, and local regulations.Calculation of Area for Proposal:Typically, during the proposal phase for redevelopment, the society should consider the total area of each flat, including any balconies or extra spaces, as per the society's bylaws or agreement with the developer. This will form the basis for determining the benefits each member will receive after redevelopment.Challenging the Decision:If the society passes a resolution regarding area calculations and a member believes it is unfair, they may challenge this decision. The process for challenging such a decision is usually governed by the society's bylaws and the local cooperative housing society regulations.Generally, the member can raise their concerns and objections during society meetings or general body meetings. If the issue remains unresolved, they may consider legal action or dispute resolution mechanisms as provided by the cooperative housing society regulations.Appropriate Authority:The appropriate authority for challenging decisions within a cooperative housing society is often the Registrar of Cooperative Societies or the Cooperative Court, depending on your location. These authorities oversee cooperative society matters and disputes. Legal action, if necessary, would typically be filed with the Cooperative Court.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "My wife is getting abusive verbally and a little physically",
    "answer": "Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is a mental condition that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. People with NPD have an inflated sense of self-importance, a deep need for admiration, and a lack of empathy for others. They often exploit, manipulate, and hurt the people closest to them, such as their spouses, children, and family members.Living with a narcissistic spouse can be very stressful and damaging to your mental health and well-being. You may experience emotional abuse, verbal abuse, physical abuse, or financial abuse from your spouse. You may also feel isolated, lonely, guilty, ashamed, or worthless because of their constant criticism, blame, and contempt. You may lose your sense of identity, self-esteem, and self-respect because of their control and domination.However, you do not have to suffer in silence or endure this abuse forever. You have the right to protect yourself and your child from harm and seek happiness and peace in your life. You have the power to change your situation and reclaim your dignity and freedom.Here are some steps that you can take to deal with your narcissistic wife and improve your situation:Seek professional help. The first and most important step is to seek help from a qualified mental health professional who can provide you with counseling, therapy, support, and guidance. A therapist can help you cope with your emotions, heal from the trauma, and regain your confidence and self-worth. A therapist can also help you understand the nature of NPD and how it affects your spouse’s behavior and your relationship. A therapist can also help you decide whether to stay in the marriage or leave it.Educate yourself. The second step is to educate yourself about NPD and how to deal with it. You can read books, articles, blogs, or watch videos on this topic. You can also join online forums or support groups where you can share your experiences and learn from others who have faced similar situations. You can also consult a lawyer or a legal aid service to know your rights and options regarding divorce, custody, alimony, etc.Set boundaries. The third step is to set clear and firm boundaries with your spouse and stick to them. Boundaries are the rules or limits that you establish to protect yourself from harm and disrespect. You need to communicate your boundaries to your spouse and let them know what you will and will not tolerate from them. For example, you can tell them that you will not accept any verbal or physical abuse, that you will not give them money unless they contribute to the household expenses, that you will not let them interfere with your parenting decisions, etc. You also need to enforce your boundaries by taking action if they violate them. For example, you can hang up the phone, walk away, call the police, or file a complaint if they abuse you.Practice self-care. The fourth step is to practice self-care and take care of your physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual needs. Self-care is the act of doing things that make you feel good, healthy, happy, and relaxed. You need to prioritize your own well-being over pleasing your spouse or meeting their demands. You need to do things that nourish your body, mind, soul, and heart. For example, you can eat well, exercise regularly, sleep enough, meditate daily, pursue your hobbies or passions,Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear client,When lending a substantial amount of money to someone for the purpose of buying property in India, it's crucial to take proper legal precautions to protect your interests. Here are some options to consider:1. Loan Agreement:You should create a detailed loan agreement that outlines the terms and conditions of the loan, including the principal amount, interest rate (if any), repayment schedule, and consequences of default.Specify the currency in which the loan is to be repaid (USD in your case), and the repayment period (e.g., 10 years).Include clauses related to the consequences of non-payment, such as the right to take legal action to recover the loan.2. Mortgage Deed:A mortgage deed is a legal document that allows you to secure the loan against the property being purchased. If the borrower defaults, you can initiate foreclosure proceedings to recover the loan amount through the sale of the property.Consult with an Indian lawyer to draft a legally binding mortgage deed. Your presence in India or appointing a power of attorney may be necessary for the execution of this deed.3. Co-ownership or Joint Registry:A joint ownership arrangement allows you to be a co-owner of the property. You can either jointly own the property or hold a share in it.Consult with a legal expert to understand the implications of co-ownership and its potential tax implications in both India and the United States.As a US citizen, you may not need to have an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card to be a joint owner, but consult with a legal professional to confirm.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "My wife is getting abusive verbally and a little physically",
    "answer": "Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is a mental condition that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. People with NPD have an inflated sense of self-importance, a deep need for admiration, and a lack of empathy for others. They often exploit, manipulate, and hurt the people closest to them, such as their spouses, children, and family members.Living with a narcissistic spouse can be very stressful and damaging to your mental health and well-being. You may experience emotional abuse, verbal abuse, physical abuse, or financial abuse from your spouse. You may also feel isolated, lonely, guilty, ashamed, or worthless because of their constant criticism, blame, and contempt. You may lose your sense of identity, self-esteem, and self-respect because of their control and domination.However, you do not have to suffer in silence or endure this abuse forever. You have the right to protect yourself and your child from harm and seek happiness and peace in your life. You have the power to change your situation and reclaim your dignity and freedom.Here are some steps that you can take to deal with your narcissistic wife and improve your situation:Seek professional help. The first and most important step is to seek help from a qualified mental health professional who can provide you with counseling, therapy, support, and guidance. A therapist can help you cope with your emotions, heal from the trauma, and regain your confidence and self-worth. A therapist can also help you understand the nature of NPD and how it affects your spouse’s behavior and your relationship. A therapist can also help you decide whether to stay in the marriage or leave it.Educate yourself. The second step is to educate yourself about NPD and how to deal with it. You can read books, articles, blogs, or watch videos on this topic. You can also join online forums or support groups where you can share your experiences and learn from others who have faced similar situations. You can also consult a lawyer or a legal aid service to know your rights and options regarding divorce, custody, alimony, etc.Set boundaries. The third step is to set clear and firm boundaries with your spouse and stick to them. Boundaries are the rules or limits that you establish to protect yourself from harm and disrespect. You need to communicate your boundaries to your spouse and let them know what you will and will not tolerate from them. For example, you can tell them that you will not accept any verbal or physical abuse, that you will not give them money unless they contribute to the household expenses, that you will not let them interfere with your parenting decisions, etc. You also need to enforce your boundaries by taking action if they violate them. For example, you can hang up the phone, walk away, call the police, or file a complaint if they abuse you.Practice self-care. The fourth step is to practice self-care and take care of your physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual needs. Self-care is the act of doing things that make you feel good, healthy, happy, and relaxed. You need to prioritize your own well-being over pleasing your spouse or meeting their demands. You need to do things that nourish your body, mind, soul, and heart. For example, you can eat well, exercise regularly, sleep enough, meditate daily, pursue your hobbies or passions,Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "United States citizen helping someone to buy property in India",
    "answer": "Dear client,When lending a substantial amount of money to someone for the purpose of buying property in India, it's crucial to take proper legal precautions to protect your interests. Here are some options to consider:1. Loan Agreement:You should create a detailed loan agreement that outlines the terms and conditions of the loan, including the principal amount, interest rate (if any), repayment schedule, and consequences of default.Specify the currency in which the loan is to be repaid (USD in your case), and the repayment period (e.g., 10 years).Include clauses related to the consequences of non-payment, such as the right to take legal action to recover the loan.2. Mortgage Deed:A mortgage deed is a legal document that allows you to secure the loan against the property being purchased. If the borrower defaults, you can initiate foreclosure proceedings to recover the loan amount through the sale of the property.Consult with an Indian lawyer to draft a legally binding mortgage deed. Your presence in India or appointing a power of attorney may be necessary for the execution of this deed.3. Co-ownership or Joint Registry:A joint ownership arrangement allows you to be a co-owner of the property. You can either jointly own the property or hold a share in it.Consult with a legal expert to understand the implications of co-ownership and its potential tax implications in both India and the United States.As a US citizen, you may not need to have an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card to be a joint owner, but consult with a legal professional to confirm.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

These should be outlined in your account agreement.Contact Bank Officially: Request a detailed explanation from the bank in writing for the charges and why they were not closed or made dormant. Make sure to keep records of all correspondence.Negotiate: Try negotiating with the bank to waive or reduce the penalty, especially if you are closing the account. Sometimes, banks may be willing to work with customers in such cases.Consult Legal Advice: If the bank doesn't provide a satisfactory resolution, you may want to consult with a lawyer who specializes in banking or consumer law to explore your legal options.Complain to Regulatory Authorities: In India, you can also consider filing a complaint with the Banking Ombudsman, who handles customer complaints against banks. The Banking Ombudsman is appointed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).It's essential to keep all documentation related to your account and any interactions with the bank.

    "answer": "1.Specific cases are mentioned under the GST law where no input tax credit shall be available for claims to the taxpayer.  ITC cannot be claimed if it is restricted in GSTR-2B available under Section 38 of the GST Act. Section 38 is completely revamped as ‘Communication of details of inward supplies and input tax credit’ in line with the Form GSTR-2B.2. Since the implementation of GST, it has been clear that health care services provided by an authorised medical practitioner or para medics through a clinical establishment are exempt vide Notification No. 12/2017-Central tax (Rate) dated [deleted]. But there have been certain grey areas in health care services regarding the availability of Input Tax Credit ) on certain supplies that needed a crystal-clear approach to be a compliant taxpayer.Advance ruling aimed at determining whether ITC is required to be restricted on medicines supplied to three types of a person :1)Supply of medicine to In-patients: ITC is required to be restricted on medicines used in the supply of health care services provided to admitted patients.2.2)Supply of medicine to Out-patients:This kind of supply involves 2 transactions:Sale of medicine from the pharmacy counter of the applicant:Medicine forming a part of health care servicesThe ITC is required to be restricted on medicines that are consumed in the provision of health care service and the output is health care service only which is exempt from tax.3. Supply of medicine to customers:The ITC is not required to be restricted on medicines supplied to a customer as there is no health care services provided and is liable to pay tax on the outward supply of medicines.The medicines are used in course of furtherance of business as per section 16 and are not blocked credit under section 17(5) (g) , consequently the applicant is eligible for ITC on inward supply of medicines under section 16(1) subject to fulfillment of rules 36 to 45 of CGST Rules.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Input Tax Credit on Business Purchases Done by Director of Company",
    "answer": "In India, Input Tax Credit (ITC) is governed by the Goods and Services Tax (GST) laws. When a business entity, such as your company, wants to claim ITC on purchases, certain conditions must be met:Recipient of Goods or Services: ITC can only be claimed by the registered recipient of goods or services. In your case, the company is the intended recipient.Tax Invoice in the Name of the Registered Entity: The tax invoice for the purchased goods or services should be in the name of the registered entity that intends to claim the ITC. In your case, the tax invoices should be in the name of the company, not in the Director's name.Compliance with GST Law: The company should be registered under GST and should be in compliance with GST law.Based on these conditions, it is typically not possible to claim ITC on purchases made under the license held in the Director's name. The ITC can generally only be claimed if the tax invoices are issued in the name of the registered company. This is to prevent misuse and ensure that the ITC is appropriately accounted for.To claim ITC and conduct business under the company's umbrella, you should consider the following steps:Transfer Ownership: Consider transferring the ownership of the drug store license from the Director's name to the company's name.Reissue Invoices: Ensure that all invoices for medicines and purchases are issued in the name of the company, not the Director.Registration under GST: If not already done, ensure that the company is registered under GST.Maintain Proper Records: Keep accurate records of all transactions, invoices, and ITC claims for future tax assessments.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Inheritance of property from an Indian citizen by an American citizen with OCI status",
    "answer": "When it comes to inheritance of property in India by a foreign national or a person of Indian origin, there are specific regulations and restrictions under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) and other laws. I'll address your queries step by step:Ownership by OCI: An Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) can inherit any immovable property in India, be it agricultural, residential, or commercial. However, while you can inherit and own agricultural land, you cannot purchase it directly. In your case, since you are inheriting it through a will, it's permissible.Will & Its Contestability: Your father's cousin can absolutely will his property to you. Having a well-drafted and registered will would strengthen the legitimacy of the transfer. But, like in many jurisdictions, a will can be contested in India. Common grounds for contesting include:The testator (person creating the will) was not of sound mind when the will was created.The will was made under duress or undue influence.The will is forged or tampered with.The testator did not follow the proper procedure in drafting or executing the will.Given the familial relationship and the fact that your father's cousin has children and grandchildren, there's a likelihood they may contest the will, especially if they feel they have been unfairly excluded.Chances in Court: It's hard to predict outcomes in legal cases since they depend heavily on the specifics. But if the will is drafted correctly, clearly specifies the intentions of your father's cousin, and if it can be established that he was of sound mind and not under undue influence when making the will, the chances of it being upheld are better. It would also be helpful if there are witnesses (preferably neutral parties) to the will's execution.Mortgaging the Property: This is a complex strategy and might not provide the security you're hoping for. If your father's cousin mortgages the property to you (with you acting as the lender), and his heirs later successfully contest the will, they'd inherit the property subject to the mortgage. This doesn't necessarily mean they would have to repay the mortgage immediately. Also, creating a mortgage for this purpose might be seen as an attempt to circumvent the law, which can have its own complications.Precautionary Measures:Ensure the will is drafted by an experienced attorney and the reasons for bequeathing the property to you are clearly laid out.It might also be a good idea for your father's cousin to discuss his intentions with his immediate family to mitigate any surprises and potential disputes later on.Consider the option of a \"testamentary trust\" where the property is held in trust with specific instructions on its use, disposal, or management.Finally, given the complexities involved, it's highly recommended you consult with a property lawyer who can provide guidance tailored to the specific circumstances.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Inheritance of property from an Indian citizen by an American citizen with OCI status",
    "answer": "1. a person can make a bequest of his property to any person of his choice by his Will2. it is not necessary that the beneficiary in the Will have to be the legal heirs of the person3. so the person can make a bequest even in favour of a foreigner4. if the person has already given some properties in his lifetime to his children/grandchildren, then that factum ought to be mentioned in the Will to justify the exclusion of the children/grandchildren from the Will and to avert any possibility of the Will being challenged on the ground that it is unnatural since it unjustly excludes the legal heirs5. the Will is not required to be registered under the law. Even if it is registered, the formal proof of due execution of the Will would still have to be discharged by the person who relies on such Will or who propounds such Will. Registering the Will does not give it any more legitimacy than when the Will would be unregistered. So registration not being the requirement of law, can be skipped completely6. asking questions like - what are the chances of the heirs winning - is completely illogical since that cannot be predicted by an advocate. What if the advocate says that there is no chance of the heirs winning, but the heirs in fact win the case? In that case will you hold the advocate responsible? Predicting is the job of an astrologer and not of an advocate.7. mortgaging the property with the proposed legatee will not serve any purpose. In fact it will backfire. So it will be a futile exercise.8. the Will can be made in any language known to the testator. It has to be signed by the testator in front of 2 witnesses. It is not necessary that both the witnesses are present together at the time the testator signs his Will. The requirement is that the witness must have seen the testator sign his Will in the presence of the witness.9. the witnesses can also be any person who know the testator and who can depose and testify that when he testator signed his Will he was in a sound and disposing state of mind10. attaching a doctor's certificate to the Will to show that the testator has a sound state of mind, is completely optional and is not a requirement under the lawYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Current Account",
    "answer": "Banks typically have policies in place regarding minimum balance requirements and penalties for not maintaining them. It's important to note that these policies can vary between banks.Here are some steps you can consider:Review Bank Policies: Look into the terms and conditions of your SBI account to understand their minimum balance requirements and penalty charges. These should be outlined in your account agreement.Contact Bank Officially: Request a detailed explanation from the bank in writing for the charges and why they were not closed or made dormant. Make sure to keep records of all correspondence.Negotiate: Try negotiating with the bank to waive or reduce the penalty, especially if you are closing the account. Sometimes, banks may be willing to work with customers in such cases.Consult Legal Advice: If the bank doesn't provide a satisfactory resolution, you may want to consult with a lawyer who specializes in banking or consumer law to explore your legal options.Complain to Regulatory Authorities: In India, you can also consider filing a complaint with the Banking Ombudsman, who handles customer complaints against banks. The Banking Ombudsman is appointed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).It's essential to keep all documentation related to your account and any interactions with the bank. Bank policies and regulations can change, so consulting with a legal expert who can provide advice specific to your situation is advisable.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In case of borrowing in INR from NRIs/PIOs, these terms and conditions need to be complied with...* Borrowing shall be only on a non-repatriation basis.* The amount of loan should be received either by inward remittance from outside India or by debit to the NRE/NRO/FCNR(B)/NRNR/NRSR account of the lender, maintained with an authorized dealer/bank in India.* The period of loan shall not exceed three years.* The rate of interest on the loan shall not be more than 2% above the bank rate prevailing on the date of taking the loan.* The payment of interest and repayment of principal shall be made only to the NRO account of the lender.The terms and conditions are prescribed under the Foreign Exchange Management (Borrowing and Lending) Regulations, 2018, for borrowing in foreign currency from NRIs/PIOs. However, a loan from a foreign national in favour of an Indian citizen under the automatic route may not be possible.Since there are restrictions to lend as mentioned above, you may better lend the amount through your close relatives under a mortgage loan which will be very safe especially if he fails to return the amount, his property can be brought to sale and money can be recovered.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "United States citizen helping someone to buy property in India",
    "answer": "Dear client,When lending a substantial amount of money to someone for the purpose of buying property in India, it's crucial to take proper legal precautions to protect your interests. Here are some options to consider:1. Loan Agreement:You should create a detailed loan agreement that outlines the terms and conditions of the loan, including the principal amount, interest rate (if any), repayment schedule, and consequences of default.Specify the currency in which the loan is to be repaid (USD in your case), and the repayment period (e.g., 10 years).Include clauses related to the consequences of non-payment, such as the right to take legal action to recover the loan.2. Mortgage Deed:A mortgage deed is a legal document that allows you to secure the loan against the property being purchased. If the borrower defaults, you can initiate foreclosure proceedings to recover the loan amount through the sale of the property.Consult with an Indian lawyer to draft a legally binding mortgage deed. Your presence in India or appointing a power of attorney may be necessary for the execution of this deed.3. Co-ownership or Joint Registry:A joint ownership arrangement allows you to be a co-owner of the property. You can either jointly own the property or hold a share in it.Consult with a legal expert to understand the implications of co-ownership and its potential tax implications in both India and the United States.As a US citizen, you may not need to have an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card to be a joint owner, but consult with a legal professional to confirm.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,In the context of society redevelopment, the consideration of area and how it impacts the distribution of benefits can be complex and may depend on the society's bylaws, redevelopment agreement, and local regulations.Calculation of Area for Proposal:Typically, during the proposal phase for redevelopment, the society should consider the total area of each flat, including any balconies or extra spaces, as per the society's bylaws or agreement with the developer. This will form the basis for determining the benefits each member will receive after redevelopment.Challenging the Decision:If the society passes a resolution regarding area calculations and a member believes it is unfair, they may challenge this decision. The process for challenging such a decision is usually governed by the society's bylaws and the local cooperative housing society regulations.Generally, the member can raise their concerns and objections during society meetings or general body meetings. If the issue remains unresolved, they may consider legal action or dispute resolution mechanisms as provided by the cooperative housing society regulations.Appropriate Authority:The appropriate authority for challenging decisions within a cooperative housing society is often the Registrar of Cooperative Societies or the Cooperative Court, depending on your location. These authorities oversee cooperative society matters and disputes. Legal action, if necessary, would typically be filed with the Cooperative Court.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In real estate development, an escrow account offers financial security and transparency; however, to safeguard the interests of buyers, a carefully drafted contract and expert advice are necessary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The final decree will specify how the land is to be divided.If one of the brothers objects to the partition plans proposed by the collector, it may cause delays. However, the court's final decree should provide a clear plan for division, and objections might need to be addressed through legal means.The division by the collector should provide separate 7/12 documents for each brother, indicating their individual ownership shares.The timeline for the collector to divide the land can vary. It depends on various factors, including the workload of the collector's office and the complexity of the division.

    "question": "Neigbour car Parking",
    "answer": "Dear client,Dear sir/madam,Your advocate can refer to these sections/laws:The National Urban Transport Policy (NUTP) of India devised by the Ministry of Urban Development in 2006 largely sets the tone for parking in India. It directs state governments to make suitable amendments to building rules to provide adequate parking spaces. The Municipal Corporation or the concerned city authorities have the mandate to govern both on-street and off-street parking. However, laws relating to parking are loosely set, based on guidelines and conviction of the local bodies since states have historically given less importance to parking while devising urban development plans.The Rules of the Road Regulations, 1989 state that when parking a vehicle it must be made sure that “it does not cause any danger, obstruction or inconvenience for other road users.”Clause 122 of the Motor Vehicles Act (1988) says that “no motor vehicle should be left on the public road in a dangerous position or in such a manner so as to cause inconvenience to other road users or abandoned.” This means that parking in front of a neighbor’s garage, double parking, parking on private property or public places not sanctioned for parking is against the law.Even places that are designated parking areas are not free of regulations; clause 126 of the Motor Vehicles Act states that “no motor vehicle should remain stationary in a public place unless there is a licensed driver in the vehicle or where the engine has stopped running, proper precautionary methods have been taken to ensure that the vehicle will not move accidentally in the absence of the driver.” Sloped roads or storefronts with “No Parking” signals are not fair game.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Bank has filed criminal case for loan default",
    "answer": "Loan default is generally a civil wrong, except in cases where there is fraudulent or dishonest intention on the part of the borrower at the time of availing the loan. The bank can file a civil suit against you for recovery of the loan amount, interest, and damages. The bank can also take possession of any collateral or security that you have pledged for the loan. However, the bank cannot file a criminal case against you for loan default, unless they can prove that you have cheated, misappropriated, or conspired to defraud them. The sections invoked by the bank are related to cheating, criminal breach of trust, cheating with knowledge of wrongful loss, cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property, cheating with intent to cause wrongful loss or wrongful gain, and criminal conspiracy. These are serious offences that can attract imprisonment and fine.However, it is possible that the bank is filing a false or frivolous criminal case against you to harass and intimidate you into paying the loan amount. This is an abuse of the process of law and a violation of your rights. You have the right to defend yourself against such false allegations and seek legal help.Here are some steps you can take to deal with this situation:Do not ignore the summon or warrant issued by the court. You must appear before the court on the date and time mentioned in the summon or warrant. If you fail to do so, you may be declared as an absconder or a proclaimed offender, which can worsen your situation.Seek legal advice from a lawyer who can guide you on how to deal with the criminal case and protect your rights and interests. You can also apply for anticipatory bail or regular bail if you are arrested or likely to be arrested.Challenge the jurisdiction of the court where the bank has filed the criminal case. If the court is in a different state 2000 km away from your and your business location, you can argue that it is inconvenient and unfair for you to attend the proceedings there. You can request the court to transfer the case to a court near your location or quash the case altogether.File a counter-complaint against the bank for filing a false and malicious criminal case against you. You can also file a complaint before the Banking Ombudsman or the Consumer Forum for redressal of your grievances. You can claim compensation for mental harassment, defamation, and violation of your rights.Negotiate with the bank for an amicable settlement of your loan account. You can explain your financial situation and offer to pay what you can afford. You can also request the bank to waive off some interest or penalty charges. You can seek the help of a mediator or a counsellor to facilitate the negotiation process.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "According to the Ministry of External Affairs, the registered rent agreement executed in favour of the tenant by the landlord can be accepted as a valid document for the proof of address at the time of submission of passport application. However, the rent agreement must be registered under Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908. The Ministry does not specify the number of witnesses required for the rent agreement, but it is advisable to have at least two witnesses as per the general practice.It is possible that your passport application was put on hold due to one less sign of witness in the rent agreement, if the Passport Issuing Authority (PIA) found it insufficient or invalid. The PIA has the discretion to accept or reject any document as proof of address. It is also possible that there was a mistake or oversight at counter A and token counter, where they did not check your rent agreement properly. The acknowledgement letter may not have any remark because it is a generic document that does not reflect the status of your application.To resolve this issue, you may have to contact the PIA and provide them with a valid rent agreement with two witnesses, or any other document that can prove your address, such as Aadhaar card, voter ID card, bank statement, etc. You may also have to submit a fresh passport application form with the correct documents.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

To address this issue, you should consider taking the following steps:Contact Passport Office: Reach out to the passport office where you submitted your application.

Make sure to follow the guidelines provided by the passport office.Review Acknowledgment Letter: Review the acknowledgment letter you received from the passport office carefully to ensure that all the submitted documents are in order. If there's no remark on the letter, it's possible that the issue was identified later in the process.Seek Assistance: If you encounter difficulties resolving the issue, consider seeking assistance from the passport office's customer service or support team.

    "question": "Sale deed using POA of Deceased Person",
    "answer": "According to the Supreme Court of India, a power of attorney (PoA) does not confer property title if a sale deed is not executed and registered to validate the PoA, and no action is taken by its holder. A PoA is merely a document that allows the principal to appoint another person as their agent, conferring authority on that agent to perform certain acts or functions on their behalf. A PoA is usually terminated when the principal dies or becomes incapacitated3.In your case, it seems that you executed a sale deed through a PoA of a deceased person, who was the land owner. This may not be a valid transaction, as the PoA would have become invalid after the death of the principal. The legal heirs of the deceased person would have inherited the property as per the law of succession. Therefore, you should have obtained the consent and signatures of all the legal heirs as sellers in the sale deed, not just as witnesses in the deed of confirmation. Their signature as mere witnesses would not suffice to transfer their rights and interests in the property.You may have to face legal challenges from the legal heir who wants to dispute the sale deed and demand extra money or share in land portion. You may have to prove that you acted in good faith and were not aware of the death of the donor at the time of executing the sale deed. You may also have to show that you paid a fair consideration for the property and that there was no fraud or coercion involved.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Sale deed using POA of Deceased Person",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, the sale of property through a power of attorney (POA) granted by a deceased person can be complex and may raise legal issues. Here are some points to consider:False Declaration: Making a false declaration about the donor (POA issuer) being alive during the sale deed registration is a legal issue. It may impact the validity of the sale deed.Legal Heirs' Confirmation: While you obtained a deed of confirmation from the legal heirs, it's essential to ensure the validity of this document. Their consent may not necessarily resolve the issue if there were discrepancies or misrepresentations in the original sale deed.Legal Action: If one of the legal heirs is challenging the sale deed, it's advisable to consult with a legal expert in India. They can provide specific advice based on the details of your case and the relevant property laws in your jurisdiction.Negotiation: If there's a dispute, it's often beneficial to explore negotiation and mediation options to resolve the matter without resorting to litigation.Document Review: Ensure that all documents, including the POA, sale deed, and the deed of confirmation, are thoroughly reviewed by a legal professional to assess their legality and validity.Legal Remedies: Consult an attorney to understand your legal rights and potential remedies.

    "question": "Relieving letter",
    "answer": "- As per the Employment Act, employees have the right to resign at any time, by serving notice or by compensating the employer with salary in lieu. It is an offence for employers to disallow employees to leave their job.- Further, the Supreme Court has declared in the judgment of the case titled as Sanjay Jain versus National Aviation Company of India Ltd, , that to resign is a right of an employee who cannot be forced to serve in case he is not willing until and unless there is some stipulation in the rules or in the terms of appointment or disciplinary proceedings is pending or contemplated which is sought to be avoided by resigning from the service.- Hence, if any disciplinary enquiry is going on against that employee, then only an employer can reject the resignation of an employee.- Since, there is no enquiry now , then they cannot refuse to relieve you and to issue a Relieving letter- Legally, in government job , the notice period is 90 days , and further you may be called by the competent authority to explain the reasons for the resignation , and thereby they will issue a Relieving letter to you.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "According to the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA), a builder can cancel the allotment of an apartment only in terms of the agreement for sale, and the buyer can approach the Real Estate Regulatory Authority for relief, if they are aggrieved by such cancellation and such cancellation is not in accordance with the terms of the agreement for sale, unilateral and without any sufficient cause. The builder is also bound by law to return the money collected from buyers within 45 days, after deducting the booking amountIn your case, it seems that the builder has violated the terms of the booking form and the sales agreement, which clearly stated the payment plan and the deal structure agreed by both parties. The builder cannot demand 20% of the payment within 21 days of booking, when you have already paid 12.5% as per the mutual agreement. The builder also cannot cancel the allotment without giving you a valid reason and a notice. The builder’s actions seem to be arbitrary and unfair, and may amount to deficiency of service and breach of contract.You have the right to challenge the cancellation of the allotment and seek refund of your money with interest and compensation. You can send a legal notice to the builder, demanding them to honour the agreement and restore your allotment, or to refund your money with interest and compensation. If the builder does not respond or comply, you can file a complaint against them before the Karnataka Real Estate Regulatory Authority (KRERA) under Section 31 of RERA. You can also file a complaint before the consumer forum under theConsumer Protection Act, 2019 for redressal of your grievances.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

Different states in India may have slightly different requirements.Bank Accounts and Property Rentals: Using a foreign marriage certificate for activities like opening a joint bank account or renting property may be possible, but it's recommended to check with the specific institutions or authorities involved. They may have their own requirements or procedures.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Sale deed using POA of Deceased Person",
    "answer": "According to the Supreme Court of India, a power of attorney (PoA) does not confer property title if a sale deed is not executed and registered to validate the PoA, and no action is taken by its holder. A PoA is merely a document that allows the principal to appoint another person as their agent, conferring authority on that agent to perform certain acts or functions on their behalf. A PoA is usually terminated when the principal dies or becomes incapacitated3.In your case, it seems that you executed a sale deed through a PoA of a deceased person, who was the land owner. This may not be a valid transaction, as the PoA would have become invalid after the death of the principal. The legal heirs of the deceased person would have inherited the property as per the law of succession. Therefore, you should have obtained the consent and signatures of all the legal heirs as sellers in the sale deed, not just as witnesses in the deed of confirmation. Their signature as mere witnesses would not suffice to transfer their rights and interests in the property.You may have to face legal challenges from the legal heir who wants to dispute the sale deed and demand extra money or share in land portion. You may have to prove that you acted in good faith and were not aware of the death of the donor at the time of executing the sale deed. You may also have to show that you paid a fair consideration for the property and that there was no fraud or coercion involved.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Sale deed using POA of Deceased Person",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, the sale of property through a power of attorney (POA) granted by a deceased person can be complex and may raise legal issues. Here are some points to consider:False Declaration: Making a false declaration about the donor (POA issuer) being alive during the sale deed registration is a legal issue. It may impact the validity of the sale deed.Legal Heirs' Confirmation: While you obtained a deed of confirmation from the legal heirs, it's essential to ensure the validity of this document. Their consent may not necessarily resolve the issue if there were discrepancies or misrepresentations in the original sale deed.Legal Action: If one of the legal heirs is challenging the sale deed, it's advisable to consult with a legal expert in India. They can provide specific advice based on the details of your case and the relevant property laws in your jurisdiction.Negotiation: If there's a dispute, it's often beneficial to explore negotiation and mediation options to resolve the matter without resorting to litigation.Document Review: Ensure that all documents, including the POA, sale deed, and the deed of confirmation, are thoroughly reviewed by a legal professional to assess their legality and validity.Legal Remedies: Consult an attorney to understand your legal rights and potential remedies. The outcome may vary based on the facts and circumstances of your case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "The builder has unilaterally cancelled the booking without any valid reason, hence he is liable either to set aside his decision to cancel the booking or to refund the entire booking amount with interest.You can make a complaint in this regard with the RERA or approach civil court to set aside the cancellation of the booking provided you produce documentary evidences for this cancellation.The promoter in addition to several other mandatory documents will have to submit a declaration, supported by an affidavit, stating that 70 percent of the amount realised for the real estate project from the buyers, from time to time, shall be deposited in a separate account to be maintained by a scheduled bank to cover the cost of construction and the land cost and shall be used only for that purpose.RERA Act as it stands today, says, \"The account has to be self-maintained and is not an escrow account requiring the approval of the Authority for withdrawal.\"\"In RERA, escrow and separate accounts mean one and the same thing\"The withdrawal from the separate account will have to be in proportion to the percentage of completion of the project after it is certified by an engineer, an architect and a chartered accountant that the withdrawal is in proportion to the percentage of completion of the project.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "According to the Indian law, a marriage can be registered under either of the two Marriage Acts: theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 or theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954. TheHindu Marriage Actis applicable to Hindus, whereas theSpecial Marriage Actis applicable to all citizens of India irrespective of their religion. The Supreme Court of India has held that marriages of Indians solemnized in foreign countries are valid in India if they are performed according to the law of that country.online marriages, also known as virtual marriages or e-marriages, were not widely recognized in India. In India, marriage is primarily governed by personal laws based on one's religion, and the process of solemnizing a marriage typically involves physical presence before the marriage registrar or religious authority, along with the fulfillment of certain legal requirements. However, it's important to note that laws and regulations can change over time, and there may have been developments or changes in Indian marriage laws since my last update. Additionally, the recognition of online marriages can vary from one Indian state or union territory to another, as some states may have different interpretations or policies regarding such marriages.Therefore, if you and your fiance are planning to get married online through a platform called courtley, which provides a valid marriage certificate issued by USA government authorities, you may not be able to use it as a proof of your marital status in India. You may have to register your marriage in India under theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, which allows for marriages between Indian citizens and foreign nationals. You may also have to get an apostille stamp on your USA marriage certificate, which is a form of authentication issued by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) for documents that are intended for use in Hague Convention countries. An apostille stamp verifies the authenticity of your document and makes it acceptable in other countries.To register your marriage in India, you may have to follow these steps:Fill an online application form on the website of the Registrar General of Marriages.Submit the required documents, such as passport copies, visa copies, birth certificates, address proofs, photographs, etc.Pay the prescribed fee online or offline.Book an appointment for verification and registration at the nearest marriage office.Appear before the marriage officer along with your fiance and two witnesses on the appointed date and time.Sign the declaration form and receive your marriage certificate.To get an apostille stamp on your USA marriage certificate, you may have to follow these steps:Get your USA marriage certificate authenticated by the Secretary of State of the state where it was issued.Send your authenticated USA marriage certificate along with a photocopy of your passport and a self-addressed envelope to the MEA Branch Secretariat in New Delhi or any other city where it is located.Pay the prescribed fee online or offline.Receive your apostilled USA marriage certificate by mail or courier.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear client,In India, the validity of a marriage certificate issued by foreign authorities, including those from the USA, depends on whether it complies with Indian laws and regulations. Here are some key points to consider:Validity of Foreign Marriage Certificates: In India, foreign marriage certificates are generally recognized if they are issued by competent authorities in the foreign country and are in compliance with Indian laws.Apostille Stamp: To use a foreign marriage certificate in India, it may need to be apostilled. An apostille is a form of authentication that verifies the legitimacy of the document for use in a foreign country. The requirement for an apostille can vary depending on the state or Union Territory in India, so it's advisable to check with the local authorities in the specific location where you intend to use the certificate.Specific Indian Laws: India has its own set of laws governing marriage, and the recognition of a foreign marriage certificate may also depend on the specific circumstances and legal requirements. Different states in India may have slightly different requirements.Bank Accounts and Property Rentals: Using a foreign marriage certificate for activities like opening a joint bank account or renting property may be possible, but it's recommended to check with the specific institutions or authorities involved.

However, the rent agreement must be registered under Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908.

The PIA has the discretion to accept or reject any document as proof of address. It is also possible that there was a mistake or oversight at counter A and token counter, where they did not check your rent agreement properly. The acknowledgement letter may not have any remark because it is a generic document that does not reflect the status of your application.To resolve this issue, you may have to contact the PIA and provide them with a valid rent agreement with two witnesses, or any other document that can prove your address, such as Aadhaar card, voter ID card, bank statement, etc. You may also have to submit a fresh passport application form with the correct documents.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Sale deed using POA of Deceased Person",
    "answer": "According to the Supreme Court of India, a power of attorney (PoA) does not confer property title if a sale deed is not executed and registered to validate the PoA, and no action is taken by its holder. A PoA is merely a document that allows the principal to appoint another person as their agent, conferring authority on that agent to perform certain acts or functions on their behalf. A PoA is usually terminated when the principal dies or becomes incapacitated3.In your case, it seems that you executed a sale deed through a PoA of a deceased person, who was the land owner. This may not be a valid transaction, as the PoA would have become invalid after the death of the principal. The legal heirs of the deceased person would have inherited the property as per the law of succession. Therefore, you should have obtained the consent and signatures of all the legal heirs as sellers in the sale deed, not just as witnesses in the deed of confirmation. Their signature as mere witnesses would not suffice to transfer their rights and interests in the property.You may have to face legal challenges from the legal heir who wants to dispute the sale deed and demand extra money or share in land portion. You may have to prove that you acted in good faith and were not aware of the death of the donor at the time of executing the sale deed. You may also have to show that you paid a fair consideration for the property and that there was no fraud or coercion involved.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Bank has filed criminal case for loan default",
    "answer": "Loan default is generally a civil wrong, except in cases where there is fraudulent or dishonest intention on the part of the borrower at the time of availing the loan. The bank can file a civil suit against you for recovery of the loan amount, interest, and damages. The bank can also take possession of any collateral or security that you have pledged for the loan. However, the bank cannot file a criminal case against you for loan default, unless they can prove that you have cheated, misappropriated, or conspired to defraud them. The sections invoked by the bank are related to cheating, criminal breach of trust, cheating with knowledge of wrongful loss, cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property, cheating with intent to cause wrongful loss or wrongful gain, and criminal conspiracy. These are serious offences that can attract imprisonment and fine.However, it is possible that the bank is filing a false or frivolous criminal case against you to harass and intimidate you into paying the loan amount. This is an abuse of the process of law and a violation of your rights. You have the right to defend yourself against such false allegations and seek legal help.Here are some steps you can take to deal with this situation:Do not ignore the summon or warrant issued by the court. You must appear before the court on the date and time mentioned in the summon or warrant. If you fail to do so, you may be declared as an absconder or a proclaimed offender, which can worsen your situation.Seek legal advice from a lawyer who can guide you on how to deal with the criminal case and protect your rights and interests. You can also apply for anticipatory bail or regular bail if you are arrested or likely to be arrested.Challenge the jurisdiction of the court where the bank has filed the criminal case. If the court is in a different state 2000 km away from your and your business location, you can argue that it is inconvenient and unfair for you to attend the proceedings there. You can request the court to transfer the case to a court near your location or quash the case altogether.File a counter-complaint against the bank for filing a false and malicious criminal case against you. You can also file a complaint before the Banking Ombudsman or the Consumer Forum for redressal of your grievances. You can claim compensation for mental harassment, defamation, and violation of your rights.Negotiate with the bank for an amicable settlement of your loan account. You can explain your financial situation and offer to pay what you can afford. You can also request the bank to waive off some interest or penalty charges. You can seek the help of a mediator or a counsellor to facilitate the negotiation process.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Sale deed using POA of Deceased Person",
    "answer": "According to the Supreme Court of India, a power of attorney (PoA) does not confer property title if a sale deed is not executed and registered to validate the PoA, and no action is taken by its holder. A PoA is merely a document that allows the principal to appoint another person as their agent, conferring authority on that agent to perform certain acts or functions on their behalf. A PoA is usually terminated when the principal dies or becomes incapacitated3.In your case, it seems that you executed a sale deed through a PoA of a deceased person, who was the land owner. This may not be a valid transaction, as the PoA would have become invalid after the death of the principal. The legal heirs of the deceased person would have inherited the property as per the law of succession. Therefore, you should have obtained the consent and signatures of all the legal heirs as sellers in the sale deed, not just as witnesses in the deed of confirmation. Their signature as mere witnesses would not suffice to transfer their rights and interests in the property.You may have to face legal challenges from the legal heir who wants to dispute the sale deed and demand extra money or share in land portion. You may have to prove that you acted in good faith and were not aware of the death of the donor at the time of executing the sale deed. You may also have to show that you paid a fair consideration for the property and that there was no fraud or coercion involved.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

TheHindu Marriage Actis applicable to Hindus, whereas theSpecial Marriage Actis applicable to all citizens of India irrespective of their religion. The Supreme Court of India has held that marriages of Indians solemnized in foreign countries are valid in India if they are performed according to the law of that country.online marriages, also known as virtual marriages or e-marriages, were not widely recognized in India. In India, marriage is primarily governed by personal laws based on one's religion, and the process of solemnizing a marriage typically involves physical presence before the marriage registrar or religious authority, along with the fulfillment of certain legal requirements. However, it's important to note that laws and regulations can change over time, and there may have been developments or changes in Indian marriage laws since my last update. Additionally, the recognition of online marriages can vary from one Indian state or union territory to another, as some states may have different interpretations or policies regarding such marriages.Therefore, if you and your fiance are planning to get married online through a platform called courtley, which provides a valid marriage certificate issued by USA government authorities, you may not be able to use it as a proof of your marital status in India. You may have to register your marriage in India under theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, which allows for marriages between Indian citizens and foreign nationals. You may also have to get an apostille stamp on your USA marriage certificate, which is a form of authentication issued by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) for documents that are intended for use in Hague Convention countries. An apostille stamp verifies the authenticity of your document and makes it acceptable in other countries.To register your marriage in India, you may have to follow these steps:Fill an online application form on the website of the Registrar General of Marriages.Submit the required documents, such as passport copies, visa copies, birth certificates, address proofs, photographs, etc.Pay the prescribed fee online or offline.Book an appointment for verification and registration at the nearest marriage office.Appear before the marriage officer along with your fiance and two witnesses on the appointed date and time.Sign the declaration form and receive your marriage certificate.To get an apostille stamp on your USA marriage certificate, you may have to follow these steps:Get your USA marriage certificate authenticated by the Secretary of State of the state where it was issued.Send your authenticated USA marriage certificate along with a photocopy of your passport and a self-addressed envelope to the MEA Branch Secretariat in New Delhi or any other city where it is located.Pay the prescribed fee online or offline.Receive your apostilled USA marriage certificate by mail or courier.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Passport on hold",
    "answer": "According to the Ministry of External Affairs, the registered rent agreement executed in favour of the tenant by the landlord can be accepted as a valid document for the proof of address at the time of submission of passport application. However, the rent agreement must be registered under Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908. The Ministry does not specify the number of witnesses required for the rent agreement, but it is advisable to have at least two witnesses as per the general practice.It is possible that your passport application was put on hold due to one less sign of witness in the rent agreement, if the Passport Issuing Authority (PIA) found it insufficient or invalid. The PIA has the discretion to accept or reject any document as proof of address. It is also possible that there was a mistake or oversight at counter A and token counter, where they did not check your rent agreement properly. The acknowledgement letter may not have any remark because it is a generic document that does not reflect the status of your application.To resolve this issue, you may have to contact the PIA and provide them with a valid rent agreement with two witnesses, or any other document that can prove your address, such as Aadhaar card, voter ID card, bank statement, etc. You may also have to submit a fresh passport application form with the correct documents.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear client,In some cases, the absence of a witness's signature on a rent agreement could lead to an application being placed on hold, especially if that is a requirement according to the rules and regulations of the passport issuing authority.It's possible that there was an oversight or inconsistency in the process you went through at different counters. To address this issue, you should consider taking the following steps:Contact Passport Office: Reach out to the passport office where you submitted your application. Inquire about the specific reason for putting your application on hold and seek clarification on the discrepancy between counter A and counter B.Correct the Issue: If the missing witness signature is the problem, you may need to amend your rent agreement to include the required witness and then resubmit the application. Make sure to follow the guidelines provided by the passport office.Review Acknowledgment Letter: Review the acknowledgment letter you received from the passport office carefully to ensure that all the submitted documents are in order. If there's no remark on the letter, it's possible that the issue was identified later in the process.Seek Assistance: If you encounter difficulties resolving the issue, consider seeking assistance from the passport office's customer service or support team. They may be able to provide guidance on how to proceed.It's essential to follow the specific instructions and requirements of your country's passport office to ensure the smooth processing of your passport renewal application. If you believe there was an error or inconsistency in the handling of your application, addressing it through official channels is the best approach.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The builder is also bound by law to return the money collected from buyers within 45 days, after deducting the booking amountIn your case, it seems that the builder has violated the terms of the booking form and the sales agreement, which clearly stated the payment plan and the deal structure agreed by both parties. The builder cannot demand 20% of the payment within 21 days of booking, when you have already paid 12.5% as per the mutual agreement. The builder also cannot cancel the allotment without giving you a valid reason and a notice. The builder’s actions seem to be arbitrary and unfair, and may amount to deficiency of service and breach of contract.You have the right to challenge the cancellation of the allotment and seek refund of your money with interest and compensation. You can send a legal notice to the builder, demanding them to honour the agreement and restore your allotment, or to refund your money with interest and compensation.

    "question": "Online marriage",
    "answer": "According to the Indian law, a marriage can be registered under either of the two Marriage Acts: theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 or theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954. TheHindu Marriage Actis applicable to Hindus, whereas theSpecial Marriage Actis applicable to all citizens of India irrespective of their religion. The Supreme Court of India has held that marriages of Indians solemnized in foreign countries are valid in India if they are performed according to the law of that country.online marriages, also known as virtual marriages or e-marriages, were not widely recognized in India. In India, marriage is primarily governed by personal laws based on one's religion, and the process of solemnizing a marriage typically involves physical presence before the marriage registrar or religious authority, along with the fulfillment of certain legal requirements. However, it's important to note that laws and regulations can change over time, and there may have been developments or changes in Indian marriage laws since my last update. Additionally, the recognition of online marriages can vary from one Indian state or union territory to another, as some states may have different interpretations or policies regarding such marriages.Therefore, if you and your fiance are planning to get married online through a platform called courtley, which provides a valid marriage certificate issued by USA government authorities, you may not be able to use it as a proof of your marital status in India.

    "question": "Online marriage",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, the validity of a marriage certificate issued by foreign authorities, including those from the USA, depends on whether it complies with Indian laws and regulations. Here are some key points to consider:Validity of Foreign Marriage Certificates: In India, foreign marriage certificates are generally recognized if they are issued by competent authorities in the foreign country and are in compliance with Indian laws.Apostille Stamp: To use a foreign marriage certificate in India, it may need to be apostilled. An apostille is a form of authentication that verifies the legitimacy of the document for use in a foreign country. The requirement for an apostille can vary depending on the state or Union Territory in India, so it's advisable to check with the local authorities in the specific location where you intend to use the certificate.Specific Indian Laws: India has its own set of laws governing marriage, and the recognition of a foreign marriage certificate may also depend on the specific circumstances and legal requirements. Different states in India may have slightly different requirements.Bank Accounts and Property Rentals: Using a foreign marriage certificate for activities like opening a joint bank account or renting property may be possible, but it's recommended to check with the specific institutions or authorities involved. They may have their own requirements or procedures.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Bank has filed criminal case for loan default",
    "answer": "Loan default is generally a civil wrong, except in cases where there is fraudulent or dishonest intention on the part of the borrower at the time of availing the loan. The bank can file a civil suit against you for recovery of the loan amount, interest, and damages. The bank can also take possession of any collateral or security that you have pledged for the loan. However, the bank cannot file a criminal case against you for loan default, unless they can prove that you have cheated, misappropriated, or conspired to defraud them. The sections invoked by the bank are related to cheating, criminal breach of trust, cheating with knowledge of wrongful loss, cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property, cheating with intent to cause wrongful loss or wrongful gain, and criminal conspiracy. These are serious offences that can attract imprisonment and fine.However, it is possible that the bank is filing a false or frivolous criminal case against you to harass and intimidate you into paying the loan amount. This is an abuse of the process of law and a violation of your rights. You have the right to defend yourself against such false allegations and seek legal help.Here are some steps you can take to deal with this situation:Do not ignore the summon or warrant issued by the court. You must appear before the court on the date and time mentioned in the summon or warrant. If you fail to do so, you may be declared as an absconder or a proclaimed offender, which can worsen your situation.Seek legal advice from a lawyer who can guide you on how to deal with the criminal case and protect your rights and interests. You can also apply for anticipatory bail or regular bail if you are arrested or likely to be arrested.Challenge the jurisdiction of the court where the bank has filed the criminal case. If the court is in a different state 2000 km away from your and your business location, you can argue that it is inconvenient and unfair for you to attend the proceedings there. You can request the court to transfer the case to a court near your location or quash the case altogether.File a counter-complaint against the bank for filing a false and malicious criminal case against you. You can also file a complaint before the Banking Ombudsman or the Consumer Forum for redressal of your grievances. You can claim compensation for mental harassment, defamation, and violation of your rights.Negotiate with the bank for an amicable settlement of your loan account. You can explain your financial situation and offer to pay what you can afford. You can also request the bank to waive off some interest or penalty charges. You can seek the help of a mediator or a counsellor to facilitate the negotiation process.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

I'll address your queries step by step:Ownership by OCI: An Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) can inherit any immovable property in India, be it agricultural, residential, or commercial. However, while you can inherit and own agricultural land, you cannot purchase it directly. In your case, since you are inheriting it through a will, it's permissible.Will & Its Contestability: Your father's cousin can absolutely will his property to you. Having a well-drafted and registered will would strengthen the legitimacy of the transfer. But, like in many jurisdictions, a will can be contested in India. Common grounds for contesting include:The testator (person creating the will) was not of sound mind when the will was created.The will was made under duress or undue influence.The will is forged or tampered with.The testator did not follow the proper procedure in drafting or executing the will.Given the familial relationship and the fact that your father's cousin has children and grandchildren, there's a likelihood they may contest the will, especially if they feel they have been unfairly excluded.Chances in Court: It's hard to predict outcomes in legal cases since they depend heavily on the specifics. But if the will is drafted correctly, clearly specifies the intentions of your father's cousin, and if it can be established that he was of sound mind and not under undue influence when making the will, the chances of it being upheld are better. It would also be helpful if there are witnesses (preferably neutral parties) to the will's execution.Mortgaging the Property: This is a complex strategy and might not provide the security you're hoping for. If your father's cousin mortgages the property to you (with you acting as the lender), and his heirs later successfully contest the will, they'd inherit the property subject to the mortgage. This doesn't necessarily mean they would have to repay the mortgage immediately. Also, creating a mortgage for this purpose might be seen as an attempt to circumvent the law, which can have its own complications.Precautionary Measures:Ensure the will is drafted by an experienced attorney and the reasons for bequeathing the property to you are clearly laid out.It might also be a good idea for your father's cousin to discuss his intentions with his immediate family to mitigate any surprises and potential disputes later on.Consider the option of a \"testamentary trust\" where the property is held in trust with specific instructions on its use, disposal, or management.Finally, given the complexities involved, it's highly recommended you consult with a property lawyer who can provide guidance tailored to the specific circumstances.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Inheritance of property from an Indian citizen by an American citizen with OCI status",
    "answer": "- As per law, an OCI can inherit any immovable property in India, whether it is residential or commercial or an agricultural land or a farmhouse.- Hence, your fathers cousin being the owner of a self acquired property can registered a Will in your name without getting consent of any of other family members- No other family members are entitled to get the share in that property , and hence they cannot challenge that will- The said inherited property cannot be mortgaged as the Will can only be executed after demise of him."

    "question": "Inheritance of property from an Indian citizen by an American citizen with OCI status",
    "answer": "1. a person can make a bequest of his property to any person of his choice by his Will2. it is not necessary that the beneficiary in the Will have to be the legal heirs of the person3. so the person can make a bequest even in favour of a foreigner4. if the person has already given some properties in his lifetime to his children/grandchildren, then that factum ought to be mentioned in the Will to justify the exclusion of the children/grandchildren from the Will and to avert any possibility of the Will being challenged on the ground that it is unnatural since it unjustly excludes the legal heirs5. the Will is not required to be registered under the law. Even if it is registered, the formal proof of due execution of the Will would still have to be discharged by the person who relies on such Will or who propounds such Will. Registering the Will does not give it any more legitimacy than when the Will would be unregistered. So registration not being the requirement of law, can be skipped completely6. asking questions like - what are the chances of the heirs winning - is completely illogical since that cannot be predicted by an advocate. What if the advocate says that there is no chance of the heirs winning, but the heirs in fact win the case? In that case will you hold the advocate responsible? Predicting is the job of an astrologer and not of an advocate.7. mortgaging the property with the proposed legatee will not serve any purpose. In fact it will backfire. So it will be a futile exercise.8. the Will can be made in any language known to the testator. It has to be signed by the testator in front of 2 witnesses. It is not necessary that both the witnesses are present together at the time the testator signs his Will. The requirement is that the witness must have seen the testator sign his Will in the presence of the witness.9. the witnesses can also be any person who know the testator and who can depose and testify that when he testator signed his Will he was in a sound and disposing state of mind10. attaching a doctor's certificate to the Will to show that the testator has a sound state of mind, is completely optional and is not a requirement under the lawYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Bank has filed criminal case for loan default",
    "answer": "Loan default is generally a civil wrong, except in cases where there is fraudulent or dishonest intention on the part of the borrower at the time of availing the loan. The bank can file a civil suit against you for recovery of the loan amount, interest, and damages. The bank can also take possession of any collateral or security that you have pledged for the loan. However, the bank cannot file a criminal case against you for loan default, unless they can prove that you have cheated, misappropriated, or conspired to defraud them. The sections invoked by the bank are related to cheating, criminal breach of trust, cheating with knowledge of wrongful loss, cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property, cheating with intent to cause wrongful loss or wrongful gain, and criminal conspiracy. These are serious offences that can attract imprisonment and fine.However, it is possible that the bank is filing a false or frivolous criminal case against you to harass and intimidate you into paying the loan amount. This is an abuse of the process of law and a violation of your rights. You have the right to defend yourself against such false allegations and seek legal help.Here are some steps you can take to deal with this situation:Do not ignore the summon or warrant issued by the court. You must appear before the court on the date and time mentioned in the summon or warrant. If you fail to do so, you may be declared as an absconder or a proclaimed offender, which can worsen your situation.Seek legal advice from a lawyer who can guide you on how to deal with the criminal case and protect your rights and interests. You can also apply for anticipatory bail or regular bail if you are arrested or likely to be arrested.Challenge the jurisdiction of the court where the bank has filed the criminal case. If the court is in a different state 2000 km away from your and your business location, you can argue that it is inconvenient and unfair for you to attend the proceedings there. You can request the court to transfer the case to a court near your location or quash the case altogether.File a counter-complaint against the bank for filing a false and malicious criminal case against you. You can also file a complaint before the Banking Ombudsman or the Consumer Forum for redressal of your grievances. You can claim compensation for mental harassment, defamation, and violation of your rights.Negotiate with the bank for an amicable settlement of your loan account. You can explain your financial situation and offer to pay what you can afford. You can also request the bank to waive off some interest or penalty charges. You can seek the help of a mediator or a counsellor to facilitate the negotiation process.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

They may help you understand the legal requirements and assist you in coordinating the necessary documentation and processes.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Bank has filed criminal case for loan default",
    "answer": "Loan default is generally a civil wrong, except in cases where there is fraudulent or dishonest intention on the part of the borrower at the time of availing the loan. The bank can file a civil suit against you for recovery of the loan amount, interest, and damages. The bank can also take possession of any collateral or security that you have pledged for the loan. However, the bank cannot file a criminal case against you for loan default, unless they can prove that you have cheated, misappropriated, or conspired to defraud them. The sections invoked by the bank are related to cheating, criminal breach of trust, cheating with knowledge of wrongful loss, cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property, cheating with intent to cause wrongful loss or wrongful gain, and criminal conspiracy. These are serious offences that can attract imprisonment and fine.However, it is possible that the bank is filing a false or frivolous criminal case against you to harass and intimidate you into paying the loan amount. This is an abuse of the process of law and a violation of your rights. You have the right to defend yourself against such false allegations and seek legal help.Here are some steps you can take to deal with this situation:Do not ignore the summon or warrant issued by the court. You must appear before the court on the date and time mentioned in the summon or warrant. If you fail to do so, you may be declared as an absconder or a proclaimed offender, which can worsen your situation.Seek legal advice from a lawyer who can guide you on how to deal with the criminal case and protect your rights and interests. You can also apply for anticipatory bail or regular bail if you are arrested or likely to be arrested.Challenge the jurisdiction of the court where the bank has filed the criminal case. If the court is in a different state 2000 km away from your and your business location, you can argue that it is inconvenient and unfair for you to attend the proceedings there. You can request the court to transfer the case to a court near your location or quash the case altogether.File a counter-complaint against the bank for filing a false and malicious criminal case against you. You can also file a complaint before the Banking Ombudsman or the Consumer Forum for redressal of your grievances. You can claim compensation for mental harassment, defamation, and violation of your rights.Negotiate with the bank for an amicable settlement of your loan account. You can explain your financial situation and offer to pay what you can afford. You can also request the bank to waive off some interest or penalty charges. You can seek the help of a mediator or a counsellor to facilitate the negotiation process.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Inheritance of property from an Indian citizen by an American citizen with OCI status",
    "answer": "When it comes to inheritance of property in India by a foreign national or a person of Indian origin, there are specific regulations and restrictions under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) and other laws. I'll address your queries step by step:Ownership by OCI: An Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) can inherit any immovable property in India, be it agricultural, residential, or commercial. However, while you can inherit and own agricultural land, you cannot purchase it directly. In your case, since you are inheriting it through a will, it's permissible.Will & Its Contestability: Your father's cousin can absolutely will his property to you. Having a well-drafted and registered will would strengthen the legitimacy of the transfer. But, like in many jurisdictions, a will can be contested in India. Common grounds for contesting include:The testator (person creating the will) was not of sound mind when the will was created.The will was made under duress or undue influence.The will is forged or tampered with.The testator did not follow the proper procedure in drafting or executing the will.Given the familial relationship and the fact that your father's cousin has children and grandchildren, there's a likelihood they may contest the will, especially if they feel they have been unfairly excluded.Chances in Court: It's hard to predict outcomes in legal cases since they depend heavily on the specifics. But if the will is drafted correctly, clearly specifies the intentions of your father's cousin, and if it can be established that he was of sound mind and not under undue influence when making the will, the chances of it being upheld are better. It would also be helpful if there are witnesses (preferably neutral parties) to the will's execution.Mortgaging the Property: This is a complex strategy and might not provide the security you're hoping for. If your father's cousin mortgages the property to you (with you acting as the lender), and his heirs later successfully contest the will, they'd inherit the property subject to the mortgage. This doesn't necessarily mean they would have to repay the mortgage immediately. Also, creating a mortgage for this purpose might be seen as an attempt to circumvent the law, which can have its own complications.Precautionary Measures:Ensure the will is drafted by an experienced attorney and the reasons for bequeathing the property to you are clearly laid out.It might also be a good idea for your father's cousin to discuss his intentions with his immediate family to mitigate any surprises and potential disputes later on.Consider the option of a \"testamentary trust\" where the property is held in trust with specific instructions on its use, disposal, or management.Finally, given the complexities involved, it's highly recommended you consult with a property lawyer who can provide guidance tailored to the specific circumstances.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Inheritance of property from an Indian citizen by an American citizen with OCI status",
    "answer": "1. a person can make a bequest of his property to any person of his choice by his Will2. it is not necessary that the beneficiary in the Will have to be the legal heirs of the person3. so the person can make a bequest even in favour of a foreigner4. if the person has already given some properties in his lifetime to his children/grandchildren, then that factum ought to be mentioned in the Will to justify the exclusion of the children/grandchildren from the Will and to avert any possibility of the Will being challenged on the ground that it is unnatural since it unjustly excludes the legal heirs5. the Will is not required to be registered under the law. Even if it is registered, the formal proof of due execution of the Will would still have to be discharged by the person who relies on such Will or who propounds such Will. Registering the Will does not give it any more legitimacy than when the Will would be unregistered. So registration not being the requirement of law, can be skipped completely6. asking questions like - what are the chances of the heirs winning - is completely illogical since that cannot be predicted by an advocate. What if the advocate says that there is no chance of the heirs winning, but the heirs in fact win the case? In that case will you hold the advocate responsible? Predicting is the job of an astrologer and not of an advocate.7. mortgaging the property with the proposed legatee will not serve any purpose. In fact it will backfire. So it will be a futile exercise.8. the Will can be made in any language known to the testator. It has to be signed by the testator in front of 2 witnesses. It is not necessary that both the witnesses are present together at the time the testator signs his Will. The requirement is that the witness must have seen the testator sign his Will in the presence of the witness.9. the witnesses can also be any person who know the testator and who can depose and testify that when he testator signed his Will he was in a sound and disposing state of mind10. attaching a doctor's certificate to the Will to show that the testator has a sound state of mind, is completely optional and is not a requirement under the lawYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

Where an immovable property is contributed as capital by the partner crediting his capital account and debiting his asset account, such pooling would convert the proprietary property as firm’s property by operation of the partnership law, though it is not registered because there is no conveyance requiring registration.5) no written or registered document is necessary for an individual to contribute any land or immovable property as a contribution against his share of the capital of a new partnership business6) as far as clauses in partnership deed are concerned you would have share in said properties only if it was contributed as capital by the partner in the partnership firm7) get partnership deed drafted by local lawyerAjay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

A family settlement is an effective alternative dispute resolution mechanism and should be a preferred route for families to protect generational wealth from being marred by disputes. Given the fact that genuine family arrangements/settlements are outside the purview of taxation, this mode of dispute resolution has gained popularity over a period. Civil proceedings in a court are not only time consuming but also a costly affair and therefore family settlements should be a preferred choice for dispute resolution amongst families. Further, as held by the Hon'ble Apex Court there is no alienation (transfer) of property in a family settlement.It would be better to have a detailed discussion in this regard with complete documents to decide the correct procedure.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, Delhi418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma"

    "answer": "Dear client,The right procedure to transfer the property without attracting long-term capital gains taxes by the Income Tax department can be complex, and it's essential to consider both the legal and financial aspects.Gift Deed: If the property was received in a family settlement, you may consider executing a gift deed from your name to the family members who should have legal ownership. While gift deeds are generally subject to income tax, if the property was acquired through a family settlement, there may be specific exemptions. Consult with your CA to understand the tax implications fully.Sale Deed: You can sell the property to the family members at a fair market value. Ensure that the sale price is reasonable to avoid any disputes with tax authorities. The tax implications will depend on the difference between the purchase price and the sale price.Family Settlement: If the property was initially received through a family settlement, another family settlement might be considered, but this can be legally complex. Consult with a lawyer to assess the feasibility of this option.Gift Tax Rules: Keep in mind that there are provisions under the Income Tax Act related to gift tax, and you should understand how these apply in your specific case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Inheritance of property from an Indian citizen by an American citizen with OCI status",
    "answer": "When it comes to inheritance of property in India by a foreign national or a person of Indian origin, there are specific regulations and restrictions under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) and other laws. I'll address your queries step by step:Ownership by OCI: An Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) can inherit any immovable property in India, be it agricultural, residential, or commercial. However, while you can inherit and own agricultural land, you cannot purchase it directly. In your case, since you are inheriting it through a will, it's permissible.Will & Its Contestability: Your father's cousin can absolutely will his property to you. Having a well-drafted and registered will would strengthen the legitimacy of the transfer. But, like in many jurisdictions, a will can be contested in India. Common grounds for contesting include:The testator (person creating the will) was not of sound mind when the will was created.The will was made under duress or undue influence.The will is forged or tampered with.The testator did not follow the proper procedure in drafting or executing the will.Given the familial relationship and the fact that your father's cousin has children and grandchildren, there's a likelihood they may contest the will, especially if they feel they have been unfairly excluded.Chances in Court: It's hard to predict outcomes in legal cases since they depend heavily on the specifics. But if the will is drafted correctly, clearly specifies the intentions of your father's cousin, and if it can be established that he was of sound mind and not under undue influence when making the will, the chances of it being upheld are better. It would also be helpful if there are witnesses (preferably neutral parties) to the will's execution.Mortgaging the Property: This is a complex strategy and might not provide the security you're hoping for. If your father's cousin mortgages the property to you (with you acting as the lender), and his heirs later successfully contest the will, they'd inherit the property subject to the mortgage. This doesn't necessarily mean they would have to repay the mortgage immediately. Also, creating a mortgage for this purpose might be seen as an attempt to circumvent the law, which can have its own complications.Precautionary Measures:Ensure the will is drafted by an experienced attorney and the reasons for bequeathing the property to you are clearly laid out.It might also be a good idea for your father's cousin to discuss his intentions with his immediate family to mitigate any surprises and potential disputes later on.Consider the option of a \"testamentary trust\" where the property is held in trust with specific instructions on its use, disposal, or management.Finally, given the complexities involved, it's highly recommended you consult with a property lawyer who can provide guidance tailored to the specific circumstances.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Inheritance of property from an Indian citizen by an American citizen with OCI status",
    "answer": "- As per law, an OCI can inherit any immovable property in India, whether it is residential or commercial or an agricultural land or a farmhouse.- Hence, your fathers cousin being the owner of a self acquired property can registered a Will in your name without getting consent of any of other family members- No other family members are entitled to get the share in that property , and hence they cannot challenge that will- The said inherited property cannot be mortgaged as the Will can only be executed after demise of him."

    "question": "Inheritance of property from an Indian citizen by an American citizen with OCI status",
    "answer": "1. a person can make a bequest of his property to any person of his choice by his Will2. it is not necessary that the beneficiary in the Will have to be the legal heirs of the person3. so the person can make a bequest even in favour of a foreigner4. if the person has already given some properties in his lifetime to his children/grandchildren, then that factum ought to be mentioned in the Will to justify the exclusion of the children/grandchildren from the Will and to avert any possibility of the Will being challenged on the ground that it is unnatural since it unjustly excludes the legal heirs5. the Will is not required to be registered under the law. Even if it is registered, the formal proof of due execution of the Will would still have to be discharged by the person who relies on such Will or who propounds such Will. Registering the Will does not give it any more legitimacy than when the Will would be unregistered. So registration not being the requirement of law, can be skipped completely6. asking questions like - what are the chances of the heirs winning - is completely illogical since that cannot be predicted by an advocate. What if the advocate says that there is no chance of the heirs winning, but the heirs in fact win the case? In that case will you hold the advocate responsible? Predicting is the job of an astrologer and not of an advocate.7. mortgaging the property with the proposed legatee will not serve any purpose. In fact it will backfire. So it will be a futile exercise.8. the Will can be made in any language known to the testator. It has to be signed by the testator in front of 2 witnesses. It is not necessary that both the witnesses are present together at the time the testator signs his Will. The requirement is that the witness must have seen the testator sign his Will in the presence of the witness.9. the witnesses can also be any person who know the testator and who can depose and testify that when he testator signed his Will he was in a sound and disposing state of mind10. attaching a doctor's certificate to the Will to show that the testator has a sound state of mind, is completely optional and is not a requirement under the lawYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "1) The Supreme Court held that property belonging to the partners or any one of them is incapable of being deemed as a partnership property, merely of being used for business purposes, and thus cannot be deemed as partnership properties.2) Section 14 of the Partnership Act, 1932 expressly declares that property exclusively belonging to a person, on his entering into partnership with others,does not become a property of the partnership merely because it is used for the business of the partnership, in the absence of an agreement to the contrary.3) partnership firm does not have a separate legal identity,different from the partners.It cannot sell or purchase property in its own name.4) When a partner pools his asset with partnership assets by contributing such asset as capital of the firm, it becomes the property of the firm under section 14 of The Partnership Act by operation of law without the formality of the conveyance. Where an immovable property is contributed as capital by the partner crediting his capital account and debiting his asset account, such pooling would convert the proprietary property as firm’s property by operation of the partnership law, though it is not registered because there is no conveyance requiring registration.5) no written or registered document is necessary for an individual to contribute any land or immovable property as a contribution against his share of the capital of a new partnership business6) as far as clauses in partnership deed are concerned you would have share in said properties only if it was contributed as capital by the partner in the partnership firm7) get partnership deed drafted by local lawyerAjay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "question": "Protection against false cases by wife to claim husband's property",
    "answer": "There are some situations where your future wife may be able to claim your property if you get married under Muslim Marriage Act. These situations include:If you desert her or treat her with cruelty or neglect, she can file a suit forrestitution of conjugal rightsor judicial separation and claim maintenance and a share in your property as per Section 4 of the Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act, 1939.If you convert to another religion, she can file a suit for dissolution of marriage and claim maintenance and a share in your property as per Section 4 of the Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act, 1939.If you die intestate (without leaving a will), she can inherit a share in your property as per the rules of succession under Muslim law.Therefore, you may want to take some precautions to protect yourself against any false cases or claims by your future wife. Some possible precautions are:Transfer your properties in the name of your parents before getting married. This may prevent your future wife from claiming any right or interest in them. However, this may not be foolproof, as she may still challenge the validity or genuineness of the transfer and allege that it was done to defraud her or defeat her rights. She may also claim that you have retained some beneficial interest or control over the properties even after transferring them to your parents.Get your father to legally disown you after transferring the properties to him. This may sever your legal relationship with him and make you ineligible to inherit his property. However, this may not be effective either, as disowning is not recognized by law as a valid mode of disinheriting an heir. Your father may still change his mind and revoke his decision to disown you or make a will in your favour. Moreover, disowning may have other adverse consequences for you, such as losing your right to maintenance or family pension from your father.Make a prenuptial agreement with your future wife before getting married. A prenuptial agreement is a contract between two prospective spouses that specifies their rights and obligations regarding their property, finances, maintenance, divorce, etc. A prenuptial agreement may help you to safeguard your properties from any false claims or disputes by your future wife. However, you should be aware that prenuptial agreements are not very common or popular in India and their legal validity and enforceability are still uncertain and debatable.Therefore, none of these precautions may guarantee complete protection against false cases by your future wife to claim your property. The best way to avoid any such trouble is to have a happy and harmonious marriage based on mutual trust, respect, and love.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Inheritance of property from an Indian citizen by an American citizen with OCI status",
    "answer": "When it comes to inheritance of property in India by a foreign national or a person of Indian origin, there are specific regulations and restrictions under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) and other laws. I'll address your queries step by step:Ownership by OCI: An Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) can inherit any immovable property in India, be it agricultural, residential, or commercial. However, while you can inherit and own agricultural land, you cannot purchase it directly. In your case, since you are inheriting it through a will, it's permissible.Will & Its Contestability: Your father's cousin can absolutely will his property to you. Having a well-drafted and registered will would strengthen the legitimacy of the transfer. But, like in many jurisdictions, a will can be contested in India. Common grounds for contesting include:The testator (person creating the will) was not of sound mind when the will was created.The will was made under duress or undue influence.The will is forged or tampered with.The testator did not follow the proper procedure in drafting or executing the will.Given the familial relationship and the fact that your father's cousin has children and grandchildren, there's a likelihood they may contest the will, especially if they feel they have been unfairly excluded.Chances in Court: It's hard to predict outcomes in legal cases since they depend heavily on the specifics. But if the will is drafted correctly, clearly specifies the intentions of your father's cousin, and if it can be established that he was of sound mind and not under undue influence when making the will, the chances of it being upheld are better. It would also be helpful if there are witnesses (preferably neutral parties) to the will's execution.Mortgaging the Property: This is a complex strategy and might not provide the security you're hoping for. If your father's cousin mortgages the property to you (with you acting as the lender), and his heirs later successfully contest the will, they'd inherit the property subject to the mortgage. This doesn't necessarily mean they would have to repay the mortgage immediately. Also, creating a mortgage for this purpose might be seen as an attempt to circumvent the law, which can have its own complications.Precautionary Measures:Ensure the will is drafted by an experienced attorney and the reasons for bequeathing the property to you are clearly laid out.It might also be a good idea for your father's cousin to discuss his intentions with his immediate family to mitigate any surprises and potential disputes later on.Consider the option of a \"testamentary trust\" where the property is held in trust with specific instructions on its use, disposal, or management.Finally, given the complexities involved, it's highly recommended you consult with a property lawyer who can provide guidance tailored to the specific circumstances.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "1. a person can make a bequest of his property to any person of his choice by his Will2. it is not necessary that the beneficiary in the Will have to be the legal heirs of the person3. so the person can make a bequest even in favour of a foreigner4. if the person has already given some properties in his lifetime to his children/grandchildren, then that factum ought to be mentioned in the Will to justify the exclusion of the children/grandchildren from the Will and to avert any possibility of the Will being challenged on the ground that it is unnatural since it unjustly excludes the legal heirs5. the Will is not required to be registered under the law. Even if it is registered, the formal proof of due execution of the Will would still have to be discharged by the person who relies on such Will or who propounds such Will. Registering the Will does not give it any more legitimacy than when the Will would be unregistered. So registration not being the requirement of law, can be skipped completely6. asking questions like - what are the chances of the heirs winning - is completely illogical since that cannot be predicted by an advocate. What if the advocate says that there is no chance of the heirs winning, but the heirs in fact win the case? In that case will you hold the advocate responsible? Predicting is the job of an astrologer and not of an advocate.7. mortgaging the property with the proposed legatee will not serve any purpose. In fact it will backfire. So it will be a futile exercise.8. the Will can be made in any language known to the testator. It has to be signed by the testator in front of 2 witnesses. It is not necessary that both the witnesses are present together at the time the testator signs his Will. The requirement is that the witness must have seen the testator sign his Will in the presence of the witness.9. the witnesses can also be any person who know the testator and who can depose and testify that when he testator signed his Will he was in a sound and disposing state of mind10. attaching a doctor's certificate to the Will to show that the testator has a sound state of mind, is completely optional and is not a requirement under the lawYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

Where an immovable property is contributed as capital by the partner crediting his capital account and debiting his asset account, such pooling would convert the proprietary property as firm’s property by operation of the partnership law, though it is not registered because there is no conveyance requiring registration.5) no written or registered document is necessary for an individual to contribute any land or immovable property as a contribution against his share of the capital of a new partnership business6) as far as clauses in partnership deed are concerned you would have share in said properties only if it was contributed as capital by the partner in the partnership firm7) get partnership deed drafted by local lawyerAjay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "answer": "There are some situations where your future wife may be able to claim your property if you get married under Muslim Marriage Act. These situations include:If you desert her or treat her with cruelty or neglect, she can file a suit forrestitution of conjugal rightsor judicial separation and claim maintenance and a share in your property as per Section 4 of the Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act, 1939.If you convert to another religion, she can file a suit for dissolution of marriage and claim maintenance and a share in your property as per Section 4 of the Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act, 1939.If you die intestate (without leaving a will), she can inherit a share in your property as per the rules of succession under Muslim law.Therefore, you may want to take some precautions to protect yourself against any false cases or claims by your future wife. Some possible precautions are:Transfer your properties in the name of your parents before getting married. This may prevent your future wife from claiming any right or interest in them. However, this may not be foolproof, as she may still challenge the validity or genuineness of the transfer and allege that it was done to defraud her or defeat her rights. She may also claim that you have retained some beneficial interest or control over the properties even after transferring them to your parents.Get your father to legally disown you after transferring the properties to him. This may sever your legal relationship with him and make you ineligible to inherit his property. However, this may not be effective either, as disowning is not recognized by law as a valid mode of disinheriting an heir. Your father may still change his mind and revoke his decision to disown you or make a will in your favour. Moreover, disowning may have other adverse consequences for you, such as losing your right to maintenance or family pension from your father.Make a prenuptial agreement with your future wife before getting married. A prenuptial agreement is a contract between two prospective spouses that specifies their rights and obligations regarding their property, finances, maintenance, divorce, etc. A prenuptial agreement may help you to safeguard your properties from any false claims or disputes by your future wife. However, you should be aware that prenuptial agreements are not very common or popular in India and their legal validity and enforceability are still uncertain and debatable.Therefore, none of these precautions may guarantee complete protection against false cases by your future wife to claim your property. The best way to avoid any such trouble is to have a happy and harmonious marriage based on mutual trust, respect, and love.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. A family settlement is an effective alternative dispute resolution mechanism and should be a preferred route for families to protect generational wealth from being marred by disputes. Given the fact that genuine family arrangements/settlements are outside the purview of taxation, this mode of dispute resolution has gained popularity over a period. Civil proceedings in a court are not only time consuming but also a costly affair and therefore family settlements should be a preferred choice for dispute resolution amongst families. Further, as held by the Hon'ble Apex Court there is no alienation (transfer) of property in a family settlement.It would be better to have a detailed discussion in this regard with complete documents to decide the correct procedure.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, Delhi418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma"

    "answer": "Dear client,The right procedure to transfer the property without attracting long-term capital gains taxes by the Income Tax department can be complex, and it's essential to consider both the legal and financial aspects.Gift Deed: If the property was received in a family settlement, you may consider executing a gift deed from your name to the family members who should have legal ownership. While gift deeds are generally subject to income tax, if the property was acquired through a family settlement, there may be specific exemptions. Consult with your CA to understand the tax implications fully.Sale Deed: You can sell the property to the family members at a fair market value. Ensure that the sale price is reasonable to avoid any disputes with tax authorities. The tax implications will depend on the difference between the purchase price and the sale price.Family Settlement: If the property was initially received through a family settlement, another family settlement might be considered, but this can be legally complex. Consult with a lawyer to assess the feasibility of this option.Gift Tax Rules: Keep in mind that there are provisions under the Income Tax Act related to gift tax, and you should understand how these apply in your specific case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Inheritance of property from an Indian citizen by an American citizen with OCI status",
    "answer": "When it comes to inheritance of property in India by a foreign national or a person of Indian origin, there are specific regulations and restrictions under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) and other laws. I'll address your queries step by step:Ownership by OCI: An Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) can inherit any immovable property in India, be it agricultural, residential, or commercial. However, while you can inherit and own agricultural land, you cannot purchase it directly. In your case, since you are inheriting it through a will, it's permissible.Will & Its Contestability: Your father's cousin can absolutely will his property to you. Having a well-drafted and registered will would strengthen the legitimacy of the transfer. But, like in many jurisdictions, a will can be contested in India. Common grounds for contesting include:The testator (person creating the will) was not of sound mind when the will was created.The will was made under duress or undue influence.The will is forged or tampered with.The testator did not follow the proper procedure in drafting or executing the will.Given the familial relationship and the fact that your father's cousin has children and grandchildren, there's a likelihood they may contest the will, especially if they feel they have been unfairly excluded.Chances in Court: It's hard to predict outcomes in legal cases since they depend heavily on the specifics. But if the will is drafted correctly, clearly specifies the intentions of your father's cousin, and if it can be established that he was of sound mind and not under undue influence when making the will, the chances of it being upheld are better. It would also be helpful if there are witnesses (preferably neutral parties) to the will's execution.Mortgaging the Property: This is a complex strategy and might not provide the security you're hoping for. If your father's cousin mortgages the property to you (with you acting as the lender), and his heirs later successfully contest the will, they'd inherit the property subject to the mortgage. This doesn't necessarily mean they would have to repay the mortgage immediately. Also, creating a mortgage for this purpose might be seen as an attempt to circumvent the law, which can have its own complications.Precautionary Measures:Ensure the will is drafted by an experienced attorney and the reasons for bequeathing the property to you are clearly laid out.It might also be a good idea for your father's cousin to discuss his intentions with his immediate family to mitigate any surprises and potential disputes later on.Consider the option of a \"testamentary trust\" where the property is held in trust with specific instructions on its use, disposal, or management.Finally, given the complexities involved, it's highly recommended you consult with a property lawyer who can provide guidance tailored to the specific circumstances.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "1. a person can make a bequest of his property to any person of his choice by his Will2. it is not necessary that the beneficiary in the Will have to be the legal heirs of the person3. so the person can make a bequest even in favour of a foreigner4. if the person has already given some properties in his lifetime to his children/grandchildren, then that factum ought to be mentioned in the Will to justify the exclusion of the children/grandchildren from the Will and to avert any possibility of the Will being challenged on the ground that it is unnatural since it unjustly excludes the legal heirs5. the Will is not required to be registered under the law. Even if it is registered, the formal proof of due execution of the Will would still have to be discharged by the person who relies on such Will or who propounds such Will. Registering the Will does not give it any more legitimacy than when the Will would be unregistered. So registration not being the requirement of law, can be skipped completely6. asking questions like - what are the chances of the heirs winning - is completely illogical since that cannot be predicted by an advocate. What if the advocate says that there is no chance of the heirs winning, but the heirs in fact win the case? In that case will you hold the advocate responsible? Predicting is the job of an astrologer and not of an advocate.7. mortgaging the property with the proposed legatee will not serve any purpose. In fact it will backfire. So it will be a futile exercise.8. the Will can be made in any language known to the testator. It has to be signed by the testator in front of 2 witnesses. It is not necessary that both the witnesses are present together at the time the testator signs his Will. The requirement is that the witness must have seen the testator sign his Will in the presence of the witness.9. the witnesses can also be any person who know the testator and who can depose and testify that when he testator signed his Will he was in a sound and disposing state of mind10. attaching a doctor's certificate to the Will to show that the testator has a sound state of mind, is completely optional and is not a requirement under the lawYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Asset under partnership",
    "answer": "1) The Supreme Court held that property belonging to the partners or any one of them is incapable of being deemed as a partnership property, merely of being used for business purposes, and thus cannot be deemed as partnership properties.2) Section 14 of the Partnership Act, 1932 expressly declares that property exclusively belonging to a person, on his entering into partnership with others,does not become a property of the partnership merely because it is used for the business of the partnership, in the absence of an agreement to the contrary.3) partnership firm does not have a separate legal identity,different from the partners.It cannot sell or purchase property in its own name.4) When a partner pools his asset with partnership assets by contributing such asset as capital of the firm, it becomes the property of the firm under section 14 of The Partnership Act by operation of law without the formality of the conveyance. Where an immovable property is contributed as capital by the partner crediting his capital account and debiting his asset account, such pooling would convert the proprietary property as firm’s property by operation of the partnership law, though it is not registered because there is no conveyance requiring registration.5) no written or registered document is necessary for an individual to contribute any land or immovable property as a contribution against his share of the capital of a new partnership business6) as far as clauses in partnership deed are concerned you would have share in said properties only if it was contributed as capital by the partner in the partnership firm7) get partnership deed drafted by local lawyerAjay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "question": "Protection against false cases by wife to claim husband's property",
    "answer": "There are some situations where your future wife may be able to claim your property if you get married under Muslim Marriage Act. These situations include:If you desert her or treat her with cruelty or neglect, she can file a suit forrestitution of conjugal rightsor judicial separation and claim maintenance and a share in your property as per Section 4 of the Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act, 1939.If you convert to another religion, she can file a suit for dissolution of marriage and claim maintenance and a share in your property as per Section 4 of the Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act, 1939.If you die intestate (without leaving a will), she can inherit a share in your property as per the rules of succession under Muslim law.Therefore, you may want to take some precautions to protect yourself against any false cases or claims by your future wife. Some possible precautions are:Transfer your properties in the name of your parents before getting married. This may prevent your future wife from claiming any right or interest in them. However, this may not be foolproof, as she may still challenge the validity or genuineness of the transfer and allege that it was done to defraud her or defeat her rights. She may also claim that you have retained some beneficial interest or control over the properties even after transferring them to your parents.Get your father to legally disown you after transferring the properties to him. This may sever your legal relationship with him and make you ineligible to inherit his property. However, this may not be effective either, as disowning is not recognized by law as a valid mode of disinheriting an heir. Your father may still change his mind and revoke his decision to disown you or make a will in your favour. Moreover, disowning may have other adverse consequences for you, such as losing your right to maintenance or family pension from your father.Make a prenuptial agreement with your future wife before getting married. A prenuptial agreement is a contract between two prospective spouses that specifies their rights and obligations regarding their property, finances, maintenance, divorce, etc. A prenuptial agreement may help you to safeguard your properties from any false claims or disputes by your future wife. However, you should be aware that prenuptial agreements are not very common or popular in India and their legal validity and enforceability are still uncertain and debatable.Therefore, none of these precautions may guarantee complete protection against false cases by your future wife to claim your property. The best way to avoid any such trouble is to have a happy and harmonious marriage based on mutual trust, respect, and love.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Inheritance of property from an Indian citizen by an American citizen with OCI status",
    "answer": "When it comes to inheritance of property in India by a foreign national or a person of Indian origin, there are specific regulations and restrictions under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) and other laws. I'll address your queries step by step:Ownership by OCI: An Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) can inherit any immovable property in India, be it agricultural, residential, or commercial. However, while you can inherit and own agricultural land, you cannot purchase it directly. In your case, since you are inheriting it through a will, it's permissible.Will & Its Contestability: Your father's cousin can absolutely will his property to you. Having a well-drafted and registered will would strengthen the legitimacy of the transfer. But, like in many jurisdictions, a will can be contested in India. Common grounds for contesting include:The testator (person creating the will) was not of sound mind when the will was created.The will was made under duress or undue influence.The will is forged or tampered with.The testator did not follow the proper procedure in drafting or executing the will.Given the familial relationship and the fact that your father's cousin has children and grandchildren, there's a likelihood they may contest the will, especially if they feel they have been unfairly excluded.Chances in Court: It's hard to predict outcomes in legal cases since they depend heavily on the specifics. But if the will is drafted correctly, clearly specifies the intentions of your father's cousin, and if it can be established that he was of sound mind and not under undue influence when making the will, the chances of it being upheld are better. It would also be helpful if there are witnesses (preferably neutral parties) to the will's execution.Mortgaging the Property: This is a complex strategy and might not provide the security you're hoping for. If your father's cousin mortgages the property to you (with you acting as the lender), and his heirs later successfully contest the will, they'd inherit the property subject to the mortgage. This doesn't necessarily mean they would have to repay the mortgage immediately. Also, creating a mortgage for this purpose might be seen as an attempt to circumvent the law, which can have its own complications.Precautionary Measures:Ensure the will is drafted by an experienced attorney and the reasons for bequeathing the property to you are clearly laid out.It might also be a good idea for your father's cousin to discuss his intentions with his immediate family to mitigate any surprises and potential disputes later on.Consider the option of a \"testamentary trust\" where the property is held in trust with specific instructions on its use, disposal, or management.Finally, given the complexities involved, it's highly recommended you consult with a property lawyer who can provide guidance tailored to the specific circumstances.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "1. a person can make a bequest of his property to any person of his choice by his Will2. it is not necessary that the beneficiary in the Will have to be the legal heirs of the person3. so the person can make a bequest even in favour of a foreigner4. if the person has already given some properties in his lifetime to his children/grandchildren, then that factum ought to be mentioned in the Will to justify the exclusion of the children/grandchildren from the Will and to avert any possibility of the Will being challenged on the ground that it is unnatural since it unjustly excludes the legal heirs5. the Will is not required to be registered under the law. Even if it is registered, the formal proof of due execution of the Will would still have to be discharged by the person who relies on such Will or who propounds such Will. Registering the Will does not give it any more legitimacy than when the Will would be unregistered. So registration not being the requirement of law, can be skipped completely6. asking questions like - what are the chances of the heirs winning - is completely illogical since that cannot be predicted by an advocate. What if the advocate says that there is no chance of the heirs winning, but the heirs in fact win the case? In that case will you hold the advocate responsible? Predicting is the job of an astrologer and not of an advocate.7. mortgaging the property with the proposed legatee will not serve any purpose. In fact it will backfire. So it will be a futile exercise.8. the Will can be made in any language known to the testator. It has to be signed by the testator in front of 2 witnesses. It is not necessary that both the witnesses are present together at the time the testator signs his Will. The requirement is that the witness must have seen the testator sign his Will in the presence of the witness.9. the witnesses can also be any person who know the testator and who can depose and testify that when he testator signed his Will he was in a sound and disposing state of mind10. attaching a doctor's certificate to the Will to show that the testator has a sound state of mind, is completely optional and is not a requirement under the lawYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Protection against false cases by wife to claim husband's property",
    "answer": "There are some situations where your future wife may be able to claim your property if you get married under Muslim Marriage Act. These situations include:If you desert her or treat her with cruelty or neglect, she can file a suit forrestitution of conjugal rightsor judicial separation and claim maintenance and a share in your property as per Section 4 of the Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act, 1939.If you convert to another religion, she can file a suit for dissolution of marriage and claim maintenance and a share in your property as per Section 4 of the Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act, 1939.If you die intestate (without leaving a will), she can inherit a share in your property as per the rules of succession under Muslim law.Therefore, you may want to take some precautions to protect yourself against any false cases or claims by your future wife. Some possible precautions are:Transfer your properties in the name of your parents before getting married. This may prevent your future wife from claiming any right or interest in them. However, this may not be foolproof, as she may still challenge the validity or genuineness of the transfer and allege that it was done to defraud her or defeat her rights. She may also claim that you have retained some beneficial interest or control over the properties even after transferring them to your parents.Get your father to legally disown you after transferring the properties to him. This may sever your legal relationship with him and make you ineligible to inherit his property. However, this may not be effective either, as disowning is not recognized by law as a valid mode of disinheriting an heir. Your father may still change his mind and revoke his decision to disown you or make a will in your favour. Moreover, disowning may have other adverse consequences for you, such as losing your right to maintenance or family pension from your father.Make a prenuptial agreement with your future wife before getting married. A prenuptial agreement is a contract between two prospective spouses that specifies their rights and obligations regarding their property, finances, maintenance, divorce, etc. A prenuptial agreement may help you to safeguard your properties from any false claims or disputes by your future wife. However, you should be aware that prenuptial agreements are not very common or popular in India and their legal validity and enforceability are still uncertain and debatable.Therefore, none of these precautions may guarantee complete protection against false cases by your future wife to claim your property. The best way to avoid any such trouble is to have a happy and harmonious marriage based on mutual trust, respect, and love.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Property transfer in a larger branch of family",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. A family settlement is an effective alternative dispute resolution mechanism and should be a preferred route for families to protect generational wealth from being marred by disputes. Given the fact that genuine family arrangements/settlements are outside the purview of taxation, this mode of dispute resolution has gained popularity over a period. Civil proceedings in a court are not only time consuming but also a costly affair and therefore family settlements should be a preferred choice for dispute resolution amongst families. Further, as held by the Hon'ble Apex Court there is no alienation (transfer) of property in a family settlement.It would be better to have a detailed discussion in this regard with complete documents to decide the correct procedure.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, Delhi418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma"

    "question": "Property transfer in a larger branch of family",
    "answer": "Dear client,The right procedure to transfer the property without attracting long-term capital gains taxes by the Income Tax department can be complex, and it's essential to consider both the legal and financial aspects.Gift Deed: If the property was received in a family settlement, you may consider executing a gift deed from your name to the family members who should have legal ownership. While gift deeds are generally subject to income tax, if the property was acquired through a family settlement, there may be specific exemptions. Consult with your CA to understand the tax implications fully.Sale Deed: You can sell the property to the family members at a fair market value. Ensure that the sale price is reasonable to avoid any disputes with tax authorities. The tax implications will depend on the difference between the purchase price and the sale price.Family Settlement: If the property was initially received through a family settlement, another family settlement might be considered, but this can be legally complex. Consult with a lawyer to assess the feasibility of this option.Gift Tax Rules: Keep in mind that there are provisions under the Income Tax Act related to gift tax, and you should understand how these apply in your specific case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Australian Citizen looking to sell a home in Hyderabad without OCI. Need help.",
    "answer": "Here are some of the answers and tips that you should know before going ahead with this deal:Yes, you can sell your property without the OCI card and Indian passport, as long as you have a valid visa to enter India and a proof of your identity and ownership of the property. However, having an OCI card or Indian passport would make the process easier and faster, as you would not need a visa and you would be treated as an Indian citizen for most purposes.Your Aadhar card, PAN card and Australian passport may be enough to prove your identity and ownership of the property, but you may also need some other documents, such as the title deed, no objection certificate, encumbrance certificate, tax receipts, etc. You should also check if your Aadhar card and PAN card are still valid and updated, as they may have been deactivated or cancelled after you acquired foreign citizenship.You may have some problems in taxation without the OCI card, as you would be treated as a foreign national for tax purposes. You would be liable to pay capital gains tax on the sale of your property in India, which is 20% for long-term gains (if you held the property for more than two years) and 30% for short-term gains (if you held the property for less than two years). You would also have to pay tax on the income from the sale of your property in Australia, as per the Australian tax laws. However, you can claim a credit for the tax paid in India under the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) between India and Australia.You should be able to get money to Australia without any issues, as long as you comply with the foreign exchange regulations of both countries. You would have to open an NRO (Non-Resident Ordinary) account in India to receive the sale proceeds of your property. You would also have to deduct TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) at 20% or 30% from the sale consideration and deposit it with the Indian government within seven days from the end of the month in which TDS is deducted. You would also have to issue a TDS certificate to yourself in Form 16A within 15 days from the due date of depositing TDS. You can then transfer the money from your NRO account to your Australian bank account after obtaining a certificate from a chartered accountant in Form 15CB and filing an online declaration in Form 15CA on the income tax website. You should also check if there are any limits or restrictions on transferring money from India to Australia by both countries.These are some of the answers and tips that you should know before going ahead with this deal.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear client,Congratulations on obtaining your Australian citizenship! Selling property in India as a foreign citizen can be a complex process, but I can provide some general guidance:Selling Property without OCI Card and Indian Passport:Generally, it is possible to sell property in India without an OCI card or an Indian passport. However, there may be additional documentation and procedures to follow.You may need to appoint a legal representative or a power of attorney holder in India who can act on your behalf in property transactions. This person should be an Indian citizen or an NRI (Non-Resident Indian).It's advisable to consult with a local lawyer in Hyderabad who specializes in property transactions to guide you through the specific requirements and documentation needed.Documents Required:Your Aadhar card, PAN card, and Australian passport are essential documents. These documents will help establish your identity and tax status in India.Ensure that your Aadhar card and PAN card are linked to your property records to facilitate the sale.Taxation:Selling property in India may have tax implications, including capital gains tax. You should consult with a tax expert to understand your tax obligations and ensure compliance with Indian tax laws.Not having an OCI card should not directly impact taxation, but it's important to follow all tax regulations.Repatriation of Funds:As an Australian citizen, you should be able to repatriate the sale proceeds to Australia. However, it's crucial to comply with India's foreign exchange regulations and tax laws.You may need to open an NRE (Non-Resident External) or NRO (Non-Resident Ordinary) bank account in India to receive the funds and then transfer them abroad.Legal Assistance:Engaging a local lawyer in Hyderabad who is well-versed in property transactions and can assist you with the sale process is highly recommended.

    "question": "Related to share",
    "answer": "Nature of Joint Demat Account: In the case of a joint demat account, the holdings are typically operated based on the principle of \"either or survivor.\" This means that if one account holder passes away, the surviving account holder can operate the account and may have rights over the shares in the account.Transmission of Shares: However, the shares held in the name of your deceased father do not automatically become the property of the surviving joint holder (your uncle). Instead, they should be transmitted to the legal heirs or the nominee of the deceased holder. If your father had nominated someone, the shares would be transferred to the nominee. In the absence of a nominee, the legal heirs would need to produce necessary documents like a succession certificate or probate to claim the shares.Legal Action: If your uncle tries to sell the shares of your father without proper authorization or without transmitting them to the legal heirs or nominee, it may amount to a wrongful act. You can:Approach the depository participant (broker) and notify them about your father's demise, providing them with a copy of the death certificate. This would place them on notice, and they may take precautions before allowing any transactions on those shares.If your uncle does proceed with unauthorized sales or transfers, you can approach the court for relief. You can file a civil case for injunction (to stop him from selling further shares) and for recovery (to recover the proceeds from any sales he has already made).Additionally, if he acts fraudulently, criminal charges might be applicable, depending on the specifics of his actions.Preventive Measures: To protect your interests proactively:Approach a lawyer to send a legal notice to your uncle, making it clear that the shares of your father should not be sold and must be transmitted to the legal heirs or nominee.Consider obtaining a succession certificate or probate, which will solidify the legal heir's claim over the assets of the deceased.Notify the relevant authorities, including the depository participant (DP), about the death of your father and ask them to freeze any transactions related to his shares until the transmission process is complete.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Divorce case",
    "answer": "Here's a general overview of the issues you've raised:Reconsideration or High Court:If you believe that the rejection of your application to introduce evidence of your employment status in the divorce case was unjust, you can first consider filing a review or reconsideration petition in the same court, asking the judge to review the decision. If the facts are clear and convincing, the same court might reconsider its position.However, if that is not fruitful or if you believe that the order of the lower court is patently illegal or unjust, you can file an appeal before the High Court against the order of the family court. An attorney will help determine if there are solid grounds for appeal.Consideration of Employment Status for Maintenance:The court generally considers the present financial status of the party while determining maintenance. If you are currently unemployed, it should be a relevant factor for the court.However, the court will also look at other aspects such as your skills, qualifications, past earnings, and the likelihood of future employment. If the court believes that you are intentionally staying unemployed to evade maintenance, it might consider your past earnings instead.If the court has rejected your evidence about unemployment in the divorce case, it might not take that into consideration when deciding maintenance in that particular case. But since it was accepted in the other cases, it should be taken into account in those proceedings.Finalization of Maintenance in Multiple Cases:In your situation, multiple cases where maintenance can be claimed are ongoing, namely DV (Domestic Violence) case,restitution of conjugal rightscase, and the maintenance case itself.Ideally, maintenance should be decided based on your financial capability and the needs of the wife. The court should not double count or overlap maintenance from different cases. Once maintenance is determined in one case, it is generally adjusted or taken into account when deciding maintenance in another case.Maintenance under the DV Act and under Section 125 of the CrPC (criminal procedure code) are different in nature, but they shouldn't overlap.If you believe that the maintenance amounts awarded in different cases are excessive or overlapping, you should raise this concern with your attorney and potentially challenge the orders.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "No punishment for FSL proven forgery?",
    "answer": "Forgery for cheating under Section 468 of theIndian Penal Codeis a non-bailable and non-compoundable offence. A non-bailable offence means that the accused cannot claim bail as a matter of right, but has to apply for it before the court. A non-compoundable offence means that the parties cannot settle the matter out of court. The punishment for forgery under Section 468 is imprisonment up to seven years and fine.However, the Supreme Court has issued some guidelines to prevent the misuse of arrest and detention powers by the police and to protect the rights of the accused. The court has directed that arrest should be made only in exceptional cases where there is a reasonable suspicion of the accused being involved in a serious offence or being likely to abscond or tamper with evidence or threaten witnesses. The court has also directed that the police should record the reasons for making or not making an arrest and inform the accused of his rights and the grounds of arrest.Therefore, it is possible that the police did not arrest the person who forged your signature because they did not find any compelling reason to do so, or because they followed the Supreme Court’s guidelines. However, this does not mean that the person can go scot-free with just a warning. He can still be prosecuted and punished by the court if he is found guilty of forgery.As for your second question, you can use the FSL report obtained in your criminal case as evidence in your civil case, provided that you follow certain procedures. You will have to file an application before the civil court seeking permission to use the FSL report as evidence. You will also have to give notice to the other party and give them an opportunity to cross-examine the FSL expert or challenge the report. The civil court will then decide whether to admit or reject the FSL report as evidence based on its relevance and reliability.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Jurisdiction of Application for Probate of will",
    "answer": "Probate is a legal process that certifies the validity and authenticity of a will and grants the executor the authority to execute the will. Probate is mandatory in India when the will is made by a Hindu, Jain, Sikh or Buddhist residing in West Bengal, Chennai or Mumbai, or when the will deals with movable or immovable property situated in these places.If the property is in Mumbai, but the will is registered in Gujarat, then you have to apply for probate of will in Mumbai, where the property is situated. The competent court to file probate proceedings is the district court of the city/town where the deceased lived at the time of death. However, if the will has been proved and deposited in a court of competent jurisdiction situated beyond the limits of India, or a properly authenticated copy of the will is produced, then letters of administration may be granted by an Indian court of competent jurisdiction to enforce such will.To apply for probate of will, you need to file a petition along with the original will and other documents to the court. You also need to pay the stamp duty and registration fees depending on the value of the assets. The court will then issue a notice to the next of kin of the deceased and publish a citation to invite any objections from the public. If there are no objections, then the court will grant the probate. If there are objections, then the probate petition will become an original suit and you will have to prove your case through evidence and arguments.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Nature of Joint Demat Account: In the case of a joint demat account, the holdings are typically operated based on the principle of \"either or survivor.\" This means that if one account holder passes away, the surviving account holder can operate the account and may have rights over the shares in the account.Transmission of Shares: However, the shares held in the name of your deceased father do not automatically become the property of the surviving joint holder (your uncle). Instead, they should be transmitted to the legal heirs or the nominee of the deceased holder. If your father had nominated someone, the shares would be transferred to the nominee. In the absence of a nominee, the legal heirs would need to produce necessary documents like a succession certificate or probate to claim the shares.Legal Action: If your uncle tries to sell the shares of your father without proper authorization or without transmitting them to the legal heirs or nominee, it may amount to a wrongful act. You can:Approach the depository participant (broker) and notify them about your father's demise, providing them with a copy of the death certificate. This would place them on notice, and they may take precautions before allowing any transactions on those shares.If your uncle does proceed with unauthorized sales or transfers, you can approach the court for relief. You can file a civil case for injunction (to stop him from selling further shares) and for recovery (to recover the proceeds from any sales he has already made).Additionally, if he acts fraudulently, criminal charges might be applicable, depending on the specifics of his actions.Preventive Measures: To protect your interests proactively:Approach a lawyer to send a legal notice to your uncle, making it clear that the shares of your father should not be sold and must be transmitted to the legal heirs or nominee.Consider obtaining a succession certificate or probate, which will solidify the legal heir's claim over the assets of the deceased.Notify the relevant authorities, including the depository participant (DP), about the death of your father and ask them to freeze any transactions related to his shares until the transmission process is complete.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Divorce case",
    "answer": "Here's a general overview of the issues you've raised:Reconsideration or High Court:If you believe that the rejection of your application to introduce evidence of your employment status in the divorce case was unjust, you can first consider filing a review or reconsideration petition in the same court, asking the judge to review the decision. If the facts are clear and convincing, the same court might reconsider its position.However, if that is not fruitful or if you believe that the order of the lower court is patently illegal or unjust, you can file an appeal before the High Court against the order of the family court. An attorney will help determine if there are solid grounds for appeal.Consideration of Employment Status for Maintenance:The court generally considers the present financial status of the party while determining maintenance. If you are currently unemployed, it should be a relevant factor for the court.However, the court will also look at other aspects such as your skills, qualifications, past earnings, and the likelihood of future employment. If the court believes that you are intentionally staying unemployed to evade maintenance, it might consider your past earnings instead.If the court has rejected your evidence about unemployment in the divorce case, it might not take that into consideration when deciding maintenance in that particular case. But since it was accepted in the other cases, it should be taken into account in those proceedings.Finalization of Maintenance in Multiple Cases:In your situation, multiple cases where maintenance can be claimed are ongoing, namely DV (Domestic Violence) case,restitution of conjugal rightscase, and the maintenance case itself.Ideally, maintenance should be decided based on your financial capability and the needs of the wife. The court should not double count or overlap maintenance from different cases. Once maintenance is determined in one case, it is generally adjusted or taken into account when deciding maintenance in another case.Maintenance under the DV Act and under Section 125 of the CrPC (criminal procedure code) are different in nature, but they shouldn't overlap.If you believe that the maintenance amounts awarded in different cases are excessive or overlapping, you should raise this concern with your attorney and potentially challenge the orders.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Running tuition in flat",
    "answer": "As per available information, giving tuition in your flat is not a commercial activity, as long as it does not cause any nuisance or inconvenience to other residents of the society. The Supreme Court of India has held that imparting education is a benevolent cause and not a business, and that a person can use a part of his or her residential premises for teaching purposes, as long as the dominant use remains residential.However, some co-operative housing societies may have their own rules and regulations regarding the use of residential flats for tuition or other purposes. These rules and regulations may vary from society to society and may depend on various factors such as the number of students, the timings, the parking space, the noise level, etc. The society may object to your tuition classes if they violate any of these rules and regulations or if they affect the rights and interests of other members.To deal with this situation, you may have to take the following steps:You have to check the bye-laws and regulations of your society and see if there is any provision that prohibits or restricts the use of residential flats for tuition or other purposes. You also have to see if there is any procedure or permission required for conducting tuition classes in your flat.You have to communicate with the society members and the committee and explain to them that your tuition classes are not a commercial activity and that they do not cause any nuisance or inconvenience to anyone. You have to assure them that you are following all the rules and regulations of the society and that you are ready to cooperate with them in resolving any issues or grievances.You have to seek prior permission from the society for conducting tuition classes in your flat and obtain a written consent from them. You may also have to pay some extra maintenance charges or fees to the society for using their facilities or services.You have to take some precautions and measures to avoid any disturbance or trouble to other residents of the society. For example, you can limit the number of students per batch, arrange for proper parking space, maintain a reasonable noise level, etc.If the society still objects to your tuition classes or tries to stop them without any valid reason, you can take legal action against them. You can file a complaint with the registrar of co-operative societies or the co-operative court and seek relief such as injunction, restoration, compensation, etc. You can also approach a civil court or a high court and seek a writ of mandamus or certiorari against the society’s action.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

There can be diverse view taking into consideration the nuisance if any is created by increasing number of students in a residential complex. Occupancy right of a member of the cooperative housing society including the terms and conditions and the purpose of the use of the flat are specified in its registered Bye-Laws. Since your society is recently handed over to its members, you need to go through the bye-laws and then if it says to seek permission then you may propose a permission letter to the committee members of the society and obtain their sanction for running your tuition class at your own residential premises. Members conducting tuition Classes in their flats in housing societies is quite common feature and the management is really at a loss to handle it properly without creating ill-will with in otherwise harmonious environment. Where a flat Owner seeks  prior permission to use the flat for tuition classes  it will be extremely difficult to refuse except on the ground that the proposed classes would pose serious threat to security and peace, excessive engagement of the lift which may cause a grave inconvenience to the residents, as also higher  running and maintenance expenses of lift, parking problems, where classes are proposed to be run as a professional activity by a member giving on rentals to a commercial organization etc. The managing committee would be well advised to put it up before the members in the general body meeting as the managing committee does not have an express/implied power under any Bye-law to consider such request and decide. However, needless to mention that there are catena of judgments of Hon'ble Apex Court that the bye-laws of the society hold supremacy over the Gujarat Cooperative Society act and regulations thereunder therefor in given set of facts, it is advisable for you to get the copy of registered bye-laws and thereafter if there is no express provision in it against the running of tuition classes then please place a request letter/ permission letter in appropriate form as stated above.Pooja AsharAdvocate, Ahmedabad237 Answers4 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Pooja Ashar"

    "question": "No punishment for FSL proven forgery?",
    "answer": "Forgery for cheating under Section 468 of theIndian Penal Codeis a non-bailable and non-compoundable offence. A non-bailable offence means that the accused cannot claim bail as a matter of right, but has to apply for it before the court. A non-compoundable offence means that the parties cannot settle the matter out of court. The punishment for forgery under Section 468 is imprisonment up to seven years and fine.However, the Supreme Court has issued some guidelines to prevent the misuse of arrest and detention powers by the police and to protect the rights of the accused. The court has directed that arrest should be made only in exceptional cases where there is a reasonable suspicion of the accused being involved in a serious offence or being likely to abscond or tamper with evidence or threaten witnesses. The court has also directed that the police should record the reasons for making or not making an arrest and inform the accused of his rights and the grounds of arrest.Therefore, it is possible that the police did not arrest the person who forged your signature because they did not find any compelling reason to do so, or because they followed the Supreme Court’s guidelines. However, this does not mean that the person can go scot-free with just a warning. He can still be prosecuted and punished by the court if he is found guilty of forgery.As for your second question, you can use the FSL report obtained in your criminal case as evidence in your civil case, provided that you follow certain procedures. You will have to file an application before the civil court seeking permission to use the FSL report as evidence. You will also have to give notice to the other party and give them an opportunity to cross-examine the FSL expert or challenge the report. The civil court will then decide whether to admit or reject the FSL report as evidence based on its relevance and reliability.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Jurisdiction of Application for Probate of will",
    "answer": "Probate is a legal process that certifies the validity and authenticity of a will and grants the executor the authority to execute the will. Probate is mandatory in India when the will is made by a Hindu, Jain, Sikh or Buddhist residing in West Bengal, Chennai or Mumbai, or when the will deals with movable or immovable property situated in these places.If the property is in Mumbai, but the will is registered in Gujarat, then you have to apply for probate of will in Mumbai, where the property is situated. The competent court to file probate proceedings is the district court of the city/town where the deceased lived at the time of death. However, if the will has been proved and deposited in a court of competent jurisdiction situated beyond the limits of India, or a properly authenticated copy of the will is produced, then letters of administration may be granted by an Indian court of competent jurisdiction to enforce such will.To apply for probate of will, you need to file a petition along with the original will and other documents to the court. You also need to pay the stamp duty and registration fees depending on the value of the assets. The court will then issue a notice to the next of kin of the deceased and publish a citation to invite any objections from the public. If there are no objections, then the court will grant the probate. If there are objections, then the probate petition will become an original suit and you will have to prove your case through evidence and arguments.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Filling & Appeal the cases repeatedly",
    "answer": "Dear client,Whether this case is maintainable?The maintainability of the case depends on various factors, including the specific laws and regulations of your jurisdiction. It appears that the plaintiff has filed an appeal against the dismissal of the suit. The appellate court will determine the maintainability of the appeal based on relevant laws and grounds.On what ground respondents need to contest.Respondents may contest the appeal on various grounds, such as challenging the validity of the appellant's reasons for delay, disputing the claims made in the appeal, and defending the lower court's decision. They should consult with their legal counsel for specific strategies.Whether it is the duty of counsel to inform the outcome of the case to the plaintiff on a regular basis?Yes, it is generally the duty of legal counsel to keep their clients informed about the progress and outcome of their cases. However, communication expectations should be clarified between the client and their attorney.Whether the reasons cited by the appellant for condone delay are acceptable?The acceptability of the reasons for condoning the delay will be determined by the appellate court. They will assess whether the reasons provided by the appellant are valid and reasonable.Why the court failed to scrutinize basic documents before issuing the notice to respondents?Court procedures and scrutiny vary by jurisdiction. If you believe there was an issue with the court's procedure,On what ground the plaintiff/appellant needs to be punished both in terms of financial and imprisonment for repeatedly filing meritless suits?The court may consider sanctions or penalties for repeatedly filing meritless suits,  It's up to the court to decide whether punitive measures are warranted.In the same RA, what grounds respondents need to file an application in court to recover litigation costs from the plaintiff/appellant?Respondents may file an application for the recovery of litigation costs if they believe the plaintiff/appellant filed the suit frivolously or in bad faith. The court will consider the merits of such an application.What preventative measures can be taken to ensure the plaintiff/appellant does not file meritless suits repeatedly?Preventative measures may include sanctions for abusive litigation practices, court orders, or other legal actions aimed at discouraging the filing of frivolous suits."

    "question": "Related to share",
    "answer": "Nature of Joint Demat Account: In the case of a joint demat account, the holdings are typically operated based on the principle of \"either or survivor.\" This means that if one account holder passes away, the surviving account holder can operate the account and may have rights over the shares in the account.Transmission of Shares: However, the shares held in the name of your deceased father do not automatically become the property of the surviving joint holder (your uncle). Instead, they should be transmitted to the legal heirs or the nominee of the deceased holder. If your father had nominated someone, the shares would be transferred to the nominee. In the absence of a nominee, the legal heirs would need to produce necessary documents like a succession certificate or probate to claim the shares.Legal Action: If your uncle tries to sell the shares of your father without proper authorization or without transmitting them to the legal heirs or nominee, it may amount to a wrongful act. You can:Approach the depository participant (broker) and notify them about your father's demise, providing them with a copy of the death certificate. This would place them on notice, and they may take precautions before allowing any transactions on those shares.If your uncle does proceed with unauthorized sales or transfers, you can approach the court for relief. You can file a civil case for injunction (to stop him from selling further shares) and for recovery (to recover the proceeds from any sales he has already made).Additionally, if he acts fraudulently, criminal charges might be applicable, depending on the specifics of his actions.Preventive Measures: To protect your interests proactively:Approach a lawyer to send a legal notice to your uncle, making it clear that the shares of your father should not be sold and must be transmitted to the legal heirs or nominee.Consider obtaining a succession certificate or probate, which will solidify the legal heir's claim over the assets of the deceased.Notify the relevant authorities, including the depository participant (DP), about the death of your father and ask them to freeze any transactions related to his shares until the transmission process is complete.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Divorce case",
    "answer": "Here's a general overview of the issues you've raised:Reconsideration or High Court:If you believe that the rejection of your application to introduce evidence of your employment status in the divorce case was unjust, you can first consider filing a review or reconsideration petition in the same court, asking the judge to review the decision. If the facts are clear and convincing, the same court might reconsider its position.However, if that is not fruitful or if you believe that the order of the lower court is patently illegal or unjust, you can file an appeal before the High Court against the order of the family court. An attorney will help determine if there are solid grounds for appeal.Consideration of Employment Status for Maintenance:The court generally considers the present financial status of the party while determining maintenance. If you are currently unemployed, it should be a relevant factor for the court.However, the court will also look at other aspects such as your skills, qualifications, past earnings, and the likelihood of future employment. If the court believes that you are intentionally staying unemployed to evade maintenance, it might consider your past earnings instead.If the court has rejected your evidence about unemployment in the divorce case, it might not take that into consideration when deciding maintenance in that particular case. But since it was accepted in the other cases, it should be taken into account in those proceedings.Finalization of Maintenance in Multiple Cases:In your situation, multiple cases where maintenance can be claimed are ongoing, namely DV (Domestic Violence) case,restitution of conjugal rightscase, and the maintenance case itself.Ideally, maintenance should be decided based on your financial capability and the needs of the wife. The court should not double count or overlap maintenance from different cases. Once maintenance is determined in one case, it is generally adjusted or taken into account when deciding maintenance in another case.Maintenance under the DV Act and under Section 125 of the CrPC (criminal procedure code) are different in nature, but they shouldn't overlap.If you believe that the maintenance amounts awarded in different cases are excessive or overlapping, you should raise this concern with your attorney and potentially challenge the orders.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

You should only state that you need the proof for personal reasons and request them to provide you with a letter or a certificate that confirms his employment status, salary, and duration of work. You should also attach a copy of your marriage certificate and your husband’s passport as proof of your relationship.If you do not get any official authorization letter from his work, you can still claim interim maintenance for yourself and your daughter based on the evidence that you have already submitted, such as his payslip, bank statements, tax returns, etc. The court will decide the amount of maintenance after considering various factors, such as your income, expenses, standard of living, needs of the child, etc. You can also request the court to direct your husband to produce his latest income proof or to appoint a commissioner to investigate his assets and income in Australia.If your husband and his family are not appearing in the court for the DVC and child custody cases, you can request the court to issue a warrant against them or to declare them as proclaimed offenders. You can also seek the help of the Indian embassy or consulate in Australia to serve them the summons or notices. If they still do not appear, the court may proceed ex parte and pass orders in your favour based on the evidence that you have produced. However, these orders may not be enforceable in Australia unless they are recognized by the Australian courts.To get a divorce from your husband, you have two options:You can file a divorce petition in India under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 on any of the grounds mentioned in Section 13, such as cruelty, desertion, adultery, conversion, etc. However, this may take a long time and require multiple hearings and evidence.You can file a divorce petition in Australia under the Family Law Act, 1975 on the ground of irretrievable breakdown of marriage.

    "question": "Divorce",
    "answer": "Divorce for NRI marriages in India can be a complex and lengthy process, as it involves various legal and practical issues. Some of the key aspects of NRI divorce in India are:Grounds for Divorce: If both parties do not agree to a mutual divorce, your brother can seek a contested divorce on various grounds provided under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955. Given the circumstances, two potential grounds stand out:Desertion: If one spouse abandons the other without reasonable cause and without the consent of the other, it amounts to desertion. A continuous period of desertion for two years or more immediately preceding the presentation of the divorce petition is a ground for divorce.No Resumption of Co-habitation: If there has been no resumption of cohabitation between the parties for a period of one year or more after the passing of a decree for judicial separation or a decree/order ofrestitution of conjugal rights, it can be a ground for divorce.Jurisdiction: Divorce proceedings can be initiated in a court where:The marriage was solemnized,The parties last resided together, orThe petitioner is residing at the time of presentation of the petition, provided the other party is a resident of such place.Legal Notice: Before initiating divorce proceedings, it's advisable for your brother to send a legal notice through an advocate to his wife, mentioning his intent to divorce and reasons thereof. This would not only act as a formal communication of his intentions but also provide an opportunity for her to respond or enter into negotiations for an amicable solution.Attempt at Reconciliation: The court, in divorce cases, usually refers the parties for mediation to try and facilitate a reconciliation or an amicable settlement. If the mediation fails, then the court proceedings continue.Documentary Evidence: It will be essential to gather all relevant documents, such as marriage certificate, any communication records, evidence of her moving to New Zealand, or any other relevant evidence that can support his claim in court.Legal Representation: Your brother should hire an experienced family lawyer who can guide him through the process, prepare the necessary legal documents, represent him in court, and handle negotiations if there's a possibility of an amicable settlement.Duration: Contested divorces can be time-consuming, especially if one party does not cooperate. The exact duration would depend on the specific circumstances of the case, evidence presented, court's caseload, and other factors.If she doesn't return or respond even after the legal notice, and if efforts at reconciliation fail, your brother can proceed with filing a petition for divorce based on the grounds mentioned.It would be wise for your brother to consult with a family lawyer in India to get a clearer understanding of his rights and the best course of action.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Jurisdiction of Application for Probate of will",
    "answer": "Probate is a legal process that certifies the validity and authenticity of a will and grants the executor the authority to execute the will. Probate is mandatory in India when the will is made by a Hindu, Jain, Sikh or Buddhist residing in West Bengal, Chennai or Mumbai, or when the will deals with movable or immovable property situated in these places.If the property is in Mumbai, but the will is registered in Gujarat, then you have to apply for probate of will in Mumbai, where the property is situated. The competent court to file probate proceedings is the district court of the city/town where the deceased lived at the time of death. However, if the will has been proved and deposited in a court of competent jurisdiction situated beyond the limits of India, or a properly authenticated copy of the will is produced, then letters of administration may be granted by an Indian court of competent jurisdiction to enforce such will.To apply for probate of will, you need to file a petition along with the original will and other documents to the court. You also need to pay the stamp duty and registration fees depending on the value of the assets. The court will then issue a notice to the next of kin of the deceased and publish a citation to invite any objections from the public. If there are no objections, then the court will grant the probate. If there are objections, then the probate petition will become an original suit and you will have to prove your case through evidence and arguments.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

This includes obtaining proper receipts for rent, accessing society's common facilities, inviting guests without causing disturbance, and using the parking space allocated by your landlord. The society shouldn't impose arbitrary rules on you.To address this issue:Open a Dialogue: Initiate a conversation with the ex-chairman and secretary. Ask for evidence supporting their claims against you, like CCTV footage. Get your landlord involved, as they hold the responsibility for your tenancy and can communicate with the society on your behalf.Legal Notice: If harassment continues, send a legal notice through a lawyer, demanding an end to their intimidating behavior and any rights violations.Police Complaint: Lodge a complaint against them under sections of theIndian Penal Codefor outraging and insulting a woman's modesty, criminal intimidation, and intentional insult. If they've misused your personal data, invoke sections of the Information Technology Act.Consumer Forum: File a complaint under theConsumer Protection Act, stating their unfair practices and service deficiencies. Claim compensation for the mental distress you've endured.Cooperative Societies Complaint: Approach the registrar of cooperative societies, citing the ex-chairman and secretary's breach of society bye-laws. Request an inquiry into their behavior.Taking these steps should help in addressing and hopefully resolving the harassment you're facing.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "No punishment for FSL proven forgery?",
    "answer": "Forgery for cheating under Section 468 of theIndian Penal Codeis a non-bailable and non-compoundable offence. A non-bailable offence means that the accused cannot claim bail as a matter of right, but has to apply for it before the court. A non-compoundable offence means that the parties cannot settle the matter out of court. The punishment for forgery under Section 468 is imprisonment up to seven years and fine.However, the Supreme Court has issued some guidelines to prevent the misuse of arrest and detention powers by the police and to protect the rights of the accused. The court has directed that arrest should be made only in exceptional cases where there is a reasonable suspicion of the accused being involved in a serious offence or being likely to abscond or tamper with evidence or threaten witnesses. The court has also directed that the police should record the reasons for making or not making an arrest and inform the accused of his rights and the grounds of arrest.Therefore, it is possible that the police did not arrest the person who forged your signature because they did not find any compelling reason to do so, or because they followed the Supreme Court’s guidelines. However, this does not mean that the person can go scot-free with just a warning. He can still be prosecuted and punished by the court if he is found guilty of forgery.As for your second question, you can use the FSL report obtained in your criminal case as evidence in your civil case, provided that you follow certain procedures. You will have to file an application before the civil court seeking permission to use the FSL report as evidence. You will also have to give notice to the other party and give them an opportunity to cross-examine the FSL expert or challenge the report. The civil court will then decide whether to admit or reject the FSL report as evidence based on its relevance and reliability.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Jurisdiction of Application for Probate of will",
    "answer": "Probate is a legal process that certifies the validity and authenticity of a will and grants the executor the authority to execute the will. Probate is mandatory in India when the will is made by a Hindu, Jain, Sikh or Buddhist residing in West Bengal, Chennai or Mumbai, or when the will deals with movable or immovable property situated in these places.If the property is in Mumbai, but the will is registered in Gujarat, then you have to apply for probate of will in Mumbai, where the property is situated. The competent court to file probate proceedings is the district court of the city/town where the deceased lived at the time of death. However, if the will has been proved and deposited in a court of competent jurisdiction situated beyond the limits of India, or a properly authenticated copy of the will is produced, then letters of administration may be granted by an Indian court of competent jurisdiction to enforce such will.To apply for probate of will, you need to file a petition along with the original will and other documents to the court. You also need to pay the stamp duty and registration fees depending on the value of the assets. The court will then issue a notice to the next of kin of the deceased and publish a citation to invite any objections from the public. If there are no objections, then the court will grant the probate. If there are objections, then the probate petition will become an original suit and you will have to prove your case through evidence and arguments.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

The division is based on several factors, and it is not automatically divided on a 50-50 basis.Here's a breakdown of your query:No Automatic Entitlement to 50% Share: Under Indian law, there's no automatic entitlement for the wife to claim a 50% share in the husband's property upon divorce. The division of property is decided on a case-by-case basis by the courts, considering various factors.Contribution to Household: The fact that the wife has contributed to children's expenses and household chores is indeed significant. Courts recognize non-monetary and indirect contributions like household chores, child-rearing, and the overall contribution to the family's welfare as substantial when determining alimony or maintenance. However, this doesn't necessarily translate to a direct 50% share in the property.Other Considerations: Courts will also consider other factors such as the duration of the marriage, the financial and non-financial contributions of each party to the welfare of the family, the income and property of each party, the standard of living enjoyed by the parties during the marriage, and the physical and emotional conditions of the parties.Maintenance and Alimony: Instead of a division of property, the wife may be entitled to maintenance or alimony, either one-time or periodic, depending on the circumstances of the case. The court will decide on maintenance considering the wife's own earnings, the husband's financial status, and their standard of living during the marriage.Mutual Consent: If the divorce is by mutual consent, then the division of property can be decided mutually between the husband and wife, and they can enter into a settlement agreement detailing the division.It's essential to consult with a lawyer to get a more comprehensive understanding tailored to the specifics of the case.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "No punishment for FSL proven forgery?",
    "answer": "Forgery for cheating under Section 468 of theIndian Penal Codeis a non-bailable and non-compoundable offence. A non-bailable offence means that the accused cannot claim bail as a matter of right, but has to apply for it before the court. A non-compoundable offence means that the parties cannot settle the matter out of court. The punishment for forgery under Section 468 is imprisonment up to seven years and fine.However, the Supreme Court has issued some guidelines to prevent the misuse of arrest and detention powers by the police and to protect the rights of the accused. The court has directed that arrest should be made only in exceptional cases where there is a reasonable suspicion of the accused being involved in a serious offence or being likely to abscond or tamper with evidence or threaten witnesses. The court has also directed that the police should record the reasons for making or not making an arrest and inform the accused of his rights and the grounds of arrest.Therefore, it is possible that the police did not arrest the person who forged your signature because they did not find any compelling reason to do so, or because they followed the Supreme Court’s guidelines. However, this does not mean that the person can go scot-free with just a warning. He can still be prosecuted and punished by the court if he is found guilty of forgery.As for your second question, you can use the FSL report obtained in your criminal case as evidence in your civil case, provided that you follow certain procedures. You will have to file an application before the civil court seeking permission to use the FSL report as evidence. You will also have to give notice to the other party and give them an opportunity to cross-examine the FSL expert or challenge the report. The civil court will then decide whether to admit or reject the FSL report as evidence based on its relevance and reliability.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Jurisdiction of Application for Probate of will",
    "answer": "Probate is a legal process that certifies the validity and authenticity of a will and grants the executor the authority to execute the will. Probate is mandatory in India when the will is made by a Hindu, Jain, Sikh or Buddhist residing in West Bengal, Chennai or Mumbai, or when the will deals with movable or immovable property situated in these places.If the property is in Mumbai, but the will is registered in Gujarat, then you have to apply for probate of will in Mumbai, where the property is situated. The competent court to file probate proceedings is the district court of the city/town where the deceased lived at the time of death. However, if the will has been proved and deposited in a court of competent jurisdiction situated beyond the limits of India, or a properly authenticated copy of the will is produced, then letters of administration may be granted by an Indian court of competent jurisdiction to enforce such will.To apply for probate of will, you need to file a petition along with the original will and other documents to the court. You also need to pay the stamp duty and registration fees depending on the value of the assets. The court will then issue a notice to the next of kin of the deceased and publish a citation to invite any objections from the public. If there are no objections, then the court will grant the probate. If there are objections, then the probate petition will become an original suit and you will have to prove your case through evidence and arguments.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "A Gram panchayat layout refers to a plot arrangement approved by the Gram panchayat, the governing body in rural regions. Such layouts might not always have clearance from the Director of Town and Country Planning (DTCP) or the Urban Development Authority (UDA). Purchasing a plot in these layouts can pose risks like unclear titles or lack of amenities.When considering a plot in a Gram panchayat layout in Telangana, here's a checklist:Title Deed Verification: Ensure the land's title deed, the main ownership document, is clear and authenticated by the sub-registrar’s office.Encumbrance Certificate (EC): This certificate shows the land's transaction history for a minimum of 30 years and should be free from any claims.Layout Approval Certificate: It certifies the plot layout's approval by the relevant authority, either Gram panchayat, DTCP, or UDA. Also, ensure RERA registration.Land Use Certificate: Ensure the land's conversion from agricultural to non-agricultural residential use, obtained from the revenue department.GO 111 Area Check: Ensure the land doesn't fall under the GO 111 area that restricts construction near Himayatsagar and Osmansagar lakes.R1 Zone Check: Verify if the land is in the R1 residential zone, which allows specific housing development parameters.Document Verification: Ensure related documents like sale agreement, mutation record, tax receipts, etc., are accurate and updated.Amenities Check: Assess basic facilities like road access, water, electricity, drainage, and confirm no pending dues on these services.Professional Help: Engage a lawyer for legal document reviews and a surveyor for accurate plot measurements.In essence, while purchasing a plot in Telangana's Gram panchayat layout, thorough due diligence is essential to avoid potential pitfalls.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

  {
    "context": "Asked 1 year ago in Family Law Religion: Christian",
    "question": "Division of property under Christian law",
    "answer": "In India, the division of property after divorce for Christians is governed by the Indian Divorce Act, 1869, and personal laws are not applicable in determining the division of assets. The division is based on several factors, and it is not automatically divided on a 50-50 basis.Here's a breakdown of your query:No Automatic Entitlement to 50% Share: Under Indian law, there's no automatic entitlement for the wife to claim a 50% share in the husband's property upon divorce. The division of property is decided on a case-by-case basis by the courts, considering various factors.Contribution to Household: The fact that the wife has contributed to children's expenses and household chores is indeed significant. Courts recognize non-monetary and indirect contributions like household chores, child-rearing, and the overall contribution to the family's welfare as substantial when determining alimony or maintenance. However, this doesn't necessarily translate to a direct 50% share in the property.Other Considerations: Courts will also consider other factors such as the duration of the marriage, the financial and non-financial contributions of each party to the welfare of the family, the income and property of each party, the standard of living enjoyed by the parties during the marriage, and the physical and emotional conditions of the parties.Maintenance and Alimony: Instead of a division of property, the wife may be entitled to maintenance or alimony, either one-time or periodic, depending on the circumstances of the case. The court will decide on maintenance considering the wife's own earnings, the husband's financial status, and their standard of living during the marriage.Mutual Consent: If the divorce is by mutual consent, then the division of property can be decided mutually between the husband and wife, and they can enter into a settlement agreement detailing the division.It's essential to consult with a lawyer to get a more comprehensive understanding tailored to the specifics of the case.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

This includes obtaining proper receipts for rent, accessing society's common facilities, inviting guests without causing disturbance, and using the parking space allocated by your landlord. The society shouldn't impose arbitrary rules on you.To address this issue:Open a Dialogue: Initiate a conversation with the ex-chairman and secretary. Ask for evidence supporting their claims against you, like CCTV footage. Get your landlord involved, as they hold the responsibility for your tenancy and can communicate with the society on your behalf.Legal Notice: If harassment continues, send a legal notice through a lawyer, demanding an end to their intimidating behavior and any rights violations.Police Complaint: Lodge a complaint against them under sections of theIndian Penal Codefor outraging and insulting a woman's modesty, criminal intimidation, and intentional insult. If they've misused your personal data, invoke sections of the Information Technology Act.Consumer Forum: File a complaint under theConsumer Protection Act, stating their unfair practices and service deficiencies. Claim compensation for the mental distress you've endured.Cooperative Societies Complaint: Approach the registrar of cooperative societies, citing the ex-chairman and secretary's breach of society bye-laws. Request an inquiry into their behavior.Taking these steps should help in addressing and hopefully resolving the harassment you're facing.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

Such seepage can result from leakages due to poor material quality, incorrect installation, or lack of maintenance. Regular inspections and maintenance of the plumbing system in the upper flat can mitigate such problems.If the resident of the upper flat is uncooperative in addressing the issue, several legal measures can be taken:Legal Notice: A notice can be sent to the resident of the upper flat, demanding the cessation of the leakage and appropriate repairs. Compensation for damages can also be claimed.Society Intervention: A complaint can be lodged with the apartment's society. The society has the responsibility of ensuring the maintenance of common areas and addressing nuisances caused by any members.Local Authorities: Reporting the problem to the local municipal corporation or development authority can be effective. These bodies are tasked with enforcing building regulations.Consumer Forum: Victims can approach the district consumer forum under theConsumer Protection Act, 2019, arguing that the upper flat owner's negligence is an unfair trade practice.Civil Suit: A lawsuit can be filed claiming that the upper flat owner's negligence has significantly interfered with the use of the property in the lower flat, seeking injunctions and damages.It is essential to address such issues promptly to avoid escalating damage and health risks.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "I am sorry to hear that you are facing harassment from the ex-chairman and the secretary of your housing society for being a bachelor female tenant. I will try to provide you some information and suggestions to resolve your issue:You possess the right to reside securely in your rented flat without interference or discrimination from society members. This includes obtaining proper receipts for rent, accessing society's common facilities, inviting guests without causing disturbance, and using the parking space allocated by your landlord. The society shouldn't impose arbitrary rules on you.To address this issue:Open a Dialogue: Initiate a conversation with the ex-chairman and secretary. Ask for evidence supporting their claims against you, like CCTV footage. Get your landlord involved, as they hold the responsibility for your tenancy and can communicate with the society on your behalf.Legal Notice: If harassment continues, send a legal notice through a lawyer, demanding an end to their intimidating behavior and any rights violations.Police Complaint: Lodge a complaint against them under sections of theIndian Penal Codefor outraging and insulting a woman's modesty, criminal intimidation, and intentional insult. If they've misused your personal data, invoke sections of the Information Technology Act.Consumer Forum: File a complaint under theConsumer Protection Act, stating their unfair practices and service deficiencies. Claim compensation for the mental distress you've endured.Cooperative Societies Complaint: Approach the registrar of cooperative societies, citing the ex-chairman and secretary's breach of society bye-laws. Request an inquiry into their behavior.Taking these steps should help in addressing and hopefully resolving the harassment you're facing.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Divorce",
    "answer": "Divorce for NRI marriages in India can be a complex and lengthy process, as it involves various legal and practical issues. Some of the key aspects of NRI divorce in India are:Grounds for Divorce: If both parties do not agree to a mutual divorce, your brother can seek a contested divorce on various grounds provided under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955. Given the circumstances, two potential grounds stand out:Desertion: If one spouse abandons the other without reasonable cause and without the consent of the other, it amounts to desertion. A continuous period of desertion for two years or more immediately preceding the presentation of the divorce petition is a ground for divorce.No Resumption of Co-habitation: If there has been no resumption of cohabitation between the parties for a period of one year or more after the passing of a decree for judicial separation or a decree/order ofrestitution of conjugal rights, it can be a ground for divorce.Jurisdiction: Divorce proceedings can be initiated in a court where:The marriage was solemnized,The parties last resided together, orThe petitioner is residing at the time of presentation of the petition, provided the other party is a resident of such place.Legal Notice: Before initiating divorce proceedings, it's advisable for your brother to send a legal notice through an advocate to his wife, mentioning his intent to divorce and reasons thereof. This would not only act as a formal communication of his intentions but also provide an opportunity for her to respond or enter into negotiations for an amicable solution.Attempt at Reconciliation: The court, in divorce cases, usually refers the parties for mediation to try and facilitate a reconciliation or an amicable settlement. If the mediation fails, then the court proceedings continue.Documentary Evidence: It will be essential to gather all relevant documents, such as marriage certificate, any communication records, evidence of her moving to New Zealand, or any other relevant evidence that can support his claim in court.Legal Representation: Your brother should hire an experienced family lawyer who can guide him through the process, prepare the necessary legal documents, represent him in court, and handle negotiations if there's a possibility of an amicable settlement.Duration: Contested divorces can be time-consuming, especially if one party does not cooperate. The exact duration would depend on the specific circumstances of the case, evidence presented, court's caseload, and other factors.If she doesn't return or respond even after the legal notice, and if efforts at reconciliation fail, your brother can proceed with filing a petition for divorce based on the grounds mentioned.It would be wise for your brother to consult with a family lawyer in India to get a clearer understanding of his rights and the best course of action.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Divorce",
    "answer": "Divorce for NRI marriages in India can be a complex and lengthy process, as it involves various legal and practical issues. Some of the key aspects of NRI divorce in India are:Grounds for Divorce: If both parties do not agree to a mutual divorce, your brother can seek a contested divorce on various grounds provided under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955. Given the circumstances, two potential grounds stand out:Desertion: If one spouse abandons the other without reasonable cause and without the consent of the other, it amounts to desertion. A continuous period of desertion for two years or more immediately preceding the presentation of the divorce petition is a ground for divorce.No Resumption of Co-habitation: If there has been no resumption of cohabitation between the parties for a period of one year or more after the passing of a decree for judicial separation or a decree/order ofrestitution of conjugal rights, it can be a ground for divorce.Jurisdiction: Divorce proceedings can be initiated in a court where:The marriage was solemnized,The parties last resided together, orThe petitioner is residing at the time of presentation of the petition, provided the other party is a resident of such place.Legal Notice: Before initiating divorce proceedings, it's advisable for your brother to send a legal notice through an advocate to his wife, mentioning his intent to divorce and reasons thereof. This would not only act as a formal communication of his intentions but also provide an opportunity for her to respond or enter into negotiations for an amicable solution.Attempt at Reconciliation: The court, in divorce cases, usually refers the parties for mediation to try and facilitate a reconciliation or an amicable settlement. If the mediation fails, then the court proceedings continue.Documentary Evidence: It will be essential to gather all relevant documents, such as marriage certificate, any communication records, evidence of her moving to New Zealand, or any other relevant evidence that can support his claim in court.Legal Representation: Your brother should hire an experienced family lawyer who can guide him through the process, prepare the necessary legal documents, represent him in court, and handle negotiations if there's a possibility of an amicable settlement.Duration: Contested divorces can be time-consuming, especially if one party does not cooperate. The exact duration would depend on the specific circumstances of the case, evidence presented, court's caseload, and other factors.If she doesn't return or respond even after the legal notice, and if efforts at reconciliation fail, your brother can proceed with filing a petition for divorce based on the grounds mentioned.It would be wise for your brother to consult with a family lawyer in India to get a clearer understanding of his rights and the best course of action.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Adopted child",
    "answer": "A family tree certificate is a genealogy prepared by family members that a Tahsildar or a revenue officer can issue. This document is mainly used for transferring properties or for various legal requirements or obtaining other certificates from the same department. A family tree certificate contains the details of different generations of a family and the names of the family members, children and grandchildren.The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, governs the adoption of children by Hindus. The act provides that an adopted child shall be deemed to be the child of his or her adoptive parents for all purposes with effect from the date of the adoption and from such date all the ties of the child in the family of his or her birth shall be deemed to be severed and replaced by those created by the adoption in the adoptive family. The act also provides that an adopted child shall not divest any person of any estate which vested in him or her before the adoption.In your case, since your grandfather’s fourth son was given in adoption in 1970 as per adoption deed, he should be considered as the child of his adoptive parents and not of his biological parents for all purposes. He should not have any share in your grandfather’s property or any relation with his natural family. Therefore, he should not be included in your grandfather’s family tree certificate.It is known that some revenue officers or Tahsildars may insist on including the adopted son in the family tree certificate as they may consider him as a legal heir of his biological father. This may create confusion and complications in the property matters. Therefore, you may need to challenge their decision and seek a clarification from a higher authority or a court.I have searched for some case judgments that may support your case and found the following:In Smt. Shanti Devi vs Shri Ram Sarup And Ors., 1987 AIR 835, 1987 SCR (1) 300, the Supreme Court held that an adopted son has no right to inherit his natural father’s property after adoption and that he ceases to be a coparcener in his natural family.In Smt. Kasturi Devi vs Shri Chiranji Lal And Ors., AIR 1976 SC 2593, the Supreme Court held that an adopted son cannot claim partition of his natural father’s property after adoption and that he cannot challenge an alienation made by his natural father before adoption.In Smt. Rukmini Amma Saradamma vs Kallyani Sulochana And Ors., AIR 1993 SC 2090, the Supreme Court held that an adopted son cannot claim maintenance from his natural father after adoption and that he is entitled to maintenance only from his adoptive father.You can refer to these judgments and cite them in your application or petition to exclude your grandfather’s adopted son from his family tree certificate. You can also consult a lawyer who can advise you on the best course of action and represent you in the court if necessary.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Bathroom seepage issue from flat above",
    "answer": "Bathroom seepage emanating from the flat above is a prevalent issue in apartment buildings, leading to damage in the lower flat and potentially resulting in health concerns. Such seepage can result from leakages due to poor material quality, incorrect installation, or lack of maintenance. Regular inspections and maintenance of the plumbing system in the upper flat can mitigate such problems.If the resident of the upper flat is uncooperative in addressing the issue, several legal measures can be taken:Legal Notice: A notice can be sent to the resident of the upper flat, demanding the cessation of the leakage and appropriate repairs. Compensation for damages can also be claimed.Society Intervention: A complaint can be lodged with the apartment's society. The society has the responsibility of ensuring the maintenance of common areas and addressing nuisances caused by any members.Local Authorities: Reporting the problem to the local municipal corporation or development authority can be effective. These bodies are tasked with enforcing building regulations.Consumer Forum: Victims can approach the district consumer forum under theConsumer Protection Act, 2019, arguing that the upper flat owner's negligence is an unfair trade practice.Civil Suit: A lawsuit can be filed claiming that the upper flat owner's negligence has significantly interfered with the use of the property in the lower flat, seeking injunctions and damages.It is essential to address such issues promptly to avoid escalating damage and health risks.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "A Gram panchayat layout refers to a plot arrangement approved by the Gram panchayat, the governing body in rural regions. Such layouts might not always have clearance from the Director of Town and Country Planning (DTCP) or the Urban Development Authority (UDA). Purchasing a plot in these layouts can pose risks like unclear titles or lack of amenities.When considering a plot in a Gram panchayat layout in Telangana, here's a checklist:Title Deed Verification: Ensure the land's title deed, the main ownership document, is clear and authenticated by the sub-registrar’s office.Encumbrance Certificate (EC): This certificate shows the land's transaction history for a minimum of 30 years and should be free from any claims.Layout Approval Certificate: It certifies the plot layout's approval by the relevant authority, either Gram panchayat, DTCP, or UDA. Also, ensure RERA registration.Land Use Certificate: Ensure the land's conversion from agricultural to non-agricultural residential use, obtained from the revenue department.GO 111 Area Check: Ensure the land doesn't fall under the GO 111 area that restricts construction near Himayatsagar and Osmansagar lakes.R1 Zone Check: Verify if the land is in the R1 residential zone, which allows specific housing development parameters.Document Verification: Ensure related documents like sale agreement, mutation record, tax receipts, etc., are accurate and updated.Amenities Check: Assess basic facilities like road access, water, electricity, drainage, and confirm no pending dues on these services.Professional Help: Engage a lawyer for legal document reviews and a surveyor for accurate plot measurements.In essence, while purchasing a plot in Telangana's Gram panchayat layout, thorough due diligence is essential to avoid potential pitfalls.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Hirsutism before the marriage and suppressed can be ground of nullity of marriage",
    "answer": "To seek nullity of marriage (annulment) under theHindu Marriage Act, it typically requires certain specific grounds to be met. One of the grounds for nullity can be \"fraud.\" However, not all cases of fraud may lead to nullity of marriage.In your situation, if you believe that your wife concealed a material fact about her appearance or condition before marriage, and this concealment amounts to fraud that goes to the root of the marriage, you may consult with a family law attorney to explore the possibility of seeking nullity of the marriage. The key elements would include demonstrating that the concealment was substantial, that it was made with an intention to deceive, and that it had a direct impact on your decision to marry.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Hirsutism before the marriage and suppressed can be ground of nullity of marriage",
    "answer": "Hirsutism is a condition that causes excessive growth of dark and coarse hair in women on the face, chest, abdomen, and other parts of the body. It is usually caused by hormonal imbalance or genetic factors. Hirsutism can affect the physical appearance and self-esteem of women and may also indicate some underlying health problems.Nullity of marriage is a legal declaration that a marriage is invalid and void from the beginning. It means that the marriage never existed in the eyes of the law. Nullity of marriage can be sought on various grounds, such as impotency, fraud, force, mental disorder, etc.According to Section 12(1)© of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, a marriage can be annulled if the consent of either party was obtained by fraud or force. However, the petition for nullity should be filed within one year of discovering the fraud or ceasing to live under force.In your case, if your wife hid her condition of hirsutism from you before marriage and continued to conceal it after marriage by using various methods, you may have a ground to file a case against her for fraud and seek nullity of marriage under theHindu Marriage Act. However, you will have to prove that her condition was material for your consent and that you were deceived by her concealment. You will also have to file the petition within one year of finding out the truth.However, you should also be aware that nullity of marriage is not an easy or quick process. It may involve a lot of legal complications and challenges. You may also face counter-allegations from your wife or her family. Therefore, you should consult a lawyer before proceeding with any legal action.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

Compensation for damages can also be claimed.Society Intervention: A complaint can be lodged with the apartment's society. The society has the responsibility of ensuring the maintenance of common areas and addressing nuisances caused by any members.Local Authorities: Reporting the problem to the local municipal corporation or development authority can be effective. These bodies are tasked with enforcing building regulations.Consumer Forum: Victims can approach the district consumer forum under theConsumer Protection Act, 2019, arguing that the upper flat owner's negligence is an unfair trade practice.Civil Suit: A lawsuit can be filed claiming that the upper flat owner's negligence has significantly interfered with the use of the property in the lower flat, seeking injunctions and damages.It is essential to address such issues promptly to avoid escalating damage and health risks.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "A Gram panchayat layout refers to a plot arrangement approved by the Gram panchayat, the governing body in rural regions. Such layouts might not always have clearance from the Director of Town and Country Planning (DTCP) or the Urban Development Authority (UDA).

Also, ensure RERA registration.Land Use Certificate: Ensure the land's conversion from agricultural to non-agricultural residential use, obtained from the revenue department.GO 111 Area Check: Ensure the land doesn't fall under the GO 111 area that restricts construction near Himayatsagar and Osmansagar lakes.R1 Zone Check: Verify if the land is in the R1 residential zone, which allows specific housing development parameters.Document Verification: Ensure related documents like sale agreement, mutation record, tax receipts, etc., are accurate and updated.Amenities Check: Assess basic facilities like road access, water, electricity, drainage, and confirm no pending dues on these services.Professional Help: Engage a lawyer for legal document reviews and a surveyor for accurate plot measurements.In essence, while purchasing a plot in Telangana's Gram panchayat layout, thorough due diligence is essential to avoid potential pitfalls.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

They should consult with their legal counsel for specific strategies.Whether it is the duty of counsel to inform the outcome of the case to the plaintiff on a regular basis?Yes, it is generally the duty of legal counsel to keep their clients informed about the progress and outcome of their cases.

If you believe there was an issue with the court's procedure,On what ground the plaintiff/appellant needs to be punished both in terms of financial and imprisonment for repeatedly filing meritless suits?The court may consider sanctions or penalties for repeatedly filing meritless suits,  It's up to the court to decide whether punitive measures are warranted.In the same RA, what grounds respondents need to file an application in court to recover litigation costs from the plaintiff/appellant?Respondents may file an application for the recovery of litigation costs if they believe the plaintiff/appellant filed the suit frivolously or in bad faith. The court will consider the merits of such an application.What preventative measures can be taken to ensure the plaintiff/appellant does not file meritless suits repeatedly?Preventative measures may include sanctions for abusive litigation practices, court orders, or other legal actions aimed at discouraging the filing of frivolous suits."

    "question": "Need citation stating that BBMP cannot issue Khatha for property that is under dispute and is in the",
    "answer": "Khatha is a document that records the details of a property owner in the records of the BBMP (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike). It is not a proof of ownership, but an evidence of assessment of property tax. Khatha can be issued, transferred, bifurcated or amalgamated by the BBMP based on the documents submitted by the property owner, such as sale deed, conversion order, layout plan, etc.However, the BBMP cannot issue Khatha for a property that is under dispute and is in the middle of court proceedings. This is because the BBMP has to verify the validity and legality of the documents submitted by the property owner before issuing Khatha. If there is any doubt or dispute regarding the ownership or title of the property, the BBMP has to wait for the court’s decision before issuing Khatha.There are some citations that support this principle. For example, in Dr.S. Shobha vs The Commissioner Bbmp on 20 September, 2021, the Karnataka High Court held that:“The BBMP cannot issue khata in favour of any person without verifying the legality and validity of documents produced by such person. If there is any doubt or dispute regarding such documents, it is open for the BBMP to refuse to issue khata and direct such person to obtain a declaration of title from a competent court.”Similarly, in Here’s why BBMP Khata is not a proof of ownership for your property, it is stated that:“The Karnataka High Court has ruled that if there is any dispute regarding ownership of property, then it is not open for the BBMP to issue Khata without verifying all relevant documents and obtaining legal opinion from its legal cell. The Court also held that if there are any pending court cases regarding ownership of property, then it is not open for the BBMP to issue Khata without waiting for the outcome of such cases.” Citation: ILR2009KAR458, 2009 (3)KarLJ630 (and on the net in MANU/KA/0450/2008)Therefore, based on these citations, you can argue that the BBMP cannot issue Khatha for your property that is under dispute and is in the middle of court proceedings. You can also submit copies of the court orders that have dismissed or stayed the claims of [PERSON 1]'s grandchildren as evidence of your title and possession.I hope this information helps you. I wish you all the best for your case.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "COVID orphaned child custody and welfare",
    "answer": "The legal matters related to the custody and welfare of COVID orphaned children are governed by the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, which is a law that aims to protect the rights and interests of children in need of care and protection. The act provides for various mechanisms and authorities to deal with the cases of children who have lost their parents due to COVID-19 or any other reason. The act also provides for the rights and responsibilities of the relatives and guardians of such children.Some of the points that you should know about the custody and welfare of COVID orphaned children are:The custody and welfare of COVID orphaned children are primarily the responsibility of the state government and its agencies, such as the Child Welfare Committees (CWCs), the District Child Protection Units (DCPUs), and the Childline Services. These agencies are mandated to identify, verify, and rehabilitate such children as per the provisions of the act.The relatives and guardians of COVID orphaned children have a secondary responsibility to take care of such children. They can claim custody or guardianship of such children by applying to the CWCs or the courts having jurisdiction over the matter. They have to prove their relationship with the children and their ability and willingness to look after them. They also have to abide by the directions and conditions imposed by the CWCs or the courts regarding the welfare of the children.The CWCs or the courts have the power to decide the custody or guardianship of COVID orphaned children based on their best interest and welfare. They can consider various factors, such as the age, gender, preference, background, health, education, etc., of the children, as well as the suitability, capability, financial status, character, etc., of the relatives or guardians. They can also order periodic reports, visits, or reviews to monitor the well-being of the children.The relatives or guardians of COVID orphaned children have no right to sell or dispose of their property without their consent or permission from the CWCs or the courts. The property of such children is protected by law and can only be used for their benefit and welfare. The relatives or guardians have to maintain proper accounts and records of the property and income of such children and submit them to the CWCs or the courts as required.Based on these points, I can suggest some steps that you can take to claim your rights and ensure your nephews’ welfare:Contact your nearest CWC or DCPU or Childline Service and inform them about your situation. Provide them with all the relevant details and documents regarding your nephews’ parents’ death, your relationship with them, your financial status, etc.Apply for custody or guardianship of your nephews before the CWC or the court having jurisdiction over your area. Attach all the necessary documents and evidence to support your claim. You may hire a lawyer to represent you or appear in person.Attend the hearings and meetings with the CWC or the court and present your case. You may also request for a home study or a social investigation report to assess your suitability as a custodian or guardian.If you get an order for custody or guardianship in your favour, follow all the directions and conditions given by the CWC or the court regarding the care and protection of your nephews. You may also seek assistance from the DCPU or the Childline Service for any support or guidance.If you lose the case or are not satisfied with the order, you may appeal to a higher authority within the prescribed time limit. You may also seek stay of execution of the order by depositing security or giving an undertaking as directed by the authority.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "COVID orphaned child custody and welfare",
    "answer": "Dear client,When a child loses both parents, it's crucial to ensure their welfare and legal rights are protected. Here are some steps you can consider:Guardianship and Custody: Typically, when both parents pass away, legal guardianship and custody of the children must be determined by the court. As an uncle and grandfather, you and your father have a legal right to apply for guardianship of the children. The court will consider what is in the best interest of the children when making this decision.Child's Best Interests: The court's primary concern is the welfare and best interests of the children. Factors such as the children's age, their relationship with potential guardians, their emotional and physical well-being, and the stability of their environment will be considered in determining custody and guardianship.Property Rights: The property that belongs to the children should be protected for their future benefit. Generally, the legal guardian of the children will be responsible for managing and protecting their assets. If you have concerns that their property might be mismanaged or sold without consent, you should raise these concerns with the court during the guardianship proceedings.Consult with an Attorney: It's highly advisable to consult with a family law attorney in Tamil Nadu who can provide guidance specific to your situation. They can help you understand your legal rights, initiate the process of seeking custody or guardianship, and ensure the children's interests are protected.Mediation: If possible, consider discussing the situation with the children's current caregivers (your sister's husband's family) to see if an amicable arrangement can be reached that ensures the children's well-being. Mediation can sometimes be a way to resolve disputes without going through lengthy court proceedings.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "A sale deed is a legally binding document that indicates the sale and transfer of ownership of a land parcel from a seller to a buyer. It is one of the most important documents as it is legally valid evidence for the transfer of land ownership. It is important to note that the sale deed needs to be registered at the subregistrar’s office of the region where the land parcel falls to ensure its validity as proof.A saatbara or 7/12 extract is a document that contains information such as survey number, area, date from which current owner is registered as owner, etc. It is issued by the revenue department of the state government and serves as a proof of land ownership.However, sometimes there may be discrepancies or errors in the plot number or other details mentioned in these documents due to various reasons such as clerical mistakes, fraud, encroachment, etc. In such cases, it is advisable to rectify the errors as soon as possible to avoid any legal complications or disputes in the future.One possible way to rectify the errors in the documents is to consult a lawyer and explore the possibility of doing an internal transfer within the family by way of a Settlement Deed wherein the discrepancy can be clarified in the preamble part and correct description of property can be given in the Schedule portion. If this can be done, dealing with the property thereafter, will not be a problem.Another possible way to rectify the errors in the documents is to approach the concerned authorities such as the revenue department or the subregistrar’s office and file an application for correction along with supporting documents such as sale deed, tax receipts, survey maps, etc. The authorities may verify the documents and issue a corrected document after rectifying the errors.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Federation rights over housing society",
    "answer": "A federation of housing societies is essentially a collective of cooperative housing societies registered under Maharashtra's legal framework. While it can offer various services like guidance, arbitration, and representation to its member societies, it doesn't possess the authority to interfere in a member society's internal affairs without explicit authorization.Functions of the Federation: The federation can guide, assist, arbitrate, and represent its member societies.Limitations of the Federation: It cannot intrude in a member society's management unless given permission either by the society's general body or the Registrar of Cooperative Societies. It is bound by the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act and Rules, and cannot impose conditions conflicting with these regulations. For instance, the federation cannot demand parking ownership documents or flat ownership papers unrelated to its objectives.Addressing Disputes: If disagreements arise between a housing society and the federation, attempts for amicable resolutions through discussions or mediation are recommended. If these don't work, societies can approach the Registrar of Cooperative Societies or the Cooperative Court for resolution.Regarding the stilt parking:Ownership and Sale: Stilt parking spaces are categorized as common areas in a cooperative housing society. Builders or promoters can't sell them according to the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA) and the Maharashtra Ownership Flats Act, 1963 (MOFA). They can only charge for the construction costs, not for land or FSI.Addressing Overcharge: If someone purchased stilt parking space from a builder in 2004, they might have a claim against the builder for overcharging. Legal actions, such as sending a notice demanding a refund with interest and compensation, can be initiated. If unresolved, one can approach consumer forums or RERA authorities for redressal.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Can I get SC converted Christian as my caste ?",
    "answer": "It seems that you are facing a difficulty in claiming your caste as SC converted Christian. This is a complex issue that involves the interplay of religion, caste, and reservation in India.The legal matters related to the SC converted Christian caste are governed by the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order (Amendment) Act, 1990, and the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order (Second Amendment) Act, 2002. These laws specify the castes and communities that are recognized as Scheduled Castes (SC) for the purpose of reservation in public services and educational institutions under Article 341 of theConstitution of India. These laws also exclude persons who profess a religion different from Hinduism, Sikhism, or Buddhism from the SC categorySome of the points that you should know about the SC converted Christian caste are:The SC converted Christian caste is a term used to describe persons who belong to castes that are listed as SCs under the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, but have converted to Christianity from Hinduism, Sikhism, or Buddhism. These persons are not eligible for reservation benefits as SCs under the Constitution.The SC converted Christian caste is different from the Dalit Christian caste, which is a term used to describe persons who belong to castes that are not listed as SCs under the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, but have converted to Christianity from Hinduism, Sikhism, or Buddhism. These persons are also not eligible for reservation benefits as SCs under the Constitution.The SC converted Christian caste is also different from the Latin Catholic caste, which is a term used to describe persons who belong to castes that are listed as Other Backward Classes (OBCs) under the National Commission for Backward Classes Act, 1993. These persons are eligible for reservation benefits as OBCs under the Constitution.The SC converted Christian caste has been demanding for inclusion in the SC category for a long time, citing historical and social reasons. They have argued that they face double discrimination on the basis of religion and caste, and that their conversion has not changed their socio-economic status. They have also challenged the constitutional validity of the exclusion clause in the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 before various courts and commissions .The government has been opposing the demand for inclusion of SC converted Christians in the SC category, citing legal and policy reasons. They have argued that religion and caste are distinct concepts, and that conversion implies a change of identity and affiliation. They have also argued that inclusion of SC converted Christians in the SC category would violate the principle of secularism and affect the rights of other SCs .Based on these points, I can try to answer your queries as follows:You cannot get SC converted Christian as your caste under the current legal framework, as you are not eligible for reservation benefits as an SC under the Constitution. Your father’s re-conversion to Hinduism may not affect your status as an SC converted Christian, as it depends on your own profession of faith. Your mother’s Latin Catholic caste may also not affect your status as an SC converted Christian, as it depends on your own birth and descent.You may have taken your caste as SC converted Christian till date based on your family history and social identity. However, this may not be legally valid or acceptable for official purposes such as admission or employment. You may have to face legal issues if you claim reservation benefits as an SC based on your caste certificate or declaration.You may not be able to get an SC converted Christian claim under the current legal framework, as there is no provision for granting reservation benefits to SC converted Christians under the Constitution. However, you may be able to get some benefits under the OBC category if your caste is listed as an OBC by the state or central government.You may also be able to pursue your legal challenge against the exclusion clause in the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 before the Supreme Court or other competent authorities. However, this may take a long time and involve a lot of litigation and uncertainty.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "context": "Asked 1 year ago in Criminal Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Compounding of an offence under Indian Forest Act",
    "answer": "It seems that you are facing a difficulty in dealing with a forest offence under the Indian Forest Act, 1927. This is a law that regulates the conservation and management of forests and forest produce in India. It also provides for the penalties and procedures for forest offences, such as cutting, uprooting, or damaging trees or plants without permission.The legal matters related to the compounding of forest offences are governed by Section 68 of the Indian Forest Act, 1927. This section empowers the State Government to authorize a Forest Officer of a rank not inferior to that of a Ranger to accept a sum of money from a person who is suspected of committing a forest offence, other than an offence specified in Section 62 or Section 63 of the Act, as compensation for the offence. The Forest Officer can also release any property seized as liable to confiscation on payment of its value. On such payment, the suspected person and the property are discharged and no further proceedings are taken against them.Based on this section, I can try to answer your queries as follows:If the range officer compounds the above offence, it is unlikely that a more senior officer from the forest department can challenge or revoke this compounding on any grounds or challenge it in court. This is because Section 68(2) of the Act clearly states that no further proceedings shall be taken against the person or property once the compounding is done. Moreover, Section 69 of the Act provides that no court shall take cognizance of any forest offence punishable under the Act or any rule made thereunder except on complaint made by certain authorities within six months from the date of commission of the offence. Therefore, unless there is any fraud, misrepresentation, or coercion involved in the compounding process, it is final and binding on both parties.If you compound the offence, it does not necessarily imply that you have admitted doing it. It only means that you have agreed to pay a sum of money as compensation for the offence that you are suspected of committing. It is possible that you may have done so to avoid further litigation and hassle, even though you are innocent. However, it may also affect your reputation and credibility, as it may create an impression that you are guilty or involved in some way. Whether your name will be recorded as an offender or a suspect in the database of the forest department depends on their internal policy and practice. You may request them to clarify this point before compounding the offence.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Justice V Sivagnanam of the Madras High Court noted that under Section 68 of the Forest Act 1927, when an offence is compounded, the person accused should be discharged and the property seized should be released.He was directing the Forest Range Officer to return a gun to a man accused under the Wildlife Protection Act.From the above judgment it can be seen that the offence was compounded by high court though it was rejected by the magistrate court.The legal matters related to the compounding of forest offences are governed by Section 68 of the Indian Forest Act, 1927.

    "question": "Compounding of an offence under Indian Forest Act",
    "answer": "Dear client,If the range officer compounds the offense, it's typically a legally binding agreement, and it would usually not be challenged or revoked by a more senior officer unless there are strong grounds to do so, such as evidence of fraud or coercion in the compounding process. However, it's essential to consult with a legal expert in India for specific advice on your situation.Compounding an offense generally does not imply an admission of guilt. It is more like a settlement where you agree to pay a fine or compensation in exchange for avoiding a more extended legal process. Your name might be recorded as a party involved in the compounding process, but it doesn't necessarily label you as a convict.Regarding your additional questions:The compounding process is typically done by the forest officer empowered by Section 68 of the Indian Forest Act, not by the court. If you agree to pay the compensation, it is a voluntary agreement between you and the forest department.The reason compounding might not lead to acquittal for forest offenses is because the purpose of compounding is often to provide an expedited resolution and collect compensation for environmental damage, rather than a criminal trial leading to acquittal. Each offense and its legal implications can vary, so it's crucial to consult with a legal expert who can provide specific guidance based on your situation and the applicable laws.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Partition suit pending for final decree",
    "answer": "In a partition case, a preliminary decree is followed by a final decree that divides the property among co-owners. Your preliminary decree, issued in 2018, granted you a 4/7th (57.15%) share, while the other six co-owners received 7.15% each. However, you've observed construction activities on the property by co-owners holding a collective 42.85% share. You obtained a court-issued stay order, restraining further construction, and have informed the police and municipal authorities. You're located in Chennai, while the property is in Rajasthan, around 2500 km away. You have several questions:Impact of Present Construction:Allowing the ongoing construction could potentially harm your interests, as the new structure's valuation may affect the property's auction price.Property's Status Quo:You mentioned that the property has existed for more than 64 years, implying that the superstructure has fully depreciated. However, the concept of status quo pertains to the property's current physical condition and legal standing, which can change over time due to various factors.Lack of Objections by Co-Owners:Your notice about the construction did not receive objections or attempts to halt it from other co-owners. This, in your view, suggests their complicity in the ongoing construction.Demarcation Challenges:If metes and bounds demarcation of the property isn't feasible, auction may be the only viable solution.Online Case Contestation from Chennai:Whether you can contest the case online from Chennai depends on the nature of your case and the court's available online facilities. E-filing and virtual courts are potential options for online case participation. You'll need to check with the specific court where your case is pending to determine if these options are available.Overall, your concerns are valid, especially regarding the potential impact of the construction on the property's valuation and the need to proceed with an auction. However, the legal processes and options available to you will depend on the specific circumstances of your case and the jurisdiction of the court involved.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Company is forcing me to serve full notice period otherwise they will no issue relieving letter",
    "answer": "I understand that your company is forcing you to serve full notice period otherwise they will not issue relieving letter. This seems to be unfair and unreasonable on their part. You have every right to resign from your job and join a new company as per your wish and convenience.There are some legal aspects and options that you should be aware of regarding your situation. Here are some of them:The company's insistence on you serving the full notice period before releasing the relieving letter might be seen as unjust and unreasonable. Legally, as per the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, Section 25F, both an employer and employee must provide at least a month's notice, or the equivalent salary, for termination or resignation respectively. This notice period can be altered based on the employment contract or mutual agreement. Any extension of the notice period through a circular without your agreement might not be enforceable. Employers must issue a relieving letter once the notice period or its monetary equivalent is fulfilled. If they don't, they might be legally accountable for breach of contract and harassment. In case of disputes, you have the right to approach legal avenues like sending a legal notice, consulting the labour commissioner, or approaching the labour court.

    "answer": "Dear client,In many cases, employment terms and conditions are outlined in your employment contract or appointment letter. If your original appointment letter stated a one-month notice period, and the company unilaterally extended it to two months without your consent or signature, this change may not be legally enforceable, especially if it was done without proper agreement or notification.If you are willing to pay the notice period pay as per your original contract and resign, the company should generally provide you with a relieving letter. Denying a relieving letter without just cause could potentially be seen as unfair or against labor laws in some jurisdictions."

    "answer": "When you book a flat in Maharashtra, especially in cities like Pune, the builder's obligations and the rights of the purchaser are regulated by the Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRERA) under the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016.Delay in Construction:If the builder hasn't initiated any construction work since November 2021, it's a clear case of delay. Considering the possession date is December 2025, a significant delay has already occurred.Cancellation and Refund:As per MahaRERA provisions, if the builder fails to complete or hand over possession of the property as per the agreed timeline, the buyer has the right to demand a full refund along with interest.Deduction by Builder:While the builder might have certain terms in the agreement regarding cancellation charges, a 10% deduction might not be justified given the clear delay in construction on the builder's part. However, the exact terms of the agreement would need to be reviewed.Interest on Paid Amount:As per RERA provisions, if the builder fails to meet the timeline, not only is the buyer entitled to a full refund but also compensation, which includes interest on the amount paid.Steps to Take:Firstly, communicate your concerns with the builder, highlighting the delay and your intent to cancel.If the builder doesn't cooperate, you can file a complaint with MahaRERA, seeking a refund with interest due to the delay.It might be beneficial to consult with a legal expert familiar with real estate matters in Maharashtra to guide you through the process and understand the terms of your agreement.Remember, RERA provisions are designed to protect the interests of homebuyers and ensure transparency and accountability on the part of builders and developers.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "The SARFAESI Act, 2002 is a law that allows banks and financial institutions to recover their dues from defaulting borrowers by selling their secured assets without the intervention of courts. The secured assets are the properties that are mortgaged or pledged by the borrowers as security for the loans.In your case, you have taken a loan from Bank of India (BOI) by using your house as mortgage. You are unable to repay the loan amount and your account has become non-performing asset (NPA). Now, the bank is ready to sell your house under the SARFAESI Act. You are ready to pay your loan amount to the bank and want to know if the bank can offer you any offer or concession on your loan amount.To answer your question:The bank may or may not offer you any offer or concession on your loan amount, depending on various factors such as the amount of loan, the amount of default, the value of the property, the market conditions, etc. The bank has the discretion to decide whether to accept or reject your offer or proposal for repayment of loan.However, you have the right to make a representation or objection to the bank against the notice of sale of your property under section 13 (3A) of the SARFAESI Act within 15 days of receiving the notice. You can request the bank to reconsider your case and give you an opportunity to repay your loan by offering some settlement or compromise or restructuring of loan3.You can also approach the bank before the auction date and try to negotiate with them for a one-time settlement (OTS) or a repayment plan that suits both parties. You can offer to pay a lump sum amount or instalments that cover the principal and interest dues along with some penalty or charges. You can also request the bank to waive off some interest or charges or reduce the rate of interest as a gesture of goodwill4.If the bank agrees to your offer or proposal, you can enter into a written agreement with them and pay the agreed amount within the stipulated time. The bank will then stop the auction process and release your property from mortgage. You will also get a no-dues certificate from the bank that will clear your credit history.If the bank does not agree to your offer or proposal, you can file an application before the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) under section 17 of the SARFAESI Act within 45 days of receiving the notice of sale or taking possession of your property by the bank. You can challenge the validity of the notice of sale or possession and seek a stay order on the auction process. You can also seek relief such as restoration of possession, compensation, damages, etc.Restructuring of Loan: Depending on the bank's policies and your repayment capacity, the bank might consider restructuring your loan, which could involve extending the loan tenure, changing the interest rate, or offering a repayment holiday for a specific period. This can provide you with some relief and more time to manage your financesA loan defaulter can approach the high court for restructuring of loan only in cases, such as when there is a violation of fundamental rights, abuse of power, fraud, or malafide intention by the lender. The high court has the power to issue writs under Article 226 of theConstitution of Indiato protect the rights and interests of the borrowers.You can also file an appeal before the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal (DRAT) under section 18 of the SARFAESI Act within 30 days of receiving the order of DRT, if you are not satisfied with it. You can seek a review or modification or reversal of the order of DRT.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "As per available information, giving tuition in your flat is not a commercial activity, as long as it does not cause any nuisance or inconvenience to other residents of the society. The Supreme Court of India has held that imparting education is a benevolent cause and not a business, and that a person can use a part of his or her residential premises for teaching purposes, as long as the dominant use remains residential.However, some co-operative housing societies may have their own rules and regulations regarding the use of residential flats for tuition or other purposes. These rules and regulations may vary from society to society and may depend on various factors such as the number of students, the timings, the parking space, the noise level, etc. The society may object to your tuition classes if they violate any of these rules and regulations or if they affect the rights and interests of other members.To deal with this situation, you may have to take the following steps:You have to check the bye-laws and regulations of your society and see if there is any provision that prohibits or restricts the use of residential flats for tuition or other purposes. You also have to see if there is any procedure or permission required for conducting tuition classes in your flat.You have to communicate with the society members and the committee and explain to them that your tuition classes are not a commercial activity and that they do not cause any nuisance or inconvenience to anyone. You have to assure them that you are following all the rules and regulations of the society and that you are ready to cooperate with them in resolving any issues or grievances.You have to seek prior permission from the society for conducting tuition classes in your flat and obtain a written consent from them. You may also have to pay some extra maintenance charges or fees to the society for using their facilities or services.You have to take some precautions and measures to avoid any disturbance or trouble to other residents of the society. For example, you can limit the number of students per batch, arrange for proper parking space, maintain a reasonable noise level, etc.If the society still objects to your tuition classes or tries to stop them without any valid reason, you can take legal action against them. You can file a complaint with the registrar of co-operative societies or the co-operative court and seek relief such as injunction, restoration, compensation, etc. You can also approach a civil court or a high court and seek a writ of mandamus or certiorari against the society’s action.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear client,Running a tuition center from your residential flat may or may not be considered a commercial activity depending on the specific rules and regulations of your apartment complex or housing society, as well as local laws. Here's what you can do:Review Society Rules: Check the society's rules and regulations to see if there are any provisions that prohibit or restrict commercial activities in residential flats. These rules should be provided to you by the society or should be publicly available.Engage with the Society Committee: If the society committee is objecting to your tuition center, try to have an open and respectful conversation with them. Discuss your point of view and explain how your tuition center may not violate any existing rules. Request that they provide specific reasons for their objection in writing.Seek Mediation: If discussions with the society committee do not resolve the issue, you may consider seeking mediation or arbitration to find a mutually agreeable solution.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

There can be diverse view taking into consideration the nuisance if any is created by increasing number of students in a residential complex. Occupancy right of a member of the cooperative housing society including the terms and conditions and the purpose of the use of the flat are specified in its registered Bye-Laws. Since your society is recently handed over to its members, you need to go through the bye-laws and then if it says to seek permission then you may propose a permission letter to the committee members of the society and obtain their sanction for running your tuition class at your own residential premises. Members conducting tuition Classes in their flats in housing societies is quite common feature and the management is really at a loss to handle it properly without creating ill-will with in otherwise harmonious environment. Where a flat Owner seeks  prior permission to use the flat for tuition classes  it will be extremely difficult to refuse except on the ground that the proposed classes would pose serious threat to security and peace, excessive engagement of the lift which may cause a grave inconvenience to the residents, as also higher  running and maintenance expenses of lift, parking problems, where classes are proposed to be run as a professional activity by a member giving on rentals to a commercial organization etc. The managing committee would be well advised to put it up before the members in the general body meeting as the managing committee does not have an express/implied power under any Bye-law to consider such request and decide. However, needless to mention that there are catena of judgments of Hon'ble Apex Court that the bye-laws of the society hold supremacy over the Gujarat Cooperative Society act and regulations thereunder therefor in given set of facts, it is advisable for you to get the copy of registered bye-laws and thereafter if there is no express provision in it against the running of tuition classes then please place a request letter/ permission letter in appropriate form as stated above.Pooja AsharAdvocate, Ahmedabad237 Answers4 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Pooja Ashar"

Here are some points to consider:Jurisdiction of Society:The jurisdiction and authority of a housing society typically extend to matters related to the common areas and facilities within the society, as well as matters related to the conduct of residents within the society.While a society may have certain rules and regulations governing noise and disturbances, it may not have direct control over commercial establishments outside the society premises.The society may, however, have a role in mediating disputes between residents and commercial establishments within the society premises.Permissible Timings:Permissible timings for commercial establishments, including shops and eateries, are usually governed by local municipal laws and regulations.The permissible hours for commercial activities can vary depending on the specific location and zoning regulations.You can check with the local municipal authority (BMC in this case) to understand the specific rules and regulations regarding operating hours for shops in your area.Taking Action:To address issues caused by the commercial shops, residents may need to take the following steps:Contact the original tenant or owner of the shop and inform them of the issues faced by residents. They may not be aware of the disturbances caused by the late-night operations.If the shop owner or tenant is uncooperative or if the issues persist, residents can file complaints with the local municipal authority (BMC) regarding noise, disturbances, or any violations of operating hours.Residents can also consider approaching the local police to report disturbances or noise violations during late hours.If the shop is operating under a license from the building owner, the owner may have the authority to take action against the tenant for violating the terms of the license agreement.It's important to document instances of disturbances, take photos or videos if possible, and keep a record of any communication with the shop owner or tenant. This information can be useful when filing complaints with the relevant authorities.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Deviation in construction of home",
    "answer": "As per the information available, a setback is the open space across the front, sides or rear of a plot between the building and the street alignment or boundary of the plot. The setback of the buildings depends on various factors such as road width, land use, height of the building, etc. The setback norms are prescribed by the Tamil Nadu Combined Development and Building Rules, 2019 (TNCDBR), which are applicable to the Chennai Metropolitan Area.According to the web search results, if you have constructed your building with a deviation from the approved setback norms, you may face some consequences such as:Your building may be considered as an unauthorized construction and may be liable for demolition or regularization by paying a penalty.Your building may not get a completion certificate or an occupancy certificate from the competent authority, which may affect your property rights and transactions.Your building may not comply with the safety and sanitation requirements and may pose a risk to yourself and others.Your building may be challenged by your neighbours or other affected parties in the court or tribunal on the grounds of violation of rules, nuisance, encroachment, etc.Some of the options that you may have to deal with this situation are as follows:You can apply for regularization of your building by paying a penalty and submitting the required documents to the competent authority. The regularization scheme is available for buildings constructed before July 1, 2007, with a maximum deviation of 50% from the setback norms.You can modify or demolish your building to comply with the setback norms and get a fresh approval from the competent authority. This may involve additional cost and time for you.You can negotiate with your neighbours and get their consent or no-objection certificate for your building deviation. This may help you to avoid any legal disputes or complaints from them.You can defend your building in the court or tribunal if any case is filed against you by your neighbours or other parties. You can produce evidence to prove that your building deviation is minor and does not affect anyone’s rights or interests. You can also cite any precedents or judgments that may support your case.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Deviation in construction of home",
    "answer": "Dear clientDeviating from the approved setback requirements for your construction can potentially lead to legal issues. Here are some considerations for your situation:Neighbor's Complaint: If your neighbor threatens to complain about the setback deviation, they may have a valid concern. Even if their own property doesn't adhere to the approved setback, this doesn't necessarily give you the right to deviate from the approved setbacks for your property.Legal Consequences: Violating approved setback requirements can result in legal consequences, including orders to demolish or modify your construction to comply with the setback rules. Fines and penalties may also apply.Permission from Neighbors: Having permission from some neighbors for the setback deviation may not be sufficient to override the approved regulations. The setback rules are typically set by local zoning and building codes, and compliance with these codes is usually mandatory.Amendment or Variance: Depending on local regulations, you may be able to apply for an amendment or variance to the setback requirements, but this process can be lengthy and may not guarantee approval. Your lawyer can assist with this process if it's applicable.Resolution with Neighbors: Consider discussing the matter with your neighbors and attempting to find an amicable resolution.

However, having an OCI card or Indian passport would make the process easier and faster, as you would not need a visa and you would be treated as an Indian citizen for most purposes.Your Aadhar card, PAN card and Australian passport may be enough to prove your identity and ownership of the property, but you may also need some other documents, such as the title deed, no objection certificate, encumbrance certificate, tax receipts, etc. You should also check if your Aadhar card and PAN card are still valid and updated, as they may have been deactivated or cancelled after you acquired foreign citizenship.You may have some problems in taxation without the OCI card, as you would be treated as a foreign national for tax purposes. You would be liable to pay capital gains tax on the sale of your property in India, which is 20% for long-term gains (if you held the property for more than two years) and 30% for short-term gains (if you held the property for less than two years). You would also have to pay tax on the income from the sale of your property in Australia, as per the Australian tax laws. However, you can claim a credit for the tax paid in India under the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) between India and Australia.You should be able to get money to Australia without any issues, as long as you comply with the foreign exchange regulations of both countries. You would have to open an NRO (Non-Resident Ordinary) account in India to receive the sale proceeds of your property. You would also have to deduct TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) at 20% or 30% from the sale consideration and deposit it with the Indian government within seven days from the end of the month in which TDS is deducted. You would also have to issue a TDS certificate to yourself in Form 16A within 15 days from the due date of depositing TDS. You can then transfer the money from your NRO account to your Australian bank account after obtaining a certificate from a chartered accountant in Form 15CB and filing an online declaration in Form 15CA on the income tax website. You should also check if there are any limits or restrictions on transferring money from India to Australia by both countries.These are some of the answers and tips that you should know before going ahead with this deal.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear client,Congratulations on obtaining your Australian citizenship! Selling property in India as a foreign citizen can be a complex process, but I can provide some general guidance:Selling Property without OCI Card and Indian Passport:Generally, it is possible to sell property in India without an OCI card or an Indian passport. However, there may be additional documentation and procedures to follow.You may need to appoint a legal representative or a power of attorney holder in India who can act on your behalf in property transactions. This person should be an Indian citizen or an NRI (Non-Resident Indian).It's advisable to consult with a local lawyer in Hyderabad who specializes in property transactions to guide you through the specific requirements and documentation needed.Documents Required:Your Aadhar card, PAN card, and Australian passport are essential documents. These documents will help establish your identity and tax status in India.Ensure that your Aadhar card and PAN card are linked to your property records to facilitate the sale.Taxation:Selling property in India may have tax implications, including capital gains tax. You should consult with a tax expert to understand your tax obligations and ensure compliance with Indian tax laws.Not having an OCI card should not directly impact taxation, but it's important to follow all tax regulations.Repatriation of Funds:As an Australian citizen, you should be able to repatriate the sale proceeds to Australia. However, it's crucial to comply with India's foreign exchange regulations and tax laws.You may need to open an NRE (Non-Resident External) or NRO (Non-Resident Ordinary) bank account in India to receive the funds and then transfer them abroad.Legal Assistance:Engaging a local lawyer in Hyderabad who is well-versed in property transactions and can assist you with the sale process is highly recommended.

    "answer": "To seek nullity of marriage (annulment) under theHindu Marriage Act, it typically requires certain specific grounds to be met. One of the grounds for nullity can be \"fraud.\" However, not all cases of fraud may lead to nullity of marriage.In your situation, if you believe that your wife concealed a material fact about her appearance or condition before marriage, and this concealment amounts to fraud that goes to the root of the marriage, you may consult with a family law attorney to explore the possibility of seeking nullity of the marriage. The key elements would include demonstrating that the concealment was substantial, that it was made with an intention to deceive, and that it had a direct impact on your decision to marry.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Hirsutism before the marriage and suppressed can be ground of nullity of marriage",
    "answer": "Hirsutism is a condition that causes excessive growth of dark and coarse hair in women on the face, chest, abdomen, and other parts of the body. It is usually caused by hormonal imbalance or genetic factors. Hirsutism can affect the physical appearance and self-esteem of women and may also indicate some underlying health problems.Nullity of marriage is a legal declaration that a marriage is invalid and void from the beginning. It means that the marriage never existed in the eyes of the law. Nullity of marriage can be sought on various grounds, such as impotency, fraud, force, mental disorder, etc.According to Section 12(1)© of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, a marriage can be annulled if the consent of either party was obtained by fraud or force. However, the petition for nullity should be filed within one year of discovering the fraud or ceasing to live under force.In your case, if your wife hid her condition of hirsutism from you before marriage and continued to conceal it after marriage by using various methods, you may have a ground to file a case against her for fraud and seek nullity of marriage under theHindu Marriage Act. However, you will have to prove that her condition was material for your consent and that you were deceived by her concealment. You will also have to file the petition within one year of finding out the truth.However, you should also be aware that nullity of marriage is not an easy or quick process. It may involve a lot of legal complications and challenges. You may also face counter-allegations from your wife or her family.

    "answer": "In India, the portrayal, publication, or distribution of explicit sexual content, including through audio or comics, can attract legal consequences under various provisions of Indian law:Indian Penal Code(IPC), 1860:Section 292of the IPC deals with the sale, distribution, public exhibition, and circulation of obscene material. Any material, if it is lascivious or appeals to the prurient interest or tends to deprave and corrupt those who are exposed to it, is termed \"obscene\". If a sex story in audio or comic format falls under this definition, it can be penalized under this section.Section 293of the IPC penalizes anyone who sells, distributes, exhibits, or circulates any obscene object to a person under the age of 20 years.Information Technology Act, 2000:Section 67of the IT Act penalizes the publishing or transmitting of obscene material in electronic form.Section 67Apenalizes the publishing or transmitting of sexually explicit material in electronic form.The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012:If the content involves a child or represents a child in explicit sexual activities, even in fictional form (like comics), it is illegal and is punishable under this Act.Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986:This law prohibits indecent representation of women through advertisements, publications, writings, paintings, figures, or in any other manner.Given the strict regulations around explicit content in India, it's essential to be very cautious if one is involved in creating, distributing, or consuming such materials.

India has laws that govern obscenity and pornography, which can vary depending on the interpretation of the content and how it is presented. Here are some key points to consider:Obscenity Laws: TheIndian Penal Code(IPC) contains provisions related to obscenity (Section 292) and the sale and distribution of obscene material (Section 292A). These provisions can be used to restrict or prohibit the creation and distribution of explicit sexual content that is deemed obscene.Child Pornography: Creating or distributing explicit content involving minors is a serious offense under Indian law, and it is illegal.Community Standards: What is considered obscene or sexually explicit can vary depending on community standards and interpretations of the law. What may be legal in one context may be deemed obscene in another.Online Platforms: When posting or distributing such content on online platforms, you should also consider the policies of the specific platform, which may have their own rules regarding explicit content.Freedom of Expression: The Indian legal system also recognizes the freedom of expression and the right to privacy.

    "answer": "A family tree certificate is a genealogy prepared by family members that a Tahsildar or a revenue officer can issue. This document is mainly used for transferring properties or for various legal requirements or obtaining other certificates from the same department. A family tree certificate contains the details of different generations of a family and the names of the family members, children and grandchildren.The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, governs the adoption of children by Hindus. The act provides that an adopted child shall be deemed to be the child of his or her adoptive parents for all purposes with effect from the date of the adoption and from such date all the ties of the child in the family of his or her birth shall be deemed to be severed and replaced by those created by the adoption in the adoptive family. The act also provides that an adopted child shall not divest any person of any estate which vested in him or her before the adoption.In your case, since your grandfather’s fourth son was given in adoption in 1970 as per adoption deed, he should be considered as the child of his adoptive parents and not of his biological parents for all purposes. He should not have any share in your grandfather’s property or any relation with his natural family. Therefore, he should not be included in your grandfather’s family tree certificate.It is known that some revenue officers or Tahsildars may insist on including the adopted son in the family tree certificate as they may consider him as a legal heir of his biological father. This may create confusion and complications in the property matters. Therefore, you may need to challenge their decision and seek a clarification from a higher authority or a court.I have searched for some case judgments that may support your case and found the following:In Smt. Shanti Devi vs Shri Ram Sarup And Ors., 1987 AIR 835, 1987 SCR (1) 300, the Supreme Court held that an adopted son has no right to inherit his natural father’s property after adoption and that he ceases to be a coparcener in his natural family.In Smt. Kasturi Devi vs Shri Chiranji Lal And Ors., AIR 1976 SC 2593, the Supreme Court held that an adopted son cannot claim partition of his natural father’s property after adoption and that he cannot challenge an alienation made by his natural father before adoption.In Smt. Rukmini Amma Saradamma vs Kallyani Sulochana And Ors., AIR 1993 SC 2090, the Supreme Court held that an adopted son cannot claim maintenance from his natural father after adoption and that he is entitled to maintenance only from his adoptive father.You can refer to these judgments and cite them in your application or petition to exclude your grandfather’s adopted son from his family tree certificate. You can also consult a lawyer who can advise you on the best course of action and represent you in the court if necessary.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Shopkeepers issue",
    "answer": "Dear clientDealing with issues arising from commercial shops in a residential building can be challenging. Here are some points to consider:Jurisdiction of Society:The jurisdiction and authority of a housing society typically extend to matters related to the common areas and facilities within the society, as well as matters related to the conduct of residents within the society.While a society may have certain rules and regulations governing noise and disturbances, it may not have direct control over commercial establishments outside the society premises.The society may, however, have a role in mediating disputes between residents and commercial establishments within the society premises.Permissible Timings:Permissible timings for commercial establishments, including shops and eateries, are usually governed by local municipal laws and regulations.The permissible hours for commercial activities can vary depending on the specific location and zoning regulations.You can check with the local municipal authority (BMC in this case) to understand the specific rules and regulations regarding operating hours for shops in your area.Taking Action:To address issues caused by the commercial shops, residents may need to take the following steps:Contact the original tenant or owner of the shop and inform them of the issues faced by residents. They may not be aware of the disturbances caused by the late-night operations.If the shop owner or tenant is uncooperative or if the issues persist, residents can file complaints with the local municipal authority (BMC) regarding noise, disturbances, or any violations of operating hours.Residents can also consider approaching the local police to report disturbances or noise violations during late hours.If the shop is operating under a license from the building owner, the owner may have the authority to take action against the tenant for violating the terms of the license agreement.It's important to document instances of disturbances, take photos or videos if possible, and keep a record of any communication with the shop owner or tenant. This information can be useful when filing complaints with the relevant authorities.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

You should only state that you need the proof for personal reasons and request them to provide you with a letter or a certificate that confirms his employment status, salary, and duration of work. You should also attach a copy of your marriage certificate and your husband’s passport as proof of your relationship.If you do not get any official authorization letter from his work, you can still claim interim maintenance for yourself and your daughter based on the evidence that you have already submitted, such as his payslip, bank statements, tax returns, etc. The court will decide the amount of maintenance after considering various factors, such as your income, expenses, standard of living, needs of the child, etc. You can also request the court to direct your husband to produce his latest income proof or to appoint a commissioner to investigate his assets and income in Australia.If your husband and his family are not appearing in the court for the DVC and child custody cases, you can request the court to issue a warrant against them or to declare them as proclaimed offenders. You can also seek the help of the Indian embassy or consulate in Australia to serve them the summons or notices. If they still do not appear, the court may proceed ex parte and pass orders in your favour based on the evidence that you have produced. However, these orders may not be enforceable in Australia unless they are recognized by the Australian courts.To get a divorce from your husband, you have two options:You can file a divorce petition in India under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 on any of the grounds mentioned in Section 13, such as cruelty, desertion, adultery, conversion, etc. However, this may take a long time and require multiple hearings and evidence.You can file a divorce petition in Australia under the Family Law Act, 1975 on the ground of irretrievable breakdown of marriage.

    "question": "Deviation in construction of home",
    "answer": "As per the information available, a setback is the open space across the front, sides or rear of a plot between the building and the street alignment or boundary of the plot. The setback of the buildings depends on various factors such as road width, land use, height of the building, etc. The setback norms are prescribed by the Tamil Nadu Combined Development and Building Rules, 2019 (TNCDBR), which are applicable to the Chennai Metropolitan Area.According to the web search results, if you have constructed your building with a deviation from the approved setback norms, you may face some consequences such as:Your building may be considered as an unauthorized construction and may be liable for demolition or regularization by paying a penalty.Your building may not get a completion certificate or an occupancy certificate from the competent authority, which may affect your property rights and transactions.Your building may not comply with the safety and sanitation requirements and may pose a risk to yourself and others.Your building may be challenged by your neighbours or other affected parties in the court or tribunal on the grounds of violation of rules, nuisance, encroachment, etc.Some of the options that you may have to deal with this situation are as follows:You can apply for regularization of your building by paying a penalty and submitting the required documents to the competent authority. The regularization scheme is available for buildings constructed before July 1, 2007, with a maximum deviation of 50% from the setback norms.You can modify or demolish your building to comply with the setback norms and get a fresh approval from the competent authority. This may involve additional cost and time for you.You can negotiate with your neighbours and get their consent or no-objection certificate for your building deviation. This may help you to avoid any legal disputes or complaints from them.You can defend your building in the court or tribunal if any case is filed against you by your neighbours or other parties. You can produce evidence to prove that your building deviation is minor and does not affect anyone’s rights or interests. You can also cite any precedents or judgments that may support your case.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Deviation in construction of home",
    "answer": "Dear clientDeviating from the approved setback requirements for your construction can potentially lead to legal issues. Here are some considerations for your situation:Neighbor's Complaint: If your neighbor threatens to complain about the setback deviation, they may have a valid concern. Even if their own property doesn't adhere to the approved setback, this doesn't necessarily give you the right to deviate from the approved setbacks for your property.Legal Consequences: Violating approved setback requirements can result in legal consequences, including orders to demolish or modify your construction to comply with the setback rules. Fines and penalties may also apply.Permission from Neighbors: Having permission from some neighbors for the setback deviation may not be sufficient to override the approved regulations. The setback rules are typically set by local zoning and building codes, and compliance with these codes is usually mandatory.Amendment or Variance: Depending on local regulations, you may be able to apply for an amendment or variance to the setback requirements, but this process can be lengthy and may not guarantee approval. Your lawyer can assist with this process if it's applicable.Resolution with Neighbors: Consider discussing the matter with your neighbors and attempting to find an amicable resolution. If your neighbors are willing to accept the deviation or reach an agreement, it may help mitigate the issue.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

You have every right to resign from your job and join a new company as per your wish and convenience.There are some legal aspects and options that you should be aware of regarding your situation. Here are some of them:The company's insistence on you serving the full notice period before releasing the relieving letter might be seen as unjust and unreasonable. Legally, as per the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, Section 25F, both an employer and employee must provide at least a month's notice, or the equivalent salary, for termination or resignation respectively. This notice period can be altered based on the employment contract or mutual agreement. Any extension of the notice period through a circular without your agreement might not be enforceable. Employers must issue a relieving letter once the notice period or its monetary equivalent is fulfilled. If they don't, they might be legally accountable for breach of contract and harassment. In case of disputes, you have the right to approach legal avenues like sending a legal notice, consulting the labour commissioner, or approaching the labour court.

Even the reason for condoning delay is not valid.If the Court fails to scrutinize the proceeding, it is the duty of respondent to bring to the notice of Court defects in proceeding.Seek compensatory costs in respect of false or vexatious claims under Section 35A.Refer to answer 6.There are preventive measures against filing of civil suits.

    "question": "Filling & Appeal the cases repeatedly",
    "answer": "Dear client,Whether this case is maintainable?The maintainability of the case depends on various factors, including the specific laws and regulations of your jurisdiction.

They should consult with their legal counsel for specific strategies.Whether it is the duty of counsel to inform the outcome of the case to the plaintiff on a regular basis?Yes, it is generally the duty of legal counsel to keep their clients informed about the progress and outcome of their cases.

    "question": "Sex story in audio or comic",
    "answer": "In India, the portrayal, publication, or distribution of explicit sexual content, including through audio or comics, can attract legal consequences under various provisions of Indian law:Indian Penal Code(IPC), 1860:Section 292of the IPC deals with the sale, distribution, public exhibition, and circulation of obscene material. Any material, if it is lascivious or appeals to the prurient interest or tends to deprave and corrupt those who are exposed to it, is termed \"obscene\". If a sex story in audio or comic format falls under this definition, it can be penalized under this section.Section 293of the IPC penalizes anyone who sells, distributes, exhibits, or circulates any obscene object to a person under the age of 20 years.Information Technology Act, 2000:Section 67of the IT Act penalizes the publishing or transmitting of obscene material in electronic form.Section 67Apenalizes the publishing or transmitting of sexually explicit material in electronic form.The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012:If the content involves a child or represents a child in explicit sexual activities, even in fictional form (like comics), it is illegal and is punishable under this Act.Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986:This law prohibits indecent representation of women through advertisements, publications, writings, paintings, figures, or in any other manner.Given the strict regulations around explicit content in India, it's essential to be very cautious if one is involved in creating, distributing, or consuming such materials. Moreover, the definition of \"obscenity\" has been a subject of judicial scrutiny in various cases, and the threshold can sometimes be subjective.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "In India, the legality of creating and distributing sexually explicit content, whether in audio, comic, or any other format, is subject to certain laws and regulations. India has laws that govern obscenity and pornography, which can vary depending on the interpretation of the content and how it is presented. Here are some key points to consider:Obscenity Laws: TheIndian Penal Code(IPC) contains provisions related to obscenity (Section 292) and the sale and distribution of obscene material (Section 292A). These provisions can be used to restrict or prohibit the creation and distribution of explicit sexual content that is deemed obscene.Child Pornography: Creating or distributing explicit content involving minors is a serious offense under Indian law, and it is illegal.Community Standards: What is considered obscene or sexually explicit can vary depending on community standards and interpretations of the law. What may be legal in one context may be deemed obscene in another.Online Platforms: When posting or distributing such content on online platforms, you should also consider the policies of the specific platform, which may have their own rules regarding explicit content.Freedom of Expression: The Indian legal system also recognizes the freedom of expression and the right to privacy. Courts may consider these factors in determining the legality of explicit content.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "A family tree certificate is a genealogy prepared by family members that a Tahsildar or a revenue officer can issue. This document is mainly used for transferring properties or for various legal requirements or obtaining other certificates from the same department. A family tree certificate contains the details of different generations of a family and the names of the family members, children and grandchildren.The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, governs the adoption of children by Hindus. The act provides that an adopted child shall be deemed to be the child of his or her adoptive parents for all purposes with effect from the date of the adoption and from such date all the ties of the child in the family of his or her birth shall be deemed to be severed and replaced by those created by the adoption in the adoptive family. The act also provides that an adopted child shall not divest any person of any estate which vested in him or her before the adoption.In your case, since your grandfather’s fourth son was given in adoption in 1970 as per adoption deed, he should be considered as the child of his adoptive parents and not of his biological parents for all purposes. He should not have any share in your grandfather’s property or any relation with his natural family. Therefore, he should not be included in your grandfather’s family tree certificate.It is known that some revenue officers or Tahsildars may insist on including the adopted son in the family tree certificate as they may consider him as a legal heir of his biological father. This may create confusion and complications in the property matters. Therefore, you may need to challenge their decision and seek a clarification from a higher authority or a court.I have searched for some case judgments that may support your case and found the following:In Smt. Shanti Devi vs Shri Ram Sarup And Ors., 1987 AIR 835, 1987 SCR (1) 300, the Supreme Court held that an adopted son has no right to inherit his natural father’s property after adoption and that he ceases to be a coparcener in his natural family.In Smt. Kasturi Devi vs Shri Chiranji Lal And Ors., AIR 1976 SC 2593, the Supreme Court held that an adopted son cannot claim partition of his natural father’s property after adoption and that he cannot challenge an alienation made by his natural father before adoption.In Smt. Rukmini Amma Saradamma vs Kallyani Sulochana And Ors., AIR 1993 SC 2090, the Supreme Court held that an adopted son cannot claim maintenance from his natural father after adoption and that he is entitled to maintenance only from his adoptive father.You can refer to these judgments and cite them in your application or petition to exclude your grandfather’s adopted son from his family tree certificate.

    "answer": "Hirsutism is a condition that causes excessive growth of dark and coarse hair in women on the face, chest, abdomen, and other parts of the body. It is usually caused by hormonal imbalance or genetic factors. Hirsutism can affect the physical appearance and self-esteem of women and may also indicate some underlying health problems.Nullity of marriage is a legal declaration that a marriage is invalid and void from the beginning. It means that the marriage never existed in the eyes of the law. Nullity of marriage can be sought on various grounds, such as impotency, fraud, force, mental disorder, etc.According to Section 12(1)© of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, a marriage can be annulled if the consent of either party was obtained by fraud or force. However, the petition for nullity should be filed within one year of discovering the fraud or ceasing to live under force.In your case, if your wife hid her condition of hirsutism from you before marriage and continued to conceal it after marriage by using various methods, you may have a ground to file a case against her for fraud and seek nullity of marriage under theHindu Marriage Act. However, you will have to prove that her condition was material for your consent and that you were deceived by her concealment. You will also have to file the petition within one year of finding out the truth.However, you should also be aware that nullity of marriage is not an easy or quick process. It may involve a lot of legal complications and challenges. You may also face counter-allegations from your wife or her family.

    "question": "Shopkeepers issue",
    "answer": "Dear clientDealing with issues arising from commercial shops in a residential building can be challenging. Here are some points to consider:Jurisdiction of Society:The jurisdiction and authority of a housing society typically extend to matters related to the common areas and facilities within the society, as well as matters related to the conduct of residents within the society.While a society may have certain rules and regulations governing noise and disturbances, it may not have direct control over commercial establishments outside the society premises.The society may, however, have a role in mediating disputes between residents and commercial establishments within the society premises.Permissible Timings:Permissible timings for commercial establishments, including shops and eateries, are usually governed by local municipal laws and regulations.The permissible hours for commercial activities can vary depending on the specific location and zoning regulations.You can check with the local municipal authority (BMC in this case) to understand the specific rules and regulations regarding operating hours for shops in your area.Taking Action:To address issues caused by the commercial shops, residents may need to take the following steps:Contact the original tenant or owner of the shop and inform them of the issues faced by residents. They may not be aware of the disturbances caused by the late-night operations.If the shop owner or tenant is uncooperative or if the issues persist, residents can file complaints with the local municipal authority (BMC) regarding noise, disturbances, or any violations of operating hours.Residents can also consider approaching the local police to report disturbances or noise violations during late hours.If the shop is operating under a license from the building owner, the owner may have the authority to take action against the tenant for violating the terms of the license agreement.It's important to document instances of disturbances, take photos or videos if possible, and keep a record of any communication with the shop owner or tenant. This information can be useful when filing complaints with the relevant authorities.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

You should only state that you need the proof for personal reasons and request them to provide you with a letter or a certificate that confirms his employment status, salary, and duration of work. You should also attach a copy of your marriage certificate and your husband’s passport as proof of your relationship.If you do not get any official authorization letter from his work, you can still claim interim maintenance for yourself and your daughter based on the evidence that you have already submitted, such as his payslip, bank statements, tax returns, etc. The court will decide the amount of maintenance after considering various factors, such as your income, expenses, standard of living, needs of the child, etc. You can also request the court to direct your husband to produce his latest income proof or to appoint a commissioner to investigate his assets and income in Australia.If your husband and his family are not appearing in the court for the DVC and child custody cases, you can request the court to issue a warrant against them or to declare them as proclaimed offenders. You can also seek the help of the Indian embassy or consulate in Australia to serve them the summons or notices. If they still do not appear, the court may proceed ex parte and pass orders in your favour based on the evidence that you have produced. However, these orders may not be enforceable in Australia unless they are recognized by the Australian courts.To get a divorce from your husband, you have two options:You can file a divorce petition in India under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 on any of the grounds mentioned in Section 13, such as cruelty, desertion, adultery, conversion, etc. However, this may take a long time and require multiple hearings and evidence.You can file a divorce petition in Australia under the Family Law Act, 1975 on the ground of irretrievable breakdown of marriage.

    "question": "Hirsutism before the marriage and suppressed can be ground of nullity of marriage",
    "answer": "To seek nullity of marriage (annulment) under theHindu Marriage Act, it typically requires certain specific grounds to be met. One of the grounds for nullity can be \"fraud.\" However, not all cases of fraud may lead to nullity of marriage.In your situation, if you believe that your wife concealed a material fact about her appearance or condition before marriage, and this concealment amounts to fraud that goes to the root of the marriage, you may consult with a family law attorney to explore the possibility of seeking nullity of the marriage. The key elements would include demonstrating that the concealment was substantial, that it was made with an intention to deceive, and that it had a direct impact on your decision to marry.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Hirsutism before the marriage and suppressed can be ground of nullity of marriage",
    "answer": "Hirsutism is a condition that causes excessive growth of dark and coarse hair in women on the face, chest, abdomen, and other parts of the body. It is usually caused by hormonal imbalance or genetic factors. Hirsutism can affect the physical appearance and self-esteem of women and may also indicate some underlying health problems.Nullity of marriage is a legal declaration that a marriage is invalid and void from the beginning. It means that the marriage never existed in the eyes of the law. Nullity of marriage can be sought on various grounds, such as impotency, fraud, force, mental disorder, etc.According to Section 12(1)© of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, a marriage can be annulled if the consent of either party was obtained by fraud or force. However, the petition for nullity should be filed within one year of discovering the fraud or ceasing to live under force.In your case, if your wife hid her condition of hirsutism from you before marriage and continued to conceal it after marriage by using various methods, you may have a ground to file a case against her for fraud and seek nullity of marriage under theHindu Marriage Act. However, you will have to prove that her condition was material for your consent and that you were deceived by her concealment. You will also have to file the petition within one year of finding out the truth.However, you should also be aware that nullity of marriage is not an easy or quick process. It may involve a lot of legal complications and challenges. You may also face counter-allegations from your wife or her family. Therefore, you should consult a lawyer before proceeding with any legal action.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Sex story in audio or comic",
    "answer": "In India, the portrayal, publication, or distribution of explicit sexual content, including through audio or comics, can attract legal consequences under various provisions of Indian law:Indian Penal Code(IPC), 1860:Section 292of the IPC deals with the sale, distribution, public exhibition, and circulation of obscene material. Any material, if it is lascivious or appeals to the prurient interest or tends to deprave and corrupt those who are exposed to it, is termed \"obscene\". If a sex story in audio or comic format falls under this definition, it can be penalized under this section.Section 293of the IPC penalizes anyone who sells, distributes, exhibits, or circulates any obscene object to a person under the age of 20 years.Information Technology Act, 2000:Section 67of the IT Act penalizes the publishing or transmitting of obscene material in electronic form.Section 67Apenalizes the publishing or transmitting of sexually explicit material in electronic form.The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012:If the content involves a child or represents a child in explicit sexual activities, even in fictional form (like comics), it is illegal and is punishable under this Act.Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986:This law prohibits indecent representation of women through advertisements, publications, writings, paintings, figures, or in any other manner.Given the strict regulations around explicit content in India, it's essential to be very cautious if one is involved in creating, distributing, or consuming such materials. Moreover, the definition of \"obscenity\" has been a subject of judicial scrutiny in various cases, and the threshold can sometimes be subjective.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "In India, the legality of creating and distributing sexually explicit content, whether in audio, comic, or any other format, is subject to certain laws and regulations. India has laws that govern obscenity and pornography, which can vary depending on the interpretation of the content and how it is presented. Here are some key points to consider:Obscenity Laws: TheIndian Penal Code(IPC) contains provisions related to obscenity (Section 292) and the sale and distribution of obscene material (Section 292A). These provisions can be used to restrict or prohibit the creation and distribution of explicit sexual content that is deemed obscene.Child Pornography: Creating or distributing explicit content involving minors is a serious offense under Indian law, and it is illegal.Community Standards: What is considered obscene or sexually explicit can vary depending on community standards and interpretations of the law. What may be legal in one context may be deemed obscene in another.Online Platforms: When posting or distributing such content on online platforms, you should also consider the policies of the specific platform, which may have their own rules regarding explicit content.Freedom of Expression: The Indian legal system also recognizes the freedom of expression and the right to privacy. Courts may consider these factors in determining the legality of explicit content.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Deviation in construction of home",
    "answer": "As per the information available, a setback is the open space across the front, sides or rear of a plot between the building and the street alignment or boundary of the plot. The setback of the buildings depends on various factors such as road width, land use, height of the building, etc. The setback norms are prescribed by the Tamil Nadu Combined Development and Building Rules, 2019 (TNCDBR), which are applicable to the Chennai Metropolitan Area.According to the web search results, if you have constructed your building with a deviation from the approved setback norms, you may face some consequences such as:Your building may be considered as an unauthorized construction and may be liable for demolition or regularization by paying a penalty.Your building may not get a completion certificate or an occupancy certificate from the competent authority, which may affect your property rights and transactions.Your building may not comply with the safety and sanitation requirements and may pose a risk to yourself and others.Your building may be challenged by your neighbours or other affected parties in the court or tribunal on the grounds of violation of rules, nuisance, encroachment, etc.Some of the options that you may have to deal with this situation are as follows:You can apply for regularization of your building by paying a penalty and submitting the required documents to the competent authority. The regularization scheme is available for buildings constructed before July 1, 2007, with a maximum deviation of 50% from the setback norms.You can modify or demolish your building to comply with the setback norms and get a fresh approval from the competent authority. This may involve additional cost and time for you.You can negotiate with your neighbours and get their consent or no-objection certificate for your building deviation. This may help you to avoid any legal disputes or complaints from them.You can defend your building in the court or tribunal if any case is filed against you by your neighbours or other parties. You can produce evidence to prove that your building deviation is minor and does not affect anyone’s rights or interests. You can also cite any precedents or judgments that may support your case.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear clientDeviating from the approved setback requirements for your construction can potentially lead to legal issues. Here are some considerations for your situation:Neighbor's Complaint: If your neighbor threatens to complain about the setback deviation, they may have a valid concern. Even if their own property doesn't adhere to the approved setback, this doesn't necessarily give you the right to deviate from the approved setbacks for your property.Legal Consequences: Violating approved setback requirements can result in legal consequences, including orders to demolish or modify your construction to comply with the setback rules. Fines and penalties may also apply.Permission from Neighbors: Having permission from some neighbors for the setback deviation may not be sufficient to override the approved regulations. The setback rules are typically set by local zoning and building codes, and compliance with these codes is usually mandatory.Amendment or Variance: Depending on local regulations, you may be able to apply for an amendment or variance to the setback requirements, but this process can be lengthy and may not guarantee approval. Your lawyer can assist with this process if it's applicable.Resolution with Neighbors: Consider discussing the matter with your neighbors and attempting to find an amicable resolution. If your neighbors are willing to accept the deviation or reach an agreement, it may help mitigate the issue.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Here are some points to consider:Jurisdiction of Society:The jurisdiction and authority of a housing society typically extend to matters related to the common areas and facilities within the society, as well as matters related to the conduct of residents within the society.While a society may have certain rules and regulations governing noise and disturbances, it may not have direct control over commercial establishments outside the society premises.The society may, however, have a role in mediating disputes between residents and commercial establishments within the society premises.Permissible Timings:Permissible timings for commercial establishments, including shops and eateries, are usually governed by local municipal laws and regulations.The permissible hours for commercial activities can vary depending on the specific location and zoning regulations.You can check with the local municipal authority (BMC in this case) to understand the specific rules and regulations regarding operating hours for shops in your area.Taking Action:To address issues caused by the commercial shops, residents may need to take the following steps:Contact the original tenant or owner of the shop and inform them of the issues faced by residents. They may not be aware of the disturbances caused by the late-night operations.If the shop owner or tenant is uncooperative or if the issues persist, residents can file complaints with the local municipal authority (BMC) regarding noise, disturbances, or any violations of operating hours.Residents can also consider approaching the local police to report disturbances or noise violations during late hours.If the shop is operating under a license from the building owner, the owner may have the authority to take action against the tenant for violating the terms of the license agreement.It's important to document instances of disturbances, take photos or videos if possible, and keep a record of any communication with the shop owner or tenant.

However, having an OCI card or Indian passport would make the process easier and faster, as you would not need a visa and you would be treated as an Indian citizen for most purposes.Your Aadhar card, PAN card and Australian passport may be enough to prove your identity and ownership of the property, but you may also need some other documents, such as the title deed, no objection certificate, encumbrance certificate, tax receipts, etc. You should also check if your Aadhar card and PAN card are still valid and updated, as they may have been deactivated or cancelled after you acquired foreign citizenship.You may have some problems in taxation without the OCI card, as you would be treated as a foreign national for tax purposes. You would be liable to pay capital gains tax on the sale of your property in India, which is 20% for long-term gains (if you held the property for more than two years) and 30% for short-term gains (if you held the property for less than two years). You would also have to pay tax on the income from the sale of your property in Australia, as per the Australian tax laws. However, you can claim a credit for the tax paid in India under the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) between India and Australia.You should be able to get money to Australia without any issues, as long as you comply with the foreign exchange regulations of both countries. You would have to open an NRO (Non-Resident Ordinary) account in India to receive the sale proceeds of your property. You would also have to deduct TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) at 20% or 30% from the sale consideration and deposit it with the Indian government within seven days from the end of the month in which TDS is deducted. You would also have to issue a TDS certificate to yourself in Form 16A within 15 days from the due date of depositing TDS. You can then transfer the money from your NRO account to your Australian bank account after obtaining a certificate from a chartered accountant in Form 15CB and filing an online declaration in Form 15CA on the income tax website. You should also check if there are any limits or restrictions on transferring money from India to Australia by both countries.These are some of the answers and tips that you should know before going ahead with this deal.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

Selling property in India as a foreign citizen can be a complex process, but I can provide some general guidance:Selling Property without OCI Card and Indian Passport:Generally, it is possible to sell property in India without an OCI card or an Indian passport. However, there may be additional documentation and procedures to follow.You may need to appoint a legal representative or a power of attorney holder in India who can act on your behalf in property transactions. This person should be an Indian citizen or an NRI (Non-Resident Indian).It's advisable to consult with a local lawyer in Hyderabad who specializes in property transactions to guide you through the specific requirements and documentation needed.Documents Required:Your Aadhar card, PAN card, and Australian passport are essential documents. These documents will help establish your identity and tax status in India.Ensure that your Aadhar card and PAN card are linked to your property records to facilitate the sale.Taxation:Selling property in India may have tax implications, including capital gains tax. You should consult with a tax expert to understand your tax obligations and ensure compliance with Indian tax laws.Not having an OCI card should not directly impact taxation, but it's important to follow all tax regulations.Repatriation of Funds:As an Australian citizen, you should be able to repatriate the sale proceeds to Australia. However, it's crucial to comply with India's foreign exchange regulations and tax laws.You may need to open an NRE (Non-Resident External) or NRO (Non-Resident Ordinary) bank account in India to receive the funds and then transfer them abroad.Legal Assistance:Engaging a local lawyer in Hyderabad who is well-versed in property transactions and can assist you with the sale process is highly recommended.

    "answer": "Generally, once a building licence is granted by a local government-municipality or corporation-there is no inspection of any nature later on to ascertain if the prescribed setback norms are complied with. This is the practical situation. Your neighbour has easement rights only if your extended construction blocks his ventilation- light and air. He may be simply threatening you to extract some monetary compensation.Swaminathan NeelakantanAdvocate, Coimbatore3023 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Swaminathan Neelakantan"

    "question": "Deviation in construction of home",
    "answer": "As per the information available, a setback is the open space across the front, sides or rear of a plot between the building and the street alignment or boundary of the plot. The setback of the buildings depends on various factors such as road width, land use, height of the building, etc. The setback norms are prescribed by the Tamil Nadu Combined Development and Building Rules, 2019 (TNCDBR), which are applicable to the Chennai Metropolitan Area.According to the web search results, if you have constructed your building with a deviation from the approved setback norms, you may face some consequences such as:Your building may be considered as an unauthorized construction and may be liable for demolition or regularization by paying a penalty.Your building may not get a completion certificate or an occupancy certificate from the competent authority, which may affect your property rights and transactions.Your building may not comply with the safety and sanitation requirements and may pose a risk to yourself and others.Your building may be challenged by your neighbours or other affected parties in the court or tribunal on the grounds of violation of rules, nuisance, encroachment, etc.Some of the options that you may have to deal with this situation are as follows:You can apply for regularization of your building by paying a penalty and submitting the required documents to the competent authority. The regularization scheme is available for buildings constructed before July 1, 2007, with a maximum deviation of 50% from the setback norms.You can modify or demolish your building to comply with the setback norms and get a fresh approval from the competent authority. This may involve additional cost and time for you.You can negotiate with your neighbours and get their consent or no-objection certificate for your building deviation. This may help you to avoid any legal disputes or complaints from them.You can defend your building in the court or tribunal if any case is filed against you by your neighbours or other parties. You can produce evidence to prove that your building deviation is minor and does not affect anyone’s rights or interests. You can also cite any precedents or judgments that may support your case.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Deviation in construction of home",
    "answer": "Dear clientDeviating from the approved setback requirements for your construction can potentially lead to legal issues. Here are some considerations for your situation:Neighbor's Complaint: If your neighbor threatens to complain about the setback deviation, they may have a valid concern. Even if their own property doesn't adhere to the approved setback, this doesn't necessarily give you the right to deviate from the approved setbacks for your property.Legal Consequences: Violating approved setback requirements can result in legal consequences, including orders to demolish or modify your construction to comply with the setback rules. Fines and penalties may also apply.Permission from Neighbors: Having permission from some neighbors for the setback deviation may not be sufficient to override the approved regulations. The setback rules are typically set by local zoning and building codes, and compliance with these codes is usually mandatory.Amendment or Variance: Depending on local regulations, you may be able to apply for an amendment or variance to the setback requirements, but this process can be lengthy and may not guarantee approval. Your lawyer can assist with this process if it's applicable.Resolution with Neighbors: Consider discussing the matter with your neighbors and attempting to find an amicable resolution. If your neighbors are willing to accept the deviation or reach an agreement, it may help mitigate the issue.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Here are some points to consider:Jurisdiction of Society:The jurisdiction and authority of a housing society typically extend to matters related to the common areas and facilities within the society, as well as matters related to the conduct of residents within the society.While a society may have certain rules and regulations governing noise and disturbances, it may not have direct control over commercial establishments outside the society premises.The society may, however, have a role in mediating disputes between residents and commercial establishments within the society premises.Permissible Timings:Permissible timings for commercial establishments, including shops and eateries, are usually governed by local municipal laws and regulations.The permissible hours for commercial activities can vary depending on the specific location and zoning regulations.You can check with the local municipal authority (BMC in this case) to understand the specific rules and regulations regarding operating hours for shops in your area.Taking Action:To address issues caused by the commercial shops, residents may need to take the following steps:Contact the original tenant or owner of the shop and inform them of the issues faced by residents. They may not be aware of the disturbances caused by the late-night operations.If the shop owner or tenant is uncooperative or if the issues persist, residents can file complaints with the local municipal authority (BMC) regarding noise, disturbances, or any violations of operating hours.Residents can also consider approaching the local police to report disturbances or noise violations during late hours.If the shop is operating under a license from the building owner, the owner may have the authority to take action against the tenant for violating the terms of the license agreement.It's important to document instances of disturbances, take photos or videos if possible, and keep a record of any communication with the shop owner or tenant. This information can be useful when filing complaints with the relevant authorities.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, having an OCI card or Indian passport would make the process easier and faster, as you would not need a visa and you would be treated as an Indian citizen for most purposes.Your Aadhar card, PAN card and Australian passport may be enough to prove your identity and ownership of the property, but you may also need some other documents, such as the title deed, no objection certificate, encumbrance certificate, tax receipts, etc. You should also check if your Aadhar card and PAN card are still valid and updated, as they may have been deactivated or cancelled after you acquired foreign citizenship.You may have some problems in taxation without the OCI card, as you would be treated as a foreign national for tax purposes. You would be liable to pay capital gains tax on the sale of your property in India, which is 20% for long-term gains (if you held the property for more than two years) and 30% for short-term gains (if you held the property for less than two years). You would also have to pay tax on the income from the sale of your property in Australia, as per the Australian tax laws. However, you can claim a credit for the tax paid in India under the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) between India and Australia.You should be able to get money to Australia without any issues, as long as you comply with the foreign exchange regulations of both countries. You would have to open an NRO (Non-Resident Ordinary) account in India to receive the sale proceeds of your property. You would also have to deduct TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) at 20% or 30% from the sale consideration and deposit it with the Indian government within seven days from the end of the month in which TDS is deducted. You would also have to issue a TDS certificate to yourself in Form 16A within 15 days from the due date of depositing TDS. You can then transfer the money from your NRO account to your Australian bank account after obtaining a certificate from a chartered accountant in Form 15CB and filing an online declaration in Form 15CA on the income tax website. You should also check if there are any limits or restrictions on transferring money from India to Australia by both countries.These are some of the answers and tips that you should know before going ahead with this deal.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

Selling property in India as a foreign citizen can be a complex process, but I can provide some general guidance:Selling Property without OCI Card and Indian Passport:Generally, it is possible to sell property in India without an OCI card or an Indian passport. However, there may be additional documentation and procedures to follow.You may need to appoint a legal representative or a power of attorney holder in India who can act on your behalf in property transactions. This person should be an Indian citizen or an NRI (Non-Resident Indian).It's advisable to consult with a local lawyer in Hyderabad who specializes in property transactions to guide you through the specific requirements and documentation needed.Documents Required:Your Aadhar card, PAN card, and Australian passport are essential documents. These documents will help establish your identity and tax status in India.Ensure that your Aadhar card and PAN card are linked to your property records to facilitate the sale.Taxation:Selling property in India may have tax implications, including capital gains tax. You should consult with a tax expert to understand your tax obligations and ensure compliance with Indian tax laws.Not having an OCI card should not directly impact taxation, but it's important to follow all tax regulations.Repatriation of Funds:As an Australian citizen, you should be able to repatriate the sale proceeds to Australia. However, it's crucial to comply with India's foreign exchange regulations and tax laws.You may need to open an NRE (Non-Resident External) or NRO (Non-Resident Ordinary) bank account in India to receive the funds and then transfer them abroad.Legal Assistance:Engaging a local lawyer in Hyderabad who is well-versed in property transactions and can assist you with the sale process is highly recommended.

However, the exact terms of the agreement would need to be reviewed.Interest on Paid Amount:As per RERA provisions, if the builder fails to meet the timeline, not only is the buyer entitled to a full refund but also compensation, which includes interest on the amount paid.Steps to Take:Firstly, communicate your concerns with the builder, highlighting the delay and your intent to cancel.If the builder doesn't cooperate, you can file a complaint with MahaRERA, seeking a refund with interest due to the delay.It might be beneficial to consult with a legal expert familiar with real estate matters in Maharashtra to guide you through the process and understand the terms of your agreement.Remember, RERA provisions are designed to protect the interests of homebuyers and ensure transparency and accountability on the part of builders and developers.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear client,  in Maharashtra, the Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRERA) provides certain protections and guidelines for homebuyers in cases like the one you described. If the builder has not fulfilled their obligations as per the agreement and if you want to cancel the agreement, you may be entitled to a refund, and the builder may not be able to deduct 10% against cancellation.Here are some steps you can consider:Check the Agreement: Carefully review the sale agreement, especially the clauses related to cancellation, refund, and delay in possession. Builders cannot arbitrarily deduct amounts without a valid reason mentioned in the agreement.File a Complaint with MahaRERA: If the builder has not met their commitments, you can consider filing a complaint with MahaRERA. They can mediate the issue and help resolve disputes between builders and buyers.Interest on Delay: MahaRERA often imposes penalties on builders for project delays. Depending on the terms of your agreement and the extent of the delay, you may be entitled to interest on the amount you have paid.Negotiate with the Builder: Before taking any legal action, you can also try to negotiate with the builder to reach an amicable solution, including a full refund of the amount you paid.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Based on the web search results that I found, here are some of the steps and tips that you should take before going ahead with this deal:Title and Ownership Verification:Check the property's title deed to ensure it's under the seller's and his wife's names.Confirm their identity and nationality through passports, visas, and PAN cards.Ensure no property encumbrances by acquiring an encumbrance certificate.Verify the property's tax status, ensuring all dues are cleared.Power of Attorney (PoA) Verification:Ensure the PoA given by the NRI seller to their relative is valid, registered, and comprehensive.Address any name discrepancies in official documents.Tax Deductions:Deduct TDS from the sale amount as mandated by the Income Tax Act, 1961. Rates are 20% for long-term and 30% for short-term capital gains.TDS rates can be adjusted if the seller provides a certificate indicating a different tax liability.TDS Formalities:Deposit the deducted TDS with the government within the stipulated time.Issue a TDS certificate (Form 16A) to the seller post deposit.Embassy Attestation:If the seller is abroad, the sale deed should be signed and attested at the Indian Embassy in the seller's residing country. This procedure is known as \"attestation of documents by diplomatic or consular officers.\"The deed should be checked by the Sub-Registrar in India before attestation to ensure legal compliance.Sale Deed Registration:Register the sale deed at the local sub-registrar's office within four months of its execution.Pay the required stamp duty and registration fees.

You should contact the relevant embassy or consulate to inquire about their specific requirements and procedures for attesting legal documents.Due Diligence: Conduct thorough due diligence on the property, including checking for any outstanding property taxes, utility bills, and other dues. Ensure that all these are cleared before the transaction.Draft a Clear Sale Agreement: Have a legally binding sale agreement that outlines all the terms and conditions of the sale, including the purchase price, payment schedule, and the responsibilities of both parties.Consider an Escrow Account: Consider using an escrow account to hold the funds until all legal requirements are met, and the property is transferred in your name.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "I understand that your company is forcing you to serve full notice period otherwise they will not issue relieving letter. This seems to be unfair and unreasonable on their part. You have every right to resign from your job and join a new company as per your wish and convenience.There are some legal aspects and options that you should be aware of regarding your situation. Here are some of them:The company's insistence on you serving the full notice period before releasing the relieving letter might be seen as unjust and unreasonable. Legally, as per the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, Section 25F, both an employer and employee must provide at least a month's notice, or the equivalent salary, for termination or resignation respectively. This notice period can be altered based on the employment contract or mutual agreement. Any extension of the notice period through a circular without your agreement might not be enforceable. Employers must issue a relieving letter once the notice period or its monetary equivalent is fulfilled. If they don't, they might be legally accountable for breach of contract and harassment. In case of disputes, you have the right to approach legal avenues like sending a legal notice, consulting the labour commissioner, or approaching the labour court.

    "question": "Running tuition in flat",
    "answer": "As per available information, giving tuition in your flat is not a commercial activity, as long as it does not cause any nuisance or inconvenience to other residents of the society. The Supreme Court of India has held that imparting education is a benevolent cause and not a business, and that a person can use a part of his or her residential premises for teaching purposes, as long as the dominant use remains residential.However, some co-operative housing societies may have their own rules and regulations regarding the use of residential flats for tuition or other purposes. These rules and regulations may vary from society to society and may depend on various factors such as the number of students, the timings, the parking space, the noise level, etc. The society may object to your tuition classes if they violate any of these rules and regulations or if they affect the rights and interests of other members.To deal with this situation, you may have to take the following steps:You have to check the bye-laws and regulations of your society and see if there is any provision that prohibits or restricts the use of residential flats for tuition or other purposes. You also have to see if there is any procedure or permission required for conducting tuition classes in your flat.You have to communicate with the society members and the committee and explain to them that your tuition classes are not a commercial activity and that they do not cause any nuisance or inconvenience to anyone. You have to assure them that you are following all the rules and regulations of the society and that you are ready to cooperate with them in resolving any issues or grievances.You have to seek prior permission from the society for conducting tuition classes in your flat and obtain a written consent from them. You may also have to pay some extra maintenance charges or fees to the society for using their facilities or services.You have to take some precautions and measures to avoid any disturbance or trouble to other residents of the society. For example, you can limit the number of students per batch, arrange for proper parking space, maintain a reasonable noise level, etc.If the society still objects to your tuition classes or tries to stop them without any valid reason, you can take legal action against them. You can file a complaint with the registrar of co-operative societies or the co-operative court and seek relief such as injunction, restoration, compensation, etc. You can also approach a civil court or a high court and seek a writ of mandamus or certiorari against the society’s action.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

There can be diverse view taking into consideration the nuisance if any is created by increasing number of students in a residential complex. Occupancy right of a member of the cooperative housing society including the terms and conditions and the purpose of the use of the flat are specified in its registered Bye-Laws. Since your society is recently handed over to its members, you need to go through the bye-laws and then if it says to seek permission then you may propose a permission letter to the committee members of the society and obtain their sanction for running your tuition class at your own residential premises. Members conducting tuition Classes in their flats in housing societies is quite common feature and the management is really at a loss to handle it properly without creating ill-will with in otherwise harmonious environment. Where a flat Owner seeks  prior permission to use the flat for tuition classes  it will be extremely difficult to refuse except on the ground that the proposed classes would pose serious threat to security and peace, excessive engagement of the lift which may cause a grave inconvenience to the residents, as also higher  running and maintenance expenses of lift, parking problems, where classes are proposed to be run as a professional activity by a member giving on rentals to a commercial organization etc. The managing committee would be well advised to put it up before the members in the general body meeting as the managing committee does not have an express/implied power under any Bye-law to consider such request and decide. However, needless to mention that there are catena of judgments of Hon'ble Apex Court that the bye-laws of the society hold supremacy over the Gujarat Cooperative Society act and regulations thereunder therefor in given set of facts, it is advisable for you to get the copy of registered bye-laws and thereafter if there is no express provision in it against the running of tuition classes then please place a request letter/ permission letter in appropriate form as stated above.Pooja AsharAdvocate, Ahmedabad237 Answers4 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Pooja Ashar"

Rates are 20% for long-term and 30% for short-term capital gains.TDS rates can be adjusted if the seller provides a certificate indicating a different tax liability.TDS Formalities:Deposit the deducted TDS with the government within the stipulated time.Issue a TDS certificate (Form 16A) to the seller post deposit.Embassy Attestation:If the seller is abroad, the sale deed should be signed and attested at the Indian Embassy in the seller's residing country. This procedure is known as \"attestation of documents by diplomatic or consular officers.\"The deed should be checked by the Sub-Registrar in India before attestation to ensure legal compliance.Sale Deed Registration:Register the sale deed at the local sub-registrar's office within four months of its execution.Pay the required stamp duty and registration fees.

    "answer": "The SARFAESI Act, 2002 is a law that allows banks and financial institutions to recover their dues from defaulting borrowers by selling their secured assets without the intervention of courts. The secured assets are the properties that are mortgaged or pledged by the borrowers as security for the loans.In your case, you have taken a loan from Bank of India (BOI) by using your house as mortgage. You are unable to repay the loan amount and your account has become non-performing asset (NPA). Now, the bank is ready to sell your house under the SARFAESI Act. You are ready to pay your loan amount to the bank and want to know if the bank can offer you any offer or concession on your loan amount.To answer your question:The bank may or may not offer you any offer or concession on your loan amount, depending on various factors such as the amount of loan, the amount of default, the value of the property, the market conditions, etc. The bank has the discretion to decide whether to accept or reject your offer or proposal for repayment of loan.However, you have the right to make a representation or objection to the bank against the notice of sale of your property under section 13 (3A) of the SARFAESI Act within 15 days of receiving the notice. You can request the bank to reconsider your case and give you an opportunity to repay your loan by offering some settlement or compromise or restructuring of loan3.You can also approach the bank before the auction date and try to negotiate with them for a one-time settlement (OTS) or a repayment plan that suits both parties. You can offer to pay a lump sum amount or instalments that cover the principal and interest dues along with some penalty or charges. You can also request the bank to waive off some interest or charges or reduce the rate of interest as a gesture of goodwill4.If the bank agrees to your offer or proposal, you can enter into a written agreement with them and pay the agreed amount within the stipulated time. The bank will then stop the auction process and release your property from mortgage. You will also get a no-dues certificate from the bank that will clear your credit history.If the bank does not agree to your offer or proposal, you can file an application before the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) under section 17 of the SARFAESI Act within 45 days of receiving the notice of sale or taking possession of your property by the bank. You can challenge the validity of the notice of sale or possession and seek a stay order on the auction process. You can also seek relief such as restoration of possession, compensation, damages, etc.Restructuring of Loan: Depending on the bank's policies and your repayment capacity, the bank might consider restructuring your loan, which could involve extending the loan tenure, changing the interest rate, or offering a repayment holiday for a specific period. This can provide you with some relief and more time to manage your financesA loan defaulter can approach the high court for restructuring of loan only in cases, such as when there is a violation of fundamental rights, abuse of power, fraud, or malafide intention by the lender. The high court has the power to issue writs under Article 226 of theConstitution of Indiato protect the rights and interests of the borrowers.You can also file an appeal before the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal (DRAT) under section 18 of the SARFAESI Act within 30 days of receiving the order of DRT, if you are not satisfied with it. You can seek a review or modification or reversal of the order of DRT.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Buying a property from an NRI involves some legal formalities and precautions that you should be aware of and follow. Based on the web search results that I found, here are some of the steps and tips that you should take before going ahead with this deal:Title and Ownership Verification:Check the property's title deed to ensure it's under the seller's and his wife's names.Confirm their identity and nationality through passports, visas, and PAN cards.Ensure no property encumbrances by acquiring an encumbrance certificate.Verify the property's tax status, ensuring all dues are cleared.Power of Attorney (PoA) Verification:Ensure the PoA given by the NRI seller to their relative is valid, registered, and comprehensive.Address any name discrepancies in official documents.Tax Deductions:Deduct TDS from the sale amount as mandated by the Income Tax Act, 1961. Rates are 20% for long-term and 30% for short-term capital gains.TDS rates can be adjusted if the seller provides a certificate indicating a different tax liability.TDS Formalities:Deposit the deducted TDS with the government within the stipulated time.Issue a TDS certificate (Form 16A) to the seller post deposit.Embassy Attestation:If the seller is abroad, the sale deed should be signed and attested at the Indian Embassy in the seller's residing country. This procedure is known as \"attestation of documents by diplomatic or consular officers.\"The deed should be checked by the Sub-Registrar in India before attestation to ensure legal compliance.Sale Deed Registration:Register the sale deed at the local sub-registrar's office within four months of its execution.Pay the required stamp duty and registration fees.

    "question": "Buying of property from NRI",
    "answer": "Dear clientWhen buying a property from an NRI (Non-Resident Indian), there are several precautions you should take to ensure a smooth and legally sound transaction. Here are some steps you can consider:Verify Ownership and Title: Ensure that the property's ownership and title are clear and free from any encumbrances or disputes. You may want to hire a local lawyer or property expert to conduct a title search and verify the ownership documents.Check KYC and Sale Deed: Investigate the differences in the wife's name in the KYC and sale deed. This could be a potential issue, and you should understand the reason behind it. It's essential to ensure that the seller has the legal authority to sell the property.Power of Attorney: Since the seller has given a power of attorney to his brother-in-law for selling the property, verify the authenticity of the power of attorney document. It should be properly notarized and registered, and you should consult with a legal expert to ensure its validity.Embassy Attestation: If you want the sale deed to be signed at the embassy, this is typically referred to as \"consular attestation\" or \"embassy attestation.\" The exact procedure can vary depending on the country and embassy involved. You should contact the relevant embassy or consulate to inquire about their specific requirements and procedures for attesting legal documents.Due Diligence: Conduct thorough due diligence on the property, including checking for any outstanding property taxes, utility bills, and other dues. Ensure that all these are cleared before the transaction.Draft a Clear Sale Agreement: Have a legally binding sale agreement that outlines all the terms and conditions of the sale, including the purchase price, payment schedule, and the responsibilities of both parties.Consider an Escrow Account: Consider using an escrow account to hold the funds until all legal requirements are met, and the property is transferred in your name.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "When you book a flat in Maharashtra, especially in cities like Pune, the builder's obligations and the rights of the purchaser are regulated by the Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRERA) under the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016.Delay in Construction:If the builder hasn't initiated any construction work since November 2021, it's a clear case of delay. Considering the possession date is December 2025, a significant delay has already occurred.Cancellation and Refund:As per MahaRERA provisions, if the builder fails to complete or hand over possession of the property as per the agreed timeline, the buyer has the right to demand a full refund along with interest.Deduction by Builder:While the builder might have certain terms in the agreement regarding cancellation charges, a 10% deduction might not be justified given the clear delay in construction on the builder's part. However, the exact terms of the agreement would need to be reviewed.Interest on Paid Amount:As per RERA provisions, if the builder fails to meet the timeline, not only is the buyer entitled to a full refund but also compensation, which includes interest on the amount paid.Steps to Take:Firstly, communicate your concerns with the builder, highlighting the delay and your intent to cancel.If the builder doesn't cooperate, you can file a complaint with MahaRERA, seeking a refund with interest due to the delay.It might be beneficial to consult with a legal expert familiar with real estate matters in Maharashtra to guide you through the process and understand the terms of your agreement.Remember, RERA provisions are designed to protect the interests of homebuyers and ensure transparency and accountability on the part of builders and developers.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "The SARFAESI Act, 2002 is a law that allows banks and financial institutions to recover their dues from defaulting borrowers by selling their secured assets without the intervention of courts. The secured assets are the properties that are mortgaged or pledged by the borrowers as security for the loans.In your case, you have taken a loan from Bank of India (BOI) by using your house as mortgage. You are unable to repay the loan amount and your account has become non-performing asset (NPA). Now, the bank is ready to sell your house under the SARFAESI Act. You are ready to pay your loan amount to the bank and want to know if the bank can offer you any offer or concession on your loan amount.To answer your question:The bank may or may not offer you any offer or concession on your loan amount, depending on various factors such as the amount of loan, the amount of default, the value of the property, the market conditions, etc. The bank has the discretion to decide whether to accept or reject your offer or proposal for repayment of loan.However, you have the right to make a representation or objection to the bank against the notice of sale of your property under section 13 (3A) of the SARFAESI Act within 15 days of receiving the notice. You can request the bank to reconsider your case and give you an opportunity to repay your loan by offering some settlement or compromise or restructuring of loan3.You can also approach the bank before the auction date and try to negotiate with them for a one-time settlement (OTS) or a repayment plan that suits both parties. You can offer to pay a lump sum amount or instalments that cover the principal and interest dues along with some penalty or charges. You can also request the bank to waive off some interest or charges or reduce the rate of interest as a gesture of goodwill4.If the bank agrees to your offer or proposal, you can enter into a written agreement with them and pay the agreed amount within the stipulated time. The bank will then stop the auction process and release your property from mortgage. You will also get a no-dues certificate from the bank that will clear your credit history.If the bank does not agree to your offer or proposal, you can file an application before the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) under section 17 of the SARFAESI Act within 45 days of receiving the notice of sale or taking possession of your property by the bank. You can challenge the validity of the notice of sale or possession and seek a stay order on the auction process. You can also seek relief such as restoration of possession, compensation, damages, etc.Restructuring of Loan: Depending on the bank's policies and your repayment capacity, the bank might consider restructuring your loan, which could involve extending the loan tenure, changing the interest rate, or offering a repayment holiday for a specific period. This can provide you with some relief and more time to manage your financesA loan defaulter can approach the high court for restructuring of loan only in cases, such as when there is a violation of fundamental rights, abuse of power, fraud, or malafide intention by the lender. The high court has the power to issue writs under Article 226 of theConstitution of Indiato protect the rights and interests of the borrowers.You can also file an appeal before the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal (DRAT) under section 18 of the SARFAESI Act within 30 days of receiving the order of DRT, if you are not satisfied with it. You can seek a review or modification or reversal of the order of DRT.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Running tuition in flat",
    "answer": "As per available information, giving tuition in your flat is not a commercial activity, as long as it does not cause any nuisance or inconvenience to other residents of the society. The Supreme Court of India has held that imparting education is a benevolent cause and not a business, and that a person can use a part of his or her residential premises for teaching purposes, as long as the dominant use remains residential.However, some co-operative housing societies may have their own rules and regulations regarding the use of residential flats for tuition or other purposes. These rules and regulations may vary from society to society and may depend on various factors such as the number of students, the timings, the parking space, the noise level, etc. The society may object to your tuition classes if they violate any of these rules and regulations or if they affect the rights and interests of other members.To deal with this situation, you may have to take the following steps:You have to check the bye-laws and regulations of your society and see if there is any provision that prohibits or restricts the use of residential flats for tuition or other purposes. You also have to see if there is any procedure or permission required for conducting tuition classes in your flat.You have to communicate with the society members and the committee and explain to them that your tuition classes are not a commercial activity and that they do not cause any nuisance or inconvenience to anyone. You have to assure them that you are following all the rules and regulations of the society and that you are ready to cooperate with them in resolving any issues or grievances.You have to seek prior permission from the society for conducting tuition classes in your flat and obtain a written consent from them. You may also have to pay some extra maintenance charges or fees to the society for using their facilities or services.You have to take some precautions and measures to avoid any disturbance or trouble to other residents of the society. For example, you can limit the number of students per batch, arrange for proper parking space, maintain a reasonable noise level, etc.If the society still objects to your tuition classes or tries to stop them without any valid reason, you can take legal action against them. You can file a complaint with the registrar of co-operative societies or the co-operative court and seek relief such as injunction, restoration, compensation, etc. You can also approach a civil court or a high court and seek a writ of mandamus or certiorari against the society’s action.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

Here's what you can do:Review Society Rules: Check the society's rules and regulations to see if there are any provisions that prohibit or restrict commercial activities in residential flats. These rules should be provided to you by the society or should be publicly available.Engage with the Society Committee: If the society committee is objecting to your tuition center, try to have an open and respectful conversation with them. Discuss your point of view and explain how your tuition center may not violate any existing rules. Request that they provide specific reasons for their objection in writing.Seek Mediation: If discussions with the society committee do not resolve the issue, you may consider seeking mediation or arbitration to find a mutually agreeable solution.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Running tuition in flat",
    "answer": "Giving tuitions to the students is not a commercial activity. There can be diverse view taking into consideration the nuisance if any is created by increasing number of students in a residential complex. Occupancy right of a member of the cooperative housing society including the terms and conditions and the purpose of the use of the flat are specified in its registered Bye-Laws. Since your society is recently handed over to its members, you need to go through the bye-laws and then if it says to seek permission then you may propose a permission letter to the committee members of the society and obtain their sanction for running your tuition class at your own residential premises. Members conducting tuition Classes in their flats in housing societies is quite common feature and the management is really at a loss to handle it properly without creating ill-will with in otherwise harmonious environment. Where a flat Owner seeks  prior permission to use the flat for tuition classes  it will be extremely difficult to refuse except on the ground that the proposed classes would pose serious threat to security and peace, excessive engagement of the lift which may cause a grave inconvenience to the residents, as also higher  running and maintenance expenses of lift, parking problems, where classes are proposed to be run as a professional activity by a member giving on rentals to a commercial organization etc. The managing committee would be well advised to put it up before the members in the general body meeting as the managing committee does not have an express/implied power under any Bye-law to consider such request and decide. However, needless to mention that there are catena of judgments of Hon'ble Apex Court that the bye-laws of the society hold supremacy over the Gujarat Cooperative Society act and regulations thereunder therefor in given set of facts, it is advisable for you to get the copy of registered bye-laws and thereafter if there is no express provision in it against the running of tuition classes then please place a request letter/ permission letter in appropriate form as stated above.Pooja AsharAdvocate, Ahmedabad237 Answers4 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Pooja Ashar"

    "question": "Need citation stating that BBMP cannot issue Khatha for property that is under dispute and is in the",
    "answer": "Khatha is a document that records the details of a property owner in the records of the BBMP (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike). It is not a proof of ownership, but an evidence of assessment of property tax. Khatha can be issued, transferred, bifurcated or amalgamated by the BBMP based on the documents submitted by the property owner, such as sale deed, conversion order, layout plan, etc.However, the BBMP cannot issue Khatha for a property that is under dispute and is in the middle of court proceedings. This is because the BBMP has to verify the validity and legality of the documents submitted by the property owner before issuing Khatha. If there is any doubt or dispute regarding the ownership or title of the property, the BBMP has to wait for the court’s decision before issuing Khatha.There are some citations that support this principle. For example, in Dr.S. Shobha vs The Commissioner Bbmp on 20 September, 2021, the Karnataka High Court held that:“The BBMP cannot issue khata in favour of any person without verifying the legality and validity of documents produced by such person. If there is any doubt or dispute regarding such documents, it is open for the BBMP to refuse to issue khata and direct such person to obtain a declaration of title from a competent court.”Similarly, in Here’s why BBMP Khata is not a proof of ownership for your property, it is stated that:“The Karnataka High Court has ruled that if there is any dispute regarding ownership of property, then it is not open for the BBMP to issue Khata without verifying all relevant documents and obtaining legal opinion from its legal cell. The Court also held that if there are any pending court cases regarding ownership of property, then it is not open for the BBMP to issue Khata without waiting for the outcome of such cases.” Citation: ILR2009KAR458, 2009 (3)KarLJ630 (and on the net in MANU/KA/0450/2008)Therefore, based on these citations, you can argue that the BBMP cannot issue Khatha for your property that is under dispute and is in the middle of court proceedings. You can also submit copies of the court orders that have dismissed or stayed the claims of [PERSON 1]'s grandchildren as evidence of your title and possession.I hope this information helps you.

    "answer": "The SARFAESI Act, 2002 is a law that allows banks and financial institutions to recover their dues from defaulting borrowers by selling their secured assets without the intervention of courts. The secured assets are the properties that are mortgaged or pledged by the borrowers as security for the loans.In your case, you have taken a loan from Bank of India (BOI) by using your house as mortgage. You are unable to repay the loan amount and your account has become non-performing asset (NPA). Now, the bank is ready to sell your house under the SARFAESI Act. You are ready to pay your loan amount to the bank and want to know if the bank can offer you any offer or concession on your loan amount.To answer your question:The bank may or may not offer you any offer or concession on your loan amount, depending on various factors such as the amount of loan, the amount of default, the value of the property, the market conditions, etc. The bank has the discretion to decide whether to accept or reject your offer or proposal for repayment of loan.However, you have the right to make a representation or objection to the bank against the notice of sale of your property under section 13 (3A) of the SARFAESI Act within 15 days of receiving the notice. You can request the bank to reconsider your case and give you an opportunity to repay your loan by offering some settlement or compromise or restructuring of loan3.You can also approach the bank before the auction date and try to negotiate with them for a one-time settlement (OTS) or a repayment plan that suits both parties. You can offer to pay a lump sum amount or instalments that cover the principal and interest dues along with some penalty or charges. You can also request the bank to waive off some interest or charges or reduce the rate of interest as a gesture of goodwill4.If the bank agrees to your offer or proposal, you can enter into a written agreement with them and pay the agreed amount within the stipulated time. The bank will then stop the auction process and release your property from mortgage. You will also get a no-dues certificate from the bank that will clear your credit history.If the bank does not agree to your offer or proposal, you can file an application before the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) under section 17 of the SARFAESI Act within 45 days of receiving the notice of sale or taking possession of your property by the bank. You can challenge the validity of the notice of sale or possession and seek a stay order on the auction process. You can also seek relief such as restoration of possession, compensation, damages, etc.Restructuring of Loan: Depending on the bank's policies and your repayment capacity, the bank might consider restructuring your loan, which could involve extending the loan tenure, changing the interest rate, or offering a repayment holiday for a specific period. This can provide you with some relief and more time to manage your financesA loan defaulter can approach the high court for restructuring of loan only in cases, such as when there is a violation of fundamental rights, abuse of power, fraud, or malafide intention by the lender. The high court has the power to issue writs under Article 226 of theConstitution of Indiato protect the rights and interests of the borrowers.You can also file an appeal before the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal (DRAT) under section 18 of the SARFAESI Act within 30 days of receiving the order of DRT, if you are not satisfied with it. You can seek a review or modification or reversal of the order of DRT.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

Explain your current financial situation and your intention to settle the debt.Negotiate: While the bank is not legally obligated to offer concessions or discounts on the loan amount, you can try to negotiate with them. Banks may consider waiving penalties, reducing interest, or providing a repayment plan if they see a genuine commitment to repaying the loan.Formal Settlement: If the bank is willing to negotiate, ensure that any settlement agreement is put in writing. This agreement should detail the terms, including the final repayment amount, the timeline, and any concessions granted.Auction Postponement: If you reach an agreement with the bank, you can request them to postpone the auction date.

    "answer": "A sale deed is a legally binding document that indicates the sale and transfer of ownership of a land parcel from a seller to a buyer. It is one of the most important documents as it is legally valid evidence for the transfer of land ownership. It is important to note that the sale deed needs to be registered at the subregistrar’s office of the region where the land parcel falls to ensure its validity as proof.A saatbara or 7/12 extract is a document that contains information such as survey number, area, date from which current owner is registered as owner, etc. It is issued by the revenue department of the state government and serves as a proof of land ownership.However, sometimes there may be discrepancies or errors in the plot number or other details mentioned in these documents due to various reasons such as clerical mistakes, fraud, encroachment, etc. In such cases, it is advisable to rectify the errors as soon as possible to avoid any legal complications or disputes in the future.One possible way to rectify the errors in the documents is to consult a lawyer and explore the possibility of doing an internal transfer within the family by way of a Settlement Deed wherein the discrepancy can be clarified in the preamble part and correct description of property can be given in the Schedule portion. If this can be done, dealing with the property thereafter, will not be a problem.Another possible way to rectify the errors in the documents is to approach the concerned authorities such as the revenue department or the subregistrar’s office and file an application for correction along with supporting documents such as sale deed, tax receipts, survey maps, etc. The authorities may verify the documents and issue a corrected document after rectifying the errors.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Here are some points to consider:Discrepancy in Plot Numbers: When there's a discrepancy between the plot number mentioned in the sale deed and the survey number mentioned in the saatbara and tax receipts, it can create confusion.Sale Deed Description: If the sale deed clearly mentions that your mother is the owner of survey no. 33/plot no. A, it holds significant legal weight. However, it's essential to verify the authenticity of the sale deed.Adjacent Plot A: If someone else has occupied and built on plot A, which your mother believes she owns according to the sale deed, this could lead to a legal dispute.Correction by Tahsil Office: If the tahsil office can correct the survey number to match the sale deed, it may help establish your mother's ownership of plot A. However, this may require legal procedures and documentation.a. Verify the authenticity of the sale deed. b. Assist in correcting the survey number with the tahsil office if necessary. c. Evaluate the situation regarding the occupied plot A and recommend appropriate legal actions, such as eviction if your mother is indeed the rightful owner.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Partition suit pending for final decree",
    "answer": "In a partition case, a preliminary decree is followed by a final decree that divides the property among co-owners. Your preliminary decree, issued in 2018, granted you a 4/7th (57.15%) share, while the other six co-owners received 7.15% each. However, you've observed construction activities on the property by co-owners holding a collective 42.85% share. You obtained a court-issued stay order, restraining further construction, and have informed the police and municipal authorities. You're located in Chennai, while the property is in Rajasthan, around 2500 km away. You have several questions:Impact of Present Construction:Allowing the ongoing construction could potentially harm your interests, as the new structure's valuation may affect the property's auction price.Property's Status Quo:You mentioned that the property has existed for more than 64 years, implying that the superstructure has fully depreciated. However, the concept of status quo pertains to the property's current physical condition and legal standing, which can change over time due to various factors.Lack of Objections by Co-Owners:Your notice about the construction did not receive objections or attempts to halt it from other co-owners. This, in your view, suggests their complicity in the ongoing construction.Demarcation Challenges:If metes and bounds demarcation of the property isn't feasible, auction may be the only viable solution.Online Case Contestation from Chennai:Whether you can contest the case online from Chennai depends on the nature of your case and the court's available online facilities. E-filing and virtual courts are potential options for online case participation. You'll need to check with the specific court where your case is pending to determine if these options are available.Overall, your concerns are valid, especially regarding the potential impact of the construction on the property's valuation and the need to proceed with an auction. However, the legal processes and options available to you will depend on the specific circumstances of your case and the jurisdiction of the court involved.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "To stop auction of my house in sarfeasi act",
    "answer": "The SARFAESI Act, 2002 is a law that allows banks and financial institutions to recover their dues from defaulting borrowers by selling their secured assets without the intervention of courts. The secured assets are the properties that are mortgaged or pledged by the borrowers as security for the loans.In your case, you have taken a loan from Bank of India (BOI) by using your house as mortgage. You are unable to repay the loan amount and your account has become non-performing asset (NPA). Now, the bank is ready to sell your house under the SARFAESI Act. You are ready to pay your loan amount to the bank and want to know if the bank can offer you any offer or concession on your loan amount.To answer your question:The bank may or may not offer you any offer or concession on your loan amount, depending on various factors such as the amount of loan, the amount of default, the value of the property, the market conditions, etc. The bank has the discretion to decide whether to accept or reject your offer or proposal for repayment of loan.However, you have the right to make a representation or objection to the bank against the notice of sale of your property under section 13 (3A) of the SARFAESI Act within 15 days of receiving the notice. You can request the bank to reconsider your case and give you an opportunity to repay your loan by offering some settlement or compromise or restructuring of loan3.You can also approach the bank before the auction date and try to negotiate with them for a one-time settlement (OTS) or a repayment plan that suits both parties. You can offer to pay a lump sum amount or instalments that cover the principal and interest dues along with some penalty or charges. You can also request the bank to waive off some interest or charges or reduce the rate of interest as a gesture of goodwill4.If the bank agrees to your offer or proposal, you can enter into a written agreement with them and pay the agreed amount within the stipulated time. The bank will then stop the auction process and release your property from mortgage. You will also get a no-dues certificate from the bank that will clear your credit history.If the bank does not agree to your offer or proposal, you can file an application before the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) under section 17 of the SARFAESI Act within 45 days of receiving the notice of sale or taking possession of your property by the bank. You can challenge the validity of the notice of sale or possession and seek a stay order on the auction process. You can also seek relief such as restoration of possession, compensation, damages, etc.Restructuring of Loan: Depending on the bank's policies and your repayment capacity, the bank might consider restructuring your loan, which could involve extending the loan tenure, changing the interest rate, or offering a repayment holiday for a specific period. This can provide you with some relief and more time to manage your financesA loan defaulter can approach the high court for restructuring of loan only in cases, such as when there is a violation of fundamental rights, abuse of power, fraud, or malafide intention by the lender. The high court has the power to issue writs under Article 226 of theConstitution of Indiato protect the rights and interests of the borrowers.You can also file an appeal before the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal (DRAT) under section 18 of the SARFAESI Act within 30 days of receiving the order of DRT, if you are not satisfied with it. You can seek a review or modification or reversal of the order of DRT.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

However, there may still be some possibilities for negotiation or settlement with the bank before the auction takes place. Here's what you can do:Contact the Bank: Reach out to the bank immediately and express your willingness to repay the loan amount in full. Explain your current financial situation and your intention to settle the debt.Negotiate: While the bank is not legally obligated to offer concessions or discounts on the loan amount, you can try to negotiate with them. Banks may consider waiving penalties, reducing interest, or providing a repayment plan if they see a genuine commitment to repaying the loan.Formal Settlement: If the bank is willing to negotiate, ensure that any settlement agreement is put in writing. This agreement should detail the terms, including the final repayment amount, the timeline, and any concessions granted.Auction Postponement: If you reach an agreement with the bank, you can request them to postpone the auction date.

    "question": "Running tuition in flat",
    "answer": "As per available information, giving tuition in your flat is not a commercial activity, as long as it does not cause any nuisance or inconvenience to other residents of the society. The Supreme Court of India has held that imparting education is a benevolent cause and not a business, and that a person can use a part of his or her residential premises for teaching purposes, as long as the dominant use remains residential.However, some co-operative housing societies may have their own rules and regulations regarding the use of residential flats for tuition or other purposes. These rules and regulations may vary from society to society and may depend on various factors such as the number of students, the timings, the parking space, the noise level, etc. The society may object to your tuition classes if they violate any of these rules and regulations or if they affect the rights and interests of other members.To deal with this situation, you may have to take the following steps:You have to check the bye-laws and regulations of your society and see if there is any provision that prohibits or restricts the use of residential flats for tuition or other purposes. You also have to see if there is any procedure or permission required for conducting tuition classes in your flat.You have to communicate with the society members and the committee and explain to them that your tuition classes are not a commercial activity and that they do not cause any nuisance or inconvenience to anyone. You have to assure them that you are following all the rules and regulations of the society and that you are ready to cooperate with them in resolving any issues or grievances.You have to seek prior permission from the society for conducting tuition classes in your flat and obtain a written consent from them. You may also have to pay some extra maintenance charges or fees to the society for using their facilities or services.You have to take some precautions and measures to avoid any disturbance or trouble to other residents of the society. For example, you can limit the number of students per batch, arrange for proper parking space, maintain a reasonable noise level, etc.If the society still objects to your tuition classes or tries to stop them without any valid reason, you can take legal action against them. You can file a complaint with the registrar of co-operative societies or the co-operative court and seek relief such as injunction, restoration, compensation, etc. You can also approach a civil court or a high court and seek a writ of mandamus or certiorari against the society’s action.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "question": "Running tuition in flat",
    "answer": "Dear client,Running a tuition center from your residential flat may or may not be considered a commercial activity depending on the specific rules and regulations of your apartment complex or housing society, as well as local laws. Here's what you can do:Review Society Rules: Check the society's rules and regulations to see if there are any provisions that prohibit or restrict commercial activities in residential flats. These rules should be provided to you by the society or should be publicly available.Engage with the Society Committee: If the society committee is objecting to your tuition center, try to have an open and respectful conversation with them. Discuss your point of view and explain how your tuition center may not violate any existing rules. Request that they provide specific reasons for their objection in writing.Seek Mediation: If discussions with the society committee do not resolve the issue, you may consider seeking mediation or arbitration to find a mutually agreeable solution.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Running tuition in flat",
    "answer": "Giving tuitions to the students is not a commercial activity. There can be diverse view taking into consideration the nuisance if any is created by increasing number of students in a residential complex. Occupancy right of a member of the cooperative housing society including the terms and conditions and the purpose of the use of the flat are specified in its registered Bye-Laws. Since your society is recently handed over to its members, you need to go through the bye-laws and then if it says to seek permission then you may propose a permission letter to the committee members of the society and obtain their sanction for running your tuition class at your own residential premises. Members conducting tuition Classes in their flats in housing societies is quite common feature and the management is really at a loss to handle it properly without creating ill-will with in otherwise harmonious environment. Where a flat Owner seeks  prior permission to use the flat for tuition classes  it will be extremely difficult to refuse except on the ground that the proposed classes would pose serious threat to security and peace, excessive engagement of the lift which may cause a grave inconvenience to the residents, as also higher  running and maintenance expenses of lift, parking problems, where classes are proposed to be run as a professional activity by a member giving on rentals to a commercial organization etc. The managing committee would be well advised to put it up before the members in the general body meeting as the managing committee does not have an express/implied power under any Bye-law to consider such request and decide. However, needless to mention that there are catena of judgments of Hon'ble Apex Court that the bye-laws of the society hold supremacy over the Gujarat Cooperative Society act and regulations thereunder therefor in given set of facts, it is advisable for you to get the copy of registered bye-laws and thereafter if there is no express provision in it against the running of tuition classes then please place a request letter/ permission letter in appropriate form as stated above.Pooja AsharAdvocate, Ahmedabad237 Answers4 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Pooja Ashar"

    "question": "To stop auction of my house in sarfeasi act",
    "answer": "The SARFAESI Act, 2002 is a law that allows banks and financial institutions to recover their dues from defaulting borrowers by selling their secured assets without the intervention of courts. The secured assets are the properties that are mortgaged or pledged by the borrowers as security for the loans.In your case, you have taken a loan from Bank of India (BOI) by using your house as mortgage. You are unable to repay the loan amount and your account has become non-performing asset (NPA). Now, the bank is ready to sell your house under the SARFAESI Act. You are ready to pay your loan amount to the bank and want to know if the bank can offer you any offer or concession on your loan amount.To answer your question:The bank may or may not offer you any offer or concession on your loan amount, depending on various factors such as the amount of loan, the amount of default, the value of the property, the market conditions, etc. The bank has the discretion to decide whether to accept or reject your offer or proposal for repayment of loan.However, you have the right to make a representation or objection to the bank against the notice of sale of your property under section 13 (3A) of the SARFAESI Act within 15 days of receiving the notice. You can request the bank to reconsider your case and give you an opportunity to repay your loan by offering some settlement or compromise or restructuring of loan3.You can also approach the bank before the auction date and try to negotiate with them for a one-time settlement (OTS) or a repayment plan that suits both parties. You can offer to pay a lump sum amount or instalments that cover the principal and interest dues along with some penalty or charges. You can also request the bank to waive off some interest or charges or reduce the rate of interest as a gesture of goodwill4.If the bank agrees to your offer or proposal, you can enter into a written agreement with them and pay the agreed amount within the stipulated time. The bank will then stop the auction process and release your property from mortgage. You will also get a no-dues certificate from the bank that will clear your credit history.If the bank does not agree to your offer or proposal, you can file an application before the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) under section 17 of the SARFAESI Act within 45 days of receiving the notice of sale or taking possession of your property by the bank. You can challenge the validity of the notice of sale or possession and seek a stay order on the auction process. You can also seek relief such as restoration of possession, compensation, damages, etc.Restructuring of Loan: Depending on the bank's policies and your repayment capacity, the bank might consider restructuring your loan, which could involve extending the loan tenure, changing the interest rate, or offering a repayment holiday for a specific period. This can provide you with some relief and more time to manage your financesA loan defaulter can approach the high court for restructuring of loan only in cases, such as when there is a violation of fundamental rights, abuse of power, fraud, or malafide intention by the lender. The high court has the power to issue writs under Article 226 of theConstitution of Indiato protect the rights and interests of the borrowers.You can also file an appeal before the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal (DRAT) under section 18 of the SARFAESI Act within 30 days of receiving the order of DRT, if you are not satisfied with it. You can seek a review or modification or reversal of the order of DRT.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "Dear clientWhen your property is scheduled for auction under the SARFAESI Act, it means the bank has initiated the process to recover the outstanding loan amount by selling the property. However, there may still be some possibilities for negotiation or settlement with the bank before the auction takes place. Here's what you can do:Contact the Bank: Reach out to the bank immediately and express your willingness to repay the loan amount in full. Explain your current financial situation and your intention to settle the debt.Negotiate: While the bank is not legally obligated to offer concessions or discounts on the loan amount, you can try to negotiate with them. Banks may consider waiving penalties, reducing interest, or providing a repayment plan if they see a genuine commitment to repaying the loan.Formal Settlement: If the bank is willing to negotiate, ensure that any settlement agreement is put in writing. This agreement should detail the terms, including the final repayment amount, the timeline, and any concessions granted.Auction Postponement: If you reach an agreement with the bank, you can request them to postpone the auction date. The bank may consider this request if they are satisfied with the repayment arrangement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"
