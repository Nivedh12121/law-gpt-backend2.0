Being nominee you are entitled to receive the money but is legally bound to distribute the same among legal heirs of father. In instant case since there is WILL so firstly probate in respect of WILL is must and as your son is beneficiary so a guardian is also required to be appointed through court in respect of your son. You can also be guardian for which a petition is required to be filed. You have neglected, surpassed and bypassed all these legally required steps and invited police complaint by your sister.  Technically you have not committed any crime. As such there is no universal defense. To suggest defense, the contents of complaint filed by your sister is required to be examined.Siddharth SrivastavaAdvocate, Delhi1537 AnswersTalk to Advocate Siddharth Srivastava"

    "answer": "A nominee is just a trustee to receive the funds from bank account ofg the deceased account holder and then disburse it to to the legal heirs of the deceased.You being one of the legal heirs, you can take one equal share out of the balance amount, at par with the other legal heirs.But it becomes your duty to distribute the share of your sister who is also one of the legal heirs to succeed to the estates and other estates of your deceased father.Besides you have stated that you have transferred the funds of your father's bank account, but it is not known that how did you transfer the same?A nominee has to give an application to withdraw the amount lying in the account of deceased account holder by attaching the death certificate and he cannot transfer the funds to his name if the account was operated by your deceased father alone.If you have done it by any illegal means then it can be considered as a crime.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear client,it's important to consult with a lawyer who specializes in inheritance and banking laws in your jurisdiction for accurate advice based on the specific laws and regulations that apply to your situation. They will be able to provide you with guidance tailored to your circumstances.When you are nominated as the beneficiary of a bank account, you generally have the right to access and withdraw the funds in the account upon the death of the account holder. However, it's important to follow the legal procedures and requirements in your jurisdiction.Here are a few general considerations:Disclosure of death: In most cases, it is required to inform the bank about the death of the account holder. The bank will then take necessary steps to freeze the account and prevent unauthorized transactions.Legal requirements: Depending on the jurisdiction and the specific circumstances, there may be legal requirements to follow when it comes to handling the assets of a deceased person. This may include obtaining a probate or letters of administration, which establish your authority to manage and distribute the assets according to the terms of the will.Compliance with the will: If your father has left a valid will and has bequeathed his assets to your son, it's important to ensure that you are following the provisions of the will. This may involve transferring the assets or funds to your son's name in accordance with the legal procedures.Consult a lawyer: Given the complexity and potential legal implications, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer who specializes in inheritance and banking laws in your jurisdiction. They can review your specific situation, advise you on the applicable laws and regulations, and guide you through the legal process. They can also assist you in formulating a strong defense if legal action has been taken against you.It's important to remember that laws and regulations can vary significantly depending on the jurisdiction. Therefore, it is essential to consult with a local lawyer who can provide accurate advice based on the specific laws in your area and help you understand your rights and obligations.Please consult with a legal professional for specific advice tailored to your situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Transfer of funds",
    "answer": "Your question is not clear. You say that you transferred the funds from your father's account without informing the bank about his death. Does it mean that you used some of his already already signed cheques or you are also a joint account holder. The fact that the bank has allowed the transfer indicates that you must have used either his cheques or you have exercised the authority as joint account holder. As you have written that your father has willed all his assets in favour of your son, so legally speaking your son is the rightful owner of all bank balances after the death of your father. You as his nominee can withdraw the funds but you cannot utilize the funds for your own benefits. The funds need to be given to your son who has a will of your father. Nothing can be said about the complaint lodged by your sister as it is not clear what are the ground of making the complaint.Dalbir BhartiAdvocate, Gurgaon41 AnswersTalk to Advocate Dalbir Bharti"

    "question": "Heir certificate/process to sell property in India",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. You know that as per Section 2(h) of Indian Succession Act, 1925 provides that Will means the legal declaration of the intention of a person with respect to his property, which he desires to take effect after his death Will has been defined in Corpus Juris Secundum as A ‘Will’ is the legal declaration of a man’s intention, which he wills to be performed after his death, or an instrument by which a person makes a disposition of his property to take effect after his death.You can apply for probate of Will initially. The word ‘Probate’ means to prove or validate something. It is a procedure for court approval of the Will as the valid and last Will of the deceased testator. According to the Indian Succession Act, 1925, “Probate of will, when granted establishes the will from the death of the testator, and renders valid all intermediate acts of the executor as such.”It means that when a Will is probated, it gets officially certified with a seal of the court and provides the authority to the executor to appropriately distribute the assets of deceased testator and also to pay off bills and creditors from that estate.The procedure for probating of will is divided into four simple stages:1. The first step involves making of application to the District Judge through a probate petition which must be duly signed and verified by or on behalf of the applicant. The probate petition should be in a prescribed format under Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.2. The second step is to send the application to the High Court, under whose jurisdiction property falls. Then a lawyer shall prepare the application, in some cases lower court can also accept the application.3. One needs to submit certain documents that can verify the genuineness of the will, death certificate and other documents. These will prove that the testator had free will.4. When the court receives the application, it verifies all the details. Then it invites the nearest kin of the deceased for claiming the probate. Finally, it showcases the invitation letter at prominent places for invitation of any objection. If after 30 days, the court files no objection, the issuance of the probate is complete.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "question": "Heir certificate/process to sell property in India",
    "answer": "If your father had written Will in USA which would include the properties left behind in the USA also then you can get the Will probated by a court of USA.A will can be executed anywhere without any restrictions subject to the due procedure of the law of the country.With reference to wills executed outside India, in respect of which a foreign probate has also been obtained, the requirement of Section 213(1) of the Indian Succession  Act , 1925, would be satisfied by obtaining under Section 228(1) of the Act an ancillary probate. Otherwise, the procedural requirement of the lex fori enacted under Section 213(1) of the Act may not be satisfied and if it is only with a view to enable parties claiming under a will executed outside India to make claims with reference to properties situated in India, the procedure under Section 228 of the Act has been prescribed.In India, Wills made in other jurisdiction are not automatically enforceable.Under the Act, an ancillary probate can be granted to authenticate a foreign will. A foreign will, once proved and deposited in a court of competent jurisdiction, or a properly authenticated copy of the will and letters of administration will be recognised by the Indian Courts. Otherwise, if the Court deems fit then it will take the evidence into account and will examine the petitioner upon oath to ensure the veracity of the will.An executor or legatee cannot claim their right under the will unless probate or letters of administration of the will are obtained.If the Will was written in India and if the properties are situated in a place other than Bombay or Madras or Calcutta, probate would not be necessary, but you can get the details of the family tree or surviving members of the family of deceased duly attested by a notary of that country, in order to succeed to the estates, based on which all the beneficiaries should apply jointly for mutation of the property to their name by enclosing the copy of the Will (probate of Will if already obtained).Once the property is mutated then all the shareholders can sell the property jointly by executing a joint sale deed in favor of the prospective buyer."

    "answer": "- If the said Will clearly not mentioned the names of all legal heirs, then there is requirement for LR certificate- A Legal heir certificate can be obtained after approaching the office of the Tehsildar or the Corporation /municipality office of the area where the deceased has taken his last breath. If the deceased person has resided that place less than 6 months only , then a report can be obtained by the Tehsildar from the Tehsildar where the deceased was resided for more than one year.- Since, you want to sell that property , then you should apply for mutation before the revenue officer in the name of all legal heirs , and there is not requirement for LR certificate , if Will is available.-Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Heir certificate/process to sell property in India",
    "answer": "Dear client,I'm not a legal expert, but I can provide some general information based on common practices. In India, an heirship certificate (also known as a succession certificate) can be obtained to establish the legal heirs of a deceased person and their respective shares in the estate. The certificate helps in transferring the assets of the deceased, including property, to the rightful heirs.To obtain an heirship certificate, you may need to follow these general steps:Jurisdiction: Determine the jurisdiction where the deceased's property is located. The application for the heirship certificate usually needs to be made in the appropriate court within that jurisdiction.Application: Prepare an application for the heirship certificate, including details such as the deceased's name, date of death, place of residence, and details of legal heirs (including their names, addresses, and relationships).Supporting Documents: Gather supporting documents that may be required, which can include:Death certificate of the deceased.Copy of the Will, if available.Identity proof and address proof of the legal heirs.Affidavits from the legal heirs stating their relationship with the deceased and their rights to the property.Any other documents as required by the court.Affidavits and Declarations: The legal heirs may need to provide affidavits and declarations stating their relationship to the deceased and their entitlement to the property.Publication and Notice: The court may require publication of a notice in a local newspaper and serving notice to other legal heirs and interested parties, giving them an opportunity to raise objections if any.Court Process: Attend the court proceedings and provide any additional information or documentation as required by the court.Please note that the process and specific requirements for obtaining an heirship certificate can vary based on the jurisdiction and the individual circumstances.

It is pertinent that stated agreements, sale deed was executed during 2001 to 2005 and more than 20 years. After sale and handing over the possession, in 2016 the act of Sayed raising boundary wall was illegal and Ramesh has ever power to get removed the Wall and to take possession and also to claim damages.1. & 2. The suit is not maintainable.  Though in terms of Article 65 of the Limitation Act the time limit to file a partition suit is 12 years so Sayed to cover lapses has take the plea that he had recent came to know that new purchasers and defendants are in illegal possession on the basis of some forged and concocted document without his consent but the same is not tenable in law being case highly belated and barred by limitation. Conduct of Sayed and Asif shows that defendant were is possession ever since from date of purchase in 2001 to 2005 and it is apparent from Asif and Sayed have never objected nor initiated proceeding to exert their right and ownership. Defendant being bonafide purchasers are in uninterrupted possession so by rule of adverse possessions defendants can assert their rights and possession in respect of their area.

    "answer": "Dear client,This is a complex legal case with several issues. Here are some possible answers to your questions:The suit is maintainable on the ground that Sayed is claiming his share of the ancestral property. Asif and Sayed inherited the property from their father Karim, and Sayed has the right to claim his share.The residents in possession can file an objection on the basis of adverse possession. If they have been in possession of the property for more than 12 years without interruption, they may be able to claim ownership of the property.The suit can be considered as a partial partition suit because Sayed is only claiming his share of the property. However, if he wants to claim the entire property, he may need to file a suit for partition and possession.The Ramesh case and sale of the commercial site may help to defend against Sayed's claim, especially if the sale was conducted in a legally valid manner. However, this will depend on the specific facts and circumstances of the case.The court jurisdiction will depend on the value of the property. If the property value is not mentioned in the valuation slip, the court may determine jurisdiction based on the market value of the property or other relevant factors.Sayed can emphasize to the court that GPA holder Kishan, the developer, and other resident members should be included as parties in the suit because they have an interest in the property and their presence is necessary for a fair and just adjudication of the case. However, it will ultimately be up to the court to decide whether to include them as parties.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,If the GPA holder Kishan is not alive and cannot be located, the court may appoint a legal representative or guardian ad litem to act on his behalf. The legal representative or guardian will be responsible for representing Kishan's interests in the case. If the legal representative or guardian cannot be located, the court may proceed with the case without them, and any decision made by the court may be binding on Kishan's interests.The principle of partition will depend on the specific laws and regulations in your jurisdiction. In general, when property is developed into a residential layout, the value of each individual site is determined based on its location, size, and other factors. If the property is being divided among multiple owners, the value of each owner's share will be based on the value of their respective sites.Sayed will need to submit all relevant documents related to the property, including the mother deed, any sale agreements, and any other legal documents related to the property. He will also need to provide evidence of his relationship to the property and his claim to a share of the property.The holding of the property owner mentioned in the mother deed will depend on the specific terms of the mother deed and any subsequent agreements or contracts. In general, if the property is developed into a residential layout and sold as individual sites, the owner mentioned in the mother deed may retain ownership of any unsold sites or receive a share of the proceeds from the sale of individual sites.It is unlikely that criminal action can be taken against Sayed on the basis of religious discrimination or creating enmity in the residents. However, if there is evidence that Sayed has violated any civil or criminal laws, he may be subject to legal action. It is recommended that Sayed consult with an experienced attorney who can review the details of the case and provide guidance on any potential legal risks.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In your case, since you have a birth certificate from Mauritius, which is your country of birth, it is advisable to mention Mauritius as the place of birth in the re-issued passport.Regarding the name change, you have an affidavit for the change of name from Dwip Sinha to Saptarshi Sinha, which can be submitted as proof for the name change. It is recommended to mention the correct and current name, i.e., Saptarshi Sinha, in the re-issued passport.There may be some questions asked by the authorities regarding the change of personal details, such as why it was not mentioned earlier. However, since you have all the required proofs, such as the birth certificate and affidavit for the name change, it should not be a significant issue.It is always advisable to provide accurate and correct personal details in the passport application, as any incorrect information may cause delays or rejections in the passport issuance process. Therefore, it is recommended to mention the correct and current details in the re-issued passport.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Sir,You may purchase the property subject to fulfillment of following conditions. For more details visit the link.12 Important Documents To Check Before Buying A New Property1. Sale Deed:A Sale Deed is the core legal document that acts as proof of sale and transfer of ownership of the property from the seller to the buyer. A Sale Deed has to be mandatorily registered. It is important that before the Sale Deed is executed one should execute the sale agreement and should check for compliance of various terms and conditions as agreed upon between the buyer and the seller. Before executing the Sale Deed, the buyer should check whether the property has a clear title. He/she should also confirm if the property is subject to any encumbrance charges.* A seller should settle all the statutory payments such as property tax, cess, water charges, society charges, electricity charges, maintenance charges etc., (subject to the agreement) before executing the Sale Deed.Mother Deed:Mother Deed, also known as the parent document, is an important legal document that traces the origin/antecedent ownership of the property from the start (if the property has had various owners). It is a document that helps in the further sale of the property, thereby establishing the new ownership. In case of absence of the original Mother Deed, certified copies should be obtained from the registering authorities. Mother Deed includes the change in ownership of the property, be it through sale, partition, gift or inheritance. It is very important that the Mother Deed records the references to previous ownership in a sequence and should be continuous and unbroken. In case of a missing sequence, one should refer to the records from the registering offices, revenue records or the recitals (preamble) in other documents. The sequence should be updated until the current owner.2. Building approval plan:A building plan is sanctioned by the BDA (Bangalore Development Authority) or BBMP (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike) or BMRDA (Bangalore Metropolitan Region Development Authority) or BIAPPA (Bangalore International Airport Area Planning Authority) without which the construction of the building is illegal under the Karnataka Municipal Corporations (KMC) Act. A building owner has to get an approved plan from the jurisdictional Commissioner or an officer authorized by such Commissioner. However, the authorities sanction a building approval plan based on the zonal classification, road width, floor area ratio (FAR) and plot depth. A set of documents are required to be submitted by the owner in order to obtain a building approval plan. The documents include- Title Deed, property assessment extract, property PID number, city survey sketch (from the Department of Survey and Settlement and Land Records), up-to-date tax paid receipt, earlier sanctioned plans (if any), property drawings, 2 copies of demand drafts, foundation certificate (if any) and a land use certificate issued by the competent authority (viz., Dy. Commissioner). It is mandatory that the building owner hires a registered architect who will draw a plan meeting the applicable bye laws. One can get a building approval plan within 4-5 working days if all the requirements are met, via the newly invented BBMP software- Automated Building Approval Plan.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, Bangalore6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar"

    "question": "Need to build committee of individual volunteer from residents but not from society association",
    "answer": "Dear client,In this situation, it seems that you and a group of residents are willing to form a separate committee to address the pending tasks and development work in the society. Here are some suggestions for better execution and a legal approach:Separate Bank Account: You can approach the society association and request permission to open a separate bank account specifically for collecting contributions towards the pending tasks. It should be in the name of the society, and the account should be operated transparently and responsibly.Independence of the Committee: When forming the committee, it would be beneficial to draft clear guidelines or bylaws that outline its purpose, powers, and responsibilities. This will help ensure the committee's independence and minimize the need for frequent approval from the society association.Agreement and Responsibility: It is advisable to have a written agreement or memorandum of understanding among the committee members, clearly stating their responsibilities and obligations. This can include provisions for individual liability in case of any deviations or financial mismanagement.Project Timeline: As you mentioned that the tasks will take approximately three years to complete, it is essential to have a well-defined project timeline and periodically update the residents on the progress.Collaboration with Builder and Society Association: It is positive that the builder is supporting your initiative. It may also be beneficial to maintain open communication with the society association to avoid any conflicts or misunderstandings. Seek their cooperation and support, emphasizing that the goal is to enhance the society's amenities for the benefit of all residents.It's important to note that the specific legal requirements and procedures may vary depending on the laws and regulations applicable to your location. Therefore, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer who specializes in property law or cooperative housing society matters. They will be able to review your specific situation, provide accurate advice, and assist you in ensuring that the necessary legal steps are followed.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,In general, labor laws in India are designed to protect the rights of employees. Employers are required to provide a safe and non-discriminatory work environment, adhere to reasonable working hours, and follow relevant labor regulations.Regarding your concerns:Transfer and Posting: Employers generally have the right to transfer employees to different locations as per the terms and conditions of employment. However, the frequency and distance of transfers may need to be reasonable and in line with the employment contract and local labor laws. It's advisable to review your employment contract and consult with an employment lawyer to understand the specific provisions related to transfers.Work Environment: Employers are expected to provide a safe and healthy work environment for their employees. If you believe that the workplace is toxic or if there are disciplinary rules that are unreasonable or violate labor laws, you may have grounds for complaint. It's recommended to document any incidents or issues and consult with an employment lawyer to discuss potential actions.Bond and Notice Period: The enforceability of bonds and notice periods can vary based on the specific terms and conditions of the agreement, as well as local labor laws. Some courts in India have held that bond clauses are illegal, while others have upheld their validity in certain circumstances. It's important to review the terms of the bond and notice period, consult with an employment lawyer, and understand the legal implications before making any decisions.Please note that this information is general in nature and may not apply specifically to your situation.

    "question": "Alimony",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard.In case of Rajnesh v. Neha & Anr, Hon'ble Supreme Court stated that there can be no straitjacket formula for fixing such a quantum. Stressing upon the importance of maintaining a careful and just balance between all relevant factors, the Court held that the maintenance amount awarded must be reasonable and realistic. It directed the Courts to take cognizance of the fact that maintenance awarded to the applicant should neither be so extravagant that it becomes oppressive and unbearable for the respondent, nor should it be so meagre that it drives the applicant to penury.In addition to the statutory guidance, the Court laid down the following indicative factors to be considered before determining the quantum of maintenance (a) the status of the parties; (b) reasonable needs of the wife and dependent children; (c) whether the applicant is educated and professionally qualified; (d) whether the applicant has any independent source of income; (e) whether the income is sufficient to enable the applicant to maintain the same standard of living as she was accustomed to in her matrimonial home; (f) whether the applicant was employed prior to her marriage; (g) whether she was working during the subsistence of the marriage; (h) whether the wife was required to sacrifice her employment opportunities for nurturing the family, child rearing, and looking after adult members of the family; (i) reasonable costs of litigation for a non-working wife.Apart from the aforesaid factors set out hereinabove, the Court laid down certain additional factors for determining the quantum of maintenance payable. These are inter alia as follows:Age and employment of parties;Duration of marriage;Maintenance of minor children; andSerious disability or ill health of a spouse, child /children from the marriage or dependent relative who require constant care and recurrent expenditure, would also be a relevant consideration while quantifying maintenance.The aforesaid factors are not exhaustive, and the concerned Court can exercise its discretion to consider any other factor/s, which may be necessary or relevant in the facts and circumstances of a particular case.Further, in case of Manokaran vs. M.Devaki where it was held that Grant of maintenance to the wife working and earning more that her husband is improper and the same cannot be said that the wife was not having sufficient independent income.She can demand alimony, however, depending on the facts and circumstances you mentioned it can be denied if defended properly. It can be claimed for child as well. Maintenance amount can be reduced if passed against him in appellate Courts since she is presently working and she will have to submit an affidavit in Court about her present financial status.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete facts.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear client,In general, alimony (also known as spousal support or maintenance) is typically determined based on various factors, including the income and financial resources of both parties, the length of the marriage, the standard of living during the marriage, and the needs of each spouse. Whether alimony would be awarded and the specific amount would depend on the specific laws and regulations of your jurisdiction, as well as the unique circumstances of the case.When it comes to child support, the primary concern is the best interests of the child. The financial resources and ability of both parents to contribute to the child's upbringing are taken into consideration. It's possible that the daughter-in-law could seek child support from your sister's son for the care and upbringing of their child.Given the complexity of your situation and the potential legal implications, it's highly recommended to seek professional legal advice.

If cheques are bounced you can recover the same as follows:=======================================================================Cheque bounceFAQs Negotiable Instruments Act1A. AmendedCheque BounceProvisions- 143A & 148…what is it?Ans:Section 143A- It empowers the Court to order the drawer of the cheque to pay Interim Compensation  - 20% - Without depositing this amount the accused cannot defend the case.Section 148– It empowers the Appellate Court to order payment pending the appeal against convictionThe Appellate Court may order the appellant to deposit an amount which shall be a minimum of 20% of the fine or compensation awarded by the trial Court.This amount shall be in addition to the amount already paid by the appellant under Section 143A.It received the assent of the President and was notified in the Official Gazette on 02.08.2018In which court do I need to file the complaint case under Section 138 N.I. Act in case drawer did not pay after receiving notice?A complaint case under Section 138 N.I. Act can be filed in any competent court in whose jurisdiction any of the following acts have occurred:a) Place of drawing of the cheque,b) Address of bank where cheque was presented (holders bank address),c) Address of bank where cheque is payable (drawers bank address)d) Place from where notice was received by drawer of chequea. It is possible that each of these four acts could have occurred at different localities. The complainant can choose any one the above places to determine jurisdiction of court where they wish to file complaint.2. What can I do if it has been more than 30 days since I received information of dishonour of cheque?If the cheque is still valid i.e. 3 months (currently) have not passed from the date of its issue, you can represent the cheque again to your banker as there is no restriction regarding the number of times a cheque can be presented and that every subsequent representation and dishonour gives rise to fresh cause of action for filing complaint. It may be noted that once a notice for payment is given then the holder must file a complaint under Section 138 N.I. Act within 30 days from expiry of notice period as a fresh cause of action will not arise if the cheque is presented again and it is dishonoured and failure to file complaint will lead to loss of remedy available under Section 138 N.I.

    "answer": "Dear client,Under Hindu law, an adopted child has equal rights in the property of the adoptive family as that of a biological child. However, the rights of an adopted child in the property of the natural family are not recognized unless the adoption was made with the consent of the natural parents or the property is inherited by the adoptive family from the natural family.In your case, it appears that your father was adopted by a lady and the agricultural property was claimed by her after the death of her husband. It is important to ascertain whether the property was acquired by the adopted mother through inheritance or as self-acquired property. If the property was inherited, your father would have had a share in it, and consequently, you and your siblings would have a share in it too.If the property was self-acquired, it would belong to the adopted mother, and upon her demise, it would devolve upon her legal heirs as per the applicable laws of inheritance. In that case, your adopted mother would have had the right to bequeath the property as per her wishes.Regarding the transactions carried out between your adopted mother and your siblings, their validity would depend on the nature of the transaction and the documents executed. If the transactions are not registered, they may not be legally valid.In order to ascertain your legal rights in the property, it is advisable to consult a local lawyer and provide them with all the relevant details. The lawyer can examine the relevant documents and advise you on the legal recourse available to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Sir,What does the grandparent's property law in India state? Does the grandson own the right to the property?All property's owned by a Hindu person devolves onto his class one legal heir's.Now to the specific scenario's in ur example (for sake of convenience I'm presuming your grandfather has only one legal heir)Senario1: The property isself acquiredby your Grandfather, in such case upon his demise intestate (without a will) the property would devolve upon ur Father and not you. In case your father passes away before your grandfather then in such case it would devolve upon you, your mother and ur siblings equally.Scenario 2:the property in question is self acquired by ur grandfather father ( ur great grand farther) - would devolve same as scenario 1.Scenario 3:the property in question is self acquired by ur grandfather grand father ( ur great great grand farther) - would devolve same as scenario 1.Scenario 4:the property in question is self acquired by ur grandfathers great grand father ( ur great great great grand farther) - then in such a case you would be entitled to the property by birth as it becomes ur ancestral property.To give you more clarity on the concept ofAncestral Property's :any property which passes undivided down 4 generations of male lineage is called ancestral property. The right to such property acquires at birth unlike other laws of inheritance where right arises upon the death of the the owner.Hope this brings some clarity to your question and your sense of entitlements.Meaning ofancestral propertyin India-Anancestral propertymeans apropertywhich is devolved upon heirs by the 3 generations above them;father,father's fatherorfather's fathers'father. ... That means when a coparcener acquires his share inancestral propertythan hecanmake awillto that share and bequest it.Meaning of ancestral property in India-An ancestral property means a property which is devolved upon heirs by the 3 generations above them; father, father’s father or father’s fathers’ father. It passes to the next three generations.Meaning of will-A will means a document in which a person specifies the method to be applied in management and distribution of properties after his death.The basic principle involved is that the property should be four generations old. The right to use and acquire property is accrued by persons through birth itself. The division of property is per stripes i.e. that share of one generation is calculated first than the share of successive generations is subdivided according to share of their predecessor. These basic elements are for governing majorly the Hindus.If A inherits property, whether movable or immovable, from his father or father’s father, or father’s father’sfather, it is ancestral property as regards his male issue. If A has no son, son’s son, or son’s son’s son in existence at the time when he inherits the property, he holds the property as absolute owner thereof, and he can deal with it as he pleases . A person inheriting property from his three immediate paternal ancestors holds it, and must hold it, in coparcenary with his sons, sons’ sons and sons’ sons’ sons but as regards other relations he holds it and is entitled to hold it, as his absolute property.”[1]Now answer to the question is that that will to ancestral property is not entirelyillegal. That means when a coparcener acquires his share in ancestral property than he can make a will to that share and bequest it. However will shall be executed after the death of the testator and if the coparcener before acquiring a share makes a will than that will be illegal. Share in ancestral property will be inherited by coparceners. So he can make a will to his share in ancestral property.As whatever he acquires is his share now and he can dispose his assets according to his wishes.Surender Kumar vs Dhani Ram CS (OS) No.1737/2012 decided on 18th January, 2016 Hon’ble Mr. J. Valmiki Mehta of Delhi High Court ruled-If a person dies after passing of theHindu Succession Act, 1956 and there is no HUF existing at the time of the death of such a person, inheritance of an immovable property of such a person by his successors-in-interest is no doubt inheritance of an ‘ancestral’ property but the inheritance is as a self acquired property in the hands of the successor and not as an HUF property although the successor(s) indeed inherits ‘ancestral’ property i.e. a property belonging to his paternal ancestor.=====================================================HINDU WOMENS PROPERTY…. HOW IT DEVOLVELSA hindu woman holds the property as an absolute owner and now she can dispose off the property as her own property. The concept of ancestral property does not apply to a property held by a hindu woman. Your maternal grandmother (naani) can will the property to anyone. However, if she dies intestate (without a will) then the property will devolve as per the rules of succession inHindu Succession Act, specifically, section 15. In that case, the property goes to the legal heirs of the woman on her father’s side if she received the property from her father’s side and to her husband’s side if she received the property from her husband side.HomeIndia newsDaughters born before 2005 have right in their fathers’ property, says Supreme CourtDaughters born before 2005 have right in their fathers’ property, says Supreme CourtIn a ruling that will ensure equality between men and women, the Supreme Court on Friday made it clear that women born before 2005 have equal right on ancestral property.In a ruling that will ensure equality between men and women, the Supreme Court on Friday made it clear that women born before 2005 have equal right on ancestral property.In a ruling that will ensure equality between men and women, the Supreme Court on Friday made it clear that women born before 2005 have equal right on ancestral property. The apex court stated that theHindu Succession Act2005 which gives equal rights to daughters on ancestral property, will be applied to all women including those born before the year.A bench of Justices AK Sikri and Ashok Bhushan said that the share in ancestral property could not be denied, to a woman, on the ground that she was born before the law was passed, and the law was applicable in all property disputes filed before 2005 and pending when the law was framed. The bench added that the amended law stipulated that a daughter would be a “coparcener” (one who shares equally in inheritance of an undivided property) since birth, and have the same rights and liabilities as a son.“The law relating to a joint Hindu family governed by the Mitakshara law has undergone unprecedented changes. The said changes have been brought forward to address the growing need to merit equal treatment to the nearest female relatives, namely daughters. These changes have been sought… on the touchstone of equality, thus seeking to remove the perceived disability and prejudice to which a daughter was subjected,” the bench was quoted as saying by TOI.Passing the order on a plea filed by two sisters seeking a share in their late father’s property, the court said that the law was amended to give women equal status with men in matters related to ancestral property. The two sisters approached the apex court after the trial court in 2007 dismissed their plea saying that they were not entitled to any share as they were born before 2005. The High Court also rejected their plea. Setting aside the High Court order, the Supreme Court said that the year of birth was not a criterion to decide whether a woman was covered under the amended law.In 2015, the Supreme Court had said that the 2005 amendment in Hindu law will not give property rights to a daughter if the father died before the amendment came into force. The court held that the amended provisions of the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, could not have retrospective effect despite it being a social legislation. The court said the father would have had to be alive on September 9, 2005, if the daughter were to become a co-sharer with her male siblings.=======================================================Consequence of Amendment made by Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 – rights & liabilities of a daughter memberDaughter shall be a Coparcener of Hindu Family Property.If a Hindu dies, the coparcener property shall be allotted to the daughter as is allotted to sons.If a female coparcener dies before partition, then children of such coparcener would eligible for allotment assuming a partition had taken place immediately before her demise.No recovery is made for ancestors dues from son, grandson, or great grandson by applying doctrine of pious obligation.A female member can also seek partition of the dwelling house where the family resides.A widow of a pre-deceased son even though remarried is now eligible for share in property as legal heir of the pre-deceased son of the family.A female can also dispose of her share in coparcenery property at her own will.Expenses incurred on Marriage of a Daughter by HUFEven daughter has become coparcener after Amendment ofHindu Succession Act, 1956, but marriage of daughter still an obligation of the Family under Hindu law.Thus, reasonable amount of gift given on her marriage should not objected by the male coparcener.Devolution of Interest in Co-parcenary PropertySection 6 as substituted by the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005.Section 6(1)provides that w.e.f. 06/09/2005, in a joint Hindu family governed by the Mitakshara law, the daughter of coparcener shall by birth become a coparcener in her own right in the same manner as the son. She shall have the same rights in the coparcenery property as she would have had if she had been a son and she shall be subject to the same liabilities in respect of the said coparcenary property as that of a sonSection 6(2)of the new post amendment section 6 provides that any property to which a female Hindu becomes entitled by virtue of sub section (1) shall be held by her with the incidents of coparcenary ownership. And property is capable of being disposed of by her by testamentary disposition.Section 6(3)provides that–    Where a Hindu dies after the commencement ofHindu Succession Act2005, his interest in the property of joint family, Shall devolve by testamentary of intestate succession.–    As the case may be, under this Act and not by survivorship, & the coparcenary property shall be deemed to have been divided as if a partition has taken place and, daughter is allotted the same share as son.The share of the pre-deceased son or a pre-deceased daughter, as they would have got had they been alive at the time of partition, shall be allotted to the surviving child of such pre-deceased son or of such pre­deceased daughter. [—- do — with the predeceased child of pre-deceased son or a pre-deceased daughter].Section 6(4)provides that no court shall recognize any right to proceed against a son, grandson, or great grandson for the recovery of any debt due from his father, grand father or great grand father.Explanation to Section 6(5) provides that partition for the purposes of this section means any partition made by execution of a deed of partition duly registered under the Registration Act, 1908 (16 of 1908) or partition effected by a decree of a court.Section 6(6)provides that nothing contained in this section shall apply to a partition, which has been effected before the [deleted].Class I heir–Son– Son of Predeceased son.– Son of Predeceased son of Prede­ceased son.– Widow– Widow of Predeceased son– Widow of Predeceased son of Predeceased son– Mother– Daughter– Son of Predeceased Daughter.– Daughter of Predeceased Daugh­ter.– Daughter of Predeceased Son– Daughter of Predeceased Son of Predeceased Son.– Son of Predeceased Daughter of Predeceased Daughter.– Daughter of Predeceased Daughter of Predeceased DaughterSection 8 in TheHindu Succession Act, 1956General rules of succession in the case of males.—The property of a male Hindu dying intestate shall devolve according to the provisions of this Chapter—(a) firstly, upon the heirs, being the relatives specified in class I of the Schedule;(b) secondly, if there is no heir of class I, then upon the heirs, being the relatives specified in class II of the Schedule;(c) thirdly, if there is no heir of any of the two classes, then upon the agnates of the deceased; and(d) lastly, if there is no agnate, then upon the cognates of the deceased.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, Bangalore6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar"

    "question": "Condition Gift Revocation",
    "answer": "Dear client,If the trust to which your grandfather gifted the property is not a registered trust, it may have implications on its legal standing and enforceability. However, I am not a lawyer, and the specific laws and regulations regarding unregistered trusts can vary depending on the jurisdiction.In general, a registered trust holds more legal weight and credibility compared to an unregistered trust. An unregistered trust may face challenges in asserting its rights and carrying out certain activities, especially if it involves property transactions or commercial use.In your case, if the unregistered trust is not willing to use the property as a function hall as you desire, it would be advisable to consult with a lawyer who specializes in property and trust law. They can review the specific details of the trust and the property ownership, and provide advice on the legal options available to you.The lawyer may assess whether the trust has the legal authority to use the property for commercial purposes or whether it is limited to certain specified purposes. They can also guide you on potential legal remedies, such as seeking an injunction or legal action to protect your rights and interests, or exploring options for resolving the dispute through negotiation or mediation.It's important to consult with a qualified legal professional who can provide advice based on the specific laws and regulations applicable in your jurisdiction and the details of your case. They will be able to assess the legal standing of the unregistered trust and provide guidance on the best course of action for you to pursue.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This provision may need to be reviewed by a lawyer to ensure it is enforceable in your jurisdiction.Insurance Requirement: Specify that the tenant must maintain adequate liability insurance coverage for their daycare operation and provide you with proof of insurance. This insurance should cover any accidents, injuries, or damages that may occur.Compliance with Regulations: Require the tenant to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and licensing requirements related to operating a daycare facility, including maintaining appropriate safety standards.Remember, it's crucial to consult with a legal professional to ensure that the clauses are suitable for your specific situation and comply with local laws.

Even if at all Writ Petition is filed, then the builder would certainly challenge the order in Hon'ble Supreme Court. Writ Petition cannot be filed against private entity. If your builder is getting some funding from government then only Writ Petition would be maintainable. Article 12 ofConstitution of Indiasays that \"The 'State' Includes the Government and Parliament of India and the Government and the Legislature of each of the States and all local and other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India.\" Therefore, Writ Petition can only be filed against State.In Sunil Batra v.

    "question": "Alimony",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard.In case of Rajnesh v. Neha & Anr, Hon'ble Supreme Court stated that there can be no straitjacket formula for fixing such a quantum. Stressing upon the importance of maintaining a careful and just balance between all relevant factors, the Court held that the maintenance amount awarded must be reasonable and realistic. It directed the Courts to take cognizance of the fact that maintenance awarded to the applicant should neither be so extravagant that it becomes oppressive and unbearable for the respondent, nor should it be so meagre that it drives the applicant to penury.In addition to the statutory guidance, the Court laid down the following indicative factors to be considered before determining the quantum of maintenance (a) the status of the parties; (b) reasonable needs of the wife and dependent children; (c) whether the applicant is educated and professionally qualified; (d) whether the applicant has any independent source of income; (e) whether the income is sufficient to enable the applicant to maintain the same standard of living as she was accustomed to in her matrimonial home; (f) whether the applicant was employed prior to her marriage; (g) whether she was working during the subsistence of the marriage; (h) whether the wife was required to sacrifice her employment opportunities for nurturing the family, child rearing, and looking after adult members of the family; (i) reasonable costs of litigation for a non-working wife.Apart from the aforesaid factors set out hereinabove, the Court laid down certain additional factors for determining the quantum of maintenance payable. These are inter alia as follows:Age and employment of parties;Duration of marriage;Maintenance of minor children; andSerious disability or ill health of a spouse, child /children from the marriage or dependent relative who require constant care and recurrent expenditure, would also be a relevant consideration while quantifying maintenance.The aforesaid factors are not exhaustive, and the concerned Court can exercise its discretion to consider any other factor/s, which may be necessary or relevant in the facts and circumstances of a particular case.Further, in case of Manokaran vs. M.Devaki where it was held that Grant of maintenance to the wife working and earning more that her husband is improper and the same cannot be said that the wife was not having sufficient independent income.She can demand alimony, however, depending on the facts and circumstances you mentioned it can be denied if defended properly. It can be claimed for child as well. Maintenance amount can be reduced if passed against him in appellate Courts since she is presently working and she will have to submit an affidavit in Court about her present financial status.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete facts.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "question": "Alimony",
    "answer": "Dear client,In general, alimony (also known as spousal support or maintenance) is typically determined based on various factors, including the income and financial resources of both parties, the length of the marriage, the standard of living during the marriage, and the needs of each spouse. Whether alimony would be awarded and the specific amount would depend on the specific laws and regulations of your jurisdiction, as well as the unique circumstances of the case.When it comes to child support, the primary concern is the best interests of the child. The financial resources and ability of both parents to contribute to the child's upbringing are taken into consideration. It's possible that the daughter-in-law could seek child support from your sister's son for the care and upbringing of their child.Given the complexity of your situation and the potential legal implications, it's highly recommended to seek professional legal advice. A family law attorney can help you understand your rights and options and guide you through the divorce process while considering the specific laws and regulations applicable to your jurisdiction.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Heir certificate/process to sell property in India",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. You know that as per Section 2(h) of Indian Succession Act, 1925 provides that Will means the legal declaration of the intention of a person with respect to his property, which he desires to take effect after his death Will has been defined in Corpus Juris Secundum as A ‘Will’ is the legal declaration of a man’s intention, which he wills to be performed after his death, or an instrument by which a person makes a disposition of his property to take effect after his death.You can apply for probate of Will initially. The word ‘Probate’ means to prove or validate something. It is a procedure for court approval of the Will as the valid and last Will of the deceased testator. According to the Indian Succession Act, 1925, “Probate of will, when granted establishes the will from the death of the testator, and renders valid all intermediate acts of the executor as such.”It means that when a Will is probated, it gets officially certified with a seal of the court and provides the authority to the executor to appropriately distribute the assets of deceased testator and also to pay off bills and creditors from that estate.The procedure for probating of will is divided into four simple stages:1. The first step involves making of application to the District Judge through a probate petition which must be duly signed and verified by or on behalf of the applicant. The probate petition should be in a prescribed format under Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.2. The second step is to send the application to the High Court, under whose jurisdiction property falls. Then a lawyer shall prepare the application, in some cases lower court can also accept the application.3. One needs to submit certain documents that can verify the genuineness of the will, death certificate and other documents. These will prove that the testator had free will.4. When the court receives the application, it verifies all the details. Then it invites the nearest kin of the deceased for claiming the probate. Finally, it showcases the invitation letter at prominent places for invitation of any objection. If after 30 days, the court files no objection, the issuance of the probate is complete.Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete documents.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "question": "Heir certificate/process to sell property in India",
    "answer": "If your father had written Will in USA which would include the properties left behind in the USA also then you can get the Will probated by a court of USA.A will can be executed anywhere without any restrictions subject to the due procedure of the law of the country.With reference to wills executed outside India, in respect of which a foreign probate has also been obtained, the requirement of Section 213(1) of the Indian Succession  Act , 1925, would be satisfied by obtaining under Section 228(1) of the Act an ancillary probate. Otherwise, the procedural requirement of the lex fori enacted under Section 213(1) of the Act may not be satisfied and if it is only with a view to enable parties claiming under a will executed outside India to make claims with reference to properties situated in India, the procedure under Section 228 of the Act has been prescribed.In India, Wills made in other jurisdiction are not automatically enforceable.Under the Act, an ancillary probate can be granted to authenticate a foreign will. A foreign will, once proved and deposited in a court of competent jurisdiction, or a properly authenticated copy of the will and letters of administration will be recognised by the Indian Courts. Otherwise, if the Court deems fit then it will take the evidence into account and will examine the petitioner upon oath to ensure the veracity of the will.An executor or legatee cannot claim their right under the will unless probate or letters of administration of the will are obtained.If the Will was written in India and if the properties are situated in a place other than Bombay or Madras or Calcutta, probate would not be necessary, but you can get the details of the family tree or surviving members of the family of deceased duly attested by a notary of that country, in order to succeed to the estates, based on which all the beneficiaries should apply jointly for mutation of the property to their name by enclosing the copy of the Will (probate of Will if already obtained).Once the property is mutated then all the shareholders can sell the property jointly by executing a joint sale deed in favor of the prospective buyer."

    "answer": "Dear client,A \"C summary\" report, also known as a closure report, is typically filed by the police when they conclude that a criminal case does not have enough evidence to proceed further. It means that the police have determined that the case does not require further investigation or prosecution.If the police have filed a closure report in your case, it indicates that they do not believe there is sufficient evidence to pursue criminal charges. However, this does not prevent you from pursuing your claim in a civil court.Regarding the possibility of the accused filing a counter FIR or a defamation suit against you, it's important to understand that anyone can file a complaint or lawsuit. However, the success of such a complaint or lawsuit depends on the merits of the case and the evidence presented.

This provision may need to be reviewed by a lawyer to ensure it is enforceable in your jurisdiction.Insurance Requirement: Specify that the tenant must maintain adequate liability insurance coverage for their daycare operation and provide you with proof of insurance. This insurance should cover any accidents, injuries, or damages that may occur.Compliance with Regulations: Require the tenant to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and licensing requirements related to operating a daycare facility, including maintaining appropriate safety standards.Remember, it's crucial to consult with a legal professional to ensure that the clauses are suitable for your specific situation and comply with local laws.

    "answer": "It is correct that lending of money is a civil wrong and non payment of loan amount is a civil dispute and as such no criminality is involved. You seem to not have been properly advised by your friends who had advised you to file police complaint undersection 420IPC of cheating. Always consult a competent lawyer. If there was cheating as per your version then how you can recover such money which you also claim to have been lended by you to your friend? Mere filing of police complaint or FIR does not amount to defamation. Nevertheless, sending of legal notice indicate and confirm civil dispute. You have good case. File suit for recovery.

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. Please understand that in case of Uma Shankar Gopalika Vs. State of Bihar and Another reported in (2005) 10 SCC 336 it was held by Hon'ble Supreme Court that it is a well-established principle of law that every breach of contract or every dispute under an agreement does not amount to the offence of cheating. It would amount to cheating only in those cases where there was any deception played at the very inception. To establish the offence of cheating, the accused should be shown to have had fraudulent or dishonest intention at the time of making promise or representation.However, if in your case you can prove anyhow through some documentary evidence that fraudulent or dishonest intention was there at the beginning of the transaction, then you can file a protest petition so as to challenge the c-summary report which you are entitled to. C-summary report is issued when the offence committed looks to be of civil nature.If the protest petition is accepted then the Magistrate takes cognizance of the matter under section 190 ofCode of Criminal Procedureand issues notice.Action can be taken against you if the other side press for it for defamation.

    "question": "Police closing the FIR with C Summary report. Any impact on me?",
    "answer": "Dear client,A \"C summary\" report, also known as a closure report, is typically filed by the police when they conclude that a criminal case does not have enough evidence to proceed further. It means that the police have determined that the case does not require further investigation or prosecution.If the police have filed a closure report in your case, it indicates that they do not believe there is sufficient evidence to pursue criminal charges. However, this does not prevent you from pursuing your claim in a civil court.Regarding the possibility of the accused filing a counter FIR or a defamation suit against you, it's important to understand that anyone can file a complaint or lawsuit. However, the success of such a complaint or lawsuit depends on the merits of the case and the evidence presented. If you have valid evidence to support your claim and have acted in good faith, it may help in defending against any potential counterclaims.To address your concerns, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer who specializes in criminal law and defamation cases. They will be able to review the specifics of your situation, assess the potential risks, and provide you with the most accurate legal advice based on the relevant laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.It's important to remember that the information provided here is general in nature and may not apply directly to your specific case.

    "answer": "Dear client,I am not a legal professional, but I can provide some general information that may be helpful. In this situation, it appears that there is an inconsistency in the father's name mentioned in the gift deed compared to the other documents related to the property. To rectify this discrepancy, it may be advisable for Ramesh Chand to consider executing a rectification deed.A rectification deed is a legal document used to correct errors or omissions in a previous deed or document. It can help in ensuring that the correct information is reflected in the property records. The specific requirements for executing a rectification deed, including the stamp duty charges, can vary depending on the jurisdiction and local laws. It is recommended to consult with a lawyer who specializes in property law to understand the exact process and applicable stamp duty charges in your specific location.Registering the property without rectifying the discrepancy in the father's name may pose potential issues in the future, as it could lead to complications in the title and ownership records. It is generally advisable to address any discrepancies or errors to maintain the accuracy and clarity of property documentation.To ensure that the property transaction is conducted smoothly and with legal certainty, it is recommended that both the buyer and seller consult with their respective legal representatives. They can review the specific details and provide guidance on the appropriate steps to take, including the execution of a rectification deed if necessary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It should be in the name of the society, and the account should be operated transparently and responsibly.Independence of the Committee: When forming the committee, it would be beneficial to draft clear guidelines or bylaws that outline its purpose, powers, and responsibilities. This will help ensure the committee's independence and minimize the need for frequent approval from the society association.Agreement and Responsibility: It is advisable to have a written agreement or memorandum of understanding among the committee members, clearly stating their responsibilities and obligations. This can include provisions for individual liability in case of any deviations or financial mismanagement.Project Timeline: As you mentioned that the tasks will take approximately three years to complete, it is essential to have a well-defined project timeline and periodically update the residents on the progress.Collaboration with Builder and Society Association: It is positive that the builder is supporting your initiative. It may also be beneficial to maintain open communication with the society association to avoid any conflicts or misunderstandings. Seek their cooperation and support, emphasizing that the goal is to enhance the society's amenities for the benefit of all residents.It's important to note that the specific legal requirements and procedures may vary depending on the laws and regulations applicable to your location. Therefore, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer who specializes in property law or cooperative housing society matters.

    "question": "Registered plot vs token money issue",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. As you know that once a home purchase deal is finalised between a buyer and a seller, a formal process is initiated to conclude it legally. This starts with the buyer paying the seller a small portion of the transaction value, to show his genuine intentions. This payment, in Indian real estate parlance, is commonly known as the ‘token amount’.There are bright chances of legal disputes in your situation. However, you can send a legal notice to the builder to comply with the terms you agreed upon and to claim compensation. Any of the parties cannot back off from settled terms of the contract. The courts have unqualified jurisdiction to award compensation in case of breach of contract, but the compensation must be reasonable. The aggrieved party is entitled to receive compensation from the defaulting party.All legal action can only be taken once notice has been served upon the entity or individual you wish to take to court. It is this process that legalises bringing a matter to court. The intimation sent is known as a legal draft. A legal notice is, therefore, a formal communication to a person or an entity, informing the other party of your intention to undertake legal proceedings against them.This notice, when sent, conveys your intention before the legal proceedings and thus, makes the party aware of your grievance. Many times, a legal notice served will bring the other party to heel, and the problem is often resolved out of court, well before it goes to trial, with fruitful discussions on both sides.However, if the other party is still unheeding the grievance, one can always start the court proceedings after the prescribed interval as stated by law. The bottom line is that legal notice can serve as a point of reference to embark upon negotiations between two parties and save both the time, effort, and money that is usually spent in court cases.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear client,Based on the information you provided, it appears that the builder may have engaged in fraudulent or unethical behavior by accepting token money for the same plot of land from another buyer before selling it to you. This raises concerns about the builder's actions and potentially indicates a breach of trust.In this situation, there could be potential legal disputes between you, the other buyer, and the builder. The specific legal remedies available to you may depend on the laws and regulations governing property transactions in your jurisdiction, as well as the terms and conditions of your agreement with the builder.Here are some precautionary steps you may consider taking:Gather and organize all relevant documents: Collect and secure all documents related to your transaction, such as the sales deed, payment receipts, correspondence with the builder, and any other supporting evidence. These documents will be important if legal action becomes necessary.Consult with a property lawyer: Seek advice from a qualified property lawyer in your jurisdiction who can review your documents, understand the specific laws that apply to your case, and provide you with legal guidance tailored to your situation.Communicate with the builder in writing: It's essential to maintain clear and documented communication with the builder. Send a written notice to the builder, clearly stating your position that you do not wish to sell the plot and reminding them of your legal rights as the registered owner.Consider filing a complaint: If you believe that the builder has engaged in fraudulent or unethical practices, you may consider filing a complaint with the appropriate regulatory authorities or consumer protection agencies in your jurisdiction. A legal professional can advise you on the best course of action in this regard.Explore negotiation or mediation: Depending on the circumstances, you may wish to explore the possibility of resolving the dispute through negotiation or mediation. This could involve discussions with the other buyer, the builder, or both, facilitated by a neutral third party. However, the feasibility of this option will depend on the willingness of all parties involved to engage in such a process.Remember, the information provided here is general in nature, and it's important to consult with a qualified property lawyer who can provide you with advice tailored to your specific situation. They will be able to assess the details of your case and guide you through the legal process, if necessary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "House broken without notice - by society and redevelopment builder",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. Hon'ble Supreme Court has elaborately dealt with this subject on several occasions and has issued comprehensive directions to deal such situations. It is to be followed in such cases by the municipal authorities and in case there is any violation of the said directions, the affected person is at liberty to take up the matter before courts.Better would be in your case to ask for interim direction of stay from Consumer Forum and legally speaking judges in Consumer Forum are aware of such tactics of builder and they usually pass the decision in favour of consumers. Even if at all Writ Petition is filed, then the builder would certainly challenge the order in Hon'ble Supreme Court. Writ Petition cannot be filed against private entity. If your builder is getting some funding from government then only Writ Petition would be maintainable. Article 12 ofConstitution of Indiasays that \"The 'State' Includes the Government and Parliament of India and the Government and the Legislature of each of the States and all local and other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India.\" Therefore, Writ Petition can only be filed against State.In Sunil Batra v. Delhi Administration, the Supreme Court held that the right to life included the right to lead a healthy life so as to enjoy all faculties of the human body in their prime conditions. It would even include the right to protection of a person's tradition, culture, heritage and all that gives meaning to a man's life. It includes the right to live in peace, to sleep in peace and the right to repose and health.My team can help you in drafting the petition and legal representation if required.

    "answer": "Dear client,If your flat is being demolished without any prior intimation or proper process being followed, it may be a violation of your rights as a flat owner. Here are some steps you can consider taking:Document the demolition: Take photographs and videos of the ongoing demolition to have evidence of the unauthorized action taken by the builder. This documentation will be important for any legal proceedings or complaints you may initiate.Contact the police: If you believe that the demolition is unlawful or unauthorized, you can consider filing a police complaint.

    "context": "Asked 2 years ago in Family Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Can I file and complete the mutual consent divorce while being in the USA?",
    "answer": "When both parties were in India & married in India according to any of the Indian forms of marriage then the dissolution of such a marriage should be done through the Indian Family Court of the competent jurisdiction where the marriage took place, where either of the parties usually reside, or where both parties last resided together.Who wish to take advantage of Indian laws and the legal system to avoid facing up to any foreign judicial system. Indian Marriage solemnized in India according to Indian matrimonial laws, then the Indian courts will have territorial jurisdiction to hear & decide matters relating to this marriage & the foreign court's decision may or may not be acceptable in India; hence, the best course is to get this marriage dissolved according to the Indian court's decree of divorce.Procedure in Mutual DivorceIn all, there are two court appearances in a mutual divorceFirst A joint petition signed by both parties is filed in court. Secondly, in the first motion, the statements of both parties are recorded and then signed on paper before the Honourable Court.Thirdly The 6 month period is given for reconciliation, (the honourable court gives a chance to the couple to change their mind)Fourthly, 6 months after the first motion or at the end of the reconciliation period if both parties still don't agree to come together. Then the parties may appear for the second motion for the final hearing.A divorce decree will be granted as the Honourable court may deem fit.Formalities to be complied with(a) A petition is to be presented jointly by the parties to the marriage.(b) The parties have been living separately for a period not less than one year. It is doubtful whether it was intended by the legislators that the parties have lived separately by mutual consent or by force of circumstances or situations.But it does not seem necessary for the court to go into that matter provided the condition of separate living under the same roof of the matrimonial home or in separate residence by the parties is satisfied. Unless the consent of any of the parties to such a petition is vitiated by coercion, fraud or undue influence, the court ought not to travel beyond the statutory condition of its jurisdiction.(c) The parties have failed for any reason whatsoever to live together. In other words, no reconciliation or adjustment is possible between them.(d) The parties have freely consented to the agreement of dissolution of marriage.(e) The parties are at liberty to withdraw the petition. It seems that the petition may be withdrawn even at the instance of one party in the course of six months from the date of presentation of the petition. But when a joint motion is taken by the parties after the lapse of six months but before the expiration of eighteen months from the date of presentation of the petition for making an inquiry, the unilateral right of a party to withdraw the petition appears to be barred. But in Sureshta Devi v Om Prakash it has been held that a party to a petition fordivorce by mutual consentcan unilaterally withdraw his or her consent.(f) The court must be satisfied as to the averments in the petition after making an inquiry and after hearing the parties which are initiated by a joint motion of the expiry of six months from the presentation of the petition. The expression \"after hearing the parties\" appearing in sub-section (2) of Section 28 of the Act does not require the presence of the parties before the court. Affidavit evidence is sufficient for this purpose by virtue of Section 40 of the Act which attracts the ­ Code of Civil Procedure 1908 and which provides in Order 19 for proof of any point by affidavits.In a mutual divorce, you choose an advocate and ask him to prepare a mutual divorce petition and send it to you through email. Signed the petition and sent it by courier after putting your signature on it and having it attested by a notary in the US. Ask your wife to put the signature in the same, and then he can file it before the family court at Ernakulam. After six months, the case will call, you may attend, and on the same day, the case will consider, your application and allow.If both parties are in US the same time you can also file divorce in US court .Generally amutual consent divorcegranted by foreign Court is considered as valid, legal and binding in Indian Courts by virtue of section 13 and 14 of Code of Civil Procedure and also on account of comity of Nations. Such decree of divorce granted by foreign Courts need not to be validated in Indian Courts. However, as a matter of abundant precaution, one can approach to the Indian Court for declaring that divorce is valid and binding.Ajay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

    "question": "Ways to Partition Co-ownership property between Brothers",
    "answer": "Dear client,While a partition suit is ongoing, it is generally advisable for co-owners to seek court permission before selling their share. Without court permission or without withdrawing the pending suit, selling their share may not be legally permissible.Sending a registered post to the registrar informing them about the attempted sale is a step to document the situation and raise awareness, but it may not automatically prevent the co-owners from selling their share.If the co-owners sell their share to a third party, and if that third party poses a threat or attempts to disturb your father's management of the property, it may be necessary to take legal action to protect your father's rights and interests. Your father may need to consult with a lawyer to explore available legal remedies.If your uncles are unwilling to sell their share to your father and insist on selling it to a third party, your father's options may be limited. However, he can consult with a lawyer to discuss the specifics of the case and explore any potential legal avenues or arguments that may be available to protect his interests.The rights and obligations of the parties involved, including your father's management of the property, would depend on the specific terms and conditions outlined in any existing agreements or court orders, as well as applicable property laws. A lawyer can provide advice on the rights and responsibilities of all parties involved and help protect your father's interests.To obtain an order of injunction to prevent your uncles from selling their share, your father would need to file a legal application in the court where the partition suit is pending. The application would need to outline the reasons and grounds for seeking the injunction. A lawyer can assist in preparing and filing the necessary application and presenting the case before the court.It is essential for your father to consult with an experienced lawyer who specializes in property and civil litigation. The lawyer can review the specific details of the case, provide tailored advice, and guide your father on the best course of action to protect his interests in the ongoing partition suit.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,After a case settles, the court might take some administrative steps. These may include drafting a final decree based on the terms of the settlement, ensuring all necessary documentation is in order, and recording the agreement officially. It's generally safe to get a vakalat from your current advocate and involve a new lawyer to obtain the final decree. However, to avoid any issues, it's crucial to clearly communicate with both the current and new lawyer about your intentions and ensure a smooth transition. Your previous advocate should not cause harm to the decree, but having a new lawyer involved can ensure the process moves forward smoothly. If your current advocate refuses to cooperate or provide the necessary documents, you have the right to engage a new lawyer to assist in obtaining the final decree. Your new lawyer can represent you in this matter without the need for the previous advocate's vakalatnama. The final decree might have been drafted or is in the process of being prepared by the court after the settlement. However, access to the draft decree might require specific procedures or permission from the court. Normally, once the stamp duty is paid, the final decree can be issued. In some cases, individuals can directly request copies of court orders or decrees by applying to the court clerk's office or the relevant court authority. This might involve formal procedures and potentially some fees, but it's usually possible to obtain copies of court documents, including the final decree, by following the correct protocol.

    "answer": "Dear client,In this situation, it seems that you and a group of residents are willing to form a separate committee to address the pending tasks and development work in the society. Here are some suggestions for better execution and a legal approach:Separate Bank Account: You can approach the society association and request permission to open a separate bank account specifically for collecting contributions towards the pending tasks. It should be in the name of the society, and the account should be operated transparently and responsibly.Independence of the Committee: When forming the committee, it would be beneficial to draft clear guidelines or bylaws that outline its purpose, powers, and responsibilities. This will help ensure the committee's independence and minimize the need for frequent approval from the society association.Agreement and Responsibility: It is advisable to have a written agreement or memorandum of understanding among the committee members, clearly stating their responsibilities and obligations. This can include provisions for individual liability in case of any deviations or financial mismanagement.Project Timeline: As you mentioned that the tasks will take approximately three years to complete, it is essential to have a well-defined project timeline and periodically update the residents on the progress.Collaboration with Builder and Society Association: It is positive that the builder is supporting your initiative. It may also be beneficial to maintain open communication with the society association to avoid any conflicts or misunderstandings. Seek their cooperation and support, emphasizing that the goal is to enhance the society's amenities for the benefit of all residents.It's important to note that the specific legal requirements and procedures may vary depending on the laws and regulations applicable to your location. Therefore, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer who specializes in property law or cooperative housing society matters. They will be able to review your specific situation, provide accurate advice, and assist you in ensuring that the necessary legal steps are followed.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. Please understand that in case of Uma Shankar Gopalika Vs. State of Bihar and Another reported in (2005) 10 SCC 336 it was held by Hon'ble Supreme Court that it is a well-established principle of law that every breach of contract or every dispute under an agreement does not amount to the offence of cheating. It would amount to cheating only in those cases where there was any deception played at the very inception. To establish the offence of cheating, the accused should be shown to have had fraudulent or dishonest intention at the time of making promise or representation.However, if in your case you can prove anyhow through some documentary evidence that fraudulent or dishonest intention was there at the beginning of the transaction, then you can file a protest petition so as to challenge the c-summary report which you are entitled to. C-summary report is issued when the offence committed looks to be of civil nature.If the protest petition is accepted then the Magistrate takes cognizance of the matter under section 190 ofCode of Criminal Procedureand issues notice.Action can be taken against you if the other side press for it for defamation.

    "question": "Police closing the FIR with C Summary report. Any impact on me?",
    "answer": "Dear client,A \"C summary\" report, also known as a closure report, is typically filed by the police when they conclude that a criminal case does not have enough evidence to proceed further. It means that the police have determined that the case does not require further investigation or prosecution.If the police have filed a closure report in your case, it indicates that they do not believe there is sufficient evidence to pursue criminal charges. However, this does not prevent you from pursuing your claim in a civil court.Regarding the possibility of the accused filing a counter FIR or a defamation suit against you, it's important to understand that anyone can file a complaint or lawsuit. However, the success of such a complaint or lawsuit depends on the merits of the case and the evidence presented. If you have valid evidence to support your claim and have acted in good faith, it may help in defending against any potential counterclaims.To address your concerns, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer who specializes in criminal law and defamation cases. They will be able to review the specifics of your situation, assess the potential risks, and provide you with the most accurate legal advice based on the relevant laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.It's important to remember that the information provided here is general in nature and may not apply directly to your specific case.

In this situation, it appears that there is an inconsistency in the father's name mentioned in the gift deed compared to the other documents related to the property. To rectify this discrepancy, it may be advisable for Ramesh Chand to consider executing a rectification deed.A rectification deed is a legal document used to correct errors or omissions in a previous deed or document.

The specific requirements for executing a rectification deed, including the stamp duty charges, can vary depending on the jurisdiction and local laws. It is recommended to consult with a lawyer who specializes in property law to understand the exact process and applicable stamp duty charges in your specific location.Registering the property without rectifying the discrepancy in the father's name may pose potential issues in the future, as it could lead to complications in the title and ownership records. It is generally advisable to address any discrepancies or errors to maintain the accuracy and clarity of property documentation.To ensure that the property transaction is conducted smoothly and with legal certainty, it is recommended that both the buyer and seller consult with their respective legal representatives.

    "question": "Registered plot vs token money issue",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. As you know that once a home purchase deal is finalised between a buyer and a seller, a formal process is initiated to conclude it legally. This starts with the buyer paying the seller a small portion of the transaction value, to show his genuine intentions. This payment, in Indian real estate parlance, is commonly known as the ‘token amount’.There are bright chances of legal disputes in your situation. However, you can send a legal notice to the builder to comply with the terms you agreed upon and to claim compensation. Any of the parties cannot back off from settled terms of the contract. The courts have unqualified jurisdiction to award compensation in case of breach of contract, but the compensation must be reasonable. The aggrieved party is entitled to receive compensation from the defaulting party.All legal action can only be taken once notice has been served upon the entity or individual you wish to take to court. It is this process that legalises bringing a matter to court. The intimation sent is known as a legal draft. A legal notice is, therefore, a formal communication to a person or an entity, informing the other party of your intention to undertake legal proceedings against them.This notice, when sent, conveys your intention before the legal proceedings and thus, makes the party aware of your grievance. Many times, a legal notice served will bring the other party to heel, and the problem is often resolved out of court, well before it goes to trial, with fruitful discussions on both sides.However, if the other party is still unheeding the grievance, one can always start the court proceedings after the prescribed interval as stated by law. The bottom line is that legal notice can serve as a point of reference to embark upon negotiations between two parties and save both the time, effort, and money that is usually spent in court cases.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "question": "Registered plot vs token money issue",
    "answer": "Dear client,Based on the information you provided, it appears that the builder may have engaged in fraudulent or unethical behavior by accepting token money for the same plot of land from another buyer before selling it to you. This raises concerns about the builder's actions and potentially indicates a breach of trust.In this situation, there could be potential legal disputes between you, the other buyer, and the builder. The specific legal remedies available to you may depend on the laws and regulations governing property transactions in your jurisdiction, as well as the terms and conditions of your agreement with the builder.Here are some precautionary steps you may consider taking:Gather and organize all relevant documents: Collect and secure all documents related to your transaction, such as the sales deed, payment receipts, correspondence with the builder, and any other supporting evidence. These documents will be important if legal action becomes necessary.Consult with a property lawyer: Seek advice from a qualified property lawyer in your jurisdiction who can review your documents, understand the specific laws that apply to your case, and provide you with legal guidance tailored to your situation.Communicate with the builder in writing: It's essential to maintain clear and documented communication with the builder. Send a written notice to the builder, clearly stating your position that you do not wish to sell the plot and reminding them of your legal rights as the registered owner.Consider filing a complaint: If you believe that the builder has engaged in fraudulent or unethical practices, you may consider filing a complaint with the appropriate regulatory authorities or consumer protection agencies in your jurisdiction. A legal professional can advise you on the best course of action in this regard.Explore negotiation or mediation: Depending on the circumstances, you may wish to explore the possibility of resolving the dispute through negotiation or mediation. This could involve discussions with the other buyer, the builder, or both, facilitated by a neutral third party. However, the feasibility of this option will depend on the willingness of all parties involved to engage in such a process.Remember, the information provided here is general in nature, and it's important to consult with a qualified property lawyer who can provide you with advice tailored to your specific situation. They will be able to assess the details of your case and guide you through the legal process, if necessary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can I file and complete the mutual consent divorce while being in the USA?",
    "answer": "When both parties were in India & married in India according to any of the Indian forms of marriage then the dissolution of such a marriage should be done through the Indian Family Court of the competent jurisdiction where the marriage took place, where either of the parties usually reside, or where both parties last resided together.Who wish to take advantage of Indian laws and the legal system to avoid facing up to any foreign judicial system. Indian Marriage solemnized in India according to Indian matrimonial laws, then the Indian courts will have territorial jurisdiction to hear & decide matters relating to this marriage & the foreign court's decision may or may not be acceptable in India; hence, the best course is to get this marriage dissolved according to the Indian court's decree of divorce.Procedure in Mutual DivorceIn all, there are two court appearances in a mutual divorceFirst A joint petition signed by both parties is filed in court. Secondly, in the first motion, the statements of both parties are recorded and then signed on paper before the Honourable Court.Thirdly The 6 month period is given for reconciliation, (the honourable court gives a chance to the couple to change their mind)Fourthly, 6 months after the first motion or at the end of the reconciliation period if both parties still don't agree to come together. Then the parties may appear for the second motion for the final hearing.A divorce decree will be granted as the Honourable court may deem fit.Formalities to be complied with(a) A petition is to be presented jointly by the parties to the marriage.(b) The parties have been living separately for a period not less than one year. It is doubtful whether it was intended by the legislators that the parties have lived separately by mutual consent or by force of circumstances or situations.But it does not seem necessary for the court to go into that matter provided the condition of separate living under the same roof of the matrimonial home or in separate residence by the parties is satisfied. Unless the consent of any of the parties to such a petition is vitiated by coercion, fraud or undue influence, the court ought not to travel beyond the statutory condition of its jurisdiction.(c) The parties have failed for any reason whatsoever to live together. In other words, no reconciliation or adjustment is possible between them.(d) The parties have freely consented to the agreement of dissolution of marriage.(e) The parties are at liberty to withdraw the petition. It seems that the petition may be withdrawn even at the instance of one party in the course of six months from the date of presentation of the petition. But when a joint motion is taken by the parties after the lapse of six months but before the expiration of eighteen months from the date of presentation of the petition for making an inquiry, the unilateral right of a party to withdraw the petition appears to be barred. But in Sureshta Devi v Om Prakash it has been held that a party to a petition fordivorce by mutual consentcan unilaterally withdraw his or her consent.(f) The court must be satisfied as to the averments in the petition after making an inquiry and after hearing the parties which are initiated by a joint motion of the expiry of six months from the presentation of the petition. The expression \"after hearing the parties\" appearing in sub-section (2) of Section 28 of the Act does not require the presence of the parties before the court. Affidavit evidence is sufficient for this purpose by virtue of Section 40 of the Act which attracts the ­ Code of Civil Procedure 1908 and which provides in Order 19 for proof of any point by affidavits.In a mutual divorce, you choose an advocate and ask him to prepare a mutual divorce petition and send it to you through email. Signed the petition and sent it by courier after putting your signature on it and having it attested by a notary in the US. Ask your wife to put the signature in the same, and then he can file it before the family court at Ernakulam. After six months, the case will call, you may attend, and on the same day, the case will consider, your application and allow.If both parties are in US the same time you can also file divorce in US court .Generally amutual consent divorcegranted by foreign Court is considered as valid, legal and binding in Indian Courts by virtue of section 13 and 14 of Code of Civil Procedure and also on account of comity of Nations. Such decree of divorce granted by foreign Courts need not to be validated in Indian Courts. However, as a matter of abundant precaution, one can approach to the Indian Court for declaring that divorce is valid and binding.Ajay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

This will help ensure the committee's independence and minimize the need for frequent approval from the society association.Agreement and Responsibility: It is advisable to have a written agreement or memorandum of understanding among the committee members, clearly stating their responsibilities and obligations. This can include provisions for individual liability in case of any deviations or financial mismanagement.Project Timeline: As you mentioned that the tasks will take approximately three years to complete, it is essential to have a well-defined project timeline and periodically update the residents on the progress.Collaboration with Builder and Society Association: It is positive that the builder is supporting your initiative. It may also be beneficial to maintain open communication with the society association to avoid any conflicts or misunderstandings. Seek their cooperation and support, emphasizing that the goal is to enhance the society's amenities for the benefit of all residents.It's important to note that the specific legal requirements and procedures may vary depending on the laws and regulations applicable to your location.

    "answer": "- As per Muslim Law, the right of inheritance of property comes only after the death of a person.- Further, any child born into a Muslim family does not get his right to property on his birth.- Further, distribution of property can be made in two ways, firstly per capita or per strip distribution.- Per – Capita distribution method is used in the Sunni law, and according to this method, the estate left over by the ancestors gets equally distributed among the heirs. Therefore, the share of each person depends on the number of heirs.- Per strip distribution method is used in the Shia law, and according to this method, the property gets distributed among the heirs according to the strip they belong to, and hence the quantum of their inheritance also depends upon the branch and the number of persons that belong to the branch.- Further, there is no distinction between the right of men and women; each has right over the said property.- However, a female will get half of the male share.- Hence, out of 100% share, share of step mother will be 12.5%. and the remaining 87.5% will be distributed between sons and daughters.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Distribution of property share among sister brother and mother as per Muslim rules",
    "answer": "Dear client,inheritance laws can vary depending on the specific interpretation and application of Islamic law in different jurisdictions. It is important to consult with a qualified lawyer who specializes in Islamic inheritance law to get accurate advice tailored to your specific situation.In Islamic law, the distribution of property among heirs is governed by the rules of inheritance outlined in the Quran. The shares of the heirs are determined based on specific rules and principles. Generally, the distribution of shares in the case of a deceased person leaving behind children and a spouse (including a stepmother) would be as follows:The surviving spouse is entitled to a share of the deceased's estate. The specific share depends on various factors, such as whether the deceased has children or parents. In some cases, the spouse may be entitled to 1/8th or 1/4th of the estate, but this can vary.The children, including both sons and daughters, are entitled to a share of the remaining estate. The shares of the children can vary depending on factors such as the presence of other heirs. In some cases, sons may receive double the share of daughters, but again, this can vary depending on the specific circumstances.It's important to note that the specific shares and distribution can be influenced by various factors, including the presence of other heirs, debts, and the specific laws of the jurisdiction you are in. Additionally, it's common for families to agree on alternative distribution arrangements through wills or mutual agreements.To ensure a fair and proper distribution of the estate among all the heirs, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer who specializes in Islamic inheritance law. They will be able to assess your specific situation, take into account the relevant laws and principles, and guide you through the process of distributing the property among all the heirs according to Islamic law and the laws of your jurisdiction.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Power of attorney for selling property with joint title",
    "answer": "Dear client,The cost and process of registering a Power of Attorney (PoA) can vary based on the location and the specific requirements of the authorities involved. Generally, when a PoA is executed in favor of a blood relative, the stamp duty and registration charges may be lower compared to when it is executed in favor of a non-blood relative. However, the exact charges and requirements can vary between different states in India. It is advisable to consult with a lawyer or visit the appropriate registrar office to get accurate information about the specific charges and process in the PCMC jurisdiction.If you choose the option for either of you to travel to India and execute separate PoAs, the process would involve drafting the PoA document, getting it notarized, and then registering it with the appropriate registrar office. The PoA can be registered in the city where the property is located (Pune in your case) or any other place in Maharashtra. The time required for registration can vary, but it is typically a matter of a few days to a couple of weeks. The registration process may involve submitting the necessary documents, paying the registration fees, and appearing before the registrar for the formalities. It is advisable to consult with a lawyer to understand the specific requirements and timeline for registering the PoA in your situation.If you both give a PoA to your respective fathers, it would be considered a valid arrangement within the blood relationship. The PoA documents can be prepared separately, with one PoA giving power to your father and another PoA giving power to your wife's father. It is important to clearly mention the scope of the power given, including the authority to sell the property. However, it is recommended to consult with a lawyer to ensure that the PoA documents are drafted correctly and comply with the relevant laws and requirements.Another option to consider is engaging the services of a trusted attorney or a reliable power of attorney agent in India who can act on your behalf for the sale of the property. This option may require careful selection and due diligence to ensure that the person or entity appointed as the power of attorney agent can represent your interests effectively.Regarding the validity of the PoA, it can vary based on the terms specified in the document. It is advisable to consult with a lawyer to ensure that the PoA is valid for the necessary duration and covers the period required for completing the property sale process.Please note that the information provided here is general in nature, and it's crucial to consult with a qualified attorney who can provide you with advice specific to your case. They will be able to review the details of your situation, consider the relevant laws and regulations, and guide you through the process of executing and registering the PoA and selling the property in India.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Registered plot vs token money issue",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. As you know that once a home purchase deal is finalised between a buyer and a seller, a formal process is initiated to conclude it legally. This starts with the buyer paying the seller a small portion of the transaction value, to show his genuine intentions. This payment, in Indian real estate parlance, is commonly known as the ‘token amount’.There are bright chances of legal disputes in your situation. However, you can send a legal notice to the builder to comply with the terms you agreed upon and to claim compensation. Any of the parties cannot back off from settled terms of the contract. The courts have unqualified jurisdiction to award compensation in case of breach of contract, but the compensation must be reasonable. The aggrieved party is entitled to receive compensation from the defaulting party.All legal action can only be taken once notice has been served upon the entity or individual you wish to take to court. It is this process that legalises bringing a matter to court. The intimation sent is known as a legal draft. A legal notice is, therefore, a formal communication to a person or an entity, informing the other party of your intention to undertake legal proceedings against them.This notice, when sent, conveys your intention before the legal proceedings and thus, makes the party aware of your grievance. Many times, a legal notice served will bring the other party to heel, and the problem is often resolved out of court, well before it goes to trial, with fruitful discussions on both sides.However, if the other party is still unheeding the grievance, one can always start the court proceedings after the prescribed interval as stated by law. The bottom line is that legal notice can serve as a point of reference to embark upon negotiations between two parties and save both the time, effort, and money that is usually spent in court cases.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear client,Based on the information you provided, it appears that the builder may have engaged in fraudulent or unethical behavior by accepting token money for the same plot of land from another buyer before selling it to you. This raises concerns about the builder's actions and potentially indicates a breach of trust.In this situation, there could be potential legal disputes between you, the other buyer, and the builder. The specific legal remedies available to you may depend on the laws and regulations governing property transactions in your jurisdiction, as well as the terms and conditions of your agreement with the builder.Here are some precautionary steps you may consider taking:Gather and organize all relevant documents: Collect and secure all documents related to your transaction, such as the sales deed, payment receipts, correspondence with the builder, and any other supporting evidence. These documents will be important if legal action becomes necessary.Consult with a property lawyer: Seek advice from a qualified property lawyer in your jurisdiction who can review your documents, understand the specific laws that apply to your case, and provide you with legal guidance tailored to your situation.Communicate with the builder in writing: It's essential to maintain clear and documented communication with the builder. Send a written notice to the builder, clearly stating your position that you do not wish to sell the plot and reminding them of your legal rights as the registered owner.Consider filing a complaint: If you believe that the builder has engaged in fraudulent or unethical practices, you may consider filing a complaint with the appropriate regulatory authorities or consumer protection agencies in your jurisdiction. A legal professional can advise you on the best course of action in this regard.Explore negotiation or mediation: Depending on the circumstances, you may wish to explore the possibility of resolving the dispute through negotiation or mediation. This could involve discussions with the other buyer, the builder, or both, facilitated by a neutral third party. However, the feasibility of this option will depend on the willingness of all parties involved to engage in such a process.Remember, the information provided here is general in nature, and it's important to consult with a qualified property lawyer who can provide you with advice tailored to your specific situation.

If both suits involve the same cause of action and the same parties, the second suit may be stayed or consolidated with the first suit under Section 10 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC). You should discuss this matter with your lawyer, who can file the appropriate application to the court to request the stay of the second suit.The granting of a temporary injunction depends on various factors, including the merits of the case and the balance of convenience. If the other party can prove that there is a possibility of irreparable harm or loss if the injunction is not granted, they may be successful in obtaining temporary injunction relief. However, your lawyer will be in a better position to assess the strength of their argument and provide guidance on how to respond effectively.Possession can be established in various ways, and it is not always necessary for someone to be physically staying inside the house. However, having someone present at the property, even as a watchman or caretaker, can help demonstrate that you are in possession and taking steps to protect your property. You should discuss the best approach with your lawyer, taking into account the specific circumstances and risks involved.Blocking the front gate with a car may provide an additional physical barrier, but it's important to consider the legal implications and potential consequences. Blocking the gate could be seen as an obstruction, and it may not be advisable without proper legal authorization.

    "answer": "In general, when dealing with a criminal case, it's important to consider the potential consequences of any agreements or statements made to the police or other parties involved. If you agree to a settlement with the new buyers and provide a written statement indicating that you will withdraw the 156(3) case, it may have implications for your ability to pursue a criminal case in the future.By agreeing to a settlement, you may be effectively acknowledging that a resolution has been reached, and it could be difficult to later argue for the registration of an FIR if the new buyers fail to fulfill their part of the agreement. It may weaken your position in claiming that a criminal offense has taken place.Before making any decisions or providing any written statements, it is highly recommended to consult with your lawyer. They can review the specifics of your case, the proposed settlement, and provide advice on the potential consequences and risks involved. They can also guide you on how to protect your interests and ensure that your rights are safeguarded throughout the legal process.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Yes, but criminal case should be filed before you join the proceeding in pending case and not after joining the proceeding.

    "answer": "First set of queries:The presumption of summons being served may vary depending on the specific rules and procedures followed by the civil court in your jurisdiction. It's best to consult with your lawyer regarding this matter to understand the local rules and how they apply to your case.Again, the treatment of court vacation in relation to the filing of a written statement can depend on local rules and procedures. Typically, court vacations are excluded from the calculation of time limits. It's essential to consult with your lawyer to understand the specific rules applicable to your case.If you have already requested the relief of permanent injunction in your own suit, it may not be necessary to file a counterclaim for the same relief in their suit. Your lawyer can guide you on whether it's appropriate to include it as a counterclaim or if it should be pursued solely in your own suit.Whether to ask for consolidation of the suits or file a rejection of plaint application is a strategic decision that should be discussed with your lawyer. They will be familiar with the specific circumstances of your case and can advise you on the best course of action.Falsely stating facts in a suit can be a serious matter, but the decision to initiate a criminal case would depend on the specific laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. It's advisable to consult with your lawyer and possibly involve the police or appropriate authorities if there is evidence of fraudulent statements.Second set of queries:Once the FIR is lodged, it would be best to consult with your lawyer regarding the appropriate course of action. They can guide you on whether to inform the magistrate or file an application to withdraw the 156(3) application.The contents of the FIR should ideally include all relevant details and allegations. If you have suspicions or additional information that you believe is relevant, it's generally advisable to include them in your statement. Your lawyer can provide more specific guidance based on the laws and practices in your jurisdiction.Contacting the IO to provide your statement or inquire about the progress of the investigation may be a reasonable step. However, it's important to follow the guidance of your lawyer, who can advise you on the best way to proceed in your specific case.The status of arrests and the appropriate follow-up procedures can vary depending on the laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. Your lawyer would be the best person to guide you on the appropriate actions and who can provide updates on the progress of the case.Third set of queries:If you withdraw the 156(3) application after the FIR is registered, it may be possible to file a subsequent 156(3) application if you are dissatisfied with the police investigation. However, the availability and maintainability of such an application would depend on the specific laws and procedures in your jurisdiction.

    "question": "Can part payment of cheque and DD be accepted during Sale",
    "answer": "Dear client,Accepting payment in the form of cheques and demand drafts (DDs) is a common practice in real estate transactions. However, it's important to ensure that you follow the applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.Regarding the acceptance of 70 lakhs in cheque and DD, it seems permissible based on the clause you provided from the Agreement to Sale (ATS). The ATS states that the balance payment can be made by D.D/ CHEQUE/RTGS.In such cases, it is generally advisable to follow these steps:Deposit the cheque into your bank account and ensure that it is cleared before proceeding with the transaction. This helps ensure that the funds are available and reduces the risk of bounced or dishonored cheques.Verify the authenticity and validity of the demand draft before accepting it. Ensure that it is issued by a reputable bank and contains accurate information.Retain records of the cheque deposit, clearance, and the demand draft for your reference and documentation purposes.To be certain about the legal requirements and procedures specific to your jurisdiction, it's important to consult with a qualified legal professional who specializes in real estate law. They will be able to review the terms of the agreement, provide guidance on accepting payments, and ensure compliance with local laws and regulations.Note that real estate laws and regulations can vary depending on your jurisdiction, so it's essential to seek specific legal advice tailored to your situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Hon'ble Supreme Court has elaborately dealt with this subject on several occasions and has issued comprehensive directions to deal such situations. It is to be followed in such cases by the municipal authorities and in case there is any violation of the said directions, the affected person is at liberty to take up the matter before courts.Better would be in your case to ask for interim direction of stay from Consumer Forum and legally speaking judges in Consumer Forum are aware of such tactics of builder and they usually pass the decision in favour of consumers. Even if at all Writ Petition is filed, then the builder would certainly challenge the order in Hon'ble Supreme Court. Writ Petition cannot be filed against private entity. If your builder is getting some funding from government then only Writ Petition would be maintainable. Article 12 ofConstitution of Indiasays that \"The 'State' Includes the Government and Parliament of India and the Government and the Legislature of each of the States and all local and other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India.\" Therefore, Writ Petition can only be filed against State.In Sunil Batra v. Delhi Administration, the Supreme Court held that the right to life included the right to lead a healthy life so as to enjoy all faculties of the human body in their prime conditions. It would even include the right to protection of a person's tradition, culture, heritage and all that gives meaning to a man's life. It includes the right to live in peace, to sleep in peace and the right to repose and health.My team can help you in drafting the petition and legal representation if required.

    "question": "Can I file and complete the mutual consent divorce while being in the USA?",
    "answer": "When both parties were in India & married in India according to any of the Indian forms of marriage then the dissolution of such a marriage should be done through the Indian Family Court of the competent jurisdiction where the marriage took place, where either of the parties usually reside, or where both parties last resided together.Who wish to take advantage of Indian laws and the legal system to avoid facing up to any foreign judicial system. Indian Marriage solemnized in India according to Indian matrimonial laws, then the Indian courts will have territorial jurisdiction to hear & decide matters relating to this marriage & the foreign court's decision may or may not be acceptable in India; hence, the best course is to get this marriage dissolved according to the Indian court's decree of divorce.Procedure in Mutual DivorceIn all, there are two court appearances in a mutual divorceFirst A joint petition signed by both parties is filed in court. Secondly, in the first motion, the statements of both parties are recorded and then signed on paper before the Honourable Court.Thirdly The 6 month period is given for reconciliation, (the honourable court gives a chance to the couple to change their mind)Fourthly, 6 months after the first motion or at the end of the reconciliation period if both parties still don't agree to come together. Then the parties may appear for the second motion for the final hearing.A divorce decree will be granted as the Honourable court may deem fit.Formalities to be complied with(a) A petition is to be presented jointly by the parties to the marriage.(b) The parties have been living separately for a period not less than one year. It is doubtful whether it was intended by the legislators that the parties have lived separately by mutual consent or by force of circumstances or situations.But it does not seem necessary for the court to go into that matter provided the condition of separate living under the same roof of the matrimonial home or in separate residence by the parties is satisfied. Unless the consent of any of the parties to such a petition is vitiated by coercion, fraud or undue influence, the court ought not to travel beyond the statutory condition of its jurisdiction.(c) The parties have failed for any reason whatsoever to live together. In other words, no reconciliation or adjustment is possible between them.(d) The parties have freely consented to the agreement of dissolution of marriage.(e) The parties are at liberty to withdraw the petition. It seems that the petition may be withdrawn even at the instance of one party in the course of six months from the date of presentation of the petition. But when a joint motion is taken by the parties after the lapse of six months but before the expiration of eighteen months from the date of presentation of the petition for making an inquiry, the unilateral right of a party to withdraw the petition appears to be barred. But in Sureshta Devi v Om Prakash it has been held that a party to a petition fordivorce by mutual consentcan unilaterally withdraw his or her consent.(f) The court must be satisfied as to the averments in the petition after making an inquiry and after hearing the parties which are initiated by a joint motion of the expiry of six months from the presentation of the petition. The expression \"after hearing the parties\" appearing in sub-section (2) of Section 28 of the Act does not require the presence of the parties before the court. Affidavit evidence is sufficient for this purpose by virtue of Section 40 of the Act which attracts the ­ Code of Civil Procedure 1908 and which provides in Order 19 for proof of any point by affidavits.In a mutual divorce, you choose an advocate and ask him to prepare a mutual divorce petition and send it to you through email. Signed the petition and sent it by courier after putting your signature on it and having it attested by a notary in the US. Ask your wife to put the signature in the same, and then he can file it before the family court at Ernakulam. After six months, the case will call, you may attend, and on the same day, the case will consider, your application and allow.If both parties are in US the same time you can also file divorce in US court .Generally amutual consent divorcegranted by foreign Court is considered as valid, legal and binding in Indian Courts by virtue of section 13 and 14 of Code of Civil Procedure and also on account of comity of Nations. Such decree of divorce granted by foreign Courts need not to be validated in Indian Courts. However, as a matter of abundant precaution, one can approach to the Indian Court for declaring that divorce is valid and binding.Ajay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

    "question": "Distribution of property share among sister brother and mother as per Muslim rules",
    "answer": "- As per Muslim Law, the right of inheritance of property comes only after the death of a person.- Further, any child born into a Muslim family does not get his right to property on his birth.- Further, distribution of property can be made in two ways, firstly per capita or per strip distribution.- Per – Capita distribution method is used in the Sunni law, and according to this method, the estate left over by the ancestors gets equally distributed among the heirs. Therefore, the share of each person depends on the number of heirs.- Per strip distribution method is used in the Shia law, and according to this method, the property gets distributed among the heirs according to the strip they belong to, and hence the quantum of their inheritance also depends upon the branch and the number of persons that belong to the branch.- Further, there is no distinction between the right of men and women; each has right over the said property.- However, a female will get half of the male share.- Hence, out of 100% share, share of step mother will be 12.5%. and the remaining 87.5% will be distributed between sons and daughters.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Distribution of property share among sister brother and mother as per Muslim rules",
    "answer": "Dear client,inheritance laws can vary depending on the specific interpretation and application of Islamic law in different jurisdictions. It is important to consult with a qualified lawyer who specializes in Islamic inheritance law to get accurate advice tailored to your specific situation.In Islamic law, the distribution of property among heirs is governed by the rules of inheritance outlined in the Quran. The shares of the heirs are determined based on specific rules and principles. Generally, the distribution of shares in the case of a deceased person leaving behind children and a spouse (including a stepmother) would be as follows:The surviving spouse is entitled to a share of the deceased's estate. The specific share depends on various factors, such as whether the deceased has children or parents. In some cases, the spouse may be entitled to 1/8th or 1/4th of the estate, but this can vary.The children, including both sons and daughters, are entitled to a share of the remaining estate. The shares of the children can vary depending on factors such as the presence of other heirs. In some cases, sons may receive double the share of daughters, but again, this can vary depending on the specific circumstances.It's important to note that the specific shares and distribution can be influenced by various factors, including the presence of other heirs, debts, and the specific laws of the jurisdiction you are in. Additionally, it's common for families to agree on alternative distribution arrangements through wills or mutual agreements.To ensure a fair and proper distribution of the estate among all the heirs, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer who specializes in Islamic inheritance law. They will be able to assess your specific situation, take into account the relevant laws and principles, and guide you through the process of distributing the property among all the heirs according to Islamic law and the laws of your jurisdiction.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If both suits involve the same cause of action and the same parties, the second suit may be stayed or consolidated with the first suit under Section 10 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC). You should discuss this matter with your lawyer, who can file the appropriate application to the court to request the stay of the second suit.The granting of a temporary injunction depends on various factors, including the merits of the case and the balance of convenience. If the other party can prove that there is a possibility of irreparable harm or loss if the injunction is not granted, they may be successful in obtaining temporary injunction relief. However, your lawyer will be in a better position to assess the strength of their argument and provide guidance on how to respond effectively.Possession can be established in various ways, and it is not always necessary for someone to be physically staying inside the house. However, having someone present at the property, even as a watchman or caretaker, can help demonstrate that you are in possession and taking steps to protect your property. You should discuss the best approach with your lawyer, taking into account the specific circumstances and risks involved.Blocking the front gate with a car may provide an additional physical barrier, but it's important to consider the legal implications and potential consequences. Blocking the gate could be seen as an obstruction, and it may not be advisable without proper legal authorization.

    "answer": "In general, when dealing with a criminal case, it's important to consider the potential consequences of any agreements or statements made to the police or other parties involved. If you agree to a settlement with the new buyers and provide a written statement indicating that you will withdraw the 156(3) case, it may have implications for your ability to pursue a criminal case in the future.By agreeing to a settlement, you may be effectively acknowledging that a resolution has been reached, and it could be difficult to later argue for the registration of an FIR if the new buyers fail to fulfill their part of the agreement. It may weaken your position in claiming that a criminal offense has taken place.Before making any decisions or providing any written statements, it is highly recommended to consult with your lawyer. They can review the specifics of your case, the proposed settlement, and provide advice on the potential consequences and risks involved.

    "answer": "First set of queries:The presumption of summons being served may vary depending on the specific rules and procedures followed by the civil court in your jurisdiction. It's best to consult with your lawyer regarding this matter to understand the local rules and how they apply to your case.Again, the treatment of court vacation in relation to the filing of a written statement can depend on local rules and procedures. Typically, court vacations are excluded from the calculation of time limits. It's essential to consult with your lawyer to understand the specific rules applicable to your case.If you have already requested the relief of permanent injunction in your own suit, it may not be necessary to file a counterclaim for the same relief in their suit. Your lawyer can guide you on whether it's appropriate to include it as a counterclaim or if it should be pursued solely in your own suit.Whether to ask for consolidation of the suits or file a rejection of plaint application is a strategic decision that should be discussed with your lawyer. They will be familiar with the specific circumstances of your case and can advise you on the best course of action.Falsely stating facts in a suit can be a serious matter, but the decision to initiate a criminal case would depend on the specific laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. It's advisable to consult with your lawyer and possibly involve the police or appropriate authorities if there is evidence of fraudulent statements.Second set of queries:Once the FIR is lodged, it would be best to consult with your lawyer regarding the appropriate course of action. They can guide you on whether to inform the magistrate or file an application to withdraw the 156(3) application.The contents of the FIR should ideally include all relevant details and allegations. If you have suspicions or additional information that you believe is relevant, it's generally advisable to include them in your statement. Your lawyer can provide more specific guidance based on the laws and practices in your jurisdiction.Contacting the IO to provide your statement or inquire about the progress of the investigation may be a reasonable step. However, it's important to follow the guidance of your lawyer, who can advise you on the best way to proceed in your specific case.The status of arrests and the appropriate follow-up procedures can vary depending on the laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. Your lawyer would be the best person to guide you on the appropriate actions and who can provide updates on the progress of the case.Third set of queries:If you withdraw the 156(3) application after the FIR is registered, it may be possible to file a subsequent 156(3) application if you are dissatisfied with the police investigation. However, the availability and maintainability of such an application would depend on the specific laws and procedures in your jurisdiction.

    "question": "Registered plot vs token money issue",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. As you know that once a home purchase deal is finalised between a buyer and a seller, a formal process is initiated to conclude it legally. This starts with the buyer paying the seller a small portion of the transaction value, to show his genuine intentions. This payment, in Indian real estate parlance, is commonly known as the ‘token amount’.There are bright chances of legal disputes in your situation. However, you can send a legal notice to the builder to comply with the terms you agreed upon and to claim compensation. Any of the parties cannot back off from settled terms of the contract. The courts have unqualified jurisdiction to award compensation in case of breach of contract, but the compensation must be reasonable. The aggrieved party is entitled to receive compensation from the defaulting party.All legal action can only be taken once notice has been served upon the entity or individual you wish to take to court. It is this process that legalises bringing a matter to court. The intimation sent is known as a legal draft. A legal notice is, therefore, a formal communication to a person or an entity, informing the other party of your intention to undertake legal proceedings against them.This notice, when sent, conveys your intention before the legal proceedings and thus, makes the party aware of your grievance. Many times, a legal notice served will bring the other party to heel, and the problem is often resolved out of court, well before it goes to trial, with fruitful discussions on both sides.However, if the other party is still unheeding the grievance, one can always start the court proceedings after the prescribed interval as stated by law. The bottom line is that legal notice can serve as a point of reference to embark upon negotiations between two parties and save both the time, effort, and money that is usually spent in court cases.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear client,Based on the information you provided, it appears that the builder may have engaged in fraudulent or unethical behavior by accepting token money for the same plot of land from another buyer before selling it to you. This raises concerns about the builder's actions and potentially indicates a breach of trust.In this situation, there could be potential legal disputes between you, the other buyer, and the builder. The specific legal remedies available to you may depend on the laws and regulations governing property transactions in your jurisdiction, as well as the terms and conditions of your agreement with the builder.Here are some precautionary steps you may consider taking:Gather and organize all relevant documents: Collect and secure all documents related to your transaction, such as the sales deed, payment receipts, correspondence with the builder, and any other supporting evidence. These documents will be important if legal action becomes necessary.Consult with a property lawyer: Seek advice from a qualified property lawyer in your jurisdiction who can review your documents, understand the specific laws that apply to your case, and provide you with legal guidance tailored to your situation.Communicate with the builder in writing: It's essential to maintain clear and documented communication with the builder. Send a written notice to the builder, clearly stating your position that you do not wish to sell the plot and reminding them of your legal rights as the registered owner.Consider filing a complaint: If you believe that the builder has engaged in fraudulent or unethical practices, you may consider filing a complaint with the appropriate regulatory authorities or consumer protection agencies in your jurisdiction. A legal professional can advise you on the best course of action in this regard.Explore negotiation or mediation: Depending on the circumstances, you may wish to explore the possibility of resolving the dispute through negotiation or mediation. This could involve discussions with the other buyer, the builder, or both, facilitated by a neutral third party. However, the feasibility of this option will depend on the willingness of all parties involved to engage in such a process.Remember, the information provided here is general in nature, and it's important to consult with a qualified property lawyer who can provide you with advice tailored to your specific situation. They will be able to assess the details of your case and guide you through the legal process, if necessary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,It is generally not permissible to file multiple suits on the same cause of action. If both suits involve the same cause of action and the same parties, the second suit may be stayed or consolidated with the first suit under Section 10 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC). You should discuss this matter with your lawyer, who can file the appropriate application to the court to request the stay of the second suit.The granting of a temporary injunction depends on various factors, including the merits of the case and the balance of convenience. If the other party can prove that there is a possibility of irreparable harm or loss if the injunction is not granted, they may be successful in obtaining temporary injunction relief. However, your lawyer will be in a better position to assess the strength of their argument and provide guidance on how to respond effectively.Possession can be established in various ways, and it is not always necessary for someone to be physically staying inside the house. However, having someone present at the property, even as a watchman or caretaker, can help demonstrate that you are in possession and taking steps to protect your property. You should discuss the best approach with your lawyer, taking into account the specific circumstances and risks involved.Blocking the front gate with a car may provide an additional physical barrier, but it's important to consider the legal implications and potential consequences. Blocking the gate could be seen as an obstruction, and it may not be advisable without proper legal authorization. It's best to consult with your lawyer to explore legal ways to protect your property.Remember, the information provided here is general in nature, and it's crucial to consult with a qualified property lawyer who can provide you with advice specific to your case.

    "question": "Protecting possession in case of fraudulent sale deed",
    "answer": "In general, when dealing with a criminal case, it's important to consider the potential consequences of any agreements or statements made to the police or other parties involved. If you agree to a settlement with the new buyers and provide a written statement indicating that you will withdraw the 156(3) case, it may have implications for your ability to pursue a criminal case in the future.By agreeing to a settlement, you may be effectively acknowledging that a resolution has been reached, and it could be difficult to later argue for the registration of an FIR if the new buyers fail to fulfill their part of the agreement. It may weaken your position in claiming that a criminal offense has taken place.Before making any decisions or providing any written statements, it is highly recommended to consult with your lawyer. They can review the specifics of your case, the proposed settlement, and provide advice on the potential consequences and risks involved. They can also guide you on how to protect your interests and ensure that your rights are safeguarded throughout the legal process.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "First set of queries:The presumption of summons being served may vary depending on the specific rules and procedures followed by the civil court in your jurisdiction. It's best to consult with your lawyer regarding this matter to understand the local rules and how they apply to your case.Again, the treatment of court vacation in relation to the filing of a written statement can depend on local rules and procedures. Typically, court vacations are excluded from the calculation of time limits. It's essential to consult with your lawyer to understand the specific rules applicable to your case.If you have already requested the relief of permanent injunction in your own suit, it may not be necessary to file a counterclaim for the same relief in their suit. Your lawyer can guide you on whether it's appropriate to include it as a counterclaim or if it should be pursued solely in your own suit.Whether to ask for consolidation of the suits or file a rejection of plaint application is a strategic decision that should be discussed with your lawyer. They will be familiar with the specific circumstances of your case and can advise you on the best course of action.Falsely stating facts in a suit can be a serious matter, but the decision to initiate a criminal case would depend on the specific laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. It's advisable to consult with your lawyer and possibly involve the police or appropriate authorities if there is evidence of fraudulent statements.Second set of queries:Once the FIR is lodged, it would be best to consult with your lawyer regarding the appropriate course of action. They can guide you on whether to inform the magistrate or file an application to withdraw the 156(3) application.The contents of the FIR should ideally include all relevant details and allegations. If you have suspicions or additional information that you believe is relevant, it's generally advisable to include them in your statement. Your lawyer can provide more specific guidance based on the laws and practices in your jurisdiction.Contacting the IO to provide your statement or inquire about the progress of the investigation may be a reasonable step. However, it's important to follow the guidance of your lawyer, who can advise you on the best way to proceed in your specific case.The status of arrests and the appropriate follow-up procedures can vary depending on the laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. Your lawyer would be the best person to guide you on the appropriate actions and who can provide updates on the progress of the case.Third set of queries:If you withdraw the 156(3) application after the FIR is registered, it may be possible to file a subsequent 156(3) application if you are dissatisfied with the police investigation. However, the availability and maintainability of such an application would depend on the specific laws and procedures in your jurisdiction.

    "question": "Distribution of property share among sister brother and mother as per Muslim rules",
    "answer": "- As per Muslim Law, the right of inheritance of property comes only after the death of a person.- Further, any child born into a Muslim family does not get his right to property on his birth.- Further, distribution of property can be made in two ways, firstly per capita or per strip distribution.- Per – Capita distribution method is used in the Sunni law, and according to this method, the estate left over by the ancestors gets equally distributed among the heirs. Therefore, the share of each person depends on the number of heirs.- Per strip distribution method is used in the Shia law, and according to this method, the property gets distributed among the heirs according to the strip they belong to, and hence the quantum of their inheritance also depends upon the branch and the number of persons that belong to the branch.- Further, there is no distinction between the right of men and women; each has right over the said property.- However, a female will get half of the male share.- Hence, out of 100% share, share of step mother will be 12.5%. and the remaining 87.5% will be distributed between sons and daughters.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Distribution of property share among sister brother and mother as per Muslim rules",
    "answer": "Dear client,inheritance laws can vary depending on the specific interpretation and application of Islamic law in different jurisdictions. It is important to consult with a qualified lawyer who specializes in Islamic inheritance law to get accurate advice tailored to your specific situation.In Islamic law, the distribution of property among heirs is governed by the rules of inheritance outlined in the Quran. The shares of the heirs are determined based on specific rules and principles. Generally, the distribution of shares in the case of a deceased person leaving behind children and a spouse (including a stepmother) would be as follows:The surviving spouse is entitled to a share of the deceased's estate. The specific share depends on various factors, such as whether the deceased has children or parents. In some cases, the spouse may be entitled to 1/8th or 1/4th of the estate, but this can vary.The children, including both sons and daughters, are entitled to a share of the remaining estate. The shares of the children can vary depending on factors such as the presence of other heirs. In some cases, sons may receive double the share of daughters, but again, this can vary depending on the specific circumstances.It's important to note that the specific shares and distribution can be influenced by various factors, including the presence of other heirs, debts, and the specific laws of the jurisdiction you are in. Additionally, it's common for families to agree on alternative distribution arrangements through wills or mutual agreements.To ensure a fair and proper distribution of the estate among all the heirs, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer who specializes in Islamic inheritance law. They will be able to assess your specific situation, take into account the relevant laws and principles, and guide you through the process of distributing the property among all the heirs according to Islamic law and the laws of your jurisdiction.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can I file and complete the mutual consent divorce while being in the USA?",
    "answer": "When both parties were in India & married in India according to any of the Indian forms of marriage then the dissolution of such a marriage should be done through the Indian Family Court of the competent jurisdiction where the marriage took place, where either of the parties usually reside, or where both parties last resided together.Who wish to take advantage of Indian laws and the legal system to avoid facing up to any foreign judicial system. Indian Marriage solemnized in India according to Indian matrimonial laws, then the Indian courts will have territorial jurisdiction to hear & decide matters relating to this marriage & the foreign court's decision may or may not be acceptable in India; hence, the best course is to get this marriage dissolved according to the Indian court's decree of divorce.Procedure in Mutual DivorceIn all, there are two court appearances in a mutual divorceFirst A joint petition signed by both parties is filed in court. Secondly, in the first motion, the statements of both parties are recorded and then signed on paper before the Honourable Court.Thirdly The 6 month period is given for reconciliation, (the honourable court gives a chance to the couple to change their mind)Fourthly, 6 months after the first motion or at the end of the reconciliation period if both parties still don't agree to come together. Then the parties may appear for the second motion for the final hearing.A divorce decree will be granted as the Honourable court may deem fit.Formalities to be complied with(a) A petition is to be presented jointly by the parties to the marriage.(b) The parties have been living separately for a period not less than one year. It is doubtful whether it was intended by the legislators that the parties have lived separately by mutual consent or by force of circumstances or situations.But it does not seem necessary for the court to go into that matter provided the condition of separate living under the same roof of the matrimonial home or in separate residence by the parties is satisfied. Unless the consent of any of the parties to such a petition is vitiated by coercion, fraud or undue influence, the court ought not to travel beyond the statutory condition of its jurisdiction.(c) The parties have failed for any reason whatsoever to live together. In other words, no reconciliation or adjustment is possible between them.(d) The parties have freely consented to the agreement of dissolution of marriage.(e) The parties are at liberty to withdraw the petition. It seems that the petition may be withdrawn even at the instance of one party in the course of six months from the date of presentation of the petition. But when a joint motion is taken by the parties after the lapse of six months but before the expiration of eighteen months from the date of presentation of the petition for making an inquiry, the unilateral right of a party to withdraw the petition appears to be barred. But in Sureshta Devi v Om Prakash it has been held that a party to a petition fordivorce by mutual consentcan unilaterally withdraw his or her consent.(f) The court must be satisfied as to the averments in the petition after making an inquiry and after hearing the parties which are initiated by a joint motion of the expiry of six months from the presentation of the petition. The expression \"after hearing the parties\" appearing in sub-section (2) of Section 28 of the Act does not require the presence of the parties before the court.

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. As you know that once a home purchase deal is finalised between a buyer and a seller, a formal process is initiated to conclude it legally. This starts with the buyer paying the seller a small portion of the transaction value, to show his genuine intentions. This payment, in Indian real estate parlance, is commonly known as the ‘token amount’.There are bright chances of legal disputes in your situation. However, you can send a legal notice to the builder to comply with the terms you agreed upon and to claim compensation. Any of the parties cannot back off from settled terms of the contract. The courts have unqualified jurisdiction to award compensation in case of breach of contract, but the compensation must be reasonable. The aggrieved party is entitled to receive compensation from the defaulting party.All legal action can only be taken once notice has been served upon the entity or individual you wish to take to court. It is this process that legalises bringing a matter to court. The intimation sent is known as a legal draft. A legal notice is, therefore, a formal communication to a person or an entity, informing the other party of your intention to undertake legal proceedings against them.This notice, when sent, conveys your intention before the legal proceedings and thus, makes the party aware of your grievance. Many times, a legal notice served will bring the other party to heel, and the problem is often resolved out of court, well before it goes to trial, with fruitful discussions on both sides.However, if the other party is still unheeding the grievance, one can always start the court proceedings after the prescribed interval as stated by law. The bottom line is that legal notice can serve as a point of reference to embark upon negotiations between two parties and save both the time, effort, and money that is usually spent in court cases.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear client,Based on the information you provided, it appears that the builder may have engaged in fraudulent or unethical behavior by accepting token money for the same plot of land from another buyer before selling it to you. This raises concerns about the builder's actions and potentially indicates a breach of trust.In this situation, there could be potential legal disputes between you, the other buyer, and the builder. The specific legal remedies available to you may depend on the laws and regulations governing property transactions in your jurisdiction, as well as the terms and conditions of your agreement with the builder.Here are some precautionary steps you may consider taking:Gather and organize all relevant documents: Collect and secure all documents related to your transaction, such as the sales deed, payment receipts, correspondence with the builder, and any other supporting evidence. These documents will be important if legal action becomes necessary.Consult with a property lawyer: Seek advice from a qualified property lawyer in your jurisdiction who can review your documents, understand the specific laws that apply to your case, and provide you with legal guidance tailored to your situation.Communicate with the builder in writing: It's essential to maintain clear and documented communication with the builder. Send a written notice to the builder, clearly stating your position that you do not wish to sell the plot and reminding them of your legal rights as the registered owner.Consider filing a complaint: If you believe that the builder has engaged in fraudulent or unethical practices, you may consider filing a complaint with the appropriate regulatory authorities or consumer protection agencies in your jurisdiction. A legal professional can advise you on the best course of action in this regard.Explore negotiation or mediation: Depending on the circumstances, you may wish to explore the possibility of resolving the dispute through negotiation or mediation. This could involve discussions with the other buyer, the builder, or both, facilitated by a neutral third party. However, the feasibility of this option will depend on the willingness of all parties involved to engage in such a process.Remember, the information provided here is general in nature, and it's important to consult with a qualified property lawyer who can provide you with advice tailored to your specific situation.

    "question": "Distribution of property share among sister brother and mother as per Muslim rules",
    "answer": "- As per Muslim Law, the right of inheritance of property comes only after the death of a person.- Further, any child born into a Muslim family does not get his right to property on his birth.- Further, distribution of property can be made in two ways, firstly per capita or per strip distribution.- Per – Capita distribution method is used in the Sunni law, and according to this method, the estate left over by the ancestors gets equally distributed among the heirs. Therefore, the share of each person depends on the number of heirs.- Per strip distribution method is used in the Shia law, and according to this method, the property gets distributed among the heirs according to the strip they belong to, and hence the quantum of their inheritance also depends upon the branch and the number of persons that belong to the branch.- Further, there is no distinction between the right of men and women; each has right over the said property.- However, a female will get half of the male share.- Hence, out of 100% share, share of step mother will be 12.5%. and the remaining 87.5% will be distributed between sons and daughters.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Distribution of property share among sister brother and mother as per Muslim rules",
    "answer": "Dear client,inheritance laws can vary depending on the specific interpretation and application of Islamic law in different jurisdictions. It is important to consult with a qualified lawyer who specializes in Islamic inheritance law to get accurate advice tailored to your specific situation.In Islamic law, the distribution of property among heirs is governed by the rules of inheritance outlined in the Quran. The shares of the heirs are determined based on specific rules and principles. Generally, the distribution of shares in the case of a deceased person leaving behind children and a spouse (including a stepmother) would be as follows:The surviving spouse is entitled to a share of the deceased's estate. The specific share depends on various factors, such as whether the deceased has children or parents. In some cases, the spouse may be entitled to 1/8th or 1/4th of the estate, but this can vary.The children, including both sons and daughters, are entitled to a share of the remaining estate. The shares of the children can vary depending on factors such as the presence of other heirs. In some cases, sons may receive double the share of daughters, but again, this can vary depending on the specific circumstances.It's important to note that the specific shares and distribution can be influenced by various factors, including the presence of other heirs, debts, and the specific laws of the jurisdiction you are in. Additionally, it's common for families to agree on alternative distribution arrangements through wills or mutual agreements.To ensure a fair and proper distribution of the estate among all the heirs, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer who specializes in Islamic inheritance law. They will be able to assess your specific situation, take into account the relevant laws and principles, and guide you through the process of distributing the property among all the heirs according to Islamic law and the laws of your jurisdiction.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,The cost and process of registering a Power of Attorney (PoA) can vary based on the location and the specific requirements of the authorities involved. Generally, when a PoA is executed in favor of a blood relative, the stamp duty and registration charges may be lower compared to when it is executed in favor of a non-blood relative. However, the exact charges and requirements can vary between different states in India. It is advisable to consult with a lawyer or visit the appropriate registrar office to get accurate information about the specific charges and process in the PCMC jurisdiction.If you choose the option for either of you to travel to India and execute separate PoAs, the process would involve drafting the PoA document, getting it notarized, and then registering it with the appropriate registrar office. The PoA can be registered in the city where the property is located (Pune in your case) or any other place in Maharashtra. The time required for registration can vary, but it is typically a matter of a few days to a couple of weeks. The registration process may involve submitting the necessary documents, paying the registration fees, and appearing before the registrar for the formalities. It is advisable to consult with a lawyer to understand the specific requirements and timeline for registering the PoA in your situation.If you both give a PoA to your respective fathers, it would be considered a valid arrangement within the blood relationship. The PoA documents can be prepared separately, with one PoA giving power to your father and another PoA giving power to your wife's father. It is important to clearly mention the scope of the power given, including the authority to sell the property. However, it is recommended to consult with a lawyer to ensure that the PoA documents are drafted correctly and comply with the relevant laws and requirements.Another option to consider is engaging the services of a trusted attorney or a reliable power of attorney agent in India who can act on your behalf for the sale of the property. This option may require careful selection and due diligence to ensure that the person or entity appointed as the power of attorney agent can represent your interests effectively.Regarding the validity of the PoA, it can vary based on the terms specified in the document. It is advisable to consult with a lawyer to ensure that the PoA is valid for the necessary duration and covers the period required for completing the property sale process.Please note that the information provided here is general in nature, and it's crucial to consult with a qualified attorney who can provide you with advice specific to your case. They will be able to review the details of your situation, consider the relevant laws and regulations, and guide you through the process of executing and registering the PoA and selling the property in India.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Limitation in execution proceeding in 125 CrPC",
    "answer": "The proceeding for enforcement of the order under Section 128, therefore, cannot be assailed on the ground that the same would be barred by limitation as provided under the proviso to Section 125(3) of the Code.It may, therefore, be deduced that the scope of Section 125(3) and 128 of the Code being different and the first proviso to Section 125(3) creating an interdict only on issuance of warrant for recovery under Section 125(3), the said period of limitation of one year cannot be held to create a fetter on the right to claim enforcement under Section 128.One of the main issues that came up for the court’s consideration was whether the limitation prescribed under the proviso to Section 125(3) doesn’t create any bar on claiming arrears of maintenance or it limit the entitlement.Limitation of one year and section 128:“Section125(3) of the code would have to be held to be confined to the section which precedes it.”Section 128 of the Code provides for enforcement of the order of maintenance against the person against whom the order of maintenance has been made. The enforcement of the order of maintenance under Section 128 can only be made upon the liability being satisfied by making actual payment of the amount of maintenance, which is due. The entitlement to claim enforcement of the order of maintenance under Section 128 by seeking discharge of the liability as per terms of the order of maintenance granted under Section 125, therefore cannot be held to be extinguished in terms of the one year limitation prescribed under the first proviso to Section 125(3).T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

Having considered the said provision of the Code we do not find that the same creates a bar or in any way affects the entitlement of a claimant to arrears of maintenance. What the proviso contemplates is that the procedure for recovery maintenance under Section 125(3), namely, by construing the same to be a levy of a fine and the detention of the defaulter in custody would not be available to a claimant who had slept over his/her rights and has not approached the court within a period of one year commencing from the date on which the entitlement to receive maintenance has accrued.

    "question": "Can part payment of cheque and DD be accepted during Sale",
    "answer": "Dear client,Accepting payment in the form of cheques and demand drafts (DDs) is a common practice in real estate transactions. However, it's important to ensure that you follow the applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.Regarding the acceptance of 70 lakhs in cheque and DD, it seems permissible based on the clause you provided from the Agreement to Sale (ATS). The ATS states that the balance payment can be made by D.D/ CHEQUE/RTGS.In such cases, it is generally advisable to follow these steps:Deposit the cheque into your bank account and ensure that it is cleared before proceeding with the transaction. This helps ensure that the funds are available and reduces the risk of bounced or dishonored cheques.Verify the authenticity and validity of the demand draft before accepting it. Ensure that it is issued by a reputable bank and contains accurate information.Retain records of the cheque deposit, clearance, and the demand draft for your reference and documentation purposes.To be certain about the legal requirements and procedures specific to your jurisdiction, it's important to consult with a qualified legal professional who specializes in real estate law. They will be able to review the terms of the agreement, provide guidance on accepting payments, and ensure compliance with local laws and regulations.Note that real estate laws and regulations can vary depending on your jurisdiction, so it's essential to seek specific legal advice tailored to your situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. Hon'ble Supreme Court has elaborately dealt with this subject on several occasions and has issued comprehensive directions to deal such situations. It is to be followed in such cases by the municipal authorities and in case there is any violation of the said directions, the affected person is at liberty to take up the matter before courts.Better would be in your case to ask for interim direction of stay from Consumer Forum and legally speaking judges in Consumer Forum are aware of such tactics of builder and they usually pass the decision in favour of consumers. Even if at all Writ Petition is filed, then the builder would certainly challenge the order in Hon'ble Supreme Court. Writ Petition cannot be filed against private entity. If your builder is getting some funding from government then only Writ Petition would be maintainable. Article 12 ofConstitution of Indiasays that \"The 'State' Includes the Government and Parliament of India and the Government and the Legislature of each of the States and all local and other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India.\" Therefore, Writ Petition can only be filed against State.In Sunil Batra v. Delhi Administration, the Supreme Court held that the right to life included the right to lead a healthy life so as to enjoy all faculties of the human body in their prime conditions. It would even include the right to protection of a person's tradition, culture, heritage and all that gives meaning to a man's life. It includes the right to live in peace, to sleep in peace and the right to repose and health.My team can help you in drafting the petition and legal representation if required.

    "answer": "Dear client,If your flat is being demolished without any prior intimation or proper process being followed, it may be a violation of your rights as a flat owner. Here are some steps you can consider taking:Document the demolition: Take photographs and videos of the ongoing demolition to have evidence of the unauthorized action taken by the builder. This documentation will be important for any legal proceedings or complaints you may initiate.Contact the police: If you believe that the demolition is unlawful or unauthorized, you can consider filing a police complaint.

    "answer": "The proceeding for enforcement of the order under Section 128, therefore, cannot be assailed on the ground that the same would be barred by limitation as provided under the proviso to Section 125(3) of the Code.It may, therefore, be deduced that the scope of Section 125(3) and 128 of the Code being different and the first proviso to Section 125(3) creating an interdict only on issuance of warrant for recovery under Section 125(3), the said period of limitation of one year cannot be held to create a fetter on the right to claim enforcement under Section 128.One of the main issues that came up for the court’s consideration was whether the limitation prescribed under the proviso to Section 125(3) doesn’t create any bar on claiming arrears of maintenance or it limit the entitlement.Limitation of one year and section 128:“Section125(3) of the code would have to be held to be confined to the section which precedes it.”Section 128 of the Code provides for enforcement of the order of maintenance against the person against whom the order of maintenance has been made. The enforcement of the order of maintenance under Section 128 can only be made upon the liability being satisfied by making actual payment of the amount of maintenance, which is due. The entitlement to claim enforcement of the order of maintenance under Section 128 by seeking discharge of the liability as per terms of the order of maintenance granted under Section 125, therefore cannot be held to be extinguished in terms of the one year limitation prescribed under the first proviso to Section 125(3).T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

Having considered the said provision of the Code we do not find that the same creates a bar or in any way affects the entitlement of a claimant to arrears of maintenance. What the proviso contemplates is that the procedure for recovery maintenance under Section 125(3), namely, by construing the same to be a levy of a fine and the detention of the defaulter in custody would not be available to a claimant who had slept over his/her rights and has not approached the court within a period of one year commencing from the date on which the entitlement to receive maintenance has accrued.

It should outline the terms and conditions agreed upon, including any provisions regarding maintenance dues and responsibilities. If the verbal agreement to have the seller pay the maintenance dues is not documented in the sale agreement, it may be challenging to enforce.Consult a real estate attorney: Seek legal advice from a real estate attorney who can review the relevant documents, including the sale agreement and the society's bylaws. They will be able to provide guidance on the legal options available to you and help determine the best course of action.Negotiate with the seller: Try to communicate and negotiate with the seller to find a mutually acceptable solution. If there was a verbal agreement between you and the seller, you may consider seeking mediation or alternative dispute resolution to resolve the issue.Engage the society: Discuss the situation with the society's management committee or office bearers. Provide them with all the relevant documentation and seek clarification on their policies and procedures for maintenance dues. They may be able to provide guidance or assistance in resolving the matter.Remember, the specific laws and regulations governing maintenance dues and obligations may vary depending on your jurisdiction and the rules of the society or homeowners association. It's crucial to consult with a qualified attorney who can provide advice based on the applicable laws and your specific circumstances.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can part payment of cheque and DD be accepted during Sale",
    "answer": "Dear client,Accepting payment in the form of cheques and demand drafts (DDs) is a common practice in real estate transactions. However, it's important to ensure that you follow the applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.Regarding the acceptance of 70 lakhs in cheque and DD, it seems permissible based on the clause you provided from the Agreement to Sale (ATS). The ATS states that the balance payment can be made by D.D/ CHEQUE/RTGS.In such cases, it is generally advisable to follow these steps:Deposit the cheque into your bank account and ensure that it is cleared before proceeding with the transaction. This helps ensure that the funds are available and reduces the risk of bounced or dishonored cheques.Verify the authenticity and validity of the demand draft before accepting it. Ensure that it is issued by a reputable bank and contains accurate information.Retain records of the cheque deposit, clearance, and the demand draft for your reference and documentation purposes.To be certain about the legal requirements and procedures specific to your jurisdiction, it's important to consult with a qualified legal professional who specializes in real estate law. They will be able to review the terms of the agreement, provide guidance on accepting payments, and ensure compliance with local laws and regulations.Note that real estate laws and regulations can vary depending on your jurisdiction, so it's essential to seek specific legal advice tailored to your situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Refund of fees and NOC from advocate",
    "answer": "The practice for asking for a NOC is arbitrary under Article 22(1) of theConstitution of India. (It guarantees every person the right to consult and be defended by any legal practitioner of their choice.)A litigant must be free to change their advocate in case they are not able to pay the fees.party to a litigation has an absolute right to appoint an advocate of his choice, to terminate his services, and to appoint a new advocate. Hence, a party cannot be compelled to obtain 'no objection' from the advocate already on record. Insisting for 'no objection' from the previous advocate will amount to putting a restriction on the right of a party to appoint an advocate of his choice.Recently Karnataka high court has observed and held that .if the Advocate feels that he has any genuine claim or grievance against his client, the appropriate course is to return the brief with endorsement of no objection and agitate such right in an appropriate forum, in accordance with law and not indulge in arm twisting methods by holding on to the brief.\"It was  also held that :There is nothing known as irrevocable vakalatnama. The right of a party to withdraw vakalatnama or authorization given to an advocate is absolute. Hence, a party may discharge his advocate any time, with or without cause by withdrawing his vakalatnama or authorization. On discharging the advocate, the party has the right to have the case file returned to him from the advocate, and any refusal by the advocate to return the fileamounts to misconduct under Section 35 of the Advocates Act, 1961. In any proceeding, including civil and criminal, a party has an absolute right to appoint a new Advocate. Under no circumstance, a party can be denied of his right to appoint a new advocate of his choice. Therefore, it follows that any rule or law imposing restriction on the said right can't be construed as mandatory. Accordingly, Courts, Tribunals or otherauthorities shall not ask for 'no objection' of the advocate already on record, to accept the vakalatnama filed by a new advocate.under no circumstance, a party can be denied of his right to appoint a new advocate of his choice hence you can proceed through a new advocate.You can demand at least half of the huge fee paid by you, if he or she is refusing you may give a complaint against the advocate in the bar council of Karnataka.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear client,If your lawyer has not acted according to your expectations, you have the right to seek a change of lawyer. The NOC is not a necessary document to change your lawyer. You can change your lawyer at any point in time by giving a written notice to your existing lawyer. However, it is advisable to obtain a NOC from the lawyer to avoid any future disputes.Regarding the refund of fees, you should first check the terms of the agreement that you signed with the lawyer. If the agreement provides for a refund of fees in case the lawyer fails to perform his duties, then you can demand a refund of fees. If there is no such clause in the agreement, you can negotiate with the lawyer and try to settle the matter amicably. If the lawyer still refuses to refund your fees, you can file a complaint with the Bar Council of Karnataka.It is important to note that the delay in correcting the scrutiny defects by your lawyer could have affected the outcome of your case. Therefore, it is important to find a good and reliable lawyer who can handle your case efficiently.

Alternatively, you may also try contacting a bail bondsman or surety agency in Bangalore to help you with this.If you are unable to find sureties in Bangalore or are facing difficulty in arranging for them, you may also request the court for an exemption from the requirement of sureties or ask for a relaxation in the amount of bond and sureties required.

    "question": "P.O. is on O.D.",
    "answer": "Dear client,The phrase \"IA 787 of 22 is dismissed\" refers to an interlocutory application (IA) filed in a divorce proceeding. In this case, IA 787, which was filed in the year 2022, has been dismissed by the court.An interlocutory application is a request or motion filed by one party during the course of a legal proceeding, seeking a specific order or direction from the court. It is a procedural step taken within the larger legal case.When an IA is dismissed, it means that the court has rejected the application and the relief sought by the party filing it. The court may have found the application to be without merit or not supported by sufficient evidence, or it may have determined that the relief requested is not appropriate in the given circumstances.The dismissal of an IA does not necessarily determine the final outcome of the overall divorce proceeding. It simply means that the specific application has been denied. The divorce case may still continue, and other issues and applications can be addressed separately.It is advisable to consult with your legal counsel or the concerned court for further clarification and to understand the impact of the dismissal on your particular case. They will be able to provide you with specific guidance and advice based on the details of your divorce proceedings.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can part payment of cheque and DD be accepted during Sale",
    "answer": "Dear client,Accepting payment in the form of cheques and demand drafts (DDs) is a common practice in real estate transactions. However, it's important to ensure that you follow the applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.Regarding the acceptance of 70 lakhs in cheque and DD, it seems permissible based on the clause you provided from the Agreement to Sale (ATS). The ATS states that the balance payment can be made by D.D/ CHEQUE/RTGS.In such cases, it is generally advisable to follow these steps:Deposit the cheque into your bank account and ensure that it is cleared before proceeding with the transaction. This helps ensure that the funds are available and reduces the risk of bounced or dishonored cheques.Verify the authenticity and validity of the demand draft before accepting it. Ensure that it is issued by a reputable bank and contains accurate information.Retain records of the cheque deposit, clearance, and the demand draft for your reference and documentation purposes.To be certain about the legal requirements and procedures specific to your jurisdiction, it's important to consult with a qualified legal professional who specializes in real estate law. They will be able to review the terms of the agreement, provide guidance on accepting payments, and ensure compliance with local laws and regulations.Note that real estate laws and regulations can vary depending on your jurisdiction, so it's essential to seek specific legal advice tailored to your situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The enforcement of the order of maintenance under Section 128 can only be made upon the liability being satisfied by making actual payment of the amount of maintenance, which is due. The entitlement to claim enforcement of the order of maintenance under Section 128 by seeking discharge of the liability as per terms of the order of maintenance granted under Section 125, therefore cannot be held to be extinguished in terms of the one year limitation prescribed under the first proviso to Section 125(3).T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

Having considered the said provision of the Code we do not find that the same creates a bar or in any way affects the entitlement of a claimant to arrears of maintenance.

    "answer": "Dear client,In cases of maintenance orders issued under Section 125 of theCode of Criminal Procedure(CrPC), the limitation period for the recovery of arrears may vary depending on the jurisdiction and the specific laws applicable in your case. It's important to consult with a qualified lawyer who can provide you with accurate advice based on the laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.In general, the limitation period for the recovery of arrears in maintenance cases is often longer than one year. The maintenance order itself does not become time-barred after one year, but rather the arrears may become subject to certain time limitations.However, it's important to note that the specific facts and circumstances of your case, as well as the relevant laws and court decisions, can affect the application of the limitation period. Therefore, it is crucial to consult with a lawyer who can review the specific details of your case and provide you with accurate advice based on the applicable laws in your jurisdiction.Additionally, it's important to comply with court orders and attend court hearings to present your defense and arguments regarding the ad interim maintenance order and any subsequent applications. Your lawyer can guide you on the appropriate legal steps to take in order to address the pending maintenance amount and present your defense effectively.Please consult with a qualified lawyer to obtain precise advice based on the facts and circumstances of your case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,To proceed with the resignation procedure in your situation, you can follow these steps:Communicate your resignation: Notify the remaining LLP director(s) and other relevant parties, in writing, about your decision to resign as a director of the LLP. Clearly state your intention to disassociate yourself from the LLP and its operations.Check the LLP Agreement: Review the LLP Agreement to understand the provisions related to resignation and appointment of directors. If the agreement has not been signed or filed on the MCA portal, it may be easier to proceed with the resignation process.Resignation documentation: Prepare a formal resignation letter stating your intent to resign as a director of the LLP. Include the effective date of resignation. Sign the letter digitally, if possible, or scan a physical copy and send it to the other director(s) via email.Update records with the Registrar of Companies (RoC): As the LLP agreement has not been filed on the MCA portal, it may not be necessary to file any specific form for your resignation. However, you should inform the remaining LLP director(s) to update the LLP records with the RoC and remove your name as a director from the LLP. They may need to file the necessary forms, such as Form LLP-3 (for appointment, cessation, or change in designation of partners), to reflect the changes in the LLP.Update other authorities: Notify other relevant authorities, such as the tax authorities, banks, and any other government departments, about your resignation and provide them with the updated LLP details, removing your name as a director.It is strongly advised to consult with a professional, such as a qualified chartered accountant or company secretary, who can guide you through the specific requirements and procedures based on the laws and regulations applicable in your jurisdiction.Please note that this is general information and should not be considered as legal advice.

    "question": "Cancellation of gift deed",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,Cancelling a Gift:Section 126 provides two modes of revocation of Gift:-Revocation by mutual agreement:- A gift may be revoked upon the happening of an event which is not dependent on the donor where the donor and donee may agree. The revocation must be in express form and not of a wish or desire.Revocation by rescission:- The gift is a transfer of ownership without any exchange of money or any consideration which is made voluntarily. So, where there is no free consent of the parties, the gift can be revoked or if it is obtained by coercion, undue influence or fraud then the gift is voidable.CASE“S. Sarojini Amma v. Velayudhan Pillai Sreekumar2018 SCC OnLine SC 2200”“In this case, the Supreme Court observed that there was no completed gift of the property which is in question to the respondent by the appellant and the appellant had right in cancelling the deed.”Conclusion:TheTransfer of Property Act, 1882 lays down provisions relating to gift deed and cancellation of the gift deed. Any person who is the real owner of the property can transfer his or her property to anyone by way of gift. A gift deed actually says that any person who is the owner of the property can transfer the property to another person without any consideration. Similarly, there are provisions for cancellation of the gift deed as well.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, Bangalore6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar"

    "answer": "Dear client,Accepting payment in the form of cheques and demand drafts (DDs) is a common practice in real estate transactions. However, it's important to ensure that you follow the applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.Regarding the acceptance of 70 lakhs in cheque and DD, it seems permissible based on the clause you provided from the Agreement to Sale (ATS). The ATS states that the balance payment can be made by D.D/ CHEQUE/RTGS.In such cases, it is generally advisable to follow these steps:Deposit the cheque into your bank account and ensure that it is cleared before proceeding with the transaction. This helps ensure that the funds are available and reduces the risk of bounced or dishonored cheques.Verify the authenticity and validity of the demand draft before accepting it. Ensure that it is issued by a reputable bank and contains accurate information.Retain records of the cheque deposit, clearance, and the demand draft for your reference and documentation purposes.To be certain about the legal requirements and procedures specific to your jurisdiction, it's important to consult with a qualified legal professional who specializes in real estate law. They will be able to review the terms of the agreement, provide guidance on accepting payments, and ensure compliance with local laws and regulations.Note that real estate laws and regulations can vary depending on your jurisdiction, so it's essential to seek specific legal advice tailored to your situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "The proceeding for enforcement of the order under Section 128, therefore, cannot be assailed on the ground that the same would be barred by limitation as provided under the proviso to Section 125(3) of the Code.It may, therefore, be deduced that the scope of Section 125(3) and 128 of the Code being different and the first proviso to Section 125(3) creating an interdict only on issuance of warrant for recovery under Section 125(3), the said period of limitation of one year cannot be held to create a fetter on the right to claim enforcement under Section 128.One of the main issues that came up for the court’s consideration was whether the limitation prescribed under the proviso to Section 125(3) doesn’t create any bar on claiming arrears of maintenance or it limit the entitlement.Limitation of one year and section 128:“Section125(3) of the code would have to be held to be confined to the section which precedes it.”Section 128 of the Code provides for enforcement of the order of maintenance against the person against whom the order of maintenance has been made. The enforcement of the order of maintenance under Section 128 can only be made upon the liability being satisfied by making actual payment of the amount of maintenance, which is due. The entitlement to claim enforcement of the order of maintenance under Section 128 by seeking discharge of the liability as per terms of the order of maintenance granted under Section 125, therefore cannot be held to be extinguished in terms of the one year limitation prescribed under the first proviso to Section 125(3).T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Limitation in execution proceeding in 125 CrPC",
    "answer": "The SC has held that the proviso to Section 125(3) CrPC has been construed by the High Court to be a fetter on the entitlement of the claimants to receive arrears of maintenance beyond a period of one year preceding the date of filing of the applicable under Section 125(3) CrPC. Having considered the said provision of the Code we do not find that the same creates a bar or in any way affects the entitlement of a claimant to arrears of maintenance. What the proviso contemplates is that the procedure for recovery maintenance under Section 125(3), namely, by construing the same to be a levy of a fine and the detention of the defaulter in custody would not be available to a claimant who had slept over his/her rights and has not approached the court within a period of one year commencing from the date on which the entitlement to receive maintenance has accrued.

The revocation must be in express form and not of a wish or desire.Revocation by rescission:- The gift is a transfer of ownership without any exchange of money or any consideration which is made voluntarily. So, where there is no free consent of the parties, the gift can be revoked or if it is obtained by coercion, undue influence or fraud then the gift is voidable.CASE“S. Sarojini Amma v.

Any person who is the real owner of the property can transfer his or her property to anyone by way of gift. A gift deed actually says that any person who is the owner of the property can transfer the property to another person without any consideration.

In this case, IA 787, which was filed in the year 2022, has been dismissed by the court.An interlocutory application is a request or motion filed by one party during the course of a legal proceeding, seeking a specific order or direction from the court. It is a procedural step taken within the larger legal case.When an IA is dismissed, it means that the court has rejected the application and the relief sought by the party filing it. The court may have found the application to be without merit or not supported by sufficient evidence, or it may have determined that the relief requested is not appropriate in the given circumstances.The dismissal of an IA does not necessarily determine the final outcome of the overall divorce proceeding. It simply means that the specific application has been denied. The divorce case may still continue, and other issues and applications can be addressed separately.It is advisable to consult with your legal counsel or the concerned court for further clarification and to understand the impact of the dismissal on your particular case.

    "question": "Resigning from LLP without LLP agreement",
    "answer": "Dear client,To proceed with the resignation procedure in your situation, you can follow these steps:Communicate your resignation: Notify the remaining LLP director(s) and other relevant parties, in writing, about your decision to resign as a director of the LLP. Clearly state your intention to disassociate yourself from the LLP and its operations.Check the LLP Agreement: Review the LLP Agreement to understand the provisions related to resignation and appointment of directors. If the agreement has not been signed or filed on the MCA portal, it may be easier to proceed with the resignation process.Resignation documentation: Prepare a formal resignation letter stating your intent to resign as a director of the LLP. Include the effective date of resignation. Sign the letter digitally, if possible, or scan a physical copy and send it to the other director(s) via email.Update records with the Registrar of Companies (RoC): As the LLP agreement has not been filed on the MCA portal, it may not be necessary to file any specific form for your resignation. However, you should inform the remaining LLP director(s) to update the LLP records with the RoC and remove your name as a director from the LLP. They may need to file the necessary forms, such as Form LLP-3 (for appointment, cessation, or change in designation of partners), to reflect the changes in the LLP.Update other authorities: Notify other relevant authorities, such as the tax authorities, banks, and any other government departments, about your resignation and provide them with the updated LLP details, removing your name as a director.It is strongly advised to consult with a professional, such as a qualified chartered accountant or company secretary, who can guide you through the specific requirements and procedures based on the laws and regulations applicable in your jurisdiction.Please note that this is general information and should not be considered as legal advice. Consulting with a qualified professional is essential to ensure compliance with the applicable laws and regulations.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Cancellation of gift deed",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,Cancelling a Gift:Section 126 provides two modes of revocation of Gift:-Revocation by mutual agreement:- A gift may be revoked upon the happening of an event which is not dependent on the donor where the donor and donee may agree. The revocation must be in express form and not of a wish or desire.Revocation by rescission:- The gift is a transfer of ownership without any exchange of money or any consideration which is made voluntarily. So, where there is no free consent of the parties, the gift can be revoked or if it is obtained by coercion, undue influence or fraud then the gift is voidable.CASE“S. Sarojini Amma v. Velayudhan Pillai Sreekumar2018 SCC OnLine SC 2200”“In this case, the Supreme Court observed that there was no completed gift of the property which is in question to the respondent by the appellant and the appellant had right in cancelling the deed.”Conclusion:TheTransfer of Property Act, 1882 lays down provisions relating to gift deed and cancellation of the gift deed. Any person who is the real owner of the property can transfer his or her property to anyone by way of gift. A gift deed actually says that any person who is the owner of the property can transfer the property to another person without any consideration. Similarly, there are provisions for cancellation of the gift deed as well.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, Bangalore6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar"

The final outcome will depend on the arguments presented, evidence submitted, and the interpretation of the law by the court. It's essential to have legal representation to ensure your interests are protected and your rights are advocated for effectively.In general, it's important to maintain clear documentation of all legal proceedings, court orders, and communication related to the property dispute.

In this case, IA 787, which was filed in the year 2022, has been dismissed by the court.An interlocutory application is a request or motion filed by one party during the course of a legal proceeding, seeking a specific order or direction from the court. It is a procedural step taken within the larger legal case.When an IA is dismissed, it means that the court has rejected the application and the relief sought by the party filing it. The court may have found the application to be without merit or not supported by sufficient evidence, or it may have determined that the relief requested is not appropriate in the given circumstances.The dismissal of an IA does not necessarily determine the final outcome of the overall divorce proceeding. It simply means that the specific application has been denied. The divorce case may still continue, and other issues and applications can be addressed separately.It is advisable to consult with your legal counsel or the concerned court for further clarification and to understand the impact of the dismissal on your particular case. They will be able to provide you with specific guidance and advice based on the details of your divorce proceedings.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Sir,Cancelling a Gift:Section 126 provides two modes of revocation of Gift:-Revocation by mutual agreement:- A gift may be revoked upon the happening of an event which is not dependent on the donor where the donor and donee may agree. The revocation must be in express form and not of a wish or desire.Revocation by rescission:- The gift is a transfer of ownership without any exchange of money or any consideration which is made voluntarily. So, where there is no free consent of the parties, the gift can be revoked or if it is obtained by coercion, undue influence or fraud then the gift is voidable.CASE“S. Sarojini Amma v. Velayudhan Pillai Sreekumar2018 SCC OnLine SC 2200”“In this case, the Supreme Court observed that there was no completed gift of the property which is in question to the respondent by the appellant and the appellant had right in cancelling the deed.”Conclusion:TheTransfer of Property Act, 1882 lays down provisions relating to gift deed and cancellation of the gift deed. Any person who is the real owner of the property can transfer his or her property to anyone by way of gift. A gift deed actually says that any person who is the owner of the property can transfer the property to another person without any consideration.

    "answer": "Dear clientIf the partition is done, the court may consider different options for dividing the property, depending on the specific circumstances of the case. Some possible scenarios are:The property may be sold and the proceeds divided among the co-owners. This is a common solution in cases where it is difficult to physically divide the property, or when none of the co-owners can afford to buy out the others.If the property can be physically divided, the court may order that the house be split into two parts, with each co-owner getting one floor. This is a feasible solution if the property has separate entrances or can be partitioned without causing significant damage.If one co-owner wishes to keep the property and the other co-owners agree to this, the court may order that the remaining co-owners be compensated for their share. The compensation may be in the form of a lump sum payment or a transfer of another property of equivalent value.If you want to keep the property and are willing to pay the other co-owners for their share, you may negotiate with them and come to an agreement outside of court. The amount of compensation will depend on the market or circle rate of the property, as well as any other factors that may affect its value.Ultimately, the court will make a decision based on what is fair and equitable for all co-owners. If you do not want to sell the property and are open to the idea of dividing it from the land, you may discuss this with your co-owners and try to come to a mutually agreeable solution.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,If the trust to which your grandfather gifted the property is not a registered trust, it may have implications on its legal standing and enforceability. However, I am not a lawyer, and the specific laws and regulations regarding unregistered trusts can vary depending on the jurisdiction.In general, a registered trust holds more legal weight and credibility compared to an unregistered trust. An unregistered trust may face challenges in asserting its rights and carrying out certain activities, especially if it involves property transactions or commercial use.In your case, if the unregistered trust is not willing to use the property as a function hall as you desire, it would be advisable to consult with a lawyer who specializes in property and trust law. They can review the specific details of the trust and the property ownership, and provide advice on the legal options available to you.The lawyer may assess whether the trust has the legal authority to use the property for commercial purposes or whether it is limited to certain specified purposes. They can also guide you on potential legal remedies, such as seeking an injunction or legal action to protect your rights and interests, or exploring options for resolving the dispute through negotiation or mediation.It's important to consult with a qualified legal professional who can provide advice based on the specific laws and regulations applicable in your jurisdiction and the details of your case. They will be able to assess the legal standing of the unregistered trust and provide guidance on the best course of action for you to pursue.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In such a suit, you can ask the court to order the lawyer to disclose the identity of the person who supplied false information to him or her. However, to succeed in a claim for malicious prosecution, you would need to prove that the lawyer acted with malice, without reasonable and probable cause, and that you suffered damages as a result of the false complaint.Alternatively, you may file a complaint with the Bar Council of the state where the lawyer is registered. The Bar Council has the power to investigate and take disciplinary action against lawyers who act unethically or violate their professional duties. In your complaint, you can request the Bar Council to investigate the lawyer's conduct in filing a false complaint against you and to take appropriate disciplinary action if the lawyer is found to have acted unethically.It is important to note that filing a complaint against the lawyer may lead to further litigation, and it may take time to obtain the information you seek.

Section 18 of theHindu Succession Actspecifies that heirs related to an intestate by full blood will have a preference over heirs related by half-blood, if the nature of the relationship is the same in every other respect.However, these sections are applicable only in cases where there is no Will left by the deceased person. In your case, since your mother died intestate (without a Will), the above sections may be applicable.As per theHindu Succession Act, your father, as the Class-I legal heir, would have had an equal share in the property with you as the Class-I female heir. However, if your father has remarried, his second wife and his son from the second marriage may also have a claim to a share in the property, depending on various factors such as when the property was acquired, whether it was ancestral or self-acquired, etc.In order to proceed further, you can file a partition suit before the court, seeking your rightful share in the property. The court will appoint a commissioner who will divide the property among the legal heirs based on their respective shares.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Mother property father passed away",
    "answer": "Dear clientIf the partition is done, the court may consider different options for dividing the property, depending on the specific circumstances of the case. Some possible scenarios are:The property may be sold and the proceeds divided among the co-owners. This is a common solution in cases where it is difficult to physically divide the property, or when none of the co-owners can afford to buy out the others.If the property can be physically divided, the court may order that the house be split into two parts, with each co-owner getting one floor. This is a feasible solution if the property has separate entrances or can be partitioned without causing significant damage.If one co-owner wishes to keep the property and the other co-owners agree to this, the court may order that the remaining co-owners be compensated for their share. The compensation may be in the form of a lump sum payment or a transfer of another property of equivalent value.If you want to keep the property and are willing to pay the other co-owners for their share, you may negotiate with them and come to an agreement outside of court. The amount of compensation will depend on the market or circle rate of the property, as well as any other factors that may affect its value.Ultimately, the court will make a decision based on what is fair and equitable for all co-owners. If you do not want to sell the property and are open to the idea of dividing it from the land, you may discuss this with your co-owners and try to come to a mutually agreeable solution.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "According to theHindu Succession Act, 1956, the property of a deceased person is inherited by his legal heirs. In this case, Mr. Z's property would be inherited equally by his two sons, X and Y. However, since both X and Y are deceased, their respective shares in the property would be inherited by their legal heirs. X had one son, A, who is also deceased, but had a son named B. Y had five sons, named C, D, E, F, and G. Therefore, the property would be divided equally among B, C, D, E, F, and G, with each person entitled to a share of 100/6 = 16.67 (rounded off) rupees.Any partition of immovable property must be made by a registered partition deed. The partition deed must be signed by all legal heirs, and each of them must receive their respective share of the property. If any legal heir does not consent to the partition, they can challenge it in court. If the partition does not follow these legal requirements, it may be considered invalid. Therefore, an unregistered partition of property without the consent of all legal heirs would not be considered valid in the eyes of the law. If any legal heir, such as the son or daughter of G, has not signed the partition agreement, it could be challenged in court, and the partition may be considered invalid."

    "answer": "Dear client ,The property of Mr. Z will be inherited by his legal heirs according to the Indian Succession Act, 1925. Since X and Y both died before Mr. Z, their share of the property will pass on to their legal heirs.In this case, X has one son A, who has died, leaving behind his son B. So, B will inherit the share of his father X.Y has 5 sons C, D, E, F, G. Since Y died before Mr. Z, his share of the property will pass on to his legal heirs. In this case, the legal heirs of Y are his sons C, D, E, F, G.Therefore, the property will be divided into 6 equal shares (1 share for each legal heir) and B, C, D, E, F, and G will each inherit 1/6th of the property.Each legal heir will inherit 1/6th of the property. So, in this case, B, C, D, E, F, and G will each inherit Rs. 16.67 (100/6).An unregistered partition of property among legal heirs may be considered valid if it is done with mutual consent and the shares are defined clearly. However, it is always advisable to get the partition deed registered to avoid any future disputes. If any legal heir has not signed the partition deed, their share may not be affected, and they may still be entitled to their share of the property as per the legal inheritance rules. Therefore, it is important to ensure that all legal heirs sign the partition deed to avoid any future disputes.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,If the khata number is wrongly mentioned in the gift deed, it could potentially create confusion and disputes related to the ownership of the property. However, it would depend on how the property is described in the gift deed, and whether it is clear from the document which specific plot was intended to be gifted to your grandfather.Regarding the grandson of X who has taken illegal possession of the property, you can file a case of eviction against him in the appropriate court. You would need to provide evidence to prove your ownership of the property, such as the registered gift deed and any other relevant documents.Regarding the donation made by the son of X to the school, if the plot of land donated was legally owned by him, it would be difficult to demolish the school. However, if the donation was made illegally or if the land was not owned by him, you may be able to take legal action to reclaim the property.

In such a suit, you can ask the court to order the lawyer to disclose the identity of the person who supplied false information to him or her. However, to succeed in a claim for malicious prosecution, you would need to prove that the lawyer acted with malice, without reasonable and probable cause, and that you suffered damages as a result of the false complaint.Alternatively, you may file a complaint with the Bar Council of the state where the lawyer is registered. The Bar Council has the power to investigate and take disciplinary action against lawyers who act unethically or violate their professional duties. In your complaint, you can request the Bar Council to investigate the lawyer's conduct in filing a false complaint against you and to take appropriate disciplinary action if the lawyer is found to have acted unethically.It is important to note that filing a complaint against the lawyer may lead to further litigation, and it may take time to obtain the information you seek.

    "answer": "Section 375 CrPC-Certain guilty pleas are non-appealableIn accordance with Article 134(2) of theIndian Constitution, the legislature also passed the Supreme Court (Enlargement of Criminal Appellate Jurisdiction) Act, 1970, which gives the Supreme Court the authority to hear appeals from the high court in certain cases.TheCode of Criminal Procedureof 1973 prescribes that verdicts and orders cannot be appealed except in certain situations. This demonstrates the critical status of appeals.A criminal defendant can file an appeal with the Supreme Court, a high court, or a sessions court, depending on the nature of the case. According to the Supreme Court’s decision inArun Kumar v. State of Uttar Pradesh (1989), the Allahabad High Court was right to overturn the Sessions Judge’s acquittal and convict the appellants if it determined that the Sessions Judge’s position was clearly erroneous and even contributed to a miscarriage of justice.However your case is that the accused pleaded guilty in the trial court and he was convicted for the offence.A plea of guilt results in an automatic conviction; there is no right of appeal.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "CrPC 375 appeal in Supreme Court",
    "answer": "A person who has been found guilty at trial may, with the approval of the Court of Appeal, make a second or subsequent appeal. An individual seeking permission to appeal must convince the court that new and persuasive evidence exists and should be taken into account. If the court believes there was a significant miscarriage of justice, it may hear a new appeal, overturn the conviction, and either substitute a judgement of acquittal or order a new trial.High Court orders of conviction issued while exercising original criminal jurisdiction have the right to be appealed to the Supreme Court.Since it is the country’s highest court of appeals, the Supreme Court has the ultimate discretion and plenary power in all appeals. The Supreme Court’s authority is principally determined by the provisions of theIndian Constitutionand the Supreme Court (Enlargement of Criminal Appellate Jurisdiction), 1970. If the high court overturns an acquittal ruling and sentences the defendant to life in prison, 10 years in jail, or death, the defendant has the right to appeal to the Supreme Court. Article 134(1) of theIndian Constitutionestablishes the same law under the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, recognising the importance of a criminal appeal being brought to that court. In accordance with Article 134(2) of theIndian Constitution, the legislature also passed the Supreme Court (Enlargement of Criminal Appellate Jurisdiction) Act, 1970, which gives the Supreme Court the authority to hear appeals from the high court in certain cases.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

The appeal is not available to challenge the conviction itself.If the High Court rejects the appeal or does not give a favorable decision on the extent or legality of the sentence, the accused may file a Special Leave Petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court of India within 90 days of the High Court's decision. However, the Supreme Court has the discretion to accept or reject the SLP.If the accused wishes to file an appeal on the ground of illegality in conviction or sentence, then they would have to file an appeal to the High Court under Section 374 of theCode of Criminal Procedure, and then if the High Court rejects the appeal or does not give a favorable decision, the accused may file an SLP in the Supreme Court within 90 days of the High Court's decision.In summary, an accused who pleads guilty and is convicted by a Court of Session, Metropolitan Magistrate, or Magistrate of the first or second class can only appeal to the High Court on the ground of the extent or legality of the sentence.

    "question": "Notice period in probation",
    "answer": "Dear client,I'm sorry to hear that you're dealing with a difficult situation at work. Here are some general answers to your questions:If you have resigned and given proper notice, they cannot force you to work extra hours or on weekends. You have fulfilled your obligation by giving notice and it is up to the company to manage the workload during the notice period.No, they cannot extend your notice period because you denied to work extra time. Your notice period is set by the contract, and if they want you to work longer than that, they will need to pay you for that additional time.No, they cannot extend your notice period due to loss of pay leave you take for medical reasons. This would be a violation of labor laws.They can extend your notice period if you don't deliver software on time, but only if this is a clear requirement stated in your contract.Your pay scale and level within the company do not affect your notice period.If you are unable or unwilling to serve the full notice period, it is best to communicate this clearly and professionally to your employer. You can send a formal resignation letter stating that you are unable to complete the full notice period, and that you are willing to discuss potential options for resolving this. It is important to be clear and honest in your communication, and to remain professional throughout the process.If your employer decides to take legal action against you, it is important to seek legal advice and representation. However, it is unlikely that they would pursue legal action if you have communicated clearly and acted in good faith.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If your brother is unable to attend regularly due to living in another city, he can consider hiring a lawyer to represent him in court.

This evidence will help your case and may be used in court.Lastly, you can consider filing a complaint against the police for not informing you about the summons.

    "question": "Registration of foreclosure property with sales certificate",
    "answer": "Dear client,As per the Registration Act, any sale or transfer of immovable property must be registered with the sub-registrar's office, and the appropriate stamp duty must be paid for the same. This applies even if the property is being sold through the SARFAESI Act.Therefore, it is advisable to register the property and pay the appropriate stamp duty as per the market value of the property. The sub-registrar's office should then enter the transaction in Book1 as per the registration act, which will ensure that the transfer of ownership is legally recognized and recorded.Entering the transaction in Book1 will also ensure that your name is reflected on the Encumbrance Certificate (EC) whenever you request for it. An EC is a document that shows all the transactions or encumbrances on a particular property, and it is issued by the sub-registrar's office. By registering the property and entering the transaction in Book1, you can ensure that your ownership of the property is reflected in the EC. This can be important for future legal or financial transactions related to the property.It is recommended that you consult with a lawyer to understand the stamp duty and registration requirements for your specific case, and to ensure that all legal procedures are followed correctly.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Registration of foreclosure property with sales certificate",
    "answer": "1. The sub registrar is right in refusing to register the sale certificate in book-I, because to register the document in Book-I, it is mandatory that the stamp duty as applicable has to be paid, do not be under misguidance.  Therefore instead of getting the sale certificate registered, you can ask the banker to execute the sale deed itself and register it so that the stamp duty can be paid once for all.2.   You will not be able to sell the property by executing a registered sale deed in favor of the  prospective buyer if you do not have a registered sale deed on your name, because it is the title document by which you can claim title to the property.The sale certificate is a mere certificate for selling the property to you and not a sale deed.The banker will tell that the sale deed is not required whereas it is not the procedure.The sale certificate issued by the banker is just an acknowledgment for receiving the money after having received money towards sale consideration, whereas this will not convey the title from the seller(banker) to you.Hence better do not approach any short cut method to remain silent about the stamp duty and the registration of the sale deed etc on any misguidance.You say that the sub registrar is not accepting the register the sale certificate without paying the stamp duty, therefore instead of paying double stamp duty, i.e., one for sale certificate and another for sale deed, you better get the sale deed executed and pay the tamp duty for the sale deed itself.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

You can also show them the relevant provisions of the law and any supporting documents that you have, such as legal opinions or judgments, to support your position. If the sub-registrar still insists on payment of stamp duty, you may need to seek legal recourse to resolve the issue.If you want to sell the property in the future, the buyer will need to pay for the stamp paper for the sale deed as per the usual course. However, it is always advisable to consult with a lawyer to ensure that all legal requirements are met, and that the sale deed is drafted correctly to avoid any future disputes or legal issues.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Society maintenance charges",
    "answer": "Dear client,The Tamil Nadu Apartment Ownership Act, 1994 provides for the formation of an association of owners, which is responsible for the maintenance, repair, and upkeep of common areas and facilities. Section 7 of the Act provides that every owner shall pay to the association his share of the common expenses.With respect to the maintenance charges, it is up to the association to determine the method of calculating the charges. The Act does not prescribe any particular method of calculation. However, the association must follow the bye-laws of the society which must be in conformity with the Act.In your case, if the bye-laws of the association provide for the calculation of maintenance charges on a sqft basis, then the association can charge the maintenance charges on that basis. However, if the bye-laws allow for a hybrid basis, then the association should follow that. If there are no bye-laws or if they are silent on the matter, then the association should hold a general meeting and pass a resolution for the method of calculation of maintenance charges.If you are not satisfied with the method of calculation of maintenance charges, you can approach the Registrar of Societies under whose jurisdiction the association falls, and file a complaint against the association for not following the bye-laws or the provisions of the Act. You can also approach the civil court and file a suit for a declaration that the method of calculation of maintenance charges adopted by the association is illegal and for a direction to the association to adopt a fair and equitable method of calculation.Regarding the maintenance charges of the OSR, it is reasonable to charge on a sqft basis if all the owners have access to the facility. However, the charges for the usage of the facility should be on an actual usage basis, and not on a sqft basis."

However, in certain cases, courts have allowed the parties to make changes to the original petition and incorporate them in the decree, especially if the changes are minor and do not affect the substance of the agreement.In your case, since the error in the first motion petition is a typographical error and does not affect the substance of the agreement, you can request the court to correct the error by filing an application for amendment of the first motion petition. You can also file a joint affidavit along with your spouse, stating the mistake and requesting the court to allow the correction.Similarly, if you wish to rephrase one of the terms agreed in the original petition, you can file an application for amendment of the original petition and a joint affidavit requesting the court to accept the new wording.The court may allow the amendments if it is satisfied that they do not materially alter the terms of the original petition and that they are bona fide. The court may also require you to provide a valid reason for the changes and may require you to pay additional court fees.Once the amendments are allowed, you can file a joint affidavit along with your spouse, containing all the items mentioned in the original petition as well as the corrected case number and the rephrased item. The court will then incorporate these changes in the final decree.It is important to consult your advocate for guidance on the specific procedures and requirements of the court where your case is pending, as the rules and procedures may vary from state to state.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,It's important to follow the proper resignation procedures and ensure that your resignation is acknowledged by the company. If you fail to do so, the company may mark you as absconding, which can negatively impact your future employment prospects.Since you do not want to log into the company's portal to submit your resignation, you could consider sending a formal resignation letter via email. This letter should include your name, position, and the date of your resignation, as well as a clear statement of your intention to resign from your position. It should also express gratitude for the opportunity and mention any positive experiences you had during your brief time with the company.In the email, you should request that the company acknowledges your resignation and confirms that they have received it. You could also mention that you did not receive any company assets and that you did not mark your attendance in the company portal.Make sure to keep a copy of the email and any response you receive from the company, as it may be useful in case of any future disputes. It's important to handle the situation professionally, as this will ensure that you maintain a positive relationship with the company, which could be beneficial in the future..Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Since the flat is unregistered, you cannot directly transfer ownership to your name. In order to get the flat registered in your name, you will first need to get the ownership of the flat established legally.You should hire a lawyer who can help you with the process of establishing the ownership of the flat. The lawyer can help you to trace A and get a sale deed executed in your favor by A. You will then need to get the sale deed registered at the local sub-registrar's office.If A is not traceable, your lawyer may suggest filing a suit for specific performance of the contract against A, which would require proving the existence of the contract of sale between A and B. You may also need to approach the authorities to revive the builder company and/or locate the legal heirs of the company, who may be held liable for the transaction.In any case, the process may involve considerable legal work and documentation, so it is important to seek professional help to ensure that all legal requirements are met.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Mutual Consent Divorce under Hindu Marriage Act",
    "answer": "Dear client,As per theHindu Marriage Act, the first motion in a divorce petition is followed by the second motion, which is the final step in obtaining a divorce decree. However, in certain cases, courts have allowed the parties to make changes to the original petition and incorporate them in the decree, especially if the changes are minor and do not affect the substance of the agreement.In your case, since the error in the first motion petition is a typographical error and does not affect the substance of the agreement, you can request the court to correct the error by filing an application for amendment of the first motion petition. You can also file a joint affidavit along with your spouse, stating the mistake and requesting the court to allow the correction.Similarly, if you wish to rephrase one of the terms agreed in the original petition, you can file an application for amendment of the original petition and a joint affidavit requesting the court to accept the new wording.The court may allow the amendments if it is satisfied that they do not materially alter the terms of the original petition and that they are bona fide. The court may also require you to provide a valid reason for the changes and may require you to pay additional court fees.Once the amendments are allowed, you can file a joint affidavit along with your spouse, containing all the items mentioned in the original petition as well as the corrected case number and the rephrased item. The court will then incorporate these changes in the final decree.It is important to consult your advocate for guidance on the specific procedures and requirements of the court where your case is pending, as the rules and procedures may vary from state to state.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "CrPC 375 appeal in Supreme Court",
    "answer": "A person who has been found guilty at trial may, with the approval of the Court of Appeal, make a second or subsequent appeal. An individual seeking permission to appeal must convince the court that new and persuasive evidence exists and should be taken into account. If the court believes there was a significant miscarriage of justice, it may hear a new appeal, overturn the conviction, and either substitute a judgement of acquittal or order a new trial.High Court orders of conviction issued while exercising original criminal jurisdiction have the right to be appealed to the Supreme Court.Since it is the country’s highest court of appeals, the Supreme Court has the ultimate discretion and plenary power in all appeals. The Supreme Court’s authority is principally determined by the provisions of theIndian Constitutionand the Supreme Court (Enlargement of Criminal Appellate Jurisdiction), 1970. If the high court overturns an acquittal ruling and sentences the defendant to life in prison, 10 years in jail, or death, the defendant has the right to appeal to the Supreme Court. Article 134(1) of theIndian Constitutionestablishes the same law under the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, recognising the importance of a criminal appeal being brought to that court. In accordance with Article 134(2) of theIndian Constitution, the legislature also passed the Supreme Court (Enlargement of Criminal Appellate Jurisdiction) Act, 1970, which gives the Supreme Court the authority to hear appeals from the high court in certain cases.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

However, the Supreme Court has the discretion to accept or reject the SLP.If the accused wishes to file an appeal on the ground of illegality in conviction or sentence, then they would have to file an appeal to the High Court under Section 374 of theCode of Criminal Procedure, and then if the High Court rejects the appeal or does not give a favorable decision, the accused may file an SLP in the Supreme Court within 90 days of the High Court's decision.In summary, an accused who pleads guilty and is convicted by a Court of Session, Metropolitan Magistrate, or Magistrate of the first or second class can only appeal to the High Court on the ground of the extent or legality of the sentence.

It has to be considered in general body wherein 3/4th of society members are present.If this decision was approved by the general body in a meeting, then the decision to exclude won't make any difference to proceed with the redevelopment process.2. A society opting for redevelopment can enter into a Development Agreement or a Redevelopment Agreement (\"DA\") either with the developer alone, or with both the developer and individual society members in certain cases. There are many instances in which the society executes the DA with the developer without individual society members. The society therefore acts on behalf of individual members.Under the Development Agreement ,new homes/units are provided to the existing society members in lieu of their earlier accommodation.Permanent Alternate Accommodation Agreementsprovides legal sanctity to the old apartment owner with regards to their new apartment in the new building. It is only after this agreement is executed that homeowners vacate their old building.If the office bearers are refusing to sign PAAA in the capacity of office bearer, then there is no legal infirmity in it, becasue it has to be signed by the individuals in the redevelopment agreement.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear client,I'm sorry to hear that you're dealing with a difficult situation at work. Here are some general answers to your questions:If you have resigned and given proper notice, they cannot force you to work extra hours or on weekends. You have fulfilled your obligation by giving notice and it is up to the company to manage the workload during the notice period.No, they cannot extend your notice period because you denied to work extra time. Your notice period is set by the contract, and if they want you to work longer than that, they will need to pay you for that additional time.No, they cannot extend your notice period due to loss of pay leave you take for medical reasons. This would be a violation of labor laws.They can extend your notice period if you don't deliver software on time, but only if this is a clear requirement stated in your contract.Your pay scale and level within the company do not affect your notice period.If you are unable or unwilling to serve the full notice period, it is best to communicate this clearly and professionally to your employer. You can send a formal resignation letter stating that you are unable to complete the full notice period, and that you are willing to discuss potential options for resolving this. It is important to be clear and honest in your communication, and to remain professional throughout the process.If your employer decides to take legal action against you, it is important to seek legal advice and representation.

Section 18 of theHindu Succession Actspecifies that heirs related to an intestate by full blood will have a preference over heirs related by half-blood, if the nature of the relationship is the same in every other respect.However, these sections are applicable only in cases where there is no Will left by the deceased person. In your case, since your mother died intestate (without a Will), the above sections may be applicable.As per theHindu Succession Act, your father, as the Class-I legal heir, would have had an equal share in the property with you as the Class-I female heir. However, if your father has remarried, his second wife and his son from the second marriage may also have a claim to a share in the property, depending on various factors such as when the property was acquired, whether it was ancestral or self-acquired, etc.In order to proceed further, you can file a partition suit before the court, seeking your rightful share in the property.

    "question": "Mother property father passed away",
    "answer": "Dear clientIf the partition is done, the court may consider different options for dividing the property, depending on the specific circumstances of the case. Some possible scenarios are:The property may be sold and the proceeds divided among the co-owners. This is a common solution in cases where it is difficult to physically divide the property, or when none of the co-owners can afford to buy out the others.If the property can be physically divided, the court may order that the house be split into two parts, with each co-owner getting one floor. This is a feasible solution if the property has separate entrances or can be partitioned without causing significant damage.If one co-owner wishes to keep the property and the other co-owners agree to this, the court may order that the remaining co-owners be compensated for their share. The compensation may be in the form of a lump sum payment or a transfer of another property of equivalent value.If you want to keep the property and are willing to pay the other co-owners for their share, you may negotiate with them and come to an agreement outside of court. The amount of compensation will depend on the market or circle rate of the property, as well as any other factors that may affect its value.Ultimately, the court will make a decision based on what is fair and equitable for all co-owners. If you do not want to sell the property and are open to the idea of dividing it from the land, you may discuss this with your co-owners and try to come to a mutually agreeable solution.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,As per the Registration Act, any sale or transfer of immovable property must be registered with the sub-registrar's office, and the appropriate stamp duty must be paid for the same. This applies even if the property is being sold through the SARFAESI Act.Therefore, it is advisable to register the property and pay the appropriate stamp duty as per the market value of the property. The sub-registrar's office should then enter the transaction in Book1 as per the registration act, which will ensure that the transfer of ownership is legally recognized and recorded.Entering the transaction in Book1 will also ensure that your name is reflected on the Encumbrance Certificate (EC) whenever you request for it. An EC is a document that shows all the transactions or encumbrances on a particular property, and it is issued by the sub-registrar's office. By registering the property and entering the transaction in Book1, you can ensure that your ownership of the property is reflected in the EC. This can be important for future legal or financial transactions related to the property.It is recommended that you consult with a lawyer to understand the stamp duty and registration requirements for your specific case, and to ensure that all legal procedures are followed correctly.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Registration of foreclosure property with sales certificate",
    "answer": "1. The sub registrar is right in refusing to register the sale certificate in book-I, because to register the document in Book-I, it is mandatory that the stamp duty as applicable has to be paid, do not be under misguidance.  Therefore instead of getting the sale certificate registered, you can ask the banker to execute the sale deed itself and register it so that the stamp duty can be paid once for all.2.   You will not be able to sell the property by executing a registered sale deed in favor of the  prospective buyer if you do not have a registered sale deed on your name, because it is the title document by which you can claim title to the property.The sale certificate is a mere certificate for selling the property to you and not a sale deed.The banker will tell that the sale deed is not required whereas it is not the procedure.The sale certificate issued by the banker is just an acknowledgment for receiving the money after having received money towards sale consideration, whereas this will not convey the title from the seller(banker) to you.Hence better do not approach any short cut method to remain silent about the stamp duty and the registration of the sale deed etc on any misguidance.You say that the sub registrar is not accepting the register the sale certificate without paying the stamp duty, therefore instead of paying double stamp duty, i.e., one for sale certificate and another for sale deed, you better get the sale deed executed and pay the tamp duty for the sale deed itself.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

In such a suit, you can ask the court to order the lawyer to disclose the identity of the person who supplied false information to him or her. However, to succeed in a claim for malicious prosecution, you would need to prove that the lawyer acted with malice, without reasonable and probable cause, and that you suffered damages as a result of the false complaint.Alternatively, you may file a complaint with the Bar Council of the state where the lawyer is registered. The Bar Council has the power to investigate and take disciplinary action against lawyers who act unethically or violate their professional duties. In your complaint, you can request the Bar Council to investigate the lawyer's conduct in filing a false complaint against you and to take appropriate disciplinary action if the lawyer is found to have acted unethically.It is important to note that filing a complaint against the lawyer may lead to further litigation, and it may take time to obtain the information you seek.

    "answer": "Dear client,If your friend has received three service notices with the respective hearing dates, it is important to attend the next hearing on 15th June. Failure to attend the hearing may result in adverse consequences for your friend's case, such as a decision being made against him in his absence.Since you mentioned that you are unable to contact the assigned advocate in Kullu, it may be helpful to try and contact the court directly to find out if the hearing is still scheduled as per the notice. You can also try and find a local advocate in Kullu who can represent your friend at the hearing.In case your friend is unable to travel to Kullu due to medical reasons or other circumstances, you may consider requesting an adjournment of the hearing. This can be done by filing an application for adjournment with the court and providing appropriate reasons for the request. However, it is important to note that adjournments are granted at the discretion of the court and may not be granted in all cases.It is important to ensure that your friend's legal rights are protected and that he receives the compensation he is entitled to for the damages suffered in the accident. Therefore, attending the hearing or taking appropriate steps to ensure representation is necessary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "A person who has been found guilty at trial may, with the approval of the Court of Appeal, make a second or subsequent appeal. An individual seeking permission to appeal must convince the court that new and persuasive evidence exists and should be taken into account. If the court believes there was a significant miscarriage of justice, it may hear a new appeal, overturn the conviction, and either substitute a judgement of acquittal or order a new trial.High Court orders of conviction issued while exercising original criminal jurisdiction have the right to be appealed to the Supreme Court.Since it is the country’s highest court of appeals, the Supreme Court has the ultimate discretion and plenary power in all appeals. The Supreme Court’s authority is principally determined by the provisions of theIndian Constitutionand the Supreme Court (Enlargement of Criminal Appellate Jurisdiction), 1970. If the high court overturns an acquittal ruling and sentences the defendant to life in prison, 10 years in jail, or death, the defendant has the right to appeal to the Supreme Court. Article 134(1) of theIndian Constitutionestablishes the same law under the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, recognising the importance of a criminal appeal being brought to that court. In accordance with Article 134(2) of theIndian Constitution, the legislature also passed the Supreme Court (Enlargement of Criminal Appellate Jurisdiction) Act, 1970, which gives the Supreme Court the authority to hear appeals from the high court in certain cases.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

Section 18 of theHindu Succession Actspecifies that heirs related to an intestate by full blood will have a preference over heirs related by half-blood, if the nature of the relationship is the same in every other respect.However, these sections are applicable only in cases where there is no Will left by the deceased person. In your case, since your mother died intestate (without a Will), the above sections may be applicable.As per theHindu Succession Act, your father, as the Class-I legal heir, would have had an equal share in the property with you as the Class-I female heir. However, if your father has remarried, his second wife and his son from the second marriage may also have a claim to a share in the property, depending on various factors such as when the property was acquired, whether it was ancestral or self-acquired, etc.In order to proceed further, you can file a partition suit before the court, seeking your rightful share in the property.

    "answer": "Dear clientIf the partition is done, the court may consider different options for dividing the property, depending on the specific circumstances of the case. Some possible scenarios are:The property may be sold and the proceeds divided among the co-owners. This is a common solution in cases where it is difficult to physically divide the property, or when none of the co-owners can afford to buy out the others.If the property can be physically divided, the court may order that the house be split into two parts, with each co-owner getting one floor. This is a feasible solution if the property has separate entrances or can be partitioned without causing significant damage.If one co-owner wishes to keep the property and the other co-owners agree to this, the court may order that the remaining co-owners be compensated for their share. The compensation may be in the form of a lump sum payment or a transfer of another property of equivalent value.If you want to keep the property and are willing to pay the other co-owners for their share, you may negotiate with them and come to an agreement outside of court. The amount of compensation will depend on the market or circle rate of the property, as well as any other factors that may affect its value.Ultimately, the court will make a decision based on what is fair and equitable for all co-owners. If you do not want to sell the property and are open to the idea of dividing it from the land, you may discuss this with your co-owners and try to come to a mutually agreeable solution.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This applies even if the property is being sold through the SARFAESI Act.Therefore, it is advisable to register the property and pay the appropriate stamp duty as per the market value of the property. The sub-registrar's office should then enter the transaction in Book1 as per the registration act, which will ensure that the transfer of ownership is legally recognized and recorded.Entering the transaction in Book1 will also ensure that your name is reflected on the Encumbrance Certificate (EC) whenever you request for it. An EC is a document that shows all the transactions or encumbrances on a particular property, and it is issued by the sub-registrar's office. By registering the property and entering the transaction in Book1, you can ensure that your ownership of the property is reflected in the EC. This can be important for future legal or financial transactions related to the property.It is recommended that you consult with a lawyer to understand the stamp duty and registration requirements for your specific case, and to ensure that all legal procedures are followed correctly.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,As per the Passport Seva Manual, if there is a mistake in the personal details mentioned in the earlier passport, the applicant should apply for a re-issue of the passport with the correct details. In your case, since you have a birth certificate from Mauritius, which is your country of birth, it is advisable to mention Mauritius as the place of birth in the re-issued passport.Regarding the name change, you have an affidavit for the change of name from Dwip Sinha to Saptarshi Sinha, which can be submitted as proof for the name change. It is recommended to mention the correct and current name, i.e., Saptarshi Sinha, in the re-issued passport.There may be some questions asked by the authorities regarding the change of personal details, such as why it was not mentioned earlier. However, since you have all the required proofs, such as the birth certificate and affidavit for the name change, it should not be a significant issue.It is always advisable to provide accurate and correct personal details in the passport application, as any incorrect information may cause delays or rejections in the passport issuance process.

    "answer": "A person who has been found guilty at trial may, with the approval of the Court of Appeal, make a second or subsequent appeal. An individual seeking permission to appeal must convince the court that new and persuasive evidence exists and should be taken into account. If the court believes there was a significant miscarriage of justice, it may hear a new appeal, overturn the conviction, and either substitute a judgement of acquittal or order a new trial.High Court orders of conviction issued while exercising original criminal jurisdiction have the right to be appealed to the Supreme Court.Since it is the country’s highest court of appeals, the Supreme Court has the ultimate discretion and plenary power in all appeals. The Supreme Court’s authority is principally determined by the provisions of theIndian Constitutionand the Supreme Court (Enlargement of Criminal Appellate Jurisdiction), 1970. If the high court overturns an acquittal ruling and sentences the defendant to life in prison, 10 years in jail, or death, the defendant has the right to appeal to the Supreme Court. Article 134(1) of theIndian Constitutionestablishes the same law under the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, recognising the importance of a criminal appeal being brought to that court. In accordance with Article 134(2) of theIndian Constitution, the legislature also passed the Supreme Court (Enlargement of Criminal Appellate Jurisdiction) Act, 1970, which gives the Supreme Court the authority to hear appeals from the high court in certain cases.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

Anandji Kalyanji's Pedhi & Ors: The Supreme Court (SC) held that the expression 'tenant' under Section 5(11)(c) of the Bombay Rent Act means only a person who is a contractual tenant because rent in payable by a contractual and not by a statutory tenant.Miss Gool Rustomji Lala v. Jal Rustomji Lala2 : The Bombay High Court interpreted the Section 5(11)(c) of the Bombay Rent Act and held that the Court can declare only one member of the family as a tenant. This view was later reaffirmed inSmt Parvatibai w/o Bandu Marathe v. Smt Radhabai Chaggan Bhadarkar , Shamkant Tukaram Naik v. Dayanabai Shamsan Dighodkar, andVimalabai Keshav Gokhale v. Avinash Krishnaji Binjewale & Ors.Kanti Bhattacharya & Ors. v. K.S. Parmeshwaran & Anr: In this case, it was contended by the legal heirs that upon the death of the deceased, they were entitled to inherit his right and as the notice of eviction suit was not addressed to them but only to the widow of the deceased, the same was invalid and, therefore, there was no termination of the tenancy. In this case, the Bombay High Court rejected such contentions and concluded that there was an agreement between members of the tenant's family and the widow of the deceased who was treated as a tenant by the tenant's family. Therefore, the notice served upon her is binding on all family members.Ramesh Ramgopal Daga v. Vasant Baburao Khandare: The question of considering other relatives as a tenant or joint tenant was completely disregarded once the petitioner was recognized as a tenant.Ashok Chintaman Juker & Ors v. Kishore Pandurang Mantri & An8 : The SC conclusively held that the tenancy rights upon the demise of the original tenant of premises can be inherited only on fulfilment of two requisites:The person must be a member of the tenant's familyHe must have been residing with the tenant at the time of his deathT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Right of legal heirs of tenants to compensation on surrender",
    "answer": "In a situation where the original tenants of a tenanted premises in a cessed building have died intestate and have 10 surviving children as legal heirs, the distribution of the compensation paid by the developer for the surrender of the tenancy would typically depend on the applicable laws of inheritance and succession.When someone dies without leaving a valid will, the applicable laws of intestate succession come into play. These laws determine how the deceased person's estate, including assets and rights like the tenancy, will be distributed among the legal heirs.When there are multiple legal heirs, the estate is often divided equally among them. This means that each 10 surviving children would be entitled to an equal share of the compensation.In situations like this, it is common for the legal heirs to go through a legal process to establish their rights and obtain a share of the compensation. This may involve filing necessary applications or claims with the appropriate courts to ensure a fair and equitable distribution.Sukumar JadhavAdvocate, Mumbai35 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sukumar Jadhav"

Section 18 of theHindu Succession Actspecifies that heirs related to an intestate by full blood will have a preference over heirs related by half-blood, if the nature of the relationship is the same in every other respect.However, these sections are applicable only in cases where there is no Will left by the deceased person. In your case, since your mother died intestate (without a Will), the above sections may be applicable.As per theHindu Succession Act, your father, as the Class-I legal heir, would have had an equal share in the property with you as the Class-I female heir. However, if your father has remarried, his second wife and his son from the second marriage may also have a claim to a share in the property, depending on various factors such as when the property was acquired, whether it was ancestral or self-acquired, etc.In order to proceed further, you can file a partition suit before the court, seeking your rightful share in the property. The court will appoint a commissioner who will divide the property among the legal heirs based on their respective shares.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Mother property father passed away",
    "answer": "Dear clientIf the partition is done, the court may consider different options for dividing the property, depending on the specific circumstances of the case. Some possible scenarios are:The property may be sold and the proceeds divided among the co-owners. This is a common solution in cases where it is difficult to physically divide the property, or when none of the co-owners can afford to buy out the others.If the property can be physically divided, the court may order that the house be split into two parts, with each co-owner getting one floor. This is a feasible solution if the property has separate entrances or can be partitioned without causing significant damage.If one co-owner wishes to keep the property and the other co-owners agree to this, the court may order that the remaining co-owners be compensated for their share. The compensation may be in the form of a lump sum payment or a transfer of another property of equivalent value.If you want to keep the property and are willing to pay the other co-owners for their share, you may negotiate with them and come to an agreement outside of court. The amount of compensation will depend on the market or circle rate of the property, as well as any other factors that may affect its value.Ultimately, the court will make a decision based on what is fair and equitable for all co-owners. If you do not want to sell the property and are open to the idea of dividing it from the land, you may discuss this with your co-owners and try to come to a mutually agreeable solution.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Possession of flat",
    "answer": "Firstly, it's important to understand the difference between possession and ownership of a property. Possession means that you have physical control over the property, while ownership means that you have legal rights and title to the property. In this case, it seems like the builder is offering you soft possession, which means that you can take possession of the flat, but legal ownership has not yet been transferred to you.It's important to note that without an occupancy certificate, the builder may not have completed all the necessary legal formalities required for the building to be occupied. Therefore, taking possession without an occupancy certificate can be risky.Before taking possession, you should carefully review all the legal documents related to the property, including the builder-buyer agreement, sale deed, and any other relevant documents. You should also ensure that all the necessary approvals and permits, including the occupancy certificate, have been obtained by the builder.Additionally, if you plan to rent out the property, you should also be aware of the legal requirements and regulations related to renting out a property in Pune. It's always a good idea to consult a legal or financial expert who can guide you through the process.In summary, it's important to carefully review all the legal documents and obtain all the necessary approvals and permits before taking possession of the flat. Without an occupancy certificate, taking possession can be risky, so it's advisable to wait until all the necessary formalities have been completed.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Possession of flat",
    "answer": "It's important to exercise caution and consider several factors before taking possession of a flat, especially if the occupancy certificate is still awaited.1. The occupancy certificate is a crucial document that signifies that the building has been constructed according to approved plans and meets the necessary safety and regulatory requirements. Without an occupancy certificate, there may be potential legal and compliance issues associated with taking possession and renting out the flat. It's advisable to wait for the occupancy certificate before proceeding with possession and renting. If the primary reason for taking possession is to rent out the flat, it's important to evaluate the rental potential and demand in the area. Consider factors such as location, amenities, market conditions, and rental rates in the vicinity. Conduct thorough research to ensure that renting out the flat would be a viable option and aligns with your financial goals.2. Before taking possession, ensure that you review and understand all the legal documents associated with the flat. This includes the sale agreement, allotment letter, building plans, payment receipts, and any other relevant documents. Verify that the builder has fulfilled their obligations as per the agreement and that there are no discrepancies or discrepancies in the documentation. While you mentioned that the builder is reputed, it's always a good idea to conduct some due diligence. Research the builder's reputation, past projects, delivery track record, and any potential legal disputes or consumer complaints against them. This will help you assess the builder's credibility and reliability.Sukumar JadhavAdvocate, Mumbai35 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sukumar Jadhav"

If the court believes there was a significant miscarriage of justice, it may hear a new appeal, overturn the conviction, and either substitute a judgement of acquittal or order a new trial.High Court orders of conviction issued while exercising original criminal jurisdiction have the right to be appealed to the Supreme Court.Since it is the country’s highest court of appeals, the Supreme Court has the ultimate discretion and plenary power in all appeals. The Supreme Court’s authority is principally determined by the provisions of theIndian Constitutionand the Supreme Court (Enlargement of Criminal Appellate Jurisdiction), 1970. If the high court overturns an acquittal ruling and sentences the defendant to life in prison, 10 years in jail, or death, the defendant has the right to appeal to the Supreme Court. Article 134(1) of theIndian Constitutionestablishes the same law under the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, recognising the importance of a criminal appeal being brought to that court. In accordance with Article 134(2) of theIndian Constitution, the legislature also passed the Supreme Court (Enlargement of Criminal Appellate Jurisdiction) Act, 1970, which gives the Supreme Court the authority to hear appeals from the high court in certain cases.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

The appeal is not available to challenge the conviction itself.If the High Court rejects the appeal or does not give a favorable decision on the extent or legality of the sentence, the accused may file a Special Leave Petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court of India within 90 days of the High Court's decision. However, the Supreme Court has the discretion to accept or reject the SLP.If the accused wishes to file an appeal on the ground of illegality in conviction or sentence, then they would have to file an appeal to the High Court under Section 374 of theCode of Criminal Procedure, and then if the High Court rejects the appeal or does not give a favorable decision, the accused may file an SLP in the Supreme Court within 90 days of the High Court's decision.In summary, an accused who pleads guilty and is convicted by a Court of Session, Metropolitan Magistrate, or Magistrate of the first or second class can only appeal to the High Court on the ground of the extent or legality of the sentence.

However, if your father has remarried, his second wife and his son from the second marriage may also have a claim to a share in the property, depending on various factors such as when the property was acquired, whether it was ancestral or self-acquired, etc.In order to proceed further, you can file a partition suit before the court, seeking your rightful share in the property.

    "answer": "Dear clientIf the partition is done, the court may consider different options for dividing the property, depending on the specific circumstances of the case. Some possible scenarios are:The property may be sold and the proceeds divided among the co-owners. This is a common solution in cases where it is difficult to physically divide the property, or when none of the co-owners can afford to buy out the others.If the property can be physically divided, the court may order that the house be split into two parts, with each co-owner getting one floor. This is a feasible solution if the property has separate entrances or can be partitioned without causing significant damage.If one co-owner wishes to keep the property and the other co-owners agree to this, the court may order that the remaining co-owners be compensated for their share. The compensation may be in the form of a lump sum payment or a transfer of another property of equivalent value.If you want to keep the property and are willing to pay the other co-owners for their share, you may negotiate with them and come to an agreement outside of court. The amount of compensation will depend on the market or circle rate of the property, as well as any other factors that may affect its value.Ultimately, the court will make a decision based on what is fair and equitable for all co-owners. If you do not want to sell the property and are open to the idea of dividing it from the land, you may discuss this with your co-owners and try to come to a mutually agreeable solution.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In such a suit, you can ask the court to order the lawyer to disclose the identity of the person who supplied false information to him or her. However, to succeed in a claim for malicious prosecution, you would need to prove that the lawyer acted with malice, without reasonable and probable cause, and that you suffered damages as a result of the false complaint.Alternatively, you may file a complaint with the Bar Council of the state where the lawyer is registered. The Bar Council has the power to investigate and take disciplinary action against lawyers who act unethically or violate their professional duties. In your complaint, you can request the Bar Council to investigate the lawyer's conduct in filing a false complaint against you and to take appropriate disciplinary action if the lawyer is found to have acted unethically.It is important to note that filing a complaint against the lawyer may lead to further litigation, and it may take time to obtain the information you seek.

This applies even if the property is being sold through the SARFAESI Act.Therefore, it is advisable to register the property and pay the appropriate stamp duty as per the market value of the property. The sub-registrar's office should then enter the transaction in Book1 as per the registration act, which will ensure that the transfer of ownership is legally recognized and recorded.Entering the transaction in Book1 will also ensure that your name is reflected on the Encumbrance Certificate (EC) whenever you request for it. An EC is a document that shows all the transactions or encumbrances on a particular property, and it is issued by the sub-registrar's office. By registering the property and entering the transaction in Book1, you can ensure that your ownership of the property is reflected in the EC. This can be important for future legal or financial transactions related to the property.It is recommended that you consult with a lawyer to understand the stamp duty and registration requirements for your specific case, and to ensure that all legal procedures are followed correctly.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Registration of foreclosure property with sales certificate",
    "answer": "1. The sub registrar is right in refusing to register the sale certificate in book-I, because to register the document in Book-I, it is mandatory that the stamp duty as applicable has to be paid, do not be under misguidance.  Therefore instead of getting the sale certificate registered, you can ask the banker to execute the sale deed itself and register it so that the stamp duty can be paid once for all.2.   You will not be able to sell the property by executing a registered sale deed in favor of the  prospective buyer if you do not have a registered sale deed on your name, because it is the title document by which you can claim title to the property.The sale certificate is a mere certificate for selling the property to you and not a sale deed.The banker will tell that the sale deed is not required whereas it is not the procedure.The sale certificate issued by the banker is just an acknowledgment for receiving the money after having received money towards sale consideration, whereas this will not convey the title from the seller(banker) to you.Hence better do not approach any short cut method to remain silent about the stamp duty and the registration of the sale deed etc on any misguidance.You say that the sub registrar is not accepting the register the sale certificate without paying the stamp duty, therefore instead of paying double stamp duty, i.e., one for sale certificate and another for sale deed, you better get the sale deed executed and pay the tamp duty for the sale deed itself.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Registration of foreclosure property with sales certificate",
    "answer": "Dear client,If the sub-registrar is refusing to file the copy of sale certificate in Book no 1 without payment of stamp duty, you can try to explain to them that as per the law, the payment of stamp duty is not required for filing a copy of the sale certificate in Book no 1. You can also show them the relevant provisions of the law and any supporting documents that you have, such as legal opinions or judgments, to support your position. If the sub-registrar still insists on payment of stamp duty, you may need to seek legal recourse to resolve the issue.If you want to sell the property in the future, the buyer will need to pay for the stamp paper for the sale deed as per the usual course. However, it is always advisable to consult with a lawyer to ensure that all legal requirements are met, and that the sale deed is drafted correctly to avoid any future disputes or legal issues.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Society maintenance charges",
    "answer": "Dear client,The Tamil Nadu Apartment Ownership Act, 1994 provides for the formation of an association of owners, which is responsible for the maintenance, repair, and upkeep of common areas and facilities. Section 7 of the Act provides that every owner shall pay to the association his share of the common expenses.With respect to the maintenance charges, it is up to the association to determine the method of calculating the charges. The Act does not prescribe any particular method of calculation. However, the association must follow the bye-laws of the society which must be in conformity with the Act.In your case, if the bye-laws of the association provide for the calculation of maintenance charges on a sqft basis, then the association can charge the maintenance charges on that basis. However, if the bye-laws allow for a hybrid basis, then the association should follow that. If there are no bye-laws or if they are silent on the matter, then the association should hold a general meeting and pass a resolution for the method of calculation of maintenance charges.If you are not satisfied with the method of calculation of maintenance charges, you can approach the Registrar of Societies under whose jurisdiction the association falls, and file a complaint against the association for not following the bye-laws or the provisions of the Act. You can also approach the civil court and file a suit for a declaration that the method of calculation of maintenance charges adopted by the association is illegal and for a direction to the association to adopt a fair and equitable method of calculation.Regarding the maintenance charges of the OSR, it is reasonable to charge on a sqft basis if all the owners have access to the facility. However, the charges for the usage of the facility should be on an actual usage basis, and not on a sqft basis."

    "answer": "Dear client,Regarding your first question, your cousin sister should indicate her current legal marital status in the visa form. If she is legally separated or divorced, she should mention it accordingly. If she is still legally married, she should indicate that and also provide information about the ongoing cases in court.Regarding the second question, there are various ways to show strong ties with India. Some examples include proof of a steady job or business, bank statements, property ownership or rental agreements, proof of family relationships, and any other commitments that would require her to return to India, such as children's education, family events, or medical treatments. In your cousin sister's case, since she is not employed and does not have direct ownership of assets, some additional documents that may help include her daughter's school enrollment records, a letter from her father stating that she is financially dependent on him, and any other documents that show that she has strong family ties in India. The invitation letter from you can also help, but it is not sufficient by itself to demonstrate strong ties with India.Regarding the missing documents, providing the jamabandi of her husband's ancestral property papers and her father's property papers could also help to demonstrate strong ties with India. However, it is important to note that the US visa officer will consider the totality of the circumstances, so there is no guarantee that any specific document will be sufficient to establish strong ties with India. It is best to provide as much evidence as possible to support your cousin sister's visa application.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "According to theHindu Succession Act, 1956, the property of a deceased person is inherited by his legal heirs. In this case, Mr. Z's property would be inherited equally by his two sons, X and Y. However, since both X and Y are deceased, their respective shares in the property would be inherited by their legal heirs. X had one son, A, who is also deceased, but had a son named B. Y had five sons, named C, D, E, F, and G. Therefore, the property would be divided equally among B, C, D, E, F, and G, with each person entitled to a share of 100/6 = 16.67 (rounded off) rupees.Any partition of immovable property must be made by a registered partition deed. The partition deed must be signed by all legal heirs, and each of them must receive their respective share of the property. If any legal heir does not consent to the partition, they can challenge it in court. If the partition does not follow these legal requirements, it may be considered invalid. Therefore, an unregistered partition of property without the consent of all legal heirs would not be considered valid in the eyes of the law. If any legal heir, such as the son or daughter of G, has not signed the partition agreement, it could be challenged in court, and the partition may be considered invalid."

    "answer": "Dear client ,The property of Mr. Z will be inherited by his legal heirs according to the Indian Succession Act, 1925. Since X and Y both died before Mr. Z, their share of the property will pass on to their legal heirs.In this case, X has one son A, who has died, leaving behind his son B. So, B will inherit the share of his father X.Y has 5 sons C, D, E, F, G. Since Y died before Mr. Z, his share of the property will pass on to his legal heirs. In this case, the legal heirs of Y are his sons C, D, E, F, G.Therefore, the property will be divided into 6 equal shares (1 share for each legal heir) and B, C, D, E, F, and G will each inherit 1/6th of the property.Each legal heir will inherit 1/6th of the property. So, in this case, B, C, D, E, F, and G will each inherit Rs. 16.67 (100/6).An unregistered partition of property among legal heirs may be considered valid if it is done with mutual consent and the shares are defined clearly. However, it is always advisable to get the partition deed registered to avoid any future disputes. If any legal heir has not signed the partition deed, their share may not be affected, and they may still be entitled to their share of the property as per the legal inheritance rules. Therefore, it is important to ensure that all legal heirs sign the partition deed to avoid any future disputes.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,If the khata number is wrongly mentioned in the gift deed, it could potentially create confusion and disputes related to the ownership of the property. However, it would depend on how the property is described in the gift deed, and whether it is clear from the document which specific plot was intended to be gifted to your grandfather.Regarding the grandson of X who has taken illegal possession of the property, you can file a case of eviction against him in the appropriate court. You would need to provide evidence to prove your ownership of the property, such as the registered gift deed and any other relevant documents.Regarding the donation made by the son of X to the school, if the plot of land donated was legally owned by him, it would be difficult to demolish the school. However, if the donation was made illegally or if the land was not owned by him, you may be able to take legal action to reclaim the property.

    "answer": "Dear client,It is advisable to mention all the relevant IPC sections in the FIR, but ultimately it is up to the police to decide which sections to include based on their investigation.At this stage, it is best to lodge the FIR only against Vishal Gupta, the seller in the fraudulent sale deed. If during the investigation, the police find evidence against the buyers for criminal conspiracy, they can be added as accused.Yes, you can file a complaint under IPC sections 445 for house-breaking against the unknown persons who broke the lock on your property.If the SHO has refused to lodge an FIR, you can file a complaint with the Superintendent of Police (SP) or with the Magistrate under Section 156(3) of theCriminal Procedure Code(CrPC). If you fear that filing an application under CrPC 156(3) may offend the police officers, you may continue following up with the SP office for a few more days. If there is still no response, you can file the application with the court, and the court will direct the police to register an FIR and investigate the case.Regarding the police asking for the original sale deed, there is no provision in the law that allows them to force you to submit the original document. You can submit a certified copy or a photocopy of the sale deed for their investigation. If the police insist on taking the original, you can request them to give you a receipt for the document, and make a photocopy of it before handing it over to them.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,I'm sorry to hear that you're dealing with a difficult situation at work. Here are some general answers to your questions:If you have resigned and given proper notice, they cannot force you to work extra hours or on weekends. You have fulfilled your obligation by giving notice and it is up to the company to manage the workload during the notice period.No, they cannot extend your notice period because you denied to work extra time. Your notice period is set by the contract, and if they want you to work longer than that, they will need to pay you for that additional time.No, they cannot extend your notice period due to loss of pay leave you take for medical reasons. This would be a violation of labor laws.They can extend your notice period if you don't deliver software on time, but only if this is a clear requirement stated in your contract.Your pay scale and level within the company do not affect your notice period.If you are unable or unwilling to serve the full notice period, it is best to communicate this clearly and professionally to your employer. You can send a formal resignation letter stating that you are unable to complete the full notice period, and that you are willing to discuss potential options for resolving this. It is important to be clear and honest in your communication, and to remain professional throughout the process.If your employer decides to take legal action against you, it is important to seek legal advice and representation. However, it is unlikely that they would pursue legal action if you have communicated clearly and acted in good faith.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This applies even if the property is being sold through the SARFAESI Act.Therefore, it is advisable to register the property and pay the appropriate stamp duty as per the market value of the property. The sub-registrar's office should then enter the transaction in Book1 as per the registration act, which will ensure that the transfer of ownership is legally recognized and recorded.Entering the transaction in Book1 will also ensure that your name is reflected on the Encumbrance Certificate (EC) whenever you request for it. An EC is a document that shows all the transactions or encumbrances on a particular property, and it is issued by the sub-registrar's office. By registering the property and entering the transaction in Book1, you can ensure that your ownership of the property is reflected in the EC. This can be important for future legal or financial transactions related to the property.It is recommended that you consult with a lawyer to understand the stamp duty and registration requirements for your specific case, and to ensure that all legal procedures are followed correctly.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Registration of foreclosure property with sales certificate",
    "answer": "1. The sub registrar is right in refusing to register the sale certificate in book-I, because to register the document in Book-I, it is mandatory that the stamp duty as applicable has to be paid, do not be under misguidance.  Therefore instead of getting the sale certificate registered, you can ask the banker to execute the sale deed itself and register it so that the stamp duty can be paid once for all.2.   You will not be able to sell the property by executing a registered sale deed in favor of the  prospective buyer if you do not have a registered sale deed on your name, because it is the title document by which you can claim title to the property.The sale certificate is a mere certificate for selling the property to you and not a sale deed.The banker will tell that the sale deed is not required whereas it is not the procedure.The sale certificate issued by the banker is just an acknowledgment for receiving the money after having received money towards sale consideration, whereas this will not convey the title from the seller(banker) to you.Hence better do not approach any short cut method to remain silent about the stamp duty and the registration of the sale deed etc on any misguidance.You say that the sub registrar is not accepting the register the sale certificate without paying the stamp duty, therefore instead of paying double stamp duty, i.e., one for sale certificate and another for sale deed, you better get the sale deed executed and pay the tamp duty for the sale deed itself.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear client,If the sub-registrar is refusing to file the copy of sale certificate in Book no 1 without payment of stamp duty, you can try to explain to them that as per the law, the payment of stamp duty is not required for filing a copy of the sale certificate in Book no 1. You can also show them the relevant provisions of the law and any supporting documents that you have, such as legal opinions or judgments, to support your position. If the sub-registrar still insists on payment of stamp duty, you may need to seek legal recourse to resolve the issue.If you want to sell the property in the future, the buyer will need to pay for the stamp paper for the sale deed as per the usual course. However, it is always advisable to consult with a lawyer to ensure that all legal requirements are met, and that the sale deed is drafted correctly to avoid any future disputes or legal issues.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "According to theHindu Succession Act, 1956, the property of a deceased person is inherited by his legal heirs. In this case, Mr. Z's property would be inherited equally by his two sons, X and Y. However, since both X and Y are deceased, their respective shares in the property would be inherited by their legal heirs. X had one son, A, who is also deceased, but had a son named B. Y had five sons, named C, D, E, F, and G. Therefore, the property would be divided equally among B, C, D, E, F, and G, with each person entitled to a share of 100/6 = 16.67 (rounded off) rupees.Any partition of immovable property must be made by a registered partition deed. The partition deed must be signed by all legal heirs, and each of them must receive their respective share of the property. If any legal heir does not consent to the partition, they can challenge it in court. If the partition does not follow these legal requirements, it may be considered invalid. Therefore, an unregistered partition of property without the consent of all legal heirs would not be considered valid in the eyes of the law. If any legal heir, such as the son or daughter of G, has not signed the partition agreement, it could be challenged in court, and the partition may be considered invalid."

    "answer": "Dear client ,The property of Mr. Z will be inherited by his legal heirs according to the Indian Succession Act, 1925. Since X and Y both died before Mr. Z, their share of the property will pass on to their legal heirs.In this case, X has one son A, who has died, leaving behind his son B. So, B will inherit the share of his father X.Y has 5 sons C, D, E, F, G. Since Y died before Mr. Z, his share of the property will pass on to his legal heirs. In this case, the legal heirs of Y are his sons C, D, E, F, G.Therefore, the property will be divided into 6 equal shares (1 share for each legal heir) and B, C, D, E, F, and G will each inherit 1/6th of the property.Each legal heir will inherit 1/6th of the property. So, in this case, B, C, D, E, F, and G will each inherit Rs. 16.67 (100/6).An unregistered partition of property among legal heirs may be considered valid if it is done with mutual consent and the shares are defined clearly. However, it is always advisable to get the partition deed registered to avoid any future disputes. If any legal heir has not signed the partition deed, their share may not be affected, and they may still be entitled to their share of the property as per the legal inheritance rules. Therefore, it is important to ensure that all legal heirs sign the partition deed to avoid any future disputes.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, it would depend on how the property is described in the gift deed, and whether it is clear from the document which specific plot was intended to be gifted to your grandfather.Regarding the grandson of X who has taken illegal possession of the property, you can file a case of eviction against him in the appropriate court. You would need to provide evidence to prove your ownership of the property, such as the registered gift deed and any other relevant documents.Regarding the donation made by the son of X to the school, if the plot of land donated was legally owned by him, it would be difficult to demolish the school. However, if the donation was made illegally or if the land was not owned by him, you may be able to take legal action to reclaim the property.

    "answer": "Dear client,I'm sorry to hear that you're dealing with a difficult situation at work. Here are some general answers to your questions:If you have resigned and given proper notice, they cannot force you to work extra hours or on weekends. You have fulfilled your obligation by giving notice and it is up to the company to manage the workload during the notice period.No, they cannot extend your notice period because you denied to work extra time. Your notice period is set by the contract, and if they want you to work longer than that, they will need to pay you for that additional time.No, they cannot extend your notice period due to loss of pay leave you take for medical reasons. This would be a violation of labor laws.They can extend your notice period if you don't deliver software on time, but only if this is a clear requirement stated in your contract.Your pay scale and level within the company do not affect your notice period.If you are unable or unwilling to serve the full notice period, it is best to communicate this clearly and professionally to your employer. You can send a formal resignation letter stating that you are unable to complete the full notice period, and that you are willing to discuss potential options for resolving this. It is important to be clear and honest in your communication, and to remain professional throughout the process.If your employer decides to take legal action against you, it is important to seek legal advice and representation. However, it is unlikely that they would pursue legal action if you have communicated clearly and acted in good faith.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

You do not have to quote any section or law in this regard.If they claim any share in it let them quote under which law are they entitled to any share in it.Let them go to court,  their case will not be entertained.You tell them that as pertransfer of property act,  if a person having clear and marketable title to the property   he can transfer his property to anyone of his choice which cannot be disputed or challenged by anyone including his wife or children.Moreover this registered settlement deed was executed around three decades ago , hence the vexatious claim that may be made by your siblings may not be entertained by court owing to various factors besides barred by limitation.They are misguided by misinterpretation of latest law on ancestral property which is not applicable to this situation.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Society maintenance charges",
    "answer": "Dear client,The Tamil Nadu Apartment Ownership Act, 1994 provides for the formation of an association of owners, which is responsible for the maintenance, repair, and upkeep of common areas and facilities. Section 7 of the Act provides that every owner shall pay to the association his share of the common expenses.With respect to the maintenance charges, it is up to the association to determine the method of calculating the charges. The Act does not prescribe any particular method of calculation. However, the association must follow the bye-laws of the society which must be in conformity with the Act.In your case, if the bye-laws of the association provide for the calculation of maintenance charges on a sqft basis, then the association can charge the maintenance charges on that basis. However, if the bye-laws allow for a hybrid basis, then the association should follow that. If there are no bye-laws or if they are silent on the matter, then the association should hold a general meeting and pass a resolution for the method of calculation of maintenance charges.If you are not satisfied with the method of calculation of maintenance charges, you can approach the Registrar of Societies under whose jurisdiction the association falls, and file a complaint against the association for not following the bye-laws or the provisions of the Act. You can also approach the civil court and file a suit for a declaration that the method of calculation of maintenance charges adopted by the association is illegal and for a direction to the association to adopt a fair and equitable method of calculation.Regarding the maintenance charges of the OSR, it is reasonable to charge on a sqft basis if all the owners have access to the facility. However, the charges for the usage of the facility should be on an actual usage basis, and not on a sqft basis."

    "answer": "Dear client,I'm sorry to hear that you're dealing with a difficult situation at work. Here are some general answers to your questions:If you have resigned and given proper notice, they cannot force you to work extra hours or on weekends. You have fulfilled your obligation by giving notice and it is up to the company to manage the workload during the notice period.No, they cannot extend your notice period because you denied to work extra time. Your notice period is set by the contract, and if they want you to work longer than that, they will need to pay you for that additional time.No, they cannot extend your notice period due to loss of pay leave you take for medical reasons. This would be a violation of labor laws.They can extend your notice period if you don't deliver software on time, but only if this is a clear requirement stated in your contract.Your pay scale and level within the company do not affect your notice period.If you are unable or unwilling to serve the full notice period, it is best to communicate this clearly and professionally to your employer. You can send a formal resignation letter stating that you are unable to complete the full notice period, and that you are willing to discuss potential options for resolving this. It is important to be clear and honest in your communication, and to remain professional throughout the process.If your employer decides to take legal action against you, it is important to seek legal advice and representation. However, it is unlikely that they would pursue legal action if you have communicated clearly and acted in good faith.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This applies even if the property is being sold through the SARFAESI Act.Therefore, it is advisable to register the property and pay the appropriate stamp duty as per the market value of the property. The sub-registrar's office should then enter the transaction in Book1 as per the registration act, which will ensure that the transfer of ownership is legally recognized and recorded.Entering the transaction in Book1 will also ensure that your name is reflected on the Encumbrance Certificate (EC) whenever you request for it. An EC is a document that shows all the transactions or encumbrances on a particular property, and it is issued by the sub-registrar's office. By registering the property and entering the transaction in Book1, you can ensure that your ownership of the property is reflected in the EC. This can be important for future legal or financial transactions related to the property.It is recommended that you consult with a lawyer to understand the stamp duty and registration requirements for your specific case, and to ensure that all legal procedures are followed correctly.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Arvind Kumar v. Government of India, referred supra, the sale certificate issued in favour of the appellant does not require any registration in view of Section 17(2)(xii) of the Registration Act as the same has been granted pursuant to the sale held in public auction by the authorised officer under SARFAESI Act.- Hence, its registration is not mandatory , and the sub-registrar cannot force to pay the stamp duty over the same for entering in Book 1.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Registration of foreclosure property with sales certificate",
    "answer": "1. The sub registrar is right in refusing to register the sale certificate in book-I, because to register the document in Book-I, it is mandatory that the stamp duty as applicable has to be paid, do not be under misguidance.  Therefore instead of getting the sale certificate registered, you can ask the banker to execute the sale deed itself and register it so that the stamp duty can be paid once for all.2.   You will not be able to sell the property by executing a registered sale deed in favor of the  prospective buyer if you do not have a registered sale deed on your name, because it is the title document by which you can claim title to the property.The sale certificate is a mere certificate for selling the property to you and not a sale deed.The banker will tell that the sale deed is not required whereas it is not the procedure.The sale certificate issued by the banker is just an acknowledgment for receiving the money after having received money towards sale consideration, whereas this will not convey the title from the seller(banker) to you.Hence better do not approach any short cut method to remain silent about the stamp duty and the registration of the sale deed etc on any misguidance.You say that the sub registrar is not accepting the register the sale certificate without paying the stamp duty, therefore instead of paying double stamp duty, i.e., one for sale certificate and another for sale deed, you better get the sale deed executed and pay the tamp duty for the sale deed itself.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear client,If the sub-registrar is refusing to file the copy of sale certificate in Book no 1 without payment of stamp duty, you can try to explain to them that as per the law, the payment of stamp duty is not required for filing a copy of the sale certificate in Book no 1. You can also show them the relevant provisions of the law and any supporting documents that you have, such as legal opinions or judgments, to support your position. If the sub-registrar still insists on payment of stamp duty, you may need to seek legal recourse to resolve the issue.If you want to sell the property in the future, the buyer will need to pay for the stamp paper for the sale deed as per the usual course. However, it is always advisable to consult with a lawyer to ensure that all legal requirements are met, and that the sale deed is drafted correctly to avoid any future disputes or legal issues.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,As the property matter is already in court, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer who can guide you on the specific details of your case. However, I can provide some general information regarding your questions.In an undivided property, all co-owners have equal rights to use and enjoy the entire property. Therefore, any changes to the property should be made with the consent of all co-owners. If one co-owner makes changes to the property without the consent of the other co-owners, the other co-owners can take legal action against them. The legal action may include filing a suit for injunction to stop the changes, or a suit for partition to divide the property.If a will is suspected to be fraudulent, it can be challenged in court. The legal proceedings for challenging a will are separate from those for probate, but they can be pursued simultaneously. If there is sufficient evidence to support the claim of fraud, criminal charges may also be filed.

    "answer": "Dear client,If the citation has not been served despite the probate being filed in late 2022, there could be various reasons for the delay. It is possible that the court is experiencing a backlog or delay in processing the citation, or that the executor or petitioner has not provided accurate contact information for the parties to be served. It is also possible that there could be foul play involved, but this would need to be investigated further. It is recommended that you consult with an experienced attorney who can review the details of the case and advise you on the best course of action.The timing for inspection of the original will will depend on the laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. Generally, interested parties may request to inspect the original will after it has been admitted to probate. However, the timing and conditions for inspection may vary depending on the specific circumstances of the case. It is recommended that you consult with an experienced attorney who can advise you on the timing and procedure for inspection of the original will.The admissibility of phone recordings without the knowledge of the person being recorded will depend on the laws and procedures in your jurisdiction, as well as the specific circumstances of the recording. In some jurisdictions, it may be illegal to record a conversation without the consent of all parties involved. However, in other jurisdictions, it may be legal to record a conversation as long as one party consents to the recording. It is recommended that you consult with an experienced attorney who can advise you on the admissibility of phone recordings in your jurisdiction and in your specific case.The most cost-effective and time-efficient course of action will depend on the specific circumstances of the case. If there is evidence of forgery or other criminal activity, a criminal suit may be necessary to address these issues. If the main issue is the division of property among multiple parties, a partition suit may be more appropriate.

    "answer": "Dear client,I'm sorry to hear that you're dealing with a difficult situation at work. Here are some general answers to your questions:If you have resigned and given proper notice, they cannot force you to work extra hours or on weekends. You have fulfilled your obligation by giving notice and it is up to the company to manage the workload during the notice period.No, they cannot extend your notice period because you denied to work extra time. Your notice period is set by the contract, and if they want you to work longer than that, they will need to pay you for that additional time.No, they cannot extend your notice period due to loss of pay leave you take for medical reasons. This would be a violation of labor laws.They can extend your notice period if you don't deliver software on time, but only if this is a clear requirement stated in your contract.Your pay scale and level within the company do not affect your notice period.If you are unable or unwilling to serve the full notice period, it is best to communicate this clearly and professionally to your employer. You can send a formal resignation letter stating that you are unable to complete the full notice period, and that you are willing to discuss potential options for resolving this. It is important to be clear and honest in your communication, and to remain professional throughout the process.If your employer decides to take legal action against you, it is important to seek legal advice and representation.

It is important to review the lease agreement for any conditions or obligations that you would need to abide by if you become the new owner of the land. You will also need to negotiate with HPCL to ensure that the petrol pump license continues under the new ownership.

    "question": "Owner of land has leased their land for petrol pump and now they want to sell their land to us",
    "answer": "Dear client,If you purchase the land that is currently leased to HPCL for a petrol pump, the lease agreement will typically continue unless there is a clause in the lease agreement that states otherwise. Generally, the lease agreement will have provisions for assignment or transfer of the lease to a new owner of the land.If you plan to purchase the land, you should review the lease agreement carefully to understand the terms and conditions related to the assignment or transfer of the lease. You should also speak to the current lessor and HPCL to understand their obligations and responsibilities under the lease agreement.Regarding the petrol pump license, it is important to note that the license to operate a petrol pump is generally issued by the government and not by the lessor or the landowner. As long as the petrol pump license is valid and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, it should continue even after the transfer of the lease to a new owner of the land. However, you should also review the terms and conditions of the license agreement to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "When a leased property is sold to another owner during the lease term,the terms of the lease will prevail.Selling a leasehold property is similar to selling any other property. However, some complex paperwork might be involved in selling such properties. It is easier to sell your property if the lease is for a longer period.In the given situation if fresh NOC is required to be obtained, you may have to comply with the prevailing rules.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

In general, if there are any changes to the ownership or use of the land, it may be necessary to obtain a new NOC from the relevant authorities.

    "question": "Refund of fees and NOC from advocate",
    "answer": "The practice for asking for a NOC is arbitrary under Article 22(1) of theConstitution of India. (It guarantees every person the right to consult and be defended by any legal practitioner of their choice.)A litigant must be free to change their advocate in case they are not able to pay the fees.party to a litigation has an absolute right to appoint an advocate of his choice, to terminate his services, and to appoint a new advocate. Hence, a party cannot be compelled to obtain 'no objection' from the advocate already on record. Insisting for 'no objection' from the previous advocate will amount to putting a restriction on the right of a party to appoint an advocate of his choice.Recently Karnataka high court has observed and held that .if the Advocate feels that he has any genuine claim or grievance against his client, the appropriate course is to return the brief with endorsement of no objection and agitate such right in an appropriate forum, in accordance with law and not indulge in arm twisting methods by holding on to the brief.\"It was  also held that :There is nothing known as irrevocable vakalatnama. The right of a party to withdraw vakalatnama or authorization given to an advocate is absolute. Hence, a party may discharge his advocate any time, with or without cause by withdrawing his vakalatnama or authorization. On discharging the advocate, the party has the right to have the case file returned to him from the advocate, and any refusal by the advocate to return the fileamounts to misconduct under Section 35 of the Advocates Act, 1961. In any proceeding, including civil and criminal, a party has an absolute right to appoint a new Advocate. Under no circumstance, a party can be denied of his right to appoint a new advocate of his choice. Therefore, it follows that any rule or law imposing restriction on the said right can't be construed as mandatory. Accordingly, Courts, Tribunals or otherauthorities shall not ask for 'no objection' of the advocate already on record, to accept the vakalatnama filed by a new advocate.under no circumstance, a party can be denied of his right to appoint a new advocate of his choice hence you can proceed through a new advocate.You can demand at least half of the huge fee paid by you, if he or she is refusing you may give a complaint against the advocate in the bar council of Karnataka.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear client,If your lawyer has not acted according to your expectations, you have the right to seek a change of lawyer. The NOC is not a necessary document to change your lawyer. You can change your lawyer at any point in time by giving a written notice to your existing lawyer. However, it is advisable to obtain a NOC from the lawyer to avoid any future disputes.Regarding the refund of fees, you should first check the terms of the agreement that you signed with the lawyer. If the agreement provides for a refund of fees in case the lawyer fails to perform his duties, then you can demand a refund of fees. If there is no such clause in the agreement, you can negotiate with the lawyer and try to settle the matter amicably. If the lawyer still refuses to refund your fees, you can file a complaint with the Bar Council of Karnataka.It is important to note that the delay in correcting the scrutiny defects by your lawyer could have affected the outcome of your case. Therefore, it is important to find a good and reliable lawyer who can handle your case efficiently. You can search for a lawyer in Karnataka who specializes in criminal law and has a good track record.

The gift from your father do not attract tax, however you may have to pay tax if you reinvest that amount in a differnt investment scheme.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "You cannot acquire agricultural property either by sale or by gift from your parents, though you can inherit agricultural property as a successor in interest/legal heirs after the lifetime of your parents.For inheritance of agricultural property ther is no requirement to obtain permission from RBI, the only condition for such inheritance is that it can be inherited after the lifetime of the owner of the property by virtue of legal heirs to the deceased.You cannot inherit the agricultural property from your parents during their lifetime.Acquiring an agricultural property by a NRI/OCI on lease is also prohibited.If you want to be confirmed about the property to be transferred to your name now itself then you can ask your parents to transfer the same by a testamentary disposition, however it will take effect or can be enforced only after the death of the testator.For your information even the registered Will can be cancelled or modified by the testator during his/her lifetime, therefore there is no guarantee  on that.If the land was bought on your name by a registered sale deed during the time of your minority by age and when you were an Indian citizen, then you do not have to get it transferred to your name because after attaining the age of majority you become an absolute owner and your father's guardianship will become infructuous.So you may revert with more clarity on this point for more proper opinion on this point.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

However, I can provide some general information regarding your questions.In an undivided property, all co-owners have equal rights to use and enjoy the entire property. Therefore, any changes to the property should be made with the consent of all co-owners. If one co-owner makes changes to the property without the consent of the other co-owners, the other co-owners can take legal action against them. The legal action may include filing a suit for injunction to stop the changes, or a suit for partition to divide the property.If a will is suspected to be fraudulent, it can be challenged in court. The legal proceedings for challenging a will are separate from those for probate, but they can be pursued simultaneously. If there is sufficient evidence to support the claim of fraud, criminal charges may also be filed.

It is pertinent that stated agreements, sale deed was executed during 2001 to 2005 and more than 20 years.

Conduct of Sayed and Asif shows that defendant were is possession ever since from date of purchase in 2001 to 2005 and it is apparent from Asif and Sayed have never objected nor initiated proceeding to exert their right and ownership. Defendant being bonafide purchasers are in uninterrupted possession so by rule of adverse possessions defendants can assert their rights and possession in respect of their area.

    "answer": "Dear client,This is a complex legal case with several issues. Here are some possible answers to your questions:The suit is maintainable on the ground that Sayed is claiming his share of the ancestral property. Asif and Sayed inherited the property from their father Karim, and Sayed has the right to claim his share.The residents in possession can file an objection on the basis of adverse possession. If they have been in possession of the property for more than 12 years without interruption, they may be able to claim ownership of the property.The suit can be considered as a partial partition suit because Sayed is only claiming his share of the property. However, if he wants to claim the entire property, he may need to file a suit for partition and possession.The Ramesh case and sale of the commercial site may help to defend against Sayed's claim, especially if the sale was conducted in a legally valid manner. However, this will depend on the specific facts and circumstances of the case.The court jurisdiction will depend on the value of the property. If the property value is not mentioned in the valuation slip, the court may determine jurisdiction based on the market value of the property or other relevant factors.Sayed can emphasize to the court that GPA holder Kishan, the developer, and other resident members should be included as parties in the suit because they have an interest in the property and their presence is necessary for a fair and just adjudication of the case. However, it will ultimately be up to the court to decide whether to include them as parties.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Time limitation to file partition suit on entire residential layout formed 20 yr back",
    "answer": "Dear client,If the GPA holder Kishan is not alive and cannot be located, the court may appoint a legal representative or guardian ad litem to act on his behalf. The legal representative or guardian will be responsible for representing Kishan's interests in the case. If the legal representative or guardian cannot be located, the court may proceed with the case without them, and any decision made by the court may be binding on Kishan's interests.The principle of partition will depend on the specific laws and regulations in your jurisdiction. In general, when property is developed into a residential layout, the value of each individual site is determined based on its location, size, and other factors. If the property is being divided among multiple owners, the value of each owner's share will be based on the value of their respective sites.Sayed will need to submit all relevant documents related to the property, including the mother deed, any sale agreements, and any other legal documents related to the property. He will also need to provide evidence of his relationship to the property and his claim to a share of the property.The holding of the property owner mentioned in the mother deed will depend on the specific terms of the mother deed and any subsequent agreements or contracts. In general, if the property is developed into a residential layout and sold as individual sites, the owner mentioned in the mother deed may retain ownership of any unsold sites or receive a share of the proceeds from the sale of individual sites.It is unlikely that criminal action can be taken against Sayed on the basis of religious discrimination or creating enmity in the residents. However, if there is evidence that Sayed has violated any civil or criminal laws, he may be subject to legal action. It is recommended that Sayed consult with an experienced attorney who can review the details of the case and provide guidance on any potential legal risks.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If during the investigation, the police find evidence against the buyers for criminal conspiracy, they can be added as accused.Yes, you can file a complaint under IPC sections 445 for house-breaking against the unknown persons who broke the lock on your property.If the SHO has refused to lodge an FIR, you can file a complaint with the Superintendent of Police (SP) or with the Magistrate under Section 156(3) of theCriminal Procedure Code(CrPC). If you fear that filing an application under CrPC 156(3) may offend the police officers, you may continue following up with the SP office for a few more days. If there is still no response, you can file the application with the court, and the court will direct the police to register an FIR and investigate the case.Regarding the police asking for the original sale deed, there is no provision in the law that allows them to force you to submit the original document. You can submit a certified copy or a photocopy of the sale deed for their investigation. If the police insist on taking the original, you can request them to give you a receipt for the document, and make a photocopy of it before handing it over to them.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Refund to buyer or person who paid the money",
    "answer": "Dear client ,It is important to note that the validity and enforceability of a contract or agreement depends on the specific terms and conditions contained within it. In this case, the agreement to sale was between you and the buyer, and you received the advance token money in the form of a demand draft made out in another person's name. You returned the money to the buyer after the sale transaction could not be completed.It is possible that the buyer could take the position that the money was not paid to the person who made the draft and therefore you have violated the agreement to sale. However, since you returned the money to the buyer and not the person who made the draft, it is unlikely that the buyer will be successful in any attempt to enforce the agreement to sale against you. It is always advisable to have clear terms in the agreement regarding the payment and refund of advance token money.The person who purchased the draft from the bank does not have any claim to the money, as the demand draft was made out in their name and they received the value of the demand draft when they purchased it from the bank. The transaction was completed between them and the bank, and they do not have any right to claim the money from you.It is recommended that you consult a lawyer in your jurisdiction to get a legal opinion on the specific facts and circumstances of your case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Being convicted for possession of a controlled substance can have serious consequences for your future, including the potential to impact your visa process and passport verification. Here are some factors to consider:Visa Process: When applying for a visa to Canada, you will likely be required to disclose any criminal convictions on your application. This includes the possession of controlled substances. If you have been convicted of a drug offense, it could potentially affect your eligibility for a visa. However, every case is different, and the decision ultimately rests with the Canadian immigration authorities.PCC: A Police Clearance Certificate (PCC) is a document that confirms whether an individual has any criminal record. If you have been convicted of a drug offense, it will likely appear on your PCC. Again, every case is different, and the impact on your PCC will depend on the specific circumstances of your case.Passport Verification: When you apply for a passport, your criminal record will be checked. If you have been convicted of a drug offense, it could potentially affect your ability to obtain a passport.In order to assess the impact of your conviction on your future plans, it is recommended that you consult with an experienced criminal defense lawyer. They can help you understand the legal process, explore your options, and provide guidance on how to minimize the impact of the conviction on your future plans.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This applies even if the property is being sold through the SARFAESI Act.Therefore, it is advisable to register the property and pay the appropriate stamp duty as per the market value of the property. The sub-registrar's office should then enter the transaction in Book1 as per the registration act, which will ensure that the transfer of ownership is legally recognized and recorded.Entering the transaction in Book1 will also ensure that your name is reflected on the Encumbrance Certificate (EC) whenever you request for it. An EC is a document that shows all the transactions or encumbrances on a particular property, and it is issued by the sub-registrar's office. By registering the property and entering the transaction in Book1, you can ensure that your ownership of the property is reflected in the EC. This can be important for future legal or financial transactions related to the property.It is recommended that you consult with a lawyer to understand the stamp duty and registration requirements for your specific case, and to ensure that all legal procedures are followed correctly.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The sub registrar is right in refusing to register the sale certificate in book-I, because to register the document in Book-I, it is mandatory that the stamp duty as applicable has to be paid, do not be under misguidance.  Therefore instead of getting the sale certificate registered, you can ask the banker to execute the sale deed itself and register it so that the stamp duty can be paid once for all.2.   You will not be able to sell the property by executing a registered sale deed in favor of the  prospective buyer if you do not have a registered sale deed on your name, because it is the title document by which you can claim title to the property.The sale certificate is a mere certificate for selling the property to you and not a sale deed.The banker will tell that the sale deed is not required whereas it is not the procedure.The sale certificate issued by the banker is just an acknowledgment for receiving the money after having received money towards sale consideration, whereas this will not convey the title from the seller(banker) to you.Hence better do not approach any short cut method to remain silent about the stamp duty and the registration of the sale deed etc on any misguidance.You say that the sub registrar is not accepting the register the sale certificate without paying the stamp duty, therefore instead of paying double stamp duty, i.e., one for sale certificate and another for sale deed, you better get the sale deed executed and pay the tamp duty for the sale deed itself.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear client,Under Hindu law, an adopted child has equal rights in the property of the adoptive family as that of a biological child. However, the rights of an adopted child in the property of the natural family are not recognized unless the adoption was made with the consent of the natural parents or the property is inherited by the adoptive family from the natural family.In your case, it appears that your father was adopted by a lady and the agricultural property was claimed by her after the death of her husband. It is important to ascertain whether the property was acquired by the adopted mother through inheritance or as self-acquired property. If the property was inherited, your father would have had a share in it, and consequently, you and your siblings would have a share in it too.If the property was self-acquired, it would belong to the adopted mother, and upon her demise, it would devolve upon her legal heirs as per the applicable laws of inheritance. In that case, your adopted mother would have had the right to bequeath the property as per her wishes.Regarding the transactions carried out between your adopted mother and your siblings, their validity would depend on the nature of the transaction and the documents executed. If the transactions are not registered, they may not be legally valid.In order to ascertain your legal rights in the property, it is advisable to consult a local lawyer and provide them with all the relevant details. The lawyer can examine the relevant documents and advise you on the legal recourse available to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The right to such property acquires at birth unlike other laws of inheritance where right arises upon the death of the the owner.Hope this brings some clarity to your question and your sense of entitlements.Meaning ofancestral propertyin India-Anancestral propertymeans apropertywhich is devolved upon heirs by the 3 generations above them;father,father's fatherorfather's fathers'father. ... That means when a coparcener acquires his share inancestral propertythan hecanmake awillto that share and bequest it.Meaning of ancestral property in India-An ancestral property means a property which is devolved upon heirs by the 3 generations above them; father, father’s father or father’s fathers’ father. It passes to the next three generations.Meaning of will-A will means a document in which a person specifies the method to be applied in management and distribution of properties after his death.The basic principle involved is that the property should be four generations old. The right to use and acquire property is accrued by persons through birth itself. The division of property is per stripes i.e. that share of one generation is calculated first than the share of successive generations is subdivided according to share of their predecessor. These basic elements are for governing majorly the Hindus.If A inherits property, whether movable or immovable, from his father or father’s father, or father’s father’sfather, it is ancestral property as regards his male issue. If A has no son, son’s son, or son’s son’s son in existence at the time when he inherits the property, he holds the property as absolute owner thereof, and he can deal with it as he pleases . A person inheriting property from his three immediate paternal ancestors holds it, and must hold it, in coparcenary with his sons, sons’ sons and sons’ sons’ sons but as regards other relations he holds it and is entitled to hold it, as his absolute property.”[1]Now answer to the question is that that will to ancestral property is not entirelyillegal. That means when a coparcener acquires his share in ancestral property than he can make a will to that share and bequest it. However will shall be executed after the death of the testator and if the coparcener before acquiring a share makes a will than that will be illegal. Share in ancestral property will be inherited by coparceners. So he can make a will to his share in ancestral property.As whatever he acquires is his share now and he can dispose his assets according to his wishes.Surender Kumar vs Dhani Ram CS (OS) No.1737/2012 decided on 18th January, 2016 Hon’ble Mr. J. Valmiki Mehta of Delhi High Court ruled-If a person dies after passing of theHindu Succession Act, 1956 and there is no HUF existing at the time of the death of such a person, inheritance of an immovable property of such a person by his successors-in-interest is no doubt inheritance of an ‘ancestral’ property but the inheritance is as a self acquired property in the hands of the successor and not as an HUF property although the successor(s) indeed inherits ‘ancestral’ property i.e. a property belonging to his paternal ancestor.=====================================================HINDU WOMENS PROPERTY…. HOW IT DEVOLVELSA hindu woman holds the property as an absolute owner and now she can dispose off the property as her own property. The concept of ancestral property does not apply to a property held by a hindu woman. Your maternal grandmother (naani) can will the property to anyone. However, if she dies intestate (without a will) then the property will devolve as per the rules of succession inHindu Succession Act, specifically, section 15. In that case, the property goes to the legal heirs of the woman on her father’s side if she received the property from her father’s side and to her husband’s side if she received the property from her husband side.HomeIndia newsDaughters born before 2005 have right in their fathers’ property, says Supreme CourtDaughters born before 2005 have right in their fathers’ property, says Supreme CourtIn a ruling that will ensure equality between men and women, the Supreme Court on Friday made it clear that women born before 2005 have equal right on ancestral property.In a ruling that will ensure equality between men and women, the Supreme Court on Friday made it clear that women born before 2005 have equal right on ancestral property.In a ruling that will ensure equality between men and women, the Supreme Court on Friday made it clear that women born before 2005 have equal right on ancestral property. The apex court stated that theHindu Succession Act2005 which gives equal rights to daughters on ancestral property, will be applied to all women including those born before the year.A bench of Justices AK Sikri and Ashok Bhushan said that the share in ancestral property could not be denied, to a woman, on the ground that she was born before the law was passed, and the law was applicable in all property disputes filed before 2005 and pending when the law was framed. The bench added that the amended law stipulated that a daughter would be a “coparcener” (one who shares equally in inheritance of an undivided property) since birth, and have the same rights and liabilities as a son.“The law relating to a joint Hindu family governed by the Mitakshara law has undergone unprecedented changes. The said changes have been brought forward to address the growing need to merit equal treatment to the nearest female relatives, namely daughters. These changes have been sought… on the touchstone of equality, thus seeking to remove the perceived disability and prejudice to which a daughter was subjected,” the bench was quoted as saying by TOI.Passing the order on a plea filed by two sisters seeking a share in their late father’s property, the court said that the law was amended to give women equal status with men in matters related to ancestral property. The two sisters approached the apex court after the trial court in 2007 dismissed their plea saying that they were not entitled to any share as they were born before 2005. The High Court also rejected their plea. Setting aside the High Court order, the Supreme Court said that the year of birth was not a criterion to decide whether a woman was covered under the amended law.In 2015, the Supreme Court had said that the 2005 amendment in Hindu law will not give property rights to a daughter if the father died before the amendment came into force. The court held that the amended provisions of the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, could not have retrospective effect despite it being a social legislation. The court said the father would have had to be alive on September 9, 2005, if the daughter were to become a co-sharer with her male siblings.=======================================================Consequence of Amendment made by Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 – rights & liabilities of a daughter memberDaughter shall be a Coparcener of Hindu Family Property.If a Hindu dies, the coparcener property shall be allotted to the daughter as is allotted to sons.If a female coparcener dies before partition, then children of such coparcener would eligible for allotment assuming a partition had taken place immediately before her demise.No recovery is made for ancestors dues from son, grandson, or great grandson by applying doctrine of pious obligation.A female member can also seek partition of the dwelling house where the family resides.A widow of a pre-deceased son even though remarried is now eligible for share in property as legal heir of the pre-deceased son of the family.A female can also dispose of her share in coparcenery property at her own will.Expenses incurred on Marriage of a Daughter by HUFEven daughter has become coparcener after Amendment ofHindu Succession Act, 1956, but marriage of daughter still an obligation of the Family under Hindu law.Thus, reasonable amount of gift given on her marriage should not objected by the male coparcener.Devolution of Interest in Co-parcenary PropertySection 6 as substituted by the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005.Section 6(1)provides that w.e.f. 06/09/2005, in a joint Hindu family governed by the Mitakshara law, the daughter of coparcener shall by birth become a coparcener in her own right in the same manner as the son. She shall have the same rights in the coparcenery property as she would have had if she had been a son and she shall be subject to the same liabilities in respect of the said coparcenary property as that of a sonSection 6(2)of the new post amendment section 6 provides that any property to which a female Hindu becomes entitled by virtue of sub section (1) shall be held by her with the incidents of coparcenary ownership. And property is capable of being disposed of by her by testamentary disposition.Section 6(3)provides that–    Where a Hindu dies after the commencement ofHindu Succession Act2005, his interest in the property of joint family, Shall devolve by testamentary of intestate succession.–    As the case may be, under this Act and not by survivorship, & the coparcenary property shall be deemed to have been divided as if a partition has taken place and, daughter is allotted the same share as son.The share of the pre-deceased son or a pre-deceased daughter, as they would have got had they been alive at the time of partition, shall be allotted to the surviving child of such pre-deceased son or of such pre­deceased daughter. [—- do — with the predeceased child of pre-deceased son or a pre-deceased daughter].Section 6(4)provides that no court shall recognize any right to proceed against a son, grandson, or great grandson for the recovery of any debt due from his father, grand father or great grand father.Explanation to Section 6(5) provides that partition for the purposes of this section means any partition made by execution of a deed of partition duly registered under the Registration Act, 1908 (16 of 1908) or partition effected by a decree of a court.Section 6(6)provides that nothing contained in this section shall apply to a partition, which has been effected before the [deleted].Class I heir–Son– Son of Predeceased son.– Son of Predeceased son of Prede­ceased son.– Widow– Widow of Predeceased son– Widow of Predeceased son of Predeceased son– Mother– Daughter– Son of Predeceased Daughter.– Daughter of Predeceased Daugh­ter.– Daughter of Predeceased Son– Daughter of Predeceased Son of Predeceased Son.– Son of Predeceased Daughter of Predeceased Daughter.– Daughter of Predeceased Daughter of Predeceased DaughterSection 8 in TheHindu Succession Act, 1956General rules of succession in the case of males.—The property of a male Hindu dying intestate shall devolve according to the provisions of this Chapter—(a) firstly, upon the heirs, being the relatives specified in class I of the Schedule;(b) secondly, if there is no heir of class I, then upon the heirs, being the relatives specified in class II of the Schedule;(c) thirdly, if there is no heir of any of the two classes, then upon the agnates of the deceased; and(d) lastly, if there is no agnate, then upon the cognates of the deceased.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, Bangalore6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar"

    "answer": "Dear client,Based on the scenario described, it appears that there was a lapse on the part of the Registration Department in registering the land for you despite having filed a petition in the High Court to cancel the earlier issued High Court order. In such a situation, you may be entitled to compensation from the Registration Department for the damages incurred.To address your specific questions:It is possible that similar cases have been filed earlier, but it would be best to consult a local lawyer who is familiar with the laws and practices in your area to get specific guidance.There may be a chance to win the case against the Registration Department, depending on the specific circumstances of your case and the evidence you have to support your claim. Again, a local lawyer would be best equipped to provide guidance on the strength of your case.Without more information about the specific High Court and registration details, it is not possible to provide a court case number for reference.It may be possible to directly approach the Revenue Department (such as the district collector) to seek compensation, but it is advisable to consult a lawyer before doing so to ensure that all legal options are explored and the best approach is taken.In general, it is important to consult a lawyer who is experienced in civil law to help you navigate the legal process and maximize your chances of getting compensation. They can guide you on the legal options available to you, help you gather the necessary evidence, and represent you in court if necessary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The latest proposal, cleared by the state Cabinet in a meeting chaired by Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi, is an extension to an policy rolled out by former CM Capt Amarinder Singh provided such rights to the residents living within Lal Dora only in villages.“People who are living within the ‘Lal Lakir’ in villages and cities do not have ownership rights.

    "question": "Lal Lakir (Red-Line) Property Punjab",
    "answer": "Dear client,To obtain a permanent injunction, you must establish that you have a legal right to the property in question and that the plaintiffs' actions are infringing upon your rights. In the absence of any official record of ownership, the burden of proof may be higher, but it is not impossible to establish ownership.To prove ownership and possession of the property, you can rely on any documentary evidence you may have, such as sale deed, lease agreement, mutation entries, tax receipts, etc. You can also produce witnesses who can testify that you have been in possession of the property for a long time, and that the plaintiffs have not made any claim over it during that time.Additionally, you may consider conducting a survey of the property and creating a detailed map that shows its boundaries and landmarks. This can be useful in establishing your ownership and possession of the property.If the plaintiffs' claim is destined to be dismissed due to lack of possession and ownership evidence, it is possible that you may be able to obtain a permanent injunction against them. However, the final decision will depend on the evidence presented in court and the legal arguments made by both parties.

    "answer": "Dear Sir,You may purchase the property subject to fulfillment of following conditions. For more details visit the link.12 Important Documents To Check Before Buying A New Property1. Sale Deed:A Sale Deed is the core legal document that acts as proof of sale and transfer of ownership of the property from the seller to the buyer. A Sale Deed has to be mandatorily registered. It is important that before the Sale Deed is executed one should execute the sale agreement and should check for compliance of various terms and conditions as agreed upon between the buyer and the seller. Before executing the Sale Deed, the buyer should check whether the property has a clear title. He/she should also confirm if the property is subject to any encumbrance charges.* A seller should settle all the statutory payments such as property tax, cess, water charges, society charges, electricity charges, maintenance charges etc., (subject to the agreement) before executing the Sale Deed.Mother Deed:Mother Deed, also known as the parent document, is an important legal document that traces the origin/antecedent ownership of the property from the start (if the property has had various owners). It is a document that helps in the further sale of the property, thereby establishing the new ownership. In case of absence of the original Mother Deed, certified copies should be obtained from the registering authorities. Mother Deed includes the change in ownership of the property, be it through sale, partition, gift or inheritance. It is very important that the Mother Deed records the references to previous ownership in a sequence and should be continuous and unbroken. In case of a missing sequence, one should refer to the records from the registering offices, revenue records or the recitals (preamble) in other documents. The sequence should be updated until the current owner.2. Building approval plan:A building plan is sanctioned by the BDA (Bangalore Development Authority) or BBMP (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike) or BMRDA (Bangalore Metropolitan Region Development Authority) or BIAPPA (Bangalore International Airport Area Planning Authority) without which the construction of the building is illegal under the Karnataka Municipal Corporations (KMC) Act. A building owner has to get an approved plan from the jurisdictional Commissioner or an officer authorized by such Commissioner. However, the authorities sanction a building approval plan based on the zonal classification, road width, floor area ratio (FAR) and plot depth. A set of documents are required to be submitted by the owner in order to obtain a building approval plan. The documents include- Title Deed, property assessment extract, property PID number, city survey sketch (from the Department of Survey and Settlement and Land Records), up-to-date tax paid receipt, earlier sanctioned plans (if any), property drawings, 2 copies of demand drafts, foundation certificate (if any) and a land use certificate issued by the competent authority (viz., Dy. Commissioner). It is mandatory that the building owner hires a registered architect who will draw a plan meeting the applicable bye laws. One can get a building approval plan within 4-5 working days if all the requirements are met, via the newly invented BBMP software- Automated Building Approval Plan.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, Bangalore6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar"

    "question": "Hindu marriage law",
    "answer": "Divorce allows a person to break free from an onerous marital relationship. But since, marriage is not merely a contract but a very important societal institution. The law is interested in protecting marriage and not allowing it to be severed only by choice and on ordinary wear and tear. Since society in countries like ours takes special interest in protecting it – In our country, to get a divorce, one needs to prove certain grounds, e.g., cruelty/adultery, desertion, etc.  Known as matrimonial offenses.As per the law, as it stands, our legal system does not allow divorce to be granted on the ground of irretrievable breakdown of marriage or irreconcilable differences. To get a divorce, one has to prove wrongdoing on the part of the other spouse and impeccable conduct on one’s own in order to win. Divorce is granted only on proof of fault or guilty conduct of one party and innocence by the other. The most common ground for divorce is cruelty. Another common ground is adultery (sexual intercourse outside wedlock); one instance of lapse of virtue can lead to divorce.Divorce by Mutual Consentis the easiest way to get a divorce, in this both parties work out their terms on which they agree to part ways- file petition in the court, which is finalised in 6 months. However there may be cases where the decision to part may not be a mutual one, and it is only one party who considers the union to be troublesome and worth getting rid off. Such situations lead to Divorce being contested.So you may file a case for divorcé either in UK or India .

The court held that when the legislative act provided for it, no bye-law could create another concept to defeat the legislative intent.The appeal filed by the society agaisnt the dismissal of appeal by Bombay high court before supreme court was dismissed.Therefore the group 2 which states that one unit per member for the voting rights is correct.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

However, it does not specify the method of determining voting rights.In the absence of any specific provisions in the bylaws of the association or the Telangana Apartments Act, 1987, it is generally advisable to follow the principle of 'one unit, one vote'. This principle ensures that each unit owner has an equal say in the affairs of the association, regardless of the size or number of units owned. It is a fair and democratic method of voting and is commonly followed in most housing societies and apartment associations in India.However, you may seek the guidance of a local property lawyer to check if there are any specific provisions under the Act or local laws that may apply to your case.

In your case, since your mother died intestate (without a Will), the above sections may be applicable.As per theHindu Succession Act, your father, as the Class-I legal heir, would have had an equal share in the property with you as the Class-I female heir. However, if your father has remarried, his second wife and his son from the second marriage may also have a claim to a share in the property, depending on various factors such as when the property was acquired, whether it was ancestral or self-acquired, etc.In order to proceed further, you can file a partition suit before the court, seeking your rightful share in the property.

    "question": "Mother property father passed away",
    "answer": "Dear clientIf the partition is done, the court may consider different options for dividing the property, depending on the specific circumstances of the case. Some possible scenarios are:The property may be sold and the proceeds divided among the co-owners. This is a common solution in cases where it is difficult to physically divide the property, or when none of the co-owners can afford to buy out the others.If the property can be physically divided, the court may order that the house be split into two parts, with each co-owner getting one floor. This is a feasible solution if the property has separate entrances or can be partitioned without causing significant damage.If one co-owner wishes to keep the property and the other co-owners agree to this, the court may order that the remaining co-owners be compensated for their share. The compensation may be in the form of a lump sum payment or a transfer of another property of equivalent value.If you want to keep the property and are willing to pay the other co-owners for their share, you may negotiate with them and come to an agreement outside of court. The amount of compensation will depend on the market or circle rate of the property, as well as any other factors that may affect its value.Ultimately, the court will make a decision based on what is fair and equitable for all co-owners. If you do not want to sell the property and are open to the idea of dividing it from the land, you may discuss this with your co-owners and try to come to a mutually agreeable solution.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This applies even if the property is being sold through the SARFAESI Act.Therefore, it is advisable to register the property and pay the appropriate stamp duty as per the market value of the property. The sub-registrar's office should then enter the transaction in Book1 as per the registration act, which will ensure that the transfer of ownership is legally recognized and recorded.Entering the transaction in Book1 will also ensure that your name is reflected on the Encumbrance Certificate (EC) whenever you request for it. An EC is a document that shows all the transactions or encumbrances on a particular property, and it is issued by the sub-registrar's office. By registering the property and entering the transaction in Book1, you can ensure that your ownership of the property is reflected in the EC. This can be important for future legal or financial transactions related to the property.It is recommended that you consult with a lawyer to understand the stamp duty and registration requirements for your specific case, and to ensure that all legal procedures are followed correctly.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "1. The sub registrar is right in refusing to register the sale certificate in book-I, because to register the document in Book-I, it is mandatory that the stamp duty as applicable has to be paid, do not be under misguidance.  Therefore instead of getting the sale certificate registered, you can ask the banker to execute the sale deed itself and register it so that the stamp duty can be paid once for all.2.   You will not be able to sell the property by executing a registered sale deed in favor of the  prospective buyer if you do not have a registered sale deed on your name, because it is the title document by which you can claim title to the property.The sale certificate is a mere certificate for selling the property to you and not a sale deed.The banker will tell that the sale deed is not required whereas it is not the procedure.The sale certificate issued by the banker is just an acknowledgment for receiving the money after having received money towards sale consideration, whereas this will not convey the title from the seller(banker) to you.Hence better do not approach any short cut method to remain silent about the stamp duty and the registration of the sale deed etc on any misguidance.You say that the sub registrar is not accepting the register the sale certificate without paying the stamp duty, therefore instead of paying double stamp duty, i.e., one for sale certificate and another for sale deed, you better get the sale deed executed and pay the tamp duty for the sale deed itself.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear client,Section 16 of theHindu Succession Actstates that among the heirs specified in the same entry, those who are mentioned earlier will have a preference over those who are mentioned later. Section 18 of theHindu Succession Actspecifies that heirs related to an intestate by full blood will have a preference over heirs related by half-blood, if the nature of the relationship is the same in every other respect.However, these sections are applicable only in cases where there is no Will left by the deceased person. In your case, since your mother died intestate (without a Will), the above sections may be applicable.As per theHindu Succession Act, your father, as the Class-I legal heir, would have had an equal share in the property with you as the Class-I female heir. However, if your father has remarried, his second wife and his son from the second marriage may also have a claim to a share in the property, depending on various factors such as when the property was acquired, whether it was ancestral or self-acquired, etc.In order to proceed further, you can file a partition suit before the court, seeking your rightful share in the property. The court will appoint a commissioner who will divide the property among the legal heirs based on their respective shares.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Mother property father passed away",
    "answer": "Dear clientIf the partition is done, the court may consider different options for dividing the property, depending on the specific circumstances of the case. Some possible scenarios are:The property may be sold and the proceeds divided among the co-owners. This is a common solution in cases where it is difficult to physically divide the property, or when none of the co-owners can afford to buy out the others.If the property can be physically divided, the court may order that the house be split into two parts, with each co-owner getting one floor. This is a feasible solution if the property has separate entrances or can be partitioned without causing significant damage.If one co-owner wishes to keep the property and the other co-owners agree to this, the court may order that the remaining co-owners be compensated for their share. The compensation may be in the form of a lump sum payment or a transfer of another property of equivalent value.If you want to keep the property and are willing to pay the other co-owners for their share, you may negotiate with them and come to an agreement outside of court. The amount of compensation will depend on the market or circle rate of the property, as well as any other factors that may affect its value.Ultimately, the court will make a decision based on what is fair and equitable for all co-owners. If you do not want to sell the property and are open to the idea of dividing it from the land, you may discuss this with your co-owners and try to come to a mutually agreeable solution.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Refund of fees and NOC from advocate",
    "answer": "The practice for asking for a NOC is arbitrary under Article 22(1) of theConstitution of India. (It guarantees every person the right to consult and be defended by any legal practitioner of their choice.)A litigant must be free to change their advocate in case they are not able to pay the fees.party to a litigation has an absolute right to appoint an advocate of his choice, to terminate his services, and to appoint a new advocate. Hence, a party cannot be compelled to obtain 'no objection' from the advocate already on record. Insisting for 'no objection' from the previous advocate will amount to putting a restriction on the right of a party to appoint an advocate of his choice.Recently Karnataka high court has observed and held that .if the Advocate feels that he has any genuine claim or grievance against his client, the appropriate course is to return the brief with endorsement of no objection and agitate such right in an appropriate forum, in accordance with law and not indulge in arm twisting methods by holding on to the brief.\"It was  also held that :There is nothing known as irrevocable vakalatnama. The right of a party to withdraw vakalatnama or authorization given to an advocate is absolute. Hence, a party may discharge his advocate any time, with or without cause by withdrawing his vakalatnama or authorization. On discharging the advocate, the party has the right to have the case file returned to him from the advocate, and any refusal by the advocate to return the fileamounts to misconduct under Section 35 of the Advocates Act, 1961. In any proceeding, including civil and criminal, a party has an absolute right to appoint a new Advocate. Under no circumstance, a party can be denied of his right to appoint a new advocate of his choice. Therefore, it follows that any rule or law imposing restriction on the said right can't be construed as mandatory. Accordingly, Courts, Tribunals or otherauthorities shall not ask for 'no objection' of the advocate already on record, to accept the vakalatnama filed by a new advocate.under no circumstance, a party can be denied of his right to appoint a new advocate of his choice hence you can proceed through a new advocate.You can demand at least half of the huge fee paid by you, if he or she is refusing you may give a complaint against the advocate in the bar council of Karnataka.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear client,If your lawyer has not acted according to your expectations, you have the right to seek a change of lawyer. The NOC is not a necessary document to change your lawyer. You can change your lawyer at any point in time by giving a written notice to your existing lawyer. However, it is advisable to obtain a NOC from the lawyer to avoid any future disputes.Regarding the refund of fees, you should first check the terms of the agreement that you signed with the lawyer. If the agreement provides for a refund of fees in case the lawyer fails to perform his duties, then you can demand a refund of fees. If there is no such clause in the agreement, you can negotiate with the lawyer and try to settle the matter amicably. If the lawyer still refuses to refund your fees, you can file a complaint with the Bar Council of Karnataka.It is important to note that the delay in correcting the scrutiny defects by your lawyer could have affected the outcome of your case. Therefore, it is important to find a good and reliable lawyer who can handle your case efficiently. You can search for a lawyer in Karnataka who specializes in criminal law and has a good track record.

With regards to the trial court asking for the bond and sureties again, it is possible that they require a fresh bond and sureties as the previous ones were furnished at the police station and may not be valid for the trial court proceedings.As for finding sureties, you may try reaching out to friends or family members who reside in Bangalore and who may be willing to stand as sureties for you. Alternatively, you may also try contacting a bail bondsman or surety agency in Bangalore to help you with this.If you are unable to find sureties in Bangalore or are facing difficulty in arranging for them, you may also request the court for an exemption from the requirement of sureties or ask for a relaxation in the amount of bond and sureties required. However, it is important to note that such exemptions or relaxations are subject to the discretion of the court and may not always be granted.In case you decide to bring sureties from Gujarat, you may have to request the court for permission to do so and provide valid reasons for the same. The court may also require additional documents and information to verify the identity and credibility of the sureties.It is advisable to consult with your lawyer and follow their advice on how best to proceed in this matter.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This applies even if the property is being sold through the SARFAESI Act.Therefore, it is advisable to register the property and pay the appropriate stamp duty as per the market value of the property. The sub-registrar's office should then enter the transaction in Book1 as per the registration act, which will ensure that the transfer of ownership is legally recognized and recorded.Entering the transaction in Book1 will also ensure that your name is reflected on the Encumbrance Certificate (EC) whenever you request for it. An EC is a document that shows all the transactions or encumbrances on a particular property, and it is issued by the sub-registrar's office. By registering the property and entering the transaction in Book1, you can ensure that your ownership of the property is reflected in the EC. This can be important for future legal or financial transactions related to the property.It is recommended that you consult with a lawyer to understand the stamp duty and registration requirements for your specific case, and to ensure that all legal procedures are followed correctly.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The sub registrar is right in refusing to register the sale certificate in book-I, because to register the document in Book-I, it is mandatory that the stamp duty as applicable has to be paid, do not be under misguidance.  Therefore instead of getting the sale certificate registered, you can ask the banker to execute the sale deed itself and register it so that the stamp duty can be paid once for all.2.   You will not be able to sell the property by executing a registered sale deed in favor of the  prospective buyer if you do not have a registered sale deed on your name, because it is the title document by which you can claim title to the property.The sale certificate is a mere certificate for selling the property to you and not a sale deed.The banker will tell that the sale deed is not required whereas it is not the procedure.The sale certificate issued by the banker is just an acknowledgment for receiving the money after having received money towards sale consideration, whereas this will not convey the title from the seller(banker) to you.Hence better do not approach any short cut method to remain silent about the stamp duty and the registration of the sale deed etc on any misguidance.You say that the sub registrar is not accepting the register the sale certificate without paying the stamp duty, therefore instead of paying double stamp duty, i.e., one for sale certificate and another for sale deed, you better get the sale deed executed and pay the tamp duty for the sale deed itself.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

As far as federal law is concerned, the Public Gambling Act of 1867 prohibits running or being in charge of a public gambling house, and engaging in any kind of gambling activity in a public place.In addition to the federal law, there are various state laws that regulate gambling. Some states have specifically legalized certain types of gambling, such as horse racing or lotteries, while others have banned all forms of gambling.As an affiliate partner of gambling and casino sites, you are promoting these sites to players in India. While there is no specific law that prohibits affiliate marketing of gambling sites in India, it is possible that your activities may be seen as promoting illegal gambling.It is recommended that you consult with a local lawyer to determine the specific laws in your state related to gambling and affiliate marketing.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Co-owner acting without consent of other owners",
    "answer": "Dear client,As the property matter is already in court, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer who can guide you on the specific details of your case. However, I can provide some general information regarding your questions.In an undivided property, all co-owners have equal rights to use and enjoy the entire property. Therefore, any changes to the property should be made with the consent of all co-owners. If one co-owner makes changes to the property without the consent of the other co-owners, the other co-owners can take legal action against them. The legal action may include filing a suit for injunction to stop the changes, or a suit for partition to divide the property.If a will is suspected to be fraudulent, it can be challenged in court. The legal proceedings for challenging a will are separate from those for probate, but they can be pursued simultaneously. If there is sufficient evidence to support the claim of fraud, criminal charges may also be filed.

    "question": "Co-owner acting without consent of other owners",
    "answer": "Dear client,If the citation has not been served despite the probate being filed in late 2022, there could be various reasons for the delay. It is possible that the court is experiencing a backlog or delay in processing the citation, or that the executor or petitioner has not provided accurate contact information for the parties to be served. It is also possible that there could be foul play involved, but this would need to be investigated further. It is recommended that you consult with an experienced attorney who can review the details of the case and advise you on the best course of action.The timing for inspection of the original will will depend on the laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. Generally, interested parties may request to inspect the original will after it has been admitted to probate. However, the timing and conditions for inspection may vary depending on the specific circumstances of the case. It is recommended that you consult with an experienced attorney who can advise you on the timing and procedure for inspection of the original will.The admissibility of phone recordings without the knowledge of the person being recorded will depend on the laws and procedures in your jurisdiction, as well as the specific circumstances of the recording. In some jurisdictions, it may be illegal to record a conversation without the consent of all parties involved. However, in other jurisdictions, it may be legal to record a conversation as long as one party consents to the recording. It is recommended that you consult with an experienced attorney who can advise you on the admissibility of phone recordings in your jurisdiction and in your specific case.The most cost-effective and time-efficient course of action will depend on the specific circumstances of the case. If there is evidence of forgery or other criminal activity, a criminal suit may be necessary to address these issues. If the main issue is the division of property among multiple parties, a partition suit may be more appropriate.

It has to be considered in general body wherein 3/4th of society members are present.If this decision was approved by the general body in a meeting, then the decision to exclude won't make any difference to proceed with the redevelopment process.2. A society opting for redevelopment can enter into a Development Agreement or a Redevelopment Agreement (\"DA\") either with the developer alone, or with both the developer and individual society members in certain cases. There are many instances in which the society executes the DA with the developer without individual society members. The society therefore acts on behalf of individual members.Under the Development Agreement ,new homes/units are provided to the existing society members in lieu of their earlier accommodation.Permanent Alternate Accommodation Agreementsprovides legal sanctity to the old apartment owner with regards to their new apartment in the new building. It is only after this agreement is executed that homeowners vacate their old building.If the office bearers are refusing to sign PAAA in the capacity of office bearer, then there is no legal infirmity in it, becasue it has to be signed by the individuals in the redevelopment agreement.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Property Dispute with local goons",
    "answer": "I understand this is a difficult situation. It is important to follow legal procedures and not take any actions that may put you in legal trouble.If the police are not providing assistance, then you can file a petition in the court seeking police protection. While it may be difficult to get police protection for a civil case involving construction, it is not impossible. You can also consider hiring private security to protect the property until the case is resolved.Regarding the appeal case, it is important to continue pursuing it and seeking legal advice from a qualified lawyer. If the appeal is successful, then the court can issue an order for possession, which should be enforced by the police.In the meantime, document any incidents of harassment or obstruction by the other party or their goons, as this can be used as evidence in court. Keep all communication with them civil and professional, and do not engage in any confrontations.I would recommend seeking the advice of a lawyer who specializes in property and civil disputes to help guide you through this process. They can advise you on the best course of action based on the specific details of your case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Section 16 of theHindu Succession Actstates that among the heirs specified in the same entry, those who are mentioned earlier will have a preference over those who are mentioned later. Section 18 of theHindu Succession Actspecifies that heirs related to an intestate by full blood will have a preference over heirs related by half-blood, if the nature of the relationship is the same in every other respect.However, these sections are applicable only in cases where there is no Will left by the deceased person. In your case, since your mother died intestate (without a Will), the above sections may be applicable.As per theHindu Succession Act, your father, as the Class-I legal heir, would have had an equal share in the property with you as the Class-I female heir. However, if your father has remarried, his second wife and his son from the second marriage may also have a claim to a share in the property, depending on various factors such as when the property was acquired, whether it was ancestral or self-acquired, etc.In order to proceed further, you can file a partition suit before the court, seeking your rightful share in the property. The court will appoint a commissioner who will divide the property among the legal heirs based on their respective shares.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Mother property father passed away",
    "answer": "Dear clientIf the partition is done, the court may consider different options for dividing the property, depending on the specific circumstances of the case. Some possible scenarios are:The property may be sold and the proceeds divided among the co-owners. This is a common solution in cases where it is difficult to physically divide the property, or when none of the co-owners can afford to buy out the others.If the property can be physically divided, the court may order that the house be split into two parts, with each co-owner getting one floor. This is a feasible solution if the property has separate entrances or can be partitioned without causing significant damage.If one co-owner wishes to keep the property and the other co-owners agree to this, the court may order that the remaining co-owners be compensated for their share. The compensation may be in the form of a lump sum payment or a transfer of another property of equivalent value.If you want to keep the property and are willing to pay the other co-owners for their share, you may negotiate with them and come to an agreement outside of court. The amount of compensation will depend on the market or circle rate of the property, as well as any other factors that may affect its value.Ultimately, the court will make a decision based on what is fair and equitable for all co-owners. If you do not want to sell the property and are open to the idea of dividing it from the land, you may discuss this with your co-owners and try to come to a mutually agreeable solution.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,As the property matter is already in court, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer who can guide you on the specific details of your case. However, I can provide some general information regarding your questions.In an undivided property, all co-owners have equal rights to use and enjoy the entire property. Therefore, any changes to the property should be made with the consent of all co-owners. If one co-owner makes changes to the property without the consent of the other co-owners, the other co-owners can take legal action against them. The legal action may include filing a suit for injunction to stop the changes, or a suit for partition to divide the property.If a will is suspected to be fraudulent, it can be challenged in court. The legal proceedings for challenging a will are separate from those for probate, but they can be pursued simultaneously. If there is sufficient evidence to support the claim of fraud, criminal charges may also be filed.

    "question": "Co-owner acting without consent of other owners",
    "answer": "Dear client,If the citation has not been served despite the probate being filed in late 2022, there could be various reasons for the delay. It is possible that the court is experiencing a backlog or delay in processing the citation, or that the executor or petitioner has not provided accurate contact information for the parties to be served. It is also possible that there could be foul play involved, but this would need to be investigated further. It is recommended that you consult with an experienced attorney who can review the details of the case and advise you on the best course of action.The timing for inspection of the original will will depend on the laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. Generally, interested parties may request to inspect the original will after it has been admitted to probate. However, the timing and conditions for inspection may vary depending on the specific circumstances of the case. It is recommended that you consult with an experienced attorney who can advise you on the timing and procedure for inspection of the original will.The admissibility of phone recordings without the knowledge of the person being recorded will depend on the laws and procedures in your jurisdiction, as well as the specific circumstances of the recording. In some jurisdictions, it may be illegal to record a conversation without the consent of all parties involved. However, in other jurisdictions, it may be legal to record a conversation as long as one party consents to the recording. It is recommended that you consult with an experienced attorney who can advise you on the admissibility of phone recordings in your jurisdiction and in your specific case.The most cost-effective and time-efficient course of action will depend on the specific circumstances of the case. If there is evidence of forgery or other criminal activity, a criminal suit may be necessary to address these issues. If the main issue is the division of property among multiple parties, a partition suit may be more appropriate. It is recommended that you consult with an experienced attorney who can review the details of the case and advise you on the best course of action.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If yes then you shall have to appear on the next date of hearing and file an application before the Court stating that you have not been served with copy of the plaint and its annexure.2. After collecting the copy of the will, you can make inspection of its original from the records since original will shall have to be submitted alongwith the probate application unless special leave has been obtained from the Court to submit copy of the Will and in that case you shall have to file an application for inspection of the original will.3. It has not yet been barred by any court in India.4. For filing criminal suit, you shall have to collect copy of the Will and determine where it has been forged.

    "answer": "Details like GPA, Court litigations in respect of land in question etc are required to be examined. Nevertheless based upon the averments in terms of GPA by Asif and Sayed the agreements including sale deed or sale agreement executed by Kishan being GPA holder are valid and enforceable against said and Asif and Sayed. It is pertinent that stated agreements, sale deed was executed during 2001 to 2005 and more than 20 years. After sale and handing over the possession, in 2016 the act of Sayed raising boundary wall was illegal and Ramesh has ever power to get removed the Wall and to take possession and also to claim damages.1. & 2. The suit is not maintainable.  Though in terms of Article 65 of the Limitation Act the time limit to file a partition suit is 12 years so Sayed to cover lapses has take the plea that he had recent came to know that new purchasers and defendants are in illegal possession on the basis of some forged and concocted document without his consent but the same is not tenable in law being case highly belated and barred by limitation. Conduct of Sayed and Asif shows that defendant were is possession ever since from date of purchase in 2001 to 2005 and it is apparent from Asif and Sayed have never objected nor initiated proceeding to exert their right and ownership. Defendant being bonafide purchasers are in uninterrupted possession so by rule of adverse possessions defendants can assert their rights and possession in respect of their area. Further agreements including sale deed or sale agreement executed by Kishan being GPA holder are valid and enforceable against said and Asif and Sayed and their legal representatives. Rest defense and grounds can be ascertained on the basis of pleadings set by Sayed and details of case.3. No4. Yes5. Court fee shall be decided on the basis of market value of the property.6.

    "answer": "Dear client,This is a complex legal case with several issues. Here are some possible answers to your questions:The suit is maintainable on the ground that Sayed is claiming his share of the ancestral property. Asif and Sayed inherited the property from their father Karim, and Sayed has the right to claim his share.The residents in possession can file an objection on the basis of adverse possession. If they have been in possession of the property for more than 12 years without interruption, they may be able to claim ownership of the property.The suit can be considered as a partial partition suit because Sayed is only claiming his share of the property. However, if he wants to claim the entire property, he may need to file a suit for partition and possession.The Ramesh case and sale of the commercial site may help to defend against Sayed's claim, especially if the sale was conducted in a legally valid manner. However, this will depend on the specific facts and circumstances of the case.The court jurisdiction will depend on the value of the property. If the property value is not mentioned in the valuation slip, the court may determine jurisdiction based on the market value of the property or other relevant factors.Sayed can emphasize to the court that GPA holder Kishan, the developer, and other resident members should be included as parties in the suit because they have an interest in the property and their presence is necessary for a fair and just adjudication of the case. However, it will ultimately be up to the court to decide whether to include them as parties.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,If the GPA holder Kishan is not alive and cannot be located, the court may appoint a legal representative or guardian ad litem to act on his behalf. The legal representative or guardian will be responsible for representing Kishan's interests in the case. If the legal representative or guardian cannot be located, the court may proceed with the case without them, and any decision made by the court may be binding on Kishan's interests.The principle of partition will depend on the specific laws and regulations in your jurisdiction. In general, when property is developed into a residential layout, the value of each individual site is determined based on its location, size, and other factors. If the property is being divided among multiple owners, the value of each owner's share will be based on the value of their respective sites.Sayed will need to submit all relevant documents related to the property, including the mother deed, any sale agreements, and any other legal documents related to the property. He will also need to provide evidence of his relationship to the property and his claim to a share of the property.The holding of the property owner mentioned in the mother deed will depend on the specific terms of the mother deed and any subsequent agreements or contracts. In general, if the property is developed into a residential layout and sold as individual sites, the owner mentioned in the mother deed may retain ownership of any unsold sites or receive a share of the proceeds from the sale of individual sites.It is unlikely that criminal action can be taken against Sayed on the basis of religious discrimination or creating enmity in the residents. However, if there is evidence that Sayed has violated any civil or criminal laws, he may be subject to legal action. It is recommended that Sayed consult with an experienced attorney who can review the details of the case and provide guidance on any potential legal risks.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear clientAccording to Section 8(1) of the Indian Citizenship Act, 1955, if an Indian citizen voluntarily acquires the citizenship of another country, then he/she ceases to be an Indian citizen. This provision applies to all Indian citizens, including minors.However, there is a provision in Section 8(2) that allows a minor child of an Indian citizen who ceases to be an Indian citizen to resume Indian citizenship within one year after attaining the age of majority (i.e. 18 years old). The minor child can do so by making a declaration in the prescribed form and manner.In the case you have mentioned, if you, as a parent, renounce your Indian citizenship and acquire British citizenship, then you will cease to be an Indian citizen. However, your children's Indian citizenship will not automatically cease. They can continue to hold Indian citizenship if they choose to do so.If one parent renounces Indian citizenship and the other parent and children wish to retain Indian citizenship, it is possible for the children to continue to hold Indian citizenship. The children will not automatically lose their Indian citizenship, but they will have to make a declaration to resume their Indian citizenship within one year of attaining the age of majority.It is important to note that the Indian government does not recognize dual citizenship. Therefore, if your children choose to retain their Indian citizenship and you acquire British citizenship, then they will have to travel to India on their Indian passport, and you will have to travel to India on your British passport.In the case where a child holds only Indian citizenship, and both parents renounce Indian citizenship, then the child will not automatically become stateless. The child can either choose to retain their Indian citizenship or apply for the citizenship of the country where they reside, depending on the laws of that country.It is always advisable to seek legal advice from an immigration lawyer or Indian embassy/consulate before making any decisions related to citizenship.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It has to be considered in general body wherein 3/4th of society members are present.If this decision was approved by the general body in a meeting, then the decision to exclude won't make any difference to proceed with the redevelopment process.2. A society opting for redevelopment can enter into a Development Agreement or a Redevelopment Agreement (\"DA\") either with the developer alone, or with both the developer and individual society members in certain cases. There are many instances in which the society executes the DA with the developer without individual society members. The society therefore acts on behalf of individual members.Under the Development Agreement ,new homes/units are provided to the existing society members in lieu of their earlier accommodation.Permanent Alternate Accommodation Agreementsprovides legal sanctity to the old apartment owner with regards to their new apartment in the new building. It is only after this agreement is executed that homeowners vacate their old building.If the office bearers are refusing to sign PAAA in the capacity of office bearer, then there is no legal infirmity in it, becasue it has to be signed by the individuals in the redevelopment agreement.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "I understand this is a difficult situation. It is important to follow legal procedures and not take any actions that may put you in legal trouble.If the police are not providing assistance, then you can file a petition in the court seeking police protection. While it may be difficult to get police protection for a civil case involving construction, it is not impossible. You can also consider hiring private security to protect the property until the case is resolved.Regarding the appeal case, it is important to continue pursuing it and seeking legal advice from a qualified lawyer. If the appeal is successful, then the court can issue an order for possession, which should be enforced by the police.In the meantime, document any incidents of harassment or obstruction by the other party or their goons, as this can be used as evidence in court. Keep all communication with them civil and professional, and do not engage in any confrontations.I would recommend seeking the advice of a lawyer who specializes in property and civil disputes to help guide you through this process.

However, it does not specify the method of determining voting rights.In the absence of any specific provisions in the bylaws of the association or the Telangana Apartments Act, 1987, it is generally advisable to follow the principle of 'one unit, one vote'. This principle ensures that each unit owner has an equal say in the affairs of the association, regardless of the size or number of units owned. It is a fair and democratic method of voting and is commonly followed in most housing societies and apartment associations in India.However, you may seek the guidance of a local property lawyer to check if there are any specific provisions under the Act or local laws that may apply to your case.

    "answer": "Dear clientIf the partition is done, the court may consider different options for dividing the property, depending on the specific circumstances of the case. Some possible scenarios are:The property may be sold and the proceeds divided among the co-owners. This is a common solution in cases where it is difficult to physically divide the property, or when none of the co-owners can afford to buy out the others.If the property can be physically divided, the court may order that the house be split into two parts, with each co-owner getting one floor. This is a feasible solution if the property has separate entrances or can be partitioned without causing significant damage.If one co-owner wishes to keep the property and the other co-owners agree to this, the court may order that the remaining co-owners be compensated for their share. The compensation may be in the form of a lump sum payment or a transfer of another property of equivalent value.If you want to keep the property and are willing to pay the other co-owners for their share, you may negotiate with them and come to an agreement outside of court. The amount of compensation will depend on the market or circle rate of the property, as well as any other factors that may affect its value.Ultimately, the court will make a decision based on what is fair and equitable for all co-owners. If you do not want to sell the property and are open to the idea of dividing it from the land, you may discuss this with your co-owners and try to come to a mutually agreeable solution.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "If the society has passed a resolution for a negotiated settlement with a final sum of 16 lakhs and a draft of the resolution has been circulated on WhatsApp and received approval from the members, then it is important that you have a copy of the signed resolution. You can make a written request to the society for a copy of the signed resolution and if they refuse to provide it, you can escalate the matter to higher authorities such as the Registrar of Societies or a consumer court.Before making any payment, it is important to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the terms of the resolution and that the payment is made only in accordance with those terms. You can consider sending a written communication to the society stating that you are willing to pay the full amount as per the resolution, but only if the society provides you with a copy of the signed resolution.It is also important to keep a record of all communication with the society, including emails, letters, and WhatsApp messages. If the society makes any further demands after the payment is made, you can use these records to demonstrate that you have already paid the amount as per the resolution and that any further demands are illegal.If the society continues to withhold the signed resolution or makes further demands after payment is made, you may need to seek legal assistance to protect your rights and interests.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, the court in Kattappana may take into consideration the divorce granted in Qatar when making its decision.As for the Christian marriage, under Indian law, Christian marriages are governed by the Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872, which allows for divorce on certain grounds. However, the laws governing divorce in Qatar may be different, and you will need to consult with a lawyer in Qatar to understand your rights and options.If your ex-wife has submitted two different statements in Qatar and in Kattappana, this may be considered perjury and can be used as evidence against her in court.

    "answer": "Dear clientAccording to Section 8(1) of the Indian Citizenship Act, 1955, if an Indian citizen voluntarily acquires the citizenship of another country, then he/she ceases to be an Indian citizen. This provision applies to all Indian citizens, including minors.However, there is a provision in Section 8(2) that allows a minor child of an Indian citizen who ceases to be an Indian citizen to resume Indian citizenship within one year after attaining the age of majority (i.e. 18 years old). The minor child can do so by making a declaration in the prescribed form and manner.In the case you have mentioned, if you, as a parent, renounce your Indian citizenship and acquire British citizenship, then you will cease to be an Indian citizen. However, your children's Indian citizenship will not automatically cease. They can continue to hold Indian citizenship if they choose to do so.If one parent renounces Indian citizenship and the other parent and children wish to retain Indian citizenship, it is possible for the children to continue to hold Indian citizenship. The children will not automatically lose their Indian citizenship, but they will have to make a declaration to resume their Indian citizenship within one year of attaining the age of majority.It is important to note that the Indian government does not recognize dual citizenship. Therefore, if your children choose to retain their Indian citizenship and you acquire British citizenship, then they will have to travel to India on their Indian passport, and you will have to travel to India on your British passport.In the case where a child holds only Indian citizenship, and both parents renounce Indian citizenship, then the child will not automatically become stateless. The child can either choose to retain their Indian citizenship or apply for the citizenship of the country where they reside, depending on the laws of that country.It is always advisable to seek legal advice from an immigration lawyer or Indian embassy/consulate before making any decisions related to citizenship.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It has to be considered in general body wherein 3/4th of society members are present.If this decision was approved by the general body in a meeting, then the decision to exclude won't make any difference to proceed with the redevelopment process.2. A society opting for redevelopment can enter into a Development Agreement or a Redevelopment Agreement (\"DA\") either with the developer alone, or with both the developer and individual society members in certain cases. There are many instances in which the society executes the DA with the developer without individual society members. The society therefore acts on behalf of individual members.Under the Development Agreement ,new homes/units are provided to the existing society members in lieu of their earlier accommodation.Permanent Alternate Accommodation Agreementsprovides legal sanctity to the old apartment owner with regards to their new apartment in the new building. It is only after this agreement is executed that homeowners vacate their old building.If the office bearers are refusing to sign PAAA in the capacity of office bearer, then there is no legal infirmity in it, becasue it has to be signed by the individuals in the redevelopment agreement.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "1. if majority members have resolved in favour of the redevelopment and a resolution to that effect is passed in a meeting of general body of society [in which majority members were present who were entitled to vote],then the society can go ahead with signing the DA with the builder2. the PAAA would be between the builder and the member. in many cases the society is joined as a confirming party. the builder has to give all the redevelopment benefits equally to all the society members and there cannot be any discrimination or favoritism3. if the society is stopping the builder from entering into a PAAA with you then you will have to take up this matter with the society registrar and if required by filing a case in a co-operative court. since the builder is not against you, he will be joined as a formal party in the proposed proceedingsYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

No, says the supreme court: it's one flat, one vote.On November 2, 2007, Justice S B Sinha and Justice Harjit Singh Bedi held that Section 27 of the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act 1960 Act clearly provides for one vote per member.The court observed that even though the objective behind \"one family, one vote\" may be laudable, it is necessary to see whether such a concept is provided for under the act. The court held that when the legislative act provided for it, no bye-law could create another concept to defeat the legislative intent.The appeal filed by the society agaisnt the dismissal of appeal by Bombay high court before supreme court was dismissed.Therefore the group 2 which states that one unit per member for the voting rights is correct.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

However, it does not specify the method of determining voting rights.In the absence of any specific provisions in the bylaws of the association or the Telangana Apartments Act, 1987, it is generally advisable to follow the principle of 'one unit, one vote'. This principle ensures that each unit owner has an equal say in the affairs of the association, regardless of the size or number of units owned. It is a fair and democratic method of voting and is commonly followed in most housing societies and apartment associations in India.However, you may seek the guidance of a local property lawyer to check if there are any specific provisions under the Act or local laws that may apply to your case. The lawyer can help you draft the bylaws of the association and ensure that they are in compliance with the applicable laws.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The lawyer can assist in providing legal advice, cross-examining witnesses and presenting evidence. The BOY SIDE should also maintain a calm demeanor during the meeting and avoid any arguments or confrontation.Girl Side and good approach with MLA and MLA’s PA comes personally and influence the Women police officer. Under political pressure, what action can women police officer take against BOY and his family members like FIR, etc…???? And How to get Save from it????The Women Cell should act independently and impartially. If there is any attempt by the Girl Side to influence the police officer or put political pressure on the BOY SIDE, then the BOY SIDE should immediately bring it to the attention of the higher authorities.What things that BOY and his family members, take care of, while giving any “Written Statement” in Women Cell??The BOY SIDE should be truthful and provide accurate information in their written statement.

If the reconciliation efforts taken by the women police fails to yield any result then the women police may register FIR against all of them on the basis of the complaint, even though the complaint is false and baseless.Then he has to challenge the same only during trial proceedings after obtaining bail for all the accused.2. On the next meeting, as the girl is not going to agree for rejoining, the boy side may agree to give divorce but on any settlement terms otherwise the boy side can refuse to agree for any terms and then immediately file an application for anticipatory bail for all.3. If the police is bent upon to register FIR, then the boy side can obtain bail immediately to avoid arrest.4. They have to give statement that the complaint is false and that they did not demand any money or dowry from her, she has left the home on her own and now she is filing this false complaint on the instigation of her parents.5.

AmendedCheque BounceProvisions- 143A & 148…what is it?Ans:Section 143A- It empowers the Court to order the drawer of the cheque to pay Interim Compensation  - 20% - Without depositing this amount the accused cannot defend the case.Section 148– It empowers the Appellate Court to order payment pending the appeal against convictionThe Appellate Court may order the appellant to deposit an amount which shall be a minimum of 20% of the fine or compensation awarded by the trial Court.This amount shall be in addition to the amount already paid by the appellant under Section 143A.It received the assent of the President and was notified in the Official Gazette on 02.08.2018In which court do I need to file the complaint case under Section 138 N.I. Act in case drawer did not pay after receiving notice?A complaint case under Section 138 N.I. Act can be filed in any competent court in whose jurisdiction any of the following acts have occurred:a) Place of drawing of the cheque,b) Address of bank where cheque was presented (holders bank address),c) Address of bank where cheque is payable (drawers bank address)d) Place from where notice was received by drawer of chequea. It is possible that each of these four acts could have occurred at different localities. The complainant can choose any one the above places to determine jurisdiction of court where they wish to file complaint.2. What can I do if it has been more than 30 days since I received information of dishonour of cheque?If the cheque is still valid i.e. 3 months (currently) have not passed from the date of its issue, you can represent the cheque again to your banker as there is no restriction regarding the number of times a cheque can be presented and that every subsequent representation and dishonour gives rise to fresh cause of action for filing complaint. It may be noted that once a notice for payment is given then the holder must file a complaint under Section 138 N.I. Act within 30 days from expiry of notice period as a fresh cause of action will not arise if the cheque is presented again and it is dishonoured and failure to file complaint will lead to loss of remedy available under Section 138 N.I. Act.3. How long after notice has been served can I file a case against the drawer?After giving notice you need to file a complaint case against drawer under Section 138 N.I. Act within 30 days from the expiry of notice period i.e. 15 days. In other words you need to file complaint case against drawer within 45 days (15+30) from the date of issue of notice. Failure to do so will lead to loss of remedy under Section 138 N.I. Act; however, you can file a summary suit for recovery of money and initiate criminal proceedings underSection 420I.P.C. within 3 years from date of issue of cheque.4. What can I do if I do not have the drawer's address?You need the address of the drawer of cheque to issue notice as contemplated under provisions of N.I. Act; also the address is necessary if you wish to avail other legal remedies available to you. You can send the notice to the last known address. In case the address of the drawer has changed and the drawer has not left a forwarding address and the notice is returned with the noting that addressee is not available at the address or addressee has left without leaving a forwarding address then you need to file a complaint case after 15 days (notice period) of receipt of such information or returned notice and within 30 days from expiry of notice period. Failure to do so will lead to loss of remedy under Section 138 N.I. Act; however, you can file a summary suit for recovery of money and initiate criminal proceedings underSection 420I.P.C. within 3 years from date of issue of cheque5. What should I do if the notice was returned and could not be served to the drawer?When a notice is returned to the sender as unclaimed or with the noting that addressee is not available at the address or addressee has left without leaving a forwarding address then the date of receipt of such information or returned notice would be the commencing date for the notice period of 15 days. Complaint case under Section 138 N.I. Act must be filed within 30 days from expiry of notice period. Such reckoning would be without prejudice to the right of the drawer of the cheque to show that he had no knowledge that the notice was brought to his address or previous address.6.

Act are not applicable e.g. Cheque given as Gift, in charity, donation etc.9. Can a cheque issued in security attract offence under Section 138 N.I. Act?With respect to the dishonour of cheques given as security, legal position is not very clear. It is subject to presumption and proof thereof that may be given by either party in support of their case. High Court of Delhi in the case of M/s Datt Enterprises ltd. vs. V.K.Dua held that the security cheque does not attract the provisions of Section 138 N.I. Act., if cheques were given as a security cheque as per past practice and pending reconciliation of accounts and not towards discharge of any liability.10.

Act was made to provide an additional criminal remedy over and above the civil remedies available; to provide a speedy and effective remedy to holder of dishonoured cheque.b. Summary suit for recovery of money takes time (approximately 3 to 5 years) and criminal proceedings underSection 420I.P.C. does not provide any provision for recovery of money and is meant only for prosecution of the drawer of the cheque who entertains dishonest intention to cheat.12. What is a summary suit for recovery of money?Summary suit is a civil legal proceeding initiated for recovery of money due under any written agreement, cheque etc. These proceedings are different from normal recovery suit, as here the liability to prove that petitioner is not liable to recover any amount is on defendant for which he needs to obtain leave to defend from the court.13. What is the validity of the cheque in day to day business?The current validity of cheques is 6 months. However, please note that from April 1, 2012. The validity will change to three months as per recent directive of RBI (under Sec. 35A, Banking Regulation Act, 1949)14. What can I do if a cheque given to me has been dishonoured?a.

What can I do if I do not file a complaint within 30 days from expiry of notice period?If you have not filed a complaint case within 30 days after expiry of notice period, you can file a summary suit for recovery of money and initiate criminal proceedings underSection 420I.P.C. within 3 years from the date of issue of cheque.17. What can I do if it has been more than 30 days since I received information of dishonour of cheque and 6 months has passed from the date of issue of cheque?a. Other remedies are also available to recover the cheque amount. You can file a summary suit for recovery of money and initiate criminal proceedings underSection 420I.P.C. within 3 years from date of issue of cheque. In case the cheque was never presented during its validity period then a summary suit is the only available remedy for recovery of money.(Notice can be given to drawer up to 3 years from date of issue of cheque for instituting a summary suit for recovery of money. Criminal proceedings for prosecution of drawer can also be instituted within 3 years from date of issue of cheque underSection 420I.P.C.)18. The drawer is asking me to settle the claim at a reduced value. What should I do?Its up to you to settle the claim at a reduced value as the same will save your precious time, as well as legal hassle. Now-a-days courts are also encouraging amicable settlement between the parties. However, if you settle the dishonoured cheque amount at a reduced value, you will lose all remedies available under law.19. What remedy do I have if the drawer delays in settling after conviction?In a recent 2010 judgement, Supreme Court has laid strict rules to deal with such delaying tactics. Delay in settling cheques bounced will cost up to 20% of the cheque amount post-conviction. This is detailed as: 10% at District Court level; 15% at the High Court level; and up to 20% at the Supreme Court level. For e.g., Defaulter going for settlement will have to pay 10% of the cheque amount to avoid going to the jail.20. Can I recover interest and legal expenses from the drawer of the dishonoured cheque?Yes, you can recover interest and legal expenses from the drawer of the dishonoured cheque in a summary suit for recovery of money, but not in the proceedings initiated under Section 138 N.I. Act. However, under Section 138 N.I. Act the award maybe higher than the cheque amount.21. What should I do if the drawer does not make payment upon receipt of notice?You can adopt either or any of the remedies available to you:a) Can file a criminal complaint against drawer of cheque under Section 138 of N.I. Act.b) Can file a summary suit for recovery of money, interest and legal expenses.c) Can file a criminal complaint against drawer of cheque underSection 420of I.P.C. Please note that there is no provision for recovery of money underSection 420I.P.C. and this section is meant only for prosecution of the drawer of the cheque.In case a person has filed suit for recovery, then he is not precluded from filing a complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act andSection 420of theIndian Penal Code. The pendency of criminal matters would not be an impediment to proceeding with the civil suits.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, Bangalore6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar"

This is to ensure that the employee's absence does not affect the functioning of the department or office. In the case of school principals, the requirement for a NOC may vary depending on the policies and rules of the Education Department of Madhya Pradesh.I would advise you to check with your father's employer or the Education Department of Madhya Pradesh to confirm if a NOC is required for your father to travel to Dubai. They should be able to provide you with the latest circulars or guidelines regarding the same.

It has to be considered in general body wherein 3/4th of society members are present.If this decision was approved by the general body in a meeting, then the decision to exclude won't make any difference to proceed with the redevelopment process.2. A society opting for redevelopment can enter into a Development Agreement or a Redevelopment Agreement (\"DA\") either with the developer alone, or with both the developer and individual society members in certain cases. There are many instances in which the society executes the DA with the developer without individual society members. The society therefore acts on behalf of individual members.Under the Development Agreement ,new homes/units are provided to the existing society members in lieu of their earlier accommodation.Permanent Alternate Accommodation Agreementsprovides legal sanctity to the old apartment owner with regards to their new apartment in the new building. It is only after this agreement is executed that homeowners vacate their old building.If the office bearers are refusing to sign PAAA in the capacity of office bearer, then there is no legal infirmity in it, becasue it has to be signed by the individuals in the redevelopment agreement.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

No, says the supreme court: it's one flat, one vote.On November 2, 2007, Justice S B Sinha and Justice Harjit Singh Bedi held that Section 27 of the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act 1960 Act clearly provides for one vote per member.The court observed that even though the objective behind \"one family, one vote\" may be laudable, it is necessary to see whether such a concept is provided for under the act. The court held that when the legislative act provided for it, no bye-law could create another concept to defeat the legislative intent.The appeal filed by the society agaisnt the dismissal of appeal by Bombay high court before supreme court was dismissed.Therefore the group 2 which states that one unit per member for the voting rights is correct.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear client,Yes, Section 14(f) of the Telangana Apartments Act, 1987 provides for the percentage of undivided interest in the common areas and facilities appurtenant to each apartment and its owner for all purposes, including voting. However, it does not specify the method of determining voting rights.In the absence of any specific provisions in the bylaws of the association or the Telangana Apartments Act, 1987, it is generally advisable to follow the principle of 'one unit, one vote'. This principle ensures that each unit owner has an equal say in the affairs of the association, regardless of the size or number of units owned. It is a fair and democratic method of voting and is commonly followed in most housing societies and apartment associations in India.However, you may seek the guidance of a local property lawyer to check if there are any specific provisions under the Act or local laws that may apply to your case. The lawyer can help you draft the bylaws of the association and ensure that they are in compliance with the applicable laws.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

AmendedCheque BounceProvisions- 143A & 148…what is it?Ans:Section 143A- It empowers the Court to order the drawer of the cheque to pay Interim Compensation  - 20% - Without depositing this amount the accused cannot defend the case.Section 148– It empowers the Appellate Court to order payment pending the appeal against convictionThe Appellate Court may order the appellant to deposit an amount which shall be a minimum of 20% of the fine or compensation awarded by the trial Court.This amount shall be in addition to the amount already paid by the appellant under Section 143A.It received the assent of the President and was notified in the Official Gazette on 02.08.2018In which court do I need to file the complaint case under Section 138 N.I. Act in case drawer did not pay after receiving notice?A complaint case under Section 138 N.I. Act can be filed in any competent court in whose jurisdiction any of the following acts have occurred:a) Place of drawing of the cheque,b) Address of bank where cheque was presented (holders bank address),c) Address of bank where cheque is payable (drawers bank address)d) Place from where notice was received by drawer of chequea. It is possible that each of these four acts could have occurred at different localities. The complainant can choose any one the above places to determine jurisdiction of court where they wish to file complaint.2. What can I do if it has been more than 30 days since I received information of dishonour of cheque?If the cheque is still valid i.e. 3 months (currently) have not passed from the date of its issue, you can represent the cheque again to your banker as there is no restriction regarding the number of times a cheque can be presented and that every subsequent representation and dishonour gives rise to fresh cause of action for filing complaint. It may be noted that once a notice for payment is given then the holder must file a complaint under Section 138 N.I. Act within 30 days from expiry of notice period as a fresh cause of action will not arise if the cheque is presented again and it is dishonoured and failure to file complaint will lead to loss of remedy available under Section 138 N.I. Act.3. How long after notice has been served can I file a case against the drawer?After giving notice you need to file a complaint case against drawer under Section 138 N.I. Act within 30 days from the expiry of notice period i.e. 15 days. In other words you need to file complaint case against drawer within 45 days (15+30) from the date of issue of notice. Failure to do so will lead to loss of remedy under Section 138 N.I. Act; however, you can file a summary suit for recovery of money and initiate criminal proceedings underSection 420I.P.C. within 3 years from date of issue of cheque.4. What can I do if I do not have the drawer's address?You need the address of the drawer of cheque to issue notice as contemplated under provisions of N.I. Act; also the address is necessary if you wish to avail other legal remedies available to you. You can send the notice to the last known address. In case the address of the drawer has changed and the drawer has not left a forwarding address and the notice is returned with the noting that addressee is not available at the address or addressee has left without leaving a forwarding address then you need to file a complaint case after 15 days (notice period) of receipt of such information or returned notice and within 30 days from expiry of notice period. Failure to do so will lead to loss of remedy under Section 138 N.I. Act; however, you can file a summary suit for recovery of money and initiate criminal proceedings underSection 420I.P.C. within 3 years from date of issue of cheque5. What should I do if the notice was returned and could not be served to the drawer?When a notice is returned to the sender as unclaimed or with the noting that addressee is not available at the address or addressee has left without leaving a forwarding address then the date of receipt of such information or returned notice would be the commencing date for the notice period of 15 days. Complaint case under Section 138 N.I. Act must be filed within 30 days from expiry of notice period. Such reckoning would be without prejudice to the right of the drawer of the cheque to show that he had no knowledge that the notice was brought to his address or previous address.6. Can Kishan Retd judge Law Chambers assist in drafting of legal notice as required by Section 138 of N.I. Act.?Yes, Kishan Retd judge law Chambers offers assistance in drafting of legal notice as required by Section 138 of N.I. Act.7.

Act are not applicable e.g. Cheque given as Gift, in charity, donation etc.9. Can a cheque issued in security attract offence under Section 138 N.I. Act?With respect to the dishonour of cheques given as security, legal position is not very clear. It is subject to presumption and proof thereof that may be given by either party in support of their case.

Act., if cheques were given as a security cheque as per past practice and pending reconciliation of accounts and not towards discharge of any liability.10.

Act was made to provide an additional criminal remedy over and above the civil remedies available; to provide a speedy and effective remedy to holder of dishonoured cheque.b. Summary suit for recovery of money takes time (approximately 3 to 5 years) and criminal proceedings underSection 420I.P.C. does not provide any provision for recovery of money and is meant only for prosecution of the drawer of the cheque who entertains dishonest intention to cheat.12. What is a summary suit for recovery of money?Summary suit is a civil legal proceeding initiated for recovery of money due under any written agreement, cheque etc. These proceedings are different from normal recovery suit, as here the liability to prove that petitioner is not liable to recover any amount is on defendant for which he needs to obtain leave to defend from the court.13. What is the validity of the cheque in day to day business?The current validity of cheques is 6 months. However, please note that from April 1, 2012. The validity will change to three months as per recent directive of RBI (under Sec. 35A, Banking Regulation Act, 1949)14. What can I do if a cheque given to me has been dishonoured?a.

Act): Give notice under within 30 days of receipt of information of dishonour from the bank.

Act?You will need at the minimum, the following:a) Proof of service of notice - receipt of postal department / courierb) Copy of noticec) Cheque in original16. What can I do if I do not file a complaint within 30 days from expiry of notice period?If you have not filed a complaint case within 30 days after expiry of notice period, you can file a summary suit for recovery of money and initiate criminal proceedings underSection 420I.P.C. within 3 years from the date of issue of cheque.17. What can I do if it has been more than 30 days since I received information of dishonour of cheque and 6 months has passed from the date of issue of cheque?a. Other remedies are also available to recover the cheque amount. You can file a summary suit for recovery of money and initiate criminal proceedings underSection 420I.P.C. within 3 years from date of issue of cheque. In case the cheque was never presented during its validity period then a summary suit is the only available remedy for recovery of money.(Notice can be given to drawer up to 3 years from date of issue of cheque for instituting a summary suit for recovery of money. Criminal proceedings for prosecution of drawer can also be instituted within 3 years from date of issue of cheque underSection 420I.P.C.)18. The drawer is asking me to settle the claim at a reduced value. What should I do?Its up to you to settle the claim at a reduced value as the same will save your precious time, as well as legal hassle. Now-a-days courts are also encouraging amicable settlement between the parties. However, if you settle the dishonoured cheque amount at a reduced value, you will lose all remedies available under law.19. What remedy do I have if the drawer delays in settling after conviction?In a recent 2010 judgement, Supreme Court has laid strict rules to deal with such delaying tactics. Delay in settling cheques bounced will cost up to 20% of the cheque amount post-conviction. This is detailed as: 10% at District Court level; 15% at the High Court level; and up to 20% at the Supreme Court level. For e.g., Defaulter going for settlement will have to pay 10% of the cheque amount to avoid going to the jail.20. Can I recover interest and legal expenses from the drawer of the dishonoured cheque?Yes, you can recover interest and legal expenses from the drawer of the dishonoured cheque in a summary suit for recovery of money, but not in the proceedings initiated under Section 138 N.I. Act. However, under Section 138 N.I. Act the award maybe higher than the cheque amount.21. What should I do if the drawer does not make payment upon receipt of notice?You can adopt either or any of the remedies available to you:a) Can file a criminal complaint against drawer of cheque under Section 138 of N.I. Act.b) Can file a summary suit for recovery of money, interest and legal expenses.c) Can file a criminal complaint against drawer of cheque underSection 420of I.P.C. Please note that there is no provision for recovery of money underSection 420I.P.C. and this section is meant only for prosecution of the drawer of the cheque.In case a person has filed suit for recovery, then he is not precluded from filing a complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act andSection 420of theIndian Penal Code. The pendency of criminal matters would not be an impediment to proceeding with the civil suits.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, Bangalore6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar"

It is possible that the court in Qatar did not know about the case that was already filed in Kattappana.In order to challenge the divorce judgment, you may need to appeal the decision in the Qatar Court of Appeals, which is the next level of appeal after the Court of First Instance. You will need to hire a lawyer to assist you with this.Regarding your restitution case in Kattappana, it will still stand even if a divorce has been granted in Qatar. However, the court in Kattappana may take into consideration the divorce granted in Qatar when making its decision.As for the Christian marriage, under Indian law, Christian marriages are governed by the Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872, which allows for divorce on certain grounds. However, the laws governing divorce in Qatar may be different, and you will need to consult with a lawyer in Qatar to understand your rights and options.If your ex-wife has submitted two different statements in Qatar and in Kattappana, this may be considered perjury and can be used as evidence against her in court.

It has to be considered in general body wherein 3/4th of society members are present.If this decision was approved by the general body in a meeting, then the decision to exclude won't make any difference to proceed with the redevelopment process.2. A society opting for redevelopment can enter into a Development Agreement or a Redevelopment Agreement (\"DA\") either with the developer alone, or with both the developer and individual society members in certain cases. There are many instances in which the society executes the DA with the developer without individual society members. The society therefore acts on behalf of individual members.Under the Development Agreement ,new homes/units are provided to the existing society members in lieu of their earlier accommodation.Permanent Alternate Accommodation Agreementsprovides legal sanctity to the old apartment owner with regards to their new apartment in the new building. It is only after this agreement is executed that homeowners vacate their old building.If the office bearers are refusing to sign PAAA in the capacity of office bearer, then there is no legal infirmity in it, becasue it has to be signed by the individuals in the redevelopment agreement.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "- As per Specific Relief Act, if any employee quits before the notice period, the Employer can only recover the Notice pay, and the Company cannot force to serve the entire notice period.- Further, the resignation decision is the employee’s decision, and the employer cannot sue for breach of contract, if the employee leaves without serving contractual notice.- Except, recovery of the said amount, company cannot harm you for the same- Further, no employer can refused to return the original certificates or to issue relieving letter .If they are doing so, their act is illegal, unjustified and against the fundamental rights of the employee.- Further, the employment bond with the negative covenant is valid and legally enforceable, if the parties agree with their free consent i.e. without force, coercion, undue influence, misrepresentation and mistake, but it is not enforceable, if it is either one sided, unconscionable or unreasonable.- Further, ifan employee leaves the job during the probation period, then it not harm his career, and generally many company stipulates in contract, that during probation period either party can terminate the job with or without any notices.- Hence, notice period is legally not applied in your caseMohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "It is completely acceptable for an employee to resign during their probation period for whatever reason, but notice must be given.The notice period clause would come in the appointment letter where notice period for probation and confirmation clearly mentioned.Most of the companies don’t have notice period in probation period.You need to understand probation period in the job is like a trial period which you get for product & service. Probation is period for both employer & employee..It is very normal for employees to leave during the probation periodGenerally a notice period isbetween two weeks to 1 monthand if not mentioned in your employment then you are not required to serve notice period as there are no specific laws on notice period.The employer cannot sue you if there is no mention about the notice period during probation, provided you confirm that you are still under probation.If you are a confirmed employee then they may insist on compensation for the notice period that was not served as per the employment offer letter terms and conditions.If  there is no sign of payment of the compensation then they may file a recovery suit  only to recover the money and no other legal action can be taken by them.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear client,As per the clause mentioned in your offer letter, you are required to give three months' notice or salary thereof in case you decide to leave the services, subject to the company's discretion. The notice period may be waived off by the company if circumstances make it necessary, or they may relieve you only at the end of the notice period. Similarly, the company can terminate your services by giving three months' notice or salary thereof.Regarding your query about not serving the notice period, if you do not serve the notice period as required by the contract, the company may take legal action against you for breach of contract. This may include recovering damages or compensation for the losses incurred due to your sudden resignation, which could be up to three months' salary or any amount mentioned in the contract.However, it is always advisable to discuss your concerns with your employer and seek an amicable solution, such as early release from the notice period, as it may not be in the best interest of both parties to prolong a difficult situation. Additionally, if you are facing mental health issues, you may want to consider seeking professional help and support to deal with the situation.In any case, it is recommended to consult with a lawyer for a better understanding of your legal options and the potential consequences of any action you take.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If cheques are bounced you can recover the same as follows:=======================================================================Cheque bounceFAQs Negotiable Instruments Act1A. AmendedCheque BounceProvisions- 143A & 148…what is it?Ans:Section 143A- It empowers the Court to order the drawer of the cheque to pay Interim Compensation  - 20% - Without depositing this amount the accused cannot defend the case.Section 148– It empowers the Appellate Court to order payment pending the appeal against convictionThe Appellate Court may order the appellant to deposit an amount which shall be a minimum of 20% of the fine or compensation awarded by the trial Court.This amount shall be in addition to the amount already paid by the appellant under Section 143A.It received the assent of the President and was notified in the Official Gazette on 02.08.2018In which court do I need to file the complaint case under Section 138 N.I. Act in case drawer did not pay after receiving notice?A complaint case under Section 138 N.I. Act can be filed in any competent court in whose jurisdiction any of the following acts have occurred:a) Place of drawing of the cheque,b) Address of bank where cheque was presented (holders bank address),c) Address of bank where cheque is payable (drawers bank address)d) Place from where notice was received by drawer of chequea. It is possible that each of these four acts could have occurred at different localities. The complainant can choose any one the above places to determine jurisdiction of court where they wish to file complaint.2. What can I do if it has been more than 30 days since I received information of dishonour of cheque?If the cheque is still valid i.e. 3 months (currently) have not passed from the date of its issue, you can represent the cheque again to your banker as there is no restriction regarding the number of times a cheque can be presented and that every subsequent representation and dishonour gives rise to fresh cause of action for filing complaint. It may be noted that once a notice for payment is given then the holder must file a complaint under Section 138 N.I. Act within 30 days from expiry of notice period as a fresh cause of action will not arise if the cheque is presented again and it is dishonoured and failure to file complaint will lead to loss of remedy available under Section 138 N.I. Act.3. How long after notice has been served can I file a case against the drawer?After giving notice you need to file a complaint case against drawer under Section 138 N.I. Act within 30 days from the expiry of notice period i.e. 15 days. In other words you need to file complaint case against drawer within 45 days (15+30) from the date of issue of notice. Failure to do so will lead to loss of remedy under Section 138 N.I. Act; however, you can file a summary suit for recovery of money and initiate criminal proceedings underSection 420I.P.C. within 3 years from date of issue of cheque.4. What can I do if I do not have the drawer's address?You need the address of the drawer of cheque to issue notice as contemplated under provisions of N.I. Act; also the address is necessary if you wish to avail other legal remedies available to you. You can send the notice to the last known address. In case the address of the drawer has changed and the drawer has not left a forwarding address and the notice is returned with the noting that addressee is not available at the address or addressee has left without leaving a forwarding address then you need to file a complaint case after 15 days (notice period) of receipt of such information or returned notice and within 30 days from expiry of notice period. Failure to do so will lead to loss of remedy under Section 138 N.I. Act; however, you can file a summary suit for recovery of money and initiate criminal proceedings underSection 420I.P.C. within 3 years from date of issue of cheque5. What should I do if the notice was returned and could not be served to the drawer?When a notice is returned to the sender as unclaimed or with the noting that addressee is not available at the address or addressee has left without leaving a forwarding address then the date of receipt of such information or returned notice would be the commencing date for the notice period of 15 days. Complaint case under Section 138 N.I. Act must be filed within 30 days from expiry of notice period. Such reckoning would be without prejudice to the right of the drawer of the cheque to show that he had no knowledge that the notice was brought to his address or previous address.6.

Act.?Yes, Kishan Retd judge law Chambers offers assistance in drafting of legal notice as required by Section 138 of N.I. Act.7.

Act.8.

Act are not applicable e.g. Cheque given as Gift, in charity, donation etc.9. Can a cheque issued in security attract offence under Section 138 N.I. Act?With respect to the dishonour of cheques given as security, legal position is not very clear. It is subject to presumption and proof thereof that may be given by either party in support of their case. High Court of Delhi in the case of M/s Datt Enterprises ltd. vs. V.K.Dua held that the security cheque does not attract the provisions of Section 138 N.I. Act., if cheques were given as a security cheque as per past practice and pending reconciliation of accounts and not towards discharge of any liability.10. What is a legally enforceable debt or other liability?Legally enforceable debt or other liability should be such which is contracted in accordance with law and which is not opposed to public policy viz., wagering contracts, debt obtained for running brothel or gambling house etc.11. What is Section 138 N.I. Act and why is remedy available under it preferable to remedy available under other laws?a. Section 138 N.I. Act was made to provide an additional criminal remedy over and above the civil remedies available; to provide a speedy and effective remedy to holder of dishonoured cheque.b. Summary suit for recovery of money takes time (approximately 3 to 5 years) and criminal proceedings underSection 420I.P.C. does not provide any provision for recovery of money and is meant only for prosecution of the drawer of the cheque who entertains dishonest intention to cheat.12. What is a summary suit for recovery of money?Summary suit is a civil legal proceeding initiated for recovery of money due under any written agreement, cheque etc. These proceedings are different from normal recovery suit, as here the liability to prove that petitioner is not liable to recover any amount is on defendant for which he needs to obtain leave to defend from the court.13. What is the validity of the cheque in day to day business?The current validity of cheques is 6 months. However, please note that from April 1, 2012. The validity will change to three months as per recent directive of RBI (under Sec. 35A, Banking Regulation Act, 1949)14. What can I do if a cheque given to me has been dishonoured?a.

What can I do if I do not file a complaint within 30 days from expiry of notice period?If you have not filed a complaint case within 30 days after expiry of notice period, you can file a summary suit for recovery of money and initiate criminal proceedings underSection 420I.P.C. within 3 years from the date of issue of cheque.17.

Other remedies are also available to recover the cheque amount. You can file a summary suit for recovery of money and initiate criminal proceedings underSection 420I.P.C. within 3 years from date of issue of cheque. In case the cheque was never presented during its validity period then a summary suit is the only available remedy for recovery of money.(Notice can be given to drawer up to 3 years from date of issue of cheque for instituting a summary suit for recovery of money. Criminal proceedings for prosecution of drawer can also be instituted within 3 years from date of issue of cheque underSection 420I.P.C.)18. The drawer is asking me to settle the claim at a reduced value. What should I do?Its up to you to settle the claim at a reduced value as the same will save your precious time, as well as legal hassle. Now-a-days courts are also encouraging amicable settlement between the parties. However, if you settle the dishonoured cheque amount at a reduced value, you will lose all remedies available under law.19. What remedy do I have if the drawer delays in settling after conviction?In a recent 2010 judgement, Supreme Court has laid strict rules to deal with such delaying tactics. Delay in settling cheques bounced will cost up to 20% of the cheque amount post-conviction. This is detailed as: 10% at District Court level; 15% at the High Court level; and up to 20% at the Supreme Court level. For e.g., Defaulter going for settlement will have to pay 10% of the cheque amount to avoid going to the jail.20. Can I recover interest and legal expenses from the drawer of the dishonoured cheque?Yes, you can recover interest and legal expenses from the drawer of the dishonoured cheque in a summary suit for recovery of money, but not in the proceedings initiated under Section 138 N.I. Act. However, under Section 138 N.I. Act the award maybe higher than the cheque amount.21. What should I do if the drawer does not make payment upon receipt of notice?You can adopt either or any of the remedies available to you:a) Can file a criminal complaint against drawer of cheque under Section 138 of N.I. Act.b) Can file a summary suit for recovery of money, interest and legal expenses.c) Can file a criminal complaint against drawer of cheque underSection 420of I.P.C. Please note that there is no provision for recovery of money underSection 420I.P.C. and this section is meant only for prosecution of the drawer of the cheque.In case a person has filed suit for recovery, then he is not precluded from filing a complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act andSection 420of theIndian Penal Code. The pendency of criminal matters would not be an impediment to proceeding with the civil suits.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, Bangalore6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar"

    "answer": "Details like GPA, Court litigations in respect of land in question etc are required to be examined. Nevertheless based upon the averments in terms of GPA by Asif and Sayed the agreements including sale deed or sale agreement executed by Kishan being GPA holder are valid and enforceable against said and Asif and Sayed. It is pertinent that stated agreements, sale deed was executed during 2001 to 2005 and more than 20 years. After sale and handing over the possession, in 2016 the act of Sayed raising boundary wall was illegal and Ramesh has ever power to get removed the Wall and to take possession and also to claim damages.1. & 2. The suit is not maintainable.  Though in terms of Article 65 of the Limitation Act the time limit to file a partition suit is 12 years so Sayed to cover lapses has take the plea that he had recent came to know that new purchasers and defendants are in illegal possession on the basis of some forged and concocted document without his consent but the same is not tenable in law being case highly belated and barred by limitation. Conduct of Sayed and Asif shows that defendant were is possession ever since from date of purchase in 2001 to 2005 and it is apparent from Asif and Sayed have never objected nor initiated proceeding to exert their right and ownership. Defendant being bonafide purchasers are in uninterrupted possession so by rule of adverse possessions defendants can assert their rights and possession in respect of their area. Further agreements including sale deed or sale agreement executed by Kishan being GPA holder are valid and enforceable against said and Asif and Sayed and their legal representatives. Rest defense and grounds can be ascertained on the basis of pleadings set by Sayed and details of case.3. No4. Yes5. Court fee shall be decided on the basis of market value of the property.6.

    "question": "Time limitation to file partition suit on entire residential layout formed 20 yr back",
    "answer": "Dear client,This is a complex legal case with several issues. Here are some possible answers to your questions:The suit is maintainable on the ground that Sayed is claiming his share of the ancestral property. Asif and Sayed inherited the property from their father Karim, and Sayed has the right to claim his share.The residents in possession can file an objection on the basis of adverse possession. If they have been in possession of the property for more than 12 years without interruption, they may be able to claim ownership of the property.The suit can be considered as a partial partition suit because Sayed is only claiming his share of the property. However, if he wants to claim the entire property, he may need to file a suit for partition and possession.The Ramesh case and sale of the commercial site may help to defend against Sayed's claim, especially if the sale was conducted in a legally valid manner. However, this will depend on the specific facts and circumstances of the case.The court jurisdiction will depend on the value of the property. If the property value is not mentioned in the valuation slip, the court may determine jurisdiction based on the market value of the property or other relevant factors.Sayed can emphasize to the court that GPA holder Kishan, the developer, and other resident members should be included as parties in the suit because they have an interest in the property and their presence is necessary for a fair and just adjudication of the case. However, it will ultimately be up to the court to decide whether to include them as parties.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,If the GPA holder Kishan is not alive and cannot be located, the court may appoint a legal representative or guardian ad litem to act on his behalf. The legal representative or guardian will be responsible for representing Kishan's interests in the case. If the legal representative or guardian cannot be located, the court may proceed with the case without them, and any decision made by the court may be binding on Kishan's interests.The principle of partition will depend on the specific laws and regulations in your jurisdiction. In general, when property is developed into a residential layout, the value of each individual site is determined based on its location, size, and other factors. If the property is being divided among multiple owners, the value of each owner's share will be based on the value of their respective sites.Sayed will need to submit all relevant documents related to the property, including the mother deed, any sale agreements, and any other legal documents related to the property. He will also need to provide evidence of his relationship to the property and his claim to a share of the property.The holding of the property owner mentioned in the mother deed will depend on the specific terms of the mother deed and any subsequent agreements or contracts. In general, if the property is developed into a residential layout and sold as individual sites, the owner mentioned in the mother deed may retain ownership of any unsold sites or receive a share of the proceeds from the sale of individual sites.It is unlikely that criminal action can be taken against Sayed on the basis of religious discrimination or creating enmity in the residents. However, if there is evidence that Sayed has violated any civil or criminal laws, he may be subject to legal action. It is recommended that Sayed consult with an experienced attorney who can review the details of the case and provide guidance on any potential legal risks.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Citizenship act",
    "answer": "Dear clientAccording to Section 8(1) of the Indian Citizenship Act, 1955, if an Indian citizen voluntarily acquires the citizenship of another country, then he/she ceases to be an Indian citizen. This provision applies to all Indian citizens, including minors.However, there is a provision in Section 8(2) that allows a minor child of an Indian citizen who ceases to be an Indian citizen to resume Indian citizenship within one year after attaining the age of majority (i.e. 18 years old). The minor child can do so by making a declaration in the prescribed form and manner.In the case you have mentioned, if you, as a parent, renounce your Indian citizenship and acquire British citizenship, then you will cease to be an Indian citizen. However, your children's Indian citizenship will not automatically cease. They can continue to hold Indian citizenship if they choose to do so.If one parent renounces Indian citizenship and the other parent and children wish to retain Indian citizenship, it is possible for the children to continue to hold Indian citizenship. The children will not automatically lose their Indian citizenship, but they will have to make a declaration to resume their Indian citizenship within one year of attaining the age of majority.It is important to note that the Indian government does not recognize dual citizenship. Therefore, if your children choose to retain their Indian citizenship and you acquire British citizenship, then they will have to travel to India on their Indian passport, and you will have to travel to India on your British passport.In the case where a child holds only Indian citizenship, and both parents renounce Indian citizenship, then the child will not automatically become stateless. The child can either choose to retain their Indian citizenship or apply for the citizenship of the country where they reside, depending on the laws of that country.It is always advisable to seek legal advice from an immigration lawyer or Indian embassy/consulate before making any decisions related to citizenship.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "1. If the reconciliation efforts taken by the women police fails to yield any result then the women police may register FIR against all of them on the basis of the complaint, even though the complaint is false and baseless.Then he has to challenge the same only during trial proceedings after obtaining bail for all the accused.2. On the next meeting, as the girl is not going to agree for rejoining, the boy side may agree to give divorce but on any settlement terms otherwise the boy side can refuse to agree for any terms and then immediately file an application for anticipatory bail for all.3. If the police is bent upon to register FIR, then the boy side can obtain bail immediately to avoid arrest.4. They have to give statement that the complaint is false and that they did not demand any money or dowry from her, she has left the home on her own and now she is filing this false complaint on the instigation of her parents.5. If she is not employed nor having any source of income to sustain her expenses, then the husband is bound to pay her monthly maintenance to her.Therefore first of all ascertain that if she is employed or having any source of income in order to avoid paying maintenance to her.6.

Act in case drawer did not pay after receiving notice?A complaint case under Section 138 N.I. Act can be filed in any competent court in whose jurisdiction any of the following acts have occurred:a) Place of drawing of the cheque,b) Address of bank where cheque was presented (holders bank address),c) Address of bank where cheque is payable (drawers bank address)d) Place from where notice was received by drawer of chequea. It is possible that each of these four acts could have occurred at different localities. The complainant can choose any one the above places to determine jurisdiction of court where they wish to file complaint.2. What can I do if it has been more than 30 days since I received information of dishonour of cheque?If the cheque is still valid i.e. 3 months (currently) have not passed from the date of its issue, you can represent the cheque again to your banker as there is no restriction regarding the number of times a cheque can be presented and that every subsequent representation and dishonour gives rise to fresh cause of action for filing complaint. It may be noted that once a notice for payment is given then the holder must file a complaint under Section 138 N.I. Act within 30 days from expiry of notice period as a fresh cause of action will not arise if the cheque is presented again and it is dishonoured and failure to file complaint will lead to loss of remedy available under Section 138 N.I. Act.3. How long after notice has been served can I file a case against the drawer?After giving notice you need to file a complaint case against drawer under Section 138 N.I. Act within 30 days from the expiry of notice period i.e. 15 days. In other words you need to file complaint case against drawer within 45 days (15+30) from the date of issue of notice. Failure to do so will lead to loss of remedy under Section 138 N.I. Act; however, you can file a summary suit for recovery of money and initiate criminal proceedings underSection 420I.P.C. within 3 years from date of issue of cheque.4. What can I do if I do not have the drawer's address?You need the address of the drawer of cheque to issue notice as contemplated under provisions of N.I.

In case the address of the drawer has changed and the drawer has not left a forwarding address and the notice is returned with the noting that addressee is not available at the address or addressee has left without leaving a forwarding address then you need to file a complaint case after 15 days (notice period) of receipt of such information or returned notice and within 30 days from expiry of notice period. Failure to do so will lead to loss of remedy under Section 138 N.I. Act; however, you can file a summary suit for recovery of money and initiate criminal proceedings underSection 420I.P.C. within 3 years from date of issue of cheque5. What should I do if the notice was returned and could not be served to the drawer?When a notice is returned to the sender as unclaimed or with the noting that addressee is not available at the address or addressee has left without leaving a forwarding address then the date of receipt of such information or returned notice would be the commencing date for the notice period of 15 days. Complaint case under Section 138 N.I. Act must be filed within 30 days from expiry of notice period. Such reckoning would be without prejudice to the right of the drawer of the cheque to show that he had no knowledge that the notice was brought to his address or previous address.6.

Act was made to provide an additional criminal remedy over and above the civil remedies available; to provide a speedy and effective remedy to holder of dishonoured cheque.b. Summary suit for recovery of money takes time (approximately 3 to 5 years) and criminal proceedings underSection 420I.P.C. does not provide any provision for recovery of money and is meant only for prosecution of the drawer of the cheque who entertains dishonest intention to cheat.12. What is a summary suit for recovery of money?Summary suit is a civil legal proceeding initiated for recovery of money due under any written agreement, cheque etc. These proceedings are different from normal recovery suit, as here the liability to prove that petitioner is not liable to recover any amount is on defendant for which he needs to obtain leave to defend from the court.13. What is the validity of the cheque in day to day business?The current validity of cheques is 6 months. However, please note that from April 1, 2012. The validity will change to three months as per recent directive of RBI (under Sec. 35A, Banking Regulation Act, 1949)14. What can I do if a cheque given to me has been dishonoured?a.

Other remedies are also available to recover the cheque amount. You can file a summary suit for recovery of money and initiate criminal proceedings underSection 420I.P.C. within 3 years from date of issue of cheque.

Criminal proceedings for prosecution of drawer can also be instituted within 3 years from date of issue of cheque underSection 420I.P.C.)18. The drawer is asking me to settle the claim at a reduced value. What should I do?Its up to you to settle the claim at a reduced value as the same will save your precious time, as well as legal hassle. Now-a-days courts are also encouraging amicable settlement between the parties. However, if you settle the dishonoured cheque amount at a reduced value, you will lose all remedies available under law.19. What remedy do I have if the drawer delays in settling after conviction?In a recent 2010 judgement, Supreme Court has laid strict rules to deal with such delaying tactics. Delay in settling cheques bounced will cost up to 20% of the cheque amount post-conviction. This is detailed as: 10% at District Court level; 15% at the High Court level; and up to 20% at the Supreme Court level.

Act. However, under Section 138 N.I. Act the award maybe higher than the cheque amount.21. What should I do if the drawer does not make payment upon receipt of notice?You can adopt either or any of the remedies available to you:a) Can file a criminal complaint against drawer of cheque under Section 138 of N.I. Act.b) Can file a summary suit for recovery of money, interest and legal expenses.c) Can file a criminal complaint against drawer of cheque underSection 420of I.P.C. Please note that there is no provision for recovery of money underSection 420I.P.C. and this section is meant only for prosecution of the drawer of the cheque.In case a person has filed suit for recovery, then he is not precluded from filing a complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act andSection 420of theIndian Penal Code. The pendency of criminal matters would not be an impediment to proceeding with the civil suits.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, Bangalore6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar"

    "answer": "If the society has passed a resolution for a negotiated settlement with a final sum of 16 lakhs and a draft of the resolution has been circulated on WhatsApp and received approval from the members, then it is important that you have a copy of the signed resolution. You can make a written request to the society for a copy of the signed resolution and if they refuse to provide it, you can escalate the matter to higher authorities such as the Registrar of Societies or a consumer court.Before making any payment, it is important to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the terms of the resolution and that the payment is made only in accordance with those terms. You can consider sending a written communication to the society stating that you are willing to pay the full amount as per the resolution, but only if the society provides you with a copy of the signed resolution.It is also important to keep a record of all communication with the society, including emails, letters, and WhatsApp messages. If the society makes any further demands after the payment is made, you can use these records to demonstrate that you have already paid the amount as per the resolution and that any further demands are illegal.If the society continues to withhold the signed resolution or makes further demands after payment is made, you may need to seek legal assistance to protect your rights and interests.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Details like GPA, Court litigations in respect of land in question etc are required to be examined. Nevertheless based upon the averments in terms of GPA by Asif and Sayed the agreements including sale deed or sale agreement executed by Kishan being GPA holder are valid and enforceable against said and Asif and Sayed. It is pertinent that stated agreements, sale deed was executed during 2001 to 2005 and more than 20 years. After sale and handing over the possession, in 2016 the act of Sayed raising boundary wall was illegal and Ramesh has ever power to get removed the Wall and to take possession and also to claim damages.1. & 2. The suit is not maintainable.  Though in terms of Article 65 of the Limitation Act the time limit to file a partition suit is 12 years so Sayed to cover lapses has take the plea that he had recent came to know that new purchasers and defendants are in illegal possession on the basis of some forged and concocted document without his consent but the same is not tenable in law being case highly belated and barred by limitation. Conduct of Sayed and Asif shows that defendant were is possession ever since from date of purchase in 2001 to 2005 and it is apparent from Asif and Sayed have never objected nor initiated proceeding to exert their right and ownership. Defendant being bonafide purchasers are in uninterrupted possession so by rule of adverse possessions defendants can assert their rights and possession in respect of their area. Further agreements including sale deed or sale agreement executed by Kishan being GPA holder are valid and enforceable against said and Asif and Sayed and their legal representatives. Rest defense and grounds can be ascertained on the basis of pleadings set by Sayed and details of case.3. No4. Yes5. Court fee shall be decided on the basis of market value of the property.6. File application under order 1 rule 10 CPC to implead necessary parties are on record.

    "answer": "Dear client,This is a complex legal case with several issues. Here are some possible answers to your questions:The suit is maintainable on the ground that Sayed is claiming his share of the ancestral property. Asif and Sayed inherited the property from their father Karim, and Sayed has the right to claim his share.The residents in possession can file an objection on the basis of adverse possession. If they have been in possession of the property for more than 12 years without interruption, they may be able to claim ownership of the property.The suit can be considered as a partial partition suit because Sayed is only claiming his share of the property. However, if he wants to claim the entire property, he may need to file a suit for partition and possession.The Ramesh case and sale of the commercial site may help to defend against Sayed's claim, especially if the sale was conducted in a legally valid manner. However, this will depend on the specific facts and circumstances of the case.The court jurisdiction will depend on the value of the property. If the property value is not mentioned in the valuation slip, the court may determine jurisdiction based on the market value of the property or other relevant factors.Sayed can emphasize to the court that GPA holder Kishan, the developer, and other resident members should be included as parties in the suit because they have an interest in the property and their presence is necessary for a fair and just adjudication of the case. However, it will ultimately be up to the court to decide whether to include them as parties.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,If the GPA holder Kishan is not alive and cannot be located, the court may appoint a legal representative or guardian ad litem to act on his behalf. The legal representative or guardian will be responsible for representing Kishan's interests in the case. If the legal representative or guardian cannot be located, the court may proceed with the case without them, and any decision made by the court may be binding on Kishan's interests.The principle of partition will depend on the specific laws and regulations in your jurisdiction. In general, when property is developed into a residential layout, the value of each individual site is determined based on its location, size, and other factors. If the property is being divided among multiple owners, the value of each owner's share will be based on the value of their respective sites.Sayed will need to submit all relevant documents related to the property, including the mother deed, any sale agreements, and any other legal documents related to the property. He will also need to provide evidence of his relationship to the property and his claim to a share of the property.The holding of the property owner mentioned in the mother deed will depend on the specific terms of the mother deed and any subsequent agreements or contracts. In general, if the property is developed into a residential layout and sold as individual sites, the owner mentioned in the mother deed may retain ownership of any unsold sites or receive a share of the proceeds from the sale of individual sites.It is unlikely that criminal action can be taken against Sayed on the basis of religious discrimination or creating enmity in the residents. However, if there is evidence that Sayed has violated any civil or criminal laws, he may be subject to legal action. It is recommended that Sayed consult with an experienced attorney who can review the details of the case and provide guidance on any potential legal risks.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The latest proposal, cleared by the state Cabinet in a meeting chaired by Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi, is an extension to an policy rolled out by former CM Capt Amarinder Singh provided such rights to the residents living within Lal Dora only in villages.“People who are living within the ‘Lal Lakir’ in villages and cities do not have ownership rights. We have decided to confer the ownership rights on the people who have been living in these areas,” Channi said after the Cabinet meeting."

    "question": "Lal Lakir (Red-Line) Property Punjab",
    "answer": "Dear client,To obtain a permanent injunction, you must establish that you have a legal right to the property in question and that the plaintiffs' actions are infringing upon your rights. In the absence of any official record of ownership, the burden of proof may be higher, but it is not impossible to establish ownership.To prove ownership and possession of the property, you can rely on any documentary evidence you may have, such as sale deed, lease agreement, mutation entries, tax receipts, etc. You can also produce witnesses who can testify that you have been in possession of the property for a long time, and that the plaintiffs have not made any claim over it during that time.Additionally, you may consider conducting a survey of the property and creating a detailed map that shows its boundaries and landmarks. This can be useful in establishing your ownership and possession of the property.If the plaintiffs' claim is destined to be dismissed due to lack of possession and ownership evidence, it is possible that you may be able to obtain a permanent injunction against them. However, the final decision will depend on the evidence presented in court and the legal arguments made by both parties.

    "question": "Is NOC compulsory for foreign travel of MP state govt school principal",
    "answer": "Dear client,as a general rule, government employees are required to obtain a NOC from their employer before traveling abroad. This is to ensure that the employee's absence does not affect the functioning of the department or office. In the case of school principals, the requirement for a NOC may vary depending on the policies and rules of the Education Department of Madhya Pradesh.I would advise you to check with your father's employer or the Education Department of Madhya Pradesh to confirm if a NOC is required for your father to travel to Dubai. They should be able to provide you with the latest circulars or guidelines regarding the same. This will ensure that your father complies with the rules and regulations and avoids any legal or administrative issues.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "If the society has passed a resolution for a negotiated settlement with a final sum of 16 lakhs and a draft of the resolution has been circulated on WhatsApp and received approval from the members, then it is important that you have a copy of the signed resolution. You can make a written request to the society for a copy of the signed resolution and if they refuse to provide it, you can escalate the matter to higher authorities such as the Registrar of Societies or a consumer court.Before making any payment, it is important to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the terms of the resolution and that the payment is made only in accordance with those terms. You can consider sending a written communication to the society stating that you are willing to pay the full amount as per the resolution, but only if the society provides you with a copy of the signed resolution.It is also important to keep a record of all communication with the society, including emails, letters, and WhatsApp messages. If the society makes any further demands after the payment is made, you can use these records to demonstrate that you have already paid the amount as per the resolution and that any further demands are illegal.If the society continues to withhold the signed resolution or makes further demands after payment is made, you may need to seek legal assistance to protect your rights and interests.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "If a case has been filed in one country, then another case on the same subject matter cannot be filed in another country, as this would lead to conflicting judgments. It is possible that the court in Qatar did not know about the case that was already filed in Kattappana.In order to challenge the divorce judgment, you may need to appeal the decision in the Qatar Court of Appeals, which is the next level of appeal after the Court of First Instance. You will need to hire a lawyer to assist you with this.Regarding your restitution case in Kattappana, it will still stand even if a divorce has been granted in Qatar. However, the court in Kattappana may take into consideration the divorce granted in Qatar when making its decision.As for the Christian marriage, under Indian law, Christian marriages are governed by the Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872, which allows for divorce on certain grounds. However, the laws governing divorce in Qatar may be different, and you will need to consult with a lawyer in Qatar to understand your rights and options.If your ex-wife has submitted two different statements in Qatar and in Kattappana, this may be considered perjury and can be used as evidence against her in court.

    "question": "Citizenship act",
    "answer": "Dear clientAccording to Section 8(1) of the Indian Citizenship Act, 1955, if an Indian citizen voluntarily acquires the citizenship of another country, then he/she ceases to be an Indian citizen. This provision applies to all Indian citizens, including minors.However, there is a provision in Section 8(2) that allows a minor child of an Indian citizen who ceases to be an Indian citizen to resume Indian citizenship within one year after attaining the age of majority (i.e. 18 years old). The minor child can do so by making a declaration in the prescribed form and manner.In the case you have mentioned, if you, as a parent, renounce your Indian citizenship and acquire British citizenship, then you will cease to be an Indian citizen. However, your children's Indian citizenship will not automatically cease. They can continue to hold Indian citizenship if they choose to do so.If one parent renounces Indian citizenship and the other parent and children wish to retain Indian citizenship, it is possible for the children to continue to hold Indian citizenship. The children will not automatically lose their Indian citizenship, but they will have to make a declaration to resume their Indian citizenship within one year of attaining the age of majority.It is important to note that the Indian government does not recognize dual citizenship. Therefore, if your children choose to retain their Indian citizenship and you acquire British citizenship, then they will have to travel to India on their Indian passport, and you will have to travel to India on your British passport.In the case where a child holds only Indian citizenship, and both parents renounce Indian citizenship, then the child will not automatically become stateless. The child can either choose to retain their Indian citizenship or apply for the citizenship of the country where they reside, depending on the laws of that country.It is always advisable to seek legal advice from an immigration lawyer or Indian embassy/consulate before making any decisions related to citizenship.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Sir,You may purchase the property subject to fulfillment of following conditions. For more details visit the link.12 Important Documents To Check Before Buying A New Property1. Sale Deed:A Sale Deed is the core legal document that acts as proof of sale and transfer of ownership of the property from the seller to the buyer. A Sale Deed has to be mandatorily registered. It is important that before the Sale Deed is executed one should execute the sale agreement and should check for compliance of various terms and conditions as agreed upon between the buyer and the seller. Before executing the Sale Deed, the buyer should check whether the property has a clear title. He/she should also confirm if the property is subject to any encumbrance charges.* A seller should settle all the statutory payments such as property tax, cess, water charges, society charges, electricity charges, maintenance charges etc., (subject to the agreement) before executing the Sale Deed.Mother Deed:Mother Deed, also known as the parent document, is an important legal document that traces the origin/antecedent ownership of the property from the start (if the property has had various owners). It is a document that helps in the further sale of the property, thereby establishing the new ownership. In case of absence of the original Mother Deed, certified copies should be obtained from the registering authorities. Mother Deed includes the change in ownership of the property, be it through sale, partition, gift or inheritance. It is very important that the Mother Deed records the references to previous ownership in a sequence and should be continuous and unbroken. In case of a missing sequence, one should refer to the records from the registering offices, revenue records or the recitals (preamble) in other documents. The sequence should be updated until the current owner.2. Building approval plan:A building plan is sanctioned by the BDA (Bangalore Development Authority) or BBMP (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike) or BMRDA (Bangalore Metropolitan Region Development Authority) or BIAPPA (Bangalore International Airport Area Planning Authority) without which the construction of the building is illegal under the Karnataka Municipal Corporations (KMC) Act. A building owner has to get an approved plan from the jurisdictional Commissioner or an officer authorized by such Commissioner. However, the authorities sanction a building approval plan based on the zonal classification, road width, floor area ratio (FAR) and plot depth. A set of documents are required to be submitted by the owner in order to obtain a building approval plan. The documents include- Title Deed, property assessment extract, property PID number, city survey sketch (from the Department of Survey and Settlement and Land Records), up-to-date tax paid receipt, earlier sanctioned plans (if any), property drawings, 2 copies of demand drafts, foundation certificate (if any) and a land use certificate issued by the competent authority (viz., Dy. Commissioner). It is mandatory that the building owner hires a registered architect who will draw a plan meeting the applicable bye laws. One can get a building approval plan within 4-5 working days if all the requirements are met, via the newly invented BBMP software- Automated Building Approval Plan.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, Bangalore6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar"

    "answer": "If you are planning to buy a land that has already been leased to HPCL for 30 years for a Dealer operated petrol pump, you will need to check the terms of the lease agreement. Generally, the lease agreement will contain a provision to address the situation if the land is sold during the lease term. It is important to review the lease agreement for any conditions or obligations that you would need to abide by if you become the new owner of the land. You will also need to negotiate with HPCL to ensure that the petrol pump license continues under the new ownership.

    "answer": "Dear client,If you purchase the land that is currently leased to HPCL for a petrol pump, the lease agreement will typically continue unless there is a clause in the lease agreement that states otherwise. Generally, the lease agreement will have provisions for assignment or transfer of the lease to a new owner of the land.If you plan to purchase the land, you should review the lease agreement carefully to understand the terms and conditions related to the assignment or transfer of the lease. You should also speak to the current lessor and HPCL to understand their obligations and responsibilities under the lease agreement.Regarding the petrol pump license, it is important to note that the license to operate a petrol pump is generally issued by the government and not by the lessor or the landowner. As long as the petrol pump license is valid and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, it should continue even after the transfer of the lease to a new owner of the land.

    "answer": "1.  Even though the judgment passed dissolving the marriage by decree of divorce by a Qatar court may involve the question of law owing to the jurisdictional point, since you have participated in the divorce proceedings, the decree passed by the court will be deemed to be valid since it is a contested divorce and not an exparte divorce.Therefore you can vent out your grievances in the form of an appeal against the judgment, by producing all the relevant documents before the appellate court and strongly  object to the decree passed against you.2. If she produces the divorce decree she got it in Qatar, then the court at kattapanna will dismiss the RCR case.3.

However, the court in Kattappana may take into consideration the divorce granted in Qatar when making its decision.As for the Christian marriage, under Indian law, Christian marriages are governed by the Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872, which allows for divorce on certain grounds. However, the laws governing divorce in Qatar may be different, and you will need to consult with a lawyer in Qatar to understand your rights and options.If your ex-wife has submitted two different statements in Qatar and in Kattappana, this may be considered perjury and can be used as evidence against her in court.

    "question": "Citizenship act",
    "answer": "Dear clientAccording to Section 8(1) of the Indian Citizenship Act, 1955, if an Indian citizen voluntarily acquires the citizenship of another country, then he/she ceases to be an Indian citizen. This provision applies to all Indian citizens, including minors.However, there is a provision in Section 8(2) that allows a minor child of an Indian citizen who ceases to be an Indian citizen to resume Indian citizenship within one year after attaining the age of majority (i.e. 18 years old). The minor child can do so by making a declaration in the prescribed form and manner.In the case you have mentioned, if you, as a parent, renounce your Indian citizenship and acquire British citizenship, then you will cease to be an Indian citizen. However, your children's Indian citizenship will not automatically cease. They can continue to hold Indian citizenship if they choose to do so.If one parent renounces Indian citizenship and the other parent and children wish to retain Indian citizenship, it is possible for the children to continue to hold Indian citizenship. The children will not automatically lose their Indian citizenship, but they will have to make a declaration to resume their Indian citizenship within one year of attaining the age of majority.It is important to note that the Indian government does not recognize dual citizenship. Therefore, if your children choose to retain their Indian citizenship and you acquire British citizenship, then they will have to travel to India on their Indian passport, and you will have to travel to India on your British passport.In the case where a child holds only Indian citizenship, and both parents renounce Indian citizenship, then the child will not automatically become stateless. The child can either choose to retain their Indian citizenship or apply for the citizenship of the country where they reside, depending on the laws of that country.It is always advisable to seek legal advice from an immigration lawyer or Indian embassy/consulate before making any decisions related to citizenship.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It is also important to note that attempting to obtain a written statement from him in exchange for dropping the charges could be considered extortion, which is a criminal offense.If you are concerned about your safety, you may consider obtaining a restraining order against your father-in-law. This would prohibit him from contacting or approaching you and your wife. You can discuss the process of obtaining a restraining order with a lawyer.As for postponing the case, it is not advisable to do so as it could result in negative consequences for you and your case.

    "answer": "You need to file a suit at the district court for declaration of your title and ownership on the basis of the documents in your possession, through a competent lawyer. For the purpose, you need to execute a special power of attorney in favour of your close relative or friend in India authorizing him/her to act on your behalf, after getting it suitably drafted by a competent lawyer. The special PoA can either be notarized in the USA or attested by the Indian Embassy/Consulate there. Then it needs to be sent to your power agent in India for adjudication (meaning, assessment of stamp duty) by the land registry. Once done, your power agent can act on your behalf. At the time of institution of the suit, ask your lawyer to file an interim application for restraining your relatives from occupying your property till the disposal of the suit.Swaminathan NeelakantanAdvocate, Coimbatore3023 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Swaminathan Neelakantan"

    "answer": "From your contents it appears that you are not taking steps to arrive at a solution to get rid of this menace, instead you are stretching the issue over unnecessary issues especially which are not maintainable.The problem here is with the Electricity department to have accepted the forged documents from a stranger in order to grant the connection to their name.Now since you have already obtained certified copies of the forged documents as well as you have documentary evidences for having paid the property taxes for that particular period, you can raise a complaint with the electricity department and request them to cancel the same and then accede to your request to disconnect the electricity connection.Actually he has played  fraud on the department and not against you.In fact you can file a suit for ejectment against him to eject him from your property since he is an unauthorised squatter in your property and it may be considered as a trespass as well.You can take action to retrieve the property from him through legal sources, i.e., civil court.For filing a suit you may authorise any close relative back in India by executing a power of attorney for court purpose and conduct the case through your power agent during your absence, however you may have to regularly follow up the case so that there is no lapse or lax on your side.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Right of son",
    "answer": "Firstly when your father and his brother had title on their names due to partition or inheritance, the property lost the nature of ancestral property, therefore neither your cousin or now you have any rights over the proeprty since it became self acquired property of your father and his brothers.Secondly the agreement is reported to have been entered into with the buyer in the year 1991 but it was not converted onto sale deed despite passing of 32 years, and also it is not known whether the full sale consideration amount was received by sellers and handed over possession thereon.If it is presumed that the buyer did not pay full sale consideration amount neither the possession of the property was handed over to him then it can be deemed as barred by limitation.The limitation period is just three years.If it was an unregistered sale agreement then in the absence of any attempt made by the buyer now for purchase and the same was not acknowledged by the sellers stating that the agreement is barred by limitation, then the buyer cannot institute any suit seeking for specific relief too.In this regard there is no necessity even to cancel an infructuous sale agreement afresh.The title holders of the property can ignore the sale agreement and proceed to alienate the property in any manner as per their desire.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

As a result,some states have banned it and some still consider it legal.3) Section 2(b) defines lottery as “a scheme, in whatever form and by whatever name called, for distribution of prizes by lot or chance to those persons participating in the chances of a prize by purchasing tickets”.4) The definition clearly indicates that three elements are essential for a scheme to be defined as a lottery: chance, consideration (for purchasing tickets) and prize or reward.4) Section 2(1)(r) of theConsumer Protection Actdefines unfair trade practice. Under this provision conducting any lottery or contests whether of skill or chance to promote  the sale, use or supply of any goods or for the provision of any service is forbidden5) Under the Tamil Nadu Prize Scheme Prohibition Act, offering prizes by way of draw of lots to purchasers of goods or products from shops or malls is prohibited.

    "question": "Lucky draw",
    "answer": "If what you state is a modified form of a lottery then: Under the Lotteries Regulation Act, of 1988, the state governments have been authorised by the central government to make their laws related to the game. As a result, some states have banned it and some still consider it legal. However,there is no such restriction on the online form of lottery.Lucky draws are not illegal in India because the lucky draw scheme which is included in the Lotteries Regulation Act,1998 has to stay within the given parameters, and most lucky draws which are organized by the governments do not require a ticket purchase and the participants can directly come and try their luck, and thus this does not account to gambling.Online lucky draws require the payment of a small amount which is usually collected by companies like Mastercard or Rupay, or by other banks used for payment and hence the government on their side does not charge anything and offer prizes gratuitously. Therefore it is very clear that a lucky draw is very different from a lottery, and this would not fall under the category of gambling.And for making it legalised the lucky draw rules in india plays a crucial role for it that if there is something is upto lucky draw that should be as per the rules mentioned in lucky draw rules in india.The Section 2(1)(r)Consumer Protection Act, 1986 also prohibits any kind of unfair trade practice  which includes “conducting any lottery or contests whether skill or chance to promote the sale, use or supply of any goods or for the provision of any service.”  The NITI Aayog has clarified this too as offering lucky draws to promote digital transactions does not include any service and the customer does not pay anything for getting the reward. These kinds of lucky draws usually include small cash back offers for payment by digital means.And thus the lucky draw scheme stays out of the ambit of consumer protection laws as well as the Lottery Regulation Act.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

Depending on her condition, she may require psychiatric evaluation and treatment. It is important to consult a qualified medical professional to address her mental health needs.Regarding the living arrangements, it is important to understand that in India, it is common for married couples to live with the husband's parents. However, if your cousin's wife is insisting on separate living arrangements, they may want to consider seeking the advice of a family counselor or mediator to help resolve the issue.If the situation cannot be resolved through counseling, your cousin and his family may want to consider seeking legal advice to understand their options. In India, divorce can be granted on the grounds of mental illness or cruelty. However, divorce should be considered as a last resort and only after all other options have been exhausted.I hope this information helps, and I wish your cousin and his family the best in resolving this difficult situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"
