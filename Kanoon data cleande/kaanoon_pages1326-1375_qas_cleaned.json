It was also designed to help separate residential areas more clearly from government-owned territory, including Badlands, Pannai Lands, Ryotwari Lands, and Inam Lands. Grama Natham is the term for the barren and underutilised terrain that is found outside of towns like Chennai. This is a plot of land that isn't actually owned by anyone. Such land is not legally proven to be owned. Grama Natham's land may only be utilised for non-commercial, residential uses.

    "question": "Will deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Locate the will. Should the decedent name you as their executor, you will have a deadline for locating and filing the decedent's will upon their passing. Should you be designated administrator, you will need to submit the will to the court following your appointment. Determining and safeguarding the estate's assets is one of your responsibilities as the administrator. You will need to take custody of property and make sure it is kept safe by using your authority as administrator or executor in order to collect property. Following the acquisition of the property, you will need to inventory it. You may be asked to file an inventory form with the court as proof that you have finished this work successfully. Every item of property will be listed on the inventory form along with its value and a description.Give creditors the opportunity to file claims. You must settle the debts of the deceased in priority order when using the estate's assets to pay them off. If the estate does not have enough money to cover the debts, you will need to sell assets to raise the money. Paying off outstanding obligations owed to the deceased is a part of overseeing the estate. You must let people who owed the deceased person money know that they are obliged to pay the estate. A letter to this effect should be sent to debtors, and copies should be retained on file. You must file all applicable tax returns on behalf of the estate and the dead as the administrator or executor. Section 159 of the Income Tax Act states that in the event of a person's death, his or her legal representatives would be responsible for paying any amount that the deceased would have been responsible for paying in the same way and to the same degree as the deceased.You must distribute the remaining assets to each of the decedent's beneficiaries once all obligations have been settled and all property has been gathered. In the event that a will exists, you will allocate the assets in accordance with its wishes. You shall divide the remaining assets in accordance with the relevant succession laws if the decedent passed away intestate. Make a final accounting. You may be required to provide a final accounting to the court once the estate has been managed through to conclusion. A final account is a comprehensive record of the assets acquired, the debts settled, and the distributions given. The account must balance when you present it to the judge.The following criteria typically influence registration fees, which are not fixed in general: States may have different registration costs based on their own laws and regulations. Expenses for document preparation and notary services, if necessary, may be incurred in addition to the registration charge.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Safe guarding myself and my old parents  from Mentally torturing wife",
    "answer": "Dear Client,According to the Guardian and Ward Act of 1890, the child's welfare is of utmost significance, and courts with competent authority work to strike a balance between the two. Moreover, just because one parent is granted custody of the kids doesn't mean that the other parent is cut off from communication or visitation rights. The courts in India ensure that the child receives the love and care of both parents. The other parent is granted visitation privileges by the court, with the court setting the terms. The Hon'ble Supreme Court and other Indian courts have stated time and time again that the minor's welfare is the only factor taken into account when deciding who gets custody of them, regardless of the claims of the parties to the custody of children.A course of unprovoked and abusive behaviour towards one's spouse that results in unbearable humiliation, distress, and misery is referred to as mental cruelty. This behaviour harms the complainant's physical and mental health and makes it impracticable for the complainant to preserve their marital status. The type of cruel treatment, the psychological effects on the spouse, and whether or not it makes the spouse reasonably fear that living with the other spouse would be \"harmful\" or \"injurious\" are all important factors to consider when determining whether or not something qualifies as mental cruelty. Therefore, the determination of cruelty is essentially an inferential process that involves considering the characteristics of the behaviour and its impact on the spouse who is lodging the complaint.  The court stated that in handling these kinds of cruelty charges, it is crucial that the court refrain from looking for a universal standard of cruelty because cruelty in one instance might not be cruelty in another. It is necessary to take into account the parties' \"economic and social conditions,\" \"culture and human values to which they attach importance,\" and the type of living to which the parties are accustomed.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Because of the connection toSection 498A, the High Court regularly grants travel authorization applications the lowest priority, therefore it could be wise to plan your strategy. Instead of pulling the application from the High Court, think about taking a two-pronged strategy. Simultaneously, you can seek for travel permission in the Trial Court while maintaining the application in the High Court. With this strategy, you can investigate other options without endangering your current legal actions.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Safe guarding myself and my old parents  from Mentally torturing wife",
    "answer": "Dear Client,According to the Guardian and Ward Act of 1890, the child's welfare is of utmost significance, and courts with competent authority work to strike a balance between the two. Moreover, just because one parent is granted custody of the kids doesn't mean that the other parent is cut off from communication or visitation rights. The courts in India ensure that the child receives the love and care of both parents. The other parent is granted visitation privileges by the court, with the court setting the terms. The Hon'ble Supreme Court and other Indian courts have stated time and time again that the minor's welfare is the only factor taken into account when deciding who gets custody of them, regardless of the claims of the parties to the custody of children.A course of unprovoked and abusive behaviour towards one's spouse that results in unbearable humiliation, distress, and misery is referred to as mental cruelty. This behaviour harms the complainant's physical and mental health and makes it impracticable for the complainant to preserve their marital status. The type of cruel treatment, the psychological effects on the spouse, and whether or not it makes the spouse reasonably fear that living with the other spouse would be \"harmful\" or \"injurious\" are all important factors to consider when determining whether or not something qualifies as mental cruelty. Therefore, the determination of cruelty is essentially an inferential process that involves considering the characteristics of the behaviour and its impact on the spouse who is lodging the complaint.  The court stated that in handling these kinds of cruelty charges, it is crucial that the court refrain from looking for a universal standard of cruelty because cruelty in one instance might not be cruelty in another. It is necessary to take into account the parties' \"economic and social conditions,\" \"culture and human values to which they attach importance,\" and the type of living to which the parties are accustomed.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In addition, theTransfer of Property Actstipulates that unless a registered instrument is used, a sale of immovable property is void.

Section 227 of theCode of Criminal Procedure(CrPC) permits this.In a similar vein, your attorney may submit a request for document production under Section 91 of the CrPC during the evidence phase.Even though oral testimony has its limitations, supporting your case with pertinent documents might help.If you would like to submit further papers during the trial, you may want to file an application under Section 173(8) of the CrPC. Including the papers that were initially missing from the chargesheet may be possible in this fashion.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Once the plaintiff establishes his entitlement to the legal character or right to property, he still has to persuade the court that the defendant has denied or is motivated to deny the plaintiff's legal character or right in declaratory cases. Declaratory cases are a useful and significant remedy since they aim to remove the current source of conflict and avert future litigation. As per Article 58 of the Limitation Act, 1963, one has three years from the day the right 'first' accrued to obtain a declaration.Hope this answer proves beneficial to you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Sorry to hear about your situation. This kind of circumstance might be difficult to handle, but it's important to do it in a cool, collected, and lawful manner. You have certain rights and alternatives, but common residential activities like wandering within your flat are not specifically governed by legislation in India. First, make an effort to speak civilly and gently with your neighbor. Describe your daily schedule and the nature of your activities, and show that you understand his worries. Provide possible remedies, like putting in carpets or giving him your phone information so he can get in touch with you directly if the noise starts to bother you. If the problem continues, keep a record of the dates and specifics of any complaints your neighbor has made. This can come in handy if you ever need to defend your behavior. As an additional option, you may think about adding soundproofing or rugs to lessen the effect of your regular activities. If your neighbor is interfering unjustly with your enjoyment of your property, you may want to file a complaint in India under Section 268 of theIndian Penal Code, which addresses public nuisances. But it's important to use caution while making legal threats. Sometimes, all it takes to stop harassment is a well-written legal notice from your attorney outlining your rights and the absence of any valid legal basis for the allegations. You may handle this situation assertively and legally by keeping lines of communication open, keeping records of events, and getting legal counsel.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "My downstairs neighbour has a problem with me walking in my flat",
    "answer": "Dear client,There is no express clause in Indian law that labels routine domestic chores like walking as a nuisance. State-specific rules or local municipal ordinances typically address noise-related issues. You could want to keep a journal of your everyday activities to show that your behaviors are within reasonable bounds and take proactive measures to address the situation before it arises. If you receive a legal notice, you should think about getting legal counsel. The complainant might not have a strong case unless you're making loud, bothersome noises. Maintaining an open line of communication with your neighbor may also prove advantageous. Seek to come to an agreement or compromise on the permissible noise levels during particular hours. Keep track of any proof that demonstrates your adherence to noise ordinances; it may come in handy while arguing your position. Since the police frequently get involved in serious conflicts in India, taking the initiative to resolve the issue could save needless judicial action.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Copyright and Publishing",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, copyright protection is automatically granted at the time a work is created; registration is not required. As per Section 45 of the Copyright Act, 1957, you have the permission to publish your novel throughout the period that the registration is pending. The Act acknowledges the rights of the author at the time of production. The primary purpose of the registration process is to provide evidence in court. To improve your legal position, it is best to wait until the registration is finalized before publishing. In the event of infringement, you can more readily pursue damages and other legal remedies once the copyright is registered. You may assert your rights using the copyright sign (©), your name, and the year of first publication while you wait for the registration. This unofficial notification alerts possible infringers to their actions. Keeping documentation of your creative process and copyright application might also be helpful in the event that disagreements occur. Whether or not to publish before the copyright is registered ultimately comes down to how much risk you can take and how much value you place on the extra legal protection that registration offers.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Sending a legal notice in Hyderabad might cost anywhere between ₹3,000 and ₹10,000, depending on the intricacy of the case and the attorney's level of experience. According to Indian law, you can ask the court to order your neighbor to fix the leak by filing a lawsuit under the Specific Relief Act. In addition, you may use the principles of tort law to pursue damages for losses you have incurred as a result of the injury. A civil case may take a variety of lengths, and delays are usual. On the other hand, deadlines for various phases of the legal process are specified in the Code of Civil Procedure. To bolster your case, you must obtain proof and meticulously record the damages. Even though some civil lawsuits could drag on for years, aggressive legal tactics, such as mediation and other forms of alternative dispute resolution, may help hasten the resolution process.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Validity of email agreement to sell",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, a registered agreement is necessary for the successful sale of real estate. It's possible that the email correspondence by itself does not create a legally binding contract for the apartment's sale. An agreement must contain an offer, acceptance, consideration, and the desire to establish legal relations, according to the Indian Contract Act. In your instance, the agreement is not registered and no consideration (money) has been paid. In addition, theTransfer of Property Actstipulates that unless a registered instrument is used, a sale of immovable property is void. The purchaser does not obtain any rights over the property in the absence of such registration. The original buyer may not have the legal authority to cause issues or cause the sale to be delayed in light of these criteria, and the email exchange may not be enforceable.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Copyright and Publishing",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, copyright protection is automatically granted at the time a work is created; registration is not required. As per Section 45 of the Copyright Act, 1957, you have the permission to publish your novel throughout the period that the registration is pending. The Act acknowledges the rights of the author at the time of production. The primary purpose of the registration process is to provide evidence in court. To improve your legal position, it is best to wait until the registration is finalized before publishing. In the event of infringement, you can more readily pursue damages and other legal remedies once the copyright is registered. You may assert your rights using the copyright sign (©), your name, and the year of first publication while you wait for the registration. This unofficial notification alerts possible infringers to their actions. Keeping documentation of your creative process and copyright application might also be helpful in the event that disagreements occur. Whether or not to publish before the copyright is registered ultimately comes down to how much risk you can take and how much value you place on the extra legal protection that registration offers.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,In India, copyright protection is automatically granted at the time a work is created; registration is not required. As per Section 45 of the Copyright Act, 1957, you have the permission to publish your novel throughout the period that the registration is pending. The Act acknowledges the rights of the author at the time of production. The primary purpose of the registration process is to provide evidence in court. To improve your legal position, it is best to wait until the registration is finalized before publishing. In the event of infringement, you can more readily pursue damages and other legal remedies once the copyright is registered. You may assert your rights using the copyright sign (©), your name, and the year of first publication while you wait for the registration. This unofficial notification alerts possible infringers to their actions. Keeping documentation of your creative process and copyright application might also be helpful in the event that disagreements occur. Whether or not to publish before the copyright is registered ultimately comes down to how much risk you can take and how much value you place on the extra legal protection that registration offers.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Neighbor dispute",
    "answer": "Dear client,Sending a legal notice in Hyderabad might cost anywhere between ₹3,000 and ₹10,000, depending on the intricacy of the case and the attorney's level of experience. According to Indian law, you can ask the court to order your neighbor to fix the leak by filing a lawsuit under the Specific Relief Act. In addition, you may use the principles of tort law to pursue damages for losses you have incurred as a result of the injury. A civil case may take a variety of lengths, and delays are usual. On the other hand, deadlines for various phases of the legal process are specified in the Code of Civil Procedure. To bolster your case, you must obtain proof and meticulously record the damages. Even though some civil lawsuits could drag on for years, aggressive legal tactics, such as mediation and other forms of alternative dispute resolution, may help hasten the resolution process.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,In India, a registered agreement is necessary for the successful sale of real estate. It's possible that the email correspondence by itself does not create a legally binding contract for the apartment's sale. An agreement must contain an offer, acceptance, consideration, and the desire to establish legal relations, according to the Indian Contract Act. In your instance, the agreement is not registered and no consideration (money) has been paid. In addition, theTransfer of Property Actstipulates that unless a registered instrument is used, a sale of immovable property is void. The purchaser does not obtain any rights over the property in the absence of such registration. The original buyer may not have the legal authority to cause issues or cause the sale to be delayed in light of these criteria, and the email exchange may not be enforceable.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, you can think about having a symbolic or religious ceremony to renew your commitment to each other in order to satisfy the German embassy's requirement for a fresh marriage certificate with the 2024 date. All the necessary Hindu rites should be performed during this ceremony, just as they were during your Arya Samaj marriage. This ceremony can be used to receive a certificate from the priest or the Arya Samaj temple acknowledging the ceremonies conducted, even though it won't have legal standing. The German embassy might then get this certificate as further proof of the marriage celebration on the intended date. To further explain the initial lack of photographic evidence, you can also present paperwork from the Arya Samaj temple or a priest attesting to the legitimacy of the ceremonies carried out during the 2023 marriage.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Filing cheating and other criminal cases",
    "answer": "Dear client,I'm sorry to hear about the situation you're facing with the delayed possession of your flat in Bangalore. Legal recourse in such matters involves various actions that can be taken against the builder based on the contractual agreements and theConsumer Protection Act. You've mentioned that a consumer case is already filed, which is a good step. Pursuing this avenue can help in seeking compensation for the delay in possession and breach of agreement. Based on the clauses in the Agreement of Sale where the builder provided an undertaking that the property is free from encumbrances, you might consider filing a criminal complaint against the builder for offenses such as:-Cheating: If the builder knowingly provided false information regarding the encroachments or the status of the property.-Breach of Contract: If the builder has violated the terms of the agreement by failing to deliver possession as promised.You can file a complaint with the police against the builder for fraudulent activities or cheating. Ensure that you have all the necessary documents and evidence to support your case.Filing a criminal case against the builder directly in your home state's High Court or in a sub-ordinate/district court in Agra without approaching the police might not be the typical route for criminal cases. Usually, criminal cases are initiated through the police, who investigate the matter and then file a charge sheet in the appropriate court. However, in some exceptional circumstances, especially when there's a clear and direct case of fraud or other criminal offenses, it might be possible to approach the court directly.To file a criminal case directly in court without involving the police, you'll need to:1. Prepare a Complaint: Draft a comprehensive complaint outlining the criminal offenses committed by the builder, supported by all relevant documents and evidence.2. Approach the Court: You can approach the High Court or a sub-ordinate/district court in Agra directly to file a private criminal complaint. This complaint should detail the offenses committed by the builder and why you're seeking legal action directly through the court.3. Court's Discretion: Whether the court accepts your complaint and initiates proceedings directly or requires police intervention might vary based on the specifics of your case and the court's discretion.This approach involves a different legal procedure and might have its own complexities. It's crucial to have strong evidence and legal guidance when pursuing this route.Filing an FIR (First Information Report) with the police station regarding the delayed possession of your property doesn't necessarily require an immediate incident or a physical place involved. In cases of alleged fraud, breach of contract, or other criminal offenses related to property matters, an FIR can be filed based on the documents and evidence supporting your complaint. The police will record the details provided in your complaint, which includes the allegations against the builder, the documents supporting your claim, and any other relevant information you provide. After the FIR is lodged, the police are responsible for conducting an investigation. They may visit the site, gather further evidence, and interview relevant parties to verify the claims made in the complaint. Based on their investigation, the police will compile a report detailing their findings. This report will be submitted to the appropriate authorities for further action. Depending on the findings of their investigation, the police may take legal action against the accused, which could involve arrests, further questioning, or filing a charge sheet in court. Even if the case primarily involves documents and financial matters without an immediate physical incident, the police are obligated to investigate the matter based on the information provided in the FIR.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Forming an unregistered association of owners allows several buyers with possession concerns from the same builder to jointly launch a lawsuit in the consumer forum. Members of the association can file a joint complaint detailing their issues, but first, they must come to a clear agreement among themselves.In a consumer forum, an unregistered association of owners may indeed submit a case. Such matters are governed under theConsumer Protection Act, 2019, Section 2(7), which defines a \"complainant\" to include an association of individuals. Regarding the complaint process, see Section 12 of the Act.In a consumer dispute, an unregistered association of owners may join individual owners as petitioner parties. Under theConsumer Protection Actof 2019, certain associations are permitted to register complaints on behalf of their members under Section 12(1)(b).Under the 2019Consumer Protection Act, an unregistered association of owners may file a petition against the constructor. They have the option to report the builder for unfair trade practices or service deficiencies. An association of people is included in the definition of \"complainant\" under Section 2(7) of the Act.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Sorry to hear about your situation. This kind of circumstance might be difficult to handle, but it's important to do it in a cool, collected, and lawful manner. You have certain rights and alternatives, but common residential activities like wandering within your flat are not specifically governed by legislation in India. First, make an effort to speak civilly and gently with your neighbor. Describe your daily schedule and the nature of your activities, and show that you understand his worries. Provide possible remedies, like putting in carpets or giving him your phone information so he can get in touch with you directly if the noise starts to bother you. If the problem continues, keep a record of the dates and specifics of any complaints your neighbor has made. This can come in handy if you ever need to defend your behavior. As an additional option, you may think about adding soundproofing or rugs to lessen the effect of your regular activities. If your neighbor is interfering unjustly with your enjoyment of your property, you may want to file a complaint in India under Section 268 of theIndian Penal Code, which addresses public nuisances. But it's important to use caution while making legal threats. Sometimes, all it takes to stop harassment is a well-written legal notice from your attorney outlining your rights and the absence of any valid legal basis for the allegations. You may handle this situation assertively and legally by keeping lines of communication open, keeping records of events, and getting legal counsel.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "My downstairs neighbour has a problem with me walking in my flat",
    "answer": "Dear client,There is no express clause in Indian law that labels routine domestic chores like walking as a nuisance. State-specific rules or local municipal ordinances typically address noise-related issues. You could want to keep a journal of your everyday activities to show that your behaviors are within reasonable bounds and take proactive measures to address the situation before it arises. If you receive a legal notice, you should think about getting legal counsel. The complainant might not have a strong case unless you're making loud, bothersome noises. Maintaining an open line of communication with your neighbor may also prove advantageous. Seek to come to an agreement or compromise on the permissible noise levels during particular hours. Keep track of any proof that demonstrates your adherence to noise ordinances; it may come in handy while arguing your position. Since the police frequently get involved in serious conflicts in India, taking the initiative to resolve the issue could save needless judicial action.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Jurisdiction for summons for private criminal complaint to a magistrate under CrPC section 200",
    "answer": "To answer your questions as below:1. How to verify if the summons is genuine, if the ecourts website does not show to which court the matter is allocated even after 1 month?Cases are often transferred between courts and ecourts is sometimes not updated to the latest case status as it depends from court to court. Also if you are able to see your name as the accused/party, then the summons must be genuine as it should bear the seal and signature of the magistrate and court (you will also find a number associated with the summons issued)2. Does the metropolitan magistrate court in Kolkata have jurisdiction in this matter if the accused is residing outside its territorial jurisdiction?Any court in India can summon any person from anywhere in India as long as the court is satisfied and admitted a complaint.3. Should I prepare to take bail as the 1st step before I am given an opportunity to argue my case?You do not need to apply for bail as it is in the summons stage. The court has not yet issued a warrant.4. Can my lawyer represent me without my physical presence on the date of the summons and answer the charges on my behalf and question the jurisdiction?Yes, your lawyer can represent you even in your absence. Also can apply before the court to exempt you from physical appearance on further dates. You are advised to engage a lawyer in Kolkata who should be able to guide further.5. Can I give power of attorney to another person to represent me and be physically present on my behalf if I do not want to go?Your lawyer himself should be able to represent you in the case and you can also provide power of attorney to anyone who is aware of the facts to represent you in case your appearance is instructed by the court during any stage of the trial process6. Since, they have asked me to appear in person or through a pleader in the summons , does it mean I need not be physically present if my pleader or advocate is present?Answered in #4 so as long as a pleader represents you, you may not be present in person.7. Normally how long does it take for the e courts website to update the exact status?It is generally within a day or two, if it is updated all.8. Is it possible that Bajaj finance advocates are issuing the summons in connivance with lower staff without the matter getting allocated to any magistrate just to intimidate me?Very unlikely as it would amount to fraud and impersonation and no court staff would ever do that.Aniruddha ChakrabortyAdvocate, Bangalore44 AnswersTalk to Advocate Aniruddha Chakraborty"

The opinion of a child who is over nine years old will be considered.- Hence, for getting custody of daughter she can file a petition before the family court as she is only 3 years old."

    "answer": "Dear client,TheHindu Marriage Act, theSpecial Marriage Act, and other personal laws control divorce rules in India. It might not be enough to file for divorce based only on the fact that your sister tested positive for HIV. The husband may seek a divorce on the grounds of cruelty or irreversible mental disease, but it might be difficult to support these arguments in court. Usually, considerations of the child's best interests guide custody choices. Your sister might be able to keep custody if she can prove she can create a secure and caring home. HIV status shouldn't be the only deciding factor in disputes over custody. The wellbeing of the kid may be the court's primary concern, thus evidence of appropriate parenting will be crucial. Your sister is under no obligation to consent to a divorce.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Ancestral Property Registration without grand children signature",
    "answer": "Dear client,The ownership and succession rights are determined by the particular laws that apply in your area. Such matters are governed in India by theHindu Succession Act, 1956. All coparceners own a part of ancestral property.Typically, assets inherited up to four generations ago are considered ancestral property. The grandchildren might be entitled to the property if it is shown to be ancestral, but this will rely on a number of circumstances, such as whether the property was divided up beforehand.Sending a legal notification may or may not be permitted under local legislation and the particular circumstances.A legal notice could be sent by the grandchild.To make sure a registered Deed of Confirmation is legitimate and useful in your case, you need take it into consideration first.Regarding maternal grandfather's property:Property is classified as ancestral based on the legal framework in place at the time of acquisition and how it was used.Grandchildren's rights are contingent upon the type of property and particular conditions.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "You can sell your property to any third party. Before law even verbal agreements have validity but in this case, it is a property in question and any agreement for sale has to be signed by both the parties(even digital signature is valid) along with a token money transacted as part of the agreement and part of the consideration price. In your case neither exist and mere emails are weak testament to any sale agreement between parties that too without full description of the schedule property.Further, when it is a joint property. all parties have to agree to sell the same which is again not what happened in this case. You should be free to sell the property to anyone else.Aniruddha ChakrabortyAdvocate, Bangalore44 AnswersTalk to Advocate Aniruddha Chakraborty"

    "question": "Validity of email agreement to sell",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, a registered agreement is necessary for the successful sale of real estate. It's possible that the email correspondence by itself does not create a legally binding contract for the apartment's sale. An agreement must contain an offer, acceptance, consideration, and the desire to establish legal relations, according to the Indian Contract Act. In your instance, the agreement is not registered and no consideration (money) has been paid. In addition, theTransfer of Property Actstipulates that unless a registered instrument is used, a sale of immovable property is void. The purchaser does not obtain any rights over the property in the absence of such registration. The original buyer may not have the legal authority to cause issues or cause the sale to be delayed in light of these criteria, and the email exchange may not be enforceable.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Sorry to hear about your situation. This kind of circumstance might be difficult to handle, but it's important to do it in a cool, collected, and lawful manner. You have certain rights and alternatives, but common residential activities like wandering within your flat are not specifically governed by legislation in India. First, make an effort to speak civilly and gently with your neighbor. Describe your daily schedule and the nature of your activities, and show that you understand his worries. Provide possible remedies, like putting in carpets or giving him your phone information so he can get in touch with you directly if the noise starts to bother you. If the problem continues, keep a record of the dates and specifics of any complaints your neighbor has made. This can come in handy if you ever need to defend your behavior. As an additional option, you may think about adding soundproofing or rugs to lessen the effect of your regular activities. If your neighbor is interfering unjustly with your enjoyment of your property, you may want to file a complaint in India under Section 268 of theIndian Penal Code, which addresses public nuisances. But it's important to use caution while making legal threats. Sometimes, all it takes to stop harassment is a well-written legal notice from your attorney outlining your rights and the absence of any valid legal basis for the allegations. You may handle this situation assertively and legally by keeping lines of communication open, keeping records of events, and getting legal counsel.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "My downstairs neighbour has a problem with me walking in my flat",
    "answer": "Dear client,There is no express clause in Indian law that labels routine domestic chores like walking as a nuisance. State-specific rules or local municipal ordinances typically address noise-related issues. You could want to keep a journal of your everyday activities to show that your behaviors are within reasonable bounds and take proactive measures to address the situation before it arises. If you receive a legal notice, you should think about getting legal counsel. The complainant might not have a strong case unless you're making loud, bothersome noises. Maintaining an open line of communication with your neighbor may also prove advantageous. Seek to come to an agreement or compromise on the permissible noise levels during particular hours. Keep track of any proof that demonstrates your adherence to noise ordinances; it may come in handy while arguing your position. Since the police frequently get involved in serious conflicts in India, taking the initiative to resolve the issue could save needless judicial action.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The Act's Section 15 highlights the need for a marriage to be officially registered in the location of the ceremony. TheIndian Penal Code, specificallySection 420concerning deception and Section 494 concerning bigamy, may deem the creation of a second marriage certificate to be fraudulent and impose penalties. Legal guidelines for marriage registration are outlined in theHindu Marriage Actof 1955 and the Registration of Births and Deaths Act. Respecting the laws of the state in which the marriage occurred is necessary to keep the marriage certificate legitimate and prevent legal issues.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It is advisable to discuss this with your attorney, who can review the particular facts and relevant legislation, including theCode of Criminal Procedure(CrPC).Getting legal advice is essential. They can advise you on the necessity and appropriateness of requesting anticipatory bail.You might not have to show up in person for every hearing; your attorney ought to be able to represent you in court. They are able to argue on your side, raising issues such as jurisdiction.A power of attorney can provide someone else the right to act on your behalf, but depending on the exact powers conferred, it may or may not apply in court.If your lawyer is representing you, they should be able to explain whether or not you need to be present in person. While the summons language might offer some information, legal counsel is essential.Updates to e-court websites may take different amounts of time.Unfounded assertions may be dangerous.

    "question": "Jurisdiction for summons for private criminal complaint to a magistrate under CrPC section 200",
    "answer": "To answer your questions as below:1. How to verify if the summons is genuine, if the ecourts website does not show to which court the matter is allocated even after 1 month?Cases are often transferred between courts and ecourts is sometimes not updated to the latest case status as it depends from court to court. Also if you are able to see your name as the accused/party, then the summons must be genuine as it should bear the seal and signature of the magistrate and court (you will also find a number associated with the summons issued)2. Does the metropolitan magistrate court in Kolkata have jurisdiction in this matter if the accused is residing outside its territorial jurisdiction?Any court in India can summon any person from anywhere in India as long as the court is satisfied and admitted a complaint.3. Should I prepare to take bail as the 1st step before I am given an opportunity to argue my case?You do not need to apply for bail as it is in the summons stage. The court has not yet issued a warrant.4. Can my lawyer represent me without my physical presence on the date of the summons and answer the charges on my behalf and question the jurisdiction?Yes, your lawyer can represent you even in your absence. Also can apply before the court to exempt you from physical appearance on further dates. You are advised to engage a lawyer in Kolkata who should be able to guide further.5. Can I give power of attorney to another person to represent me and be physically present on my behalf if I do not want to go?Your lawyer himself should be able to represent you in the case and you can also provide power of attorney to anyone who is aware of the facts to represent you in case your appearance is instructed by the court during any stage of the trial process6. Since, they have asked me to appear in person or through a pleader in the summons , does it mean I need not be physically present if my pleader or advocate is present?Answered in #4 so as long as a pleader represents you, you may not be present in person.7. Normally how long does it take for the e courts website to update the exact status?It is generally within a day or two, if it is updated all.8. Is it possible that Bajaj finance advocates are issuing the summons in connivance with lower staff without the matter getting allocated to any magistrate just to intimidate me?Very unlikely as it would amount to fraud and impersonation and no court staff would ever do that.Aniruddha ChakrabortyAdvocate, Bangalore44 AnswersTalk to Advocate Aniruddha Chakraborty"

It's possible that the email correspondence by itself does not create a legally binding contract for the apartment's sale.

In your instance, the agreement is not registered and no consideration (money) has been paid. In addition, theTransfer of Property Actstipulates that unless a registered instrument is used, a sale of immovable property is void. The purchaser does not obtain any rights over the property in the absence of such registration.

    "answer": "Dear client,Sorry to hear about your situation. This kind of circumstance might be difficult to handle, but it's important to do it in a cool, collected, and lawful manner. You have certain rights and alternatives, but common residential activities like wandering within your flat are not specifically governed by legislation in India. First, make an effort to speak civilly and gently with your neighbor. Describe your daily schedule and the nature of your activities, and show that you understand his worries. Provide possible remedies, like putting in carpets or giving him your phone information so he can get in touch with you directly if the noise starts to bother you. If the problem continues, keep a record of the dates and specifics of any complaints your neighbor has made. This can come in handy if you ever need to defend your behavior. As an additional option, you may think about adding soundproofing or rugs to lessen the effect of your regular activities. If your neighbor is interfering unjustly with your enjoyment of your property, you may want to file a complaint in India under Section 268 of theIndian Penal Code, which addresses public nuisances. But it's important to use caution while making legal threats. Sometimes, all it takes to stop harassment is a well-written legal notice from your attorney outlining your rights and the absence of any valid legal basis for the allegations. You may handle this situation assertively and legally by keeping lines of communication open, keeping records of events, and getting legal counsel.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "My downstairs neighbour has a problem with me walking in my flat",
    "answer": "Dear client,There is no express clause in Indian law that labels routine domestic chores like walking as a nuisance. State-specific rules or local municipal ordinances typically address noise-related issues. You could want to keep a journal of your everyday activities to show that your behaviors are within reasonable bounds and take proactive measures to address the situation before it arises. If you receive a legal notice, you should think about getting legal counsel. The complainant might not have a strong case unless you're making loud, bothersome noises. Maintaining an open line of communication with your neighbor may also prove advantageous. Seek to come to an agreement or compromise on the permissible noise levels during particular hours. Keep track of any proof that demonstrates your adherence to noise ordinances; it may come in handy while arguing your position. Since the police frequently get involved in serious conflicts in India, taking the initiative to resolve the issue could save needless judicial action.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The deed is the last formal transfer of ownership, and the Act may use it as a crucial source when determining whether the property is held benami.The Act's Section 4(3) offers exceptions that permit the holding of property in specific roles, such as fiduciary or HUF. The property may be exempt from the Benami Transactions Act if it was held in a fiduciary role or for the benefit of coparceners in a HUF.Compared to the allocation letter, the transaction date—that is, the conveyance deed—is probably more important. Transactions made prior to the Act's effective date in 1988 might not be covered by it.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can builder charge interest on amount that has not been processed by bank for stage not completed",
    "answer": "Is there a sale agreement between you and the builder? If there is a sale agreement that specifies the payment terms and payment schedules, builder may be imposing penalty and demanding additional 5% based on that. PLease check what the sale agreement, if exists, states.Even if there is a clause in the sale agreement but based on the fact that builder has not handed over the property to you and that 90% of the consideration amount is already paid, you can issue a legal notice to the builder asking him to drop the demand and penalty interest he is trying to charge. Since the builder should be aware that the remaining 10% is subject to disbursal by bank at the time of registration, which is a standard practice, so nothing extra ordinary here.If the builder doesn't agree, you can file a case against the builder before the district consumer commission.Aniruddha ChakrabortyAdvocate, Bangalore44 AnswersTalk to Advocate Aniruddha Chakraborty"

    "answer": "Dear client,Builders in India are required by the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA) to comply with project schedules and budgetary obligations. RERA rules may have been broken if the builder is requesting payment in excess of the sum that the bank has allowed. The builder should not seek more than the building cost specified in the selling agreement, according to RERA Section 4(2)(l)(D). You might not be required to pay interest on the portion that was not distributed, in relation to the interest on the 10% that the bank withheld. If the builder's demand exceeds the amount permitted by the bank, you can register a complaint with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) in your state, mentioning that interest was charged on the money that was withheld.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Jurisdiction for summons for private criminal complaint to a magistrate under CrPC section 200",
    "answer": "To answer your questions as below:1. How to verify if the summons is genuine, if the ecourts website does not show to which court the matter is allocated even after 1 month?Cases are often transferred between courts and ecourts is sometimes not updated to the latest case status as it depends from court to court. Also if you are able to see your name as the accused/party, then the summons must be genuine as it should bear the seal and signature of the magistrate and court (you will also find a number associated with the summons issued)2. Does the metropolitan magistrate court in Kolkata have jurisdiction in this matter if the accused is residing outside its territorial jurisdiction?Any court in India can summon any person from anywhere in India as long as the court is satisfied and admitted a complaint.3. Should I prepare to take bail as the 1st step before I am given an opportunity to argue my case?You do not need to apply for bail as it is in the summons stage. The court has not yet issued a warrant.4. Can my lawyer represent me without my physical presence on the date of the summons and answer the charges on my behalf and question the jurisdiction?Yes, your lawyer can represent you even in your absence. Also can apply before the court to exempt you from physical appearance on further dates. You are advised to engage a lawyer in Kolkata who should be able to guide further.5. Can I give power of attorney to another person to represent me and be physically present on my behalf if I do not want to go?Your lawyer himself should be able to represent you in the case and you can also provide power of attorney to anyone who is aware of the facts to represent you in case your appearance is instructed by the court during any stage of the trial process6. Since, they have asked me to appear in person or through a pleader in the summons , does it mean I need not be physically present if my pleader or advocate is present?Answered in #4 so as long as a pleader represents you, you may not be present in person.7. Normally how long does it take for the e courts website to update the exact status?It is generally within a day or two, if it is updated all.8. Is it possible that Bajaj finance advocates are issuing the summons in connivance with lower staff without the matter getting allocated to any magistrate just to intimidate me?Very unlikely as it would amount to fraud and impersonation and no court staff would ever do that.Aniruddha ChakrabortyAdvocate, Bangalore44 AnswersTalk to Advocate Aniruddha Chakraborty"

All coparceners own a part of ancestral property.Typically, assets inherited up to four generations ago are considered ancestral property. The grandchildren might be entitled to the property if it is shown to be ancestral, but this will rely on a number of circumstances, such as whether the property was divided up beforehand.Sending a legal notification may or may not be permitted under local legislation and the particular circumstances.A legal notice could be sent by the grandchild.To make sure a registered Deed of Confirmation is legitimate and useful in your case, you need take it into consideration first.Regarding maternal grandfather's property:Property is classified as ancestral based on the legal framework in place at the time of acquisition and how it was used.Grandchildren's rights are contingent upon the type of property and particular conditions.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Although it's not required by law, post-dated checks, or PDCs, are frequently requested as a security measure by builders in India. But given the approaching home loan disbursement, the builder's insistence on PDCs raises questions. A key requirement for a valid sale is the payment of the entire consideration, as stated in Section 13(1) of the Sale of Goods Act. This seems to be at odds with the builder's need for PDCs, particularly in light of the approaching house loan payout. You might want to think about getting a formal statement from the builder that clearly states that the PDCs will be returned once the bank receives the entire amount as a precaution. You can also consult the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA), which safeguards homebuyers' interests and places a strong emphasis on openness. In the event that the builder declines to assist, you may consult the Real Estate Regulatory Authority of the state in question for advice.

According to Indian law, you can ask the court to order your neighbor to fix the leak by filing a lawsuit under the Specific Relief Act.

    "answer": "Dear client,Regarding the 1988 Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act:When assessing if a transaction is lawful, the conveyance deed usually has greater significance than the allocation letter. The deed is the last formal transfer of ownership, and the Act may use it as a crucial source when determining whether the property is held benami.The Act's Section 4(3) offers exceptions that permit the holding of property in specific roles, such as fiduciary or HUF. The property may be exempt from the Benami Transactions Act if it was held in a fiduciary role or for the benefit of coparceners in a HUF.Compared to the allocation letter, the transaction date—that is, the conveyance deed—is probably more important. Transactions made prior to the Act's effective date in 1988 might not be covered by it.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

All coparceners own a part of ancestral property.Typically, assets inherited up to four generations ago are considered ancestral property. The grandchildren might be entitled to the property if it is shown to be ancestral, but this will rely on a number of circumstances, such as whether the property was divided up beforehand.Sending a legal notification may or may not be permitted under local legislation and the particular circumstances.A legal notice could be sent by the grandchild.To make sure a registered Deed of Confirmation is legitimate and useful in your case, you need take it into consideration first.Regarding maternal grandfather's property:Property is classified as ancestral based on the legal framework in place at the time of acquisition and how it was used.Grandchildren's rights are contingent upon the type of property and particular conditions.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Filing cheating and other criminal cases",
    "answer": "Dear client,I'm sorry to hear about the situation you're facing with the delayed possession of your flat in Bangalore. Legal recourse in such matters involves various actions that can be taken against the builder based on the contractual agreements and theConsumer Protection Act. You've mentioned that a consumer case is already filed, which is a good step. Pursuing this avenue can help in seeking compensation for the delay in possession and breach of agreement. Based on the clauses in the Agreement of Sale where the builder provided an undertaking that the property is free from encumbrances, you might consider filing a criminal complaint against the builder for offenses such as:-Cheating: If the builder knowingly provided false information regarding the encroachments or the status of the property.-Breach of Contract: If the builder has violated the terms of the agreement by failing to deliver possession as promised.You can file a complaint with the police against the builder for fraudulent activities or cheating. Ensure that you have all the necessary documents and evidence to support your case.Filing a criminal case against the builder directly in your home state's High Court or in a sub-ordinate/district court in Agra without approaching the police might not be the typical route for criminal cases. Usually, criminal cases are initiated through the police, who investigate the matter and then file a charge sheet in the appropriate court. However, in some exceptional circumstances, especially when there's a clear and direct case of fraud or other criminal offenses, it might be possible to approach the court directly.To file a criminal case directly in court without involving the police, you'll need to:1. Prepare a Complaint: Draft a comprehensive complaint outlining the criminal offenses committed by the builder, supported by all relevant documents and evidence.2. Approach the Court: You can approach the High Court or a sub-ordinate/district court in Agra directly to file a private criminal complaint. This complaint should detail the offenses committed by the builder and why you're seeking legal action directly through the court.3. Court's Discretion: Whether the court accepts your complaint and initiates proceedings directly or requires police intervention might vary based on the specifics of your case and the court's discretion.This approach involves a different legal procedure and might have its own complexities. It's crucial to have strong evidence and legal guidance when pursuing this route.Filing an FIR (First Information Report) with the police station regarding the delayed possession of your property doesn't necessarily require an immediate incident or a physical place involved. In cases of alleged fraud, breach of contract, or other criminal offenses related to property matters, an FIR can be filed based on the documents and evidence supporting your complaint. The police will record the details provided in your complaint, which includes the allegations against the builder, the documents supporting your claim, and any other relevant information you provide. After the FIR is lodged, the police are responsible for conducting an investigation. They may visit the site, gather further evidence, and interview relevant parties to verify the claims made in the complaint. Based on their investigation, the police will compile a report detailing their findings. This report will be submitted to the appropriate authorities for further action. Depending on the findings of their investigation, the police may take legal action against the accused, which could involve arrests, further questioning, or filing a charge sheet in court. Even if the case primarily involves documents and financial matters without an immediate physical incident, the police are obligated to investigate the matter based on the information provided in the FIR.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Sorry to hear about your situation. This kind of circumstance might be difficult to handle, but it's important to do it in a cool, collected, and lawful manner. You have certain rights and alternatives, but common residential activities like wandering within your flat are not specifically governed by legislation in India. First, make an effort to speak civilly and gently with your neighbor. Describe your daily schedule and the nature of your activities, and show that you understand his worries. Provide possible remedies, like putting in carpets or giving him your phone information so he can get in touch with you directly if the noise starts to bother you. If the problem continues, keep a record of the dates and specifics of any complaints your neighbor has made. This can come in handy if you ever need to defend your behavior. As an additional option, you may think about adding soundproofing or rugs to lessen the effect of your regular activities. If your neighbor is interfering unjustly with your enjoyment of your property, you may want to file a complaint in India under Section 268 of theIndian Penal Code, which addresses public nuisances. But it's important to use caution while making legal threats. Sometimes, all it takes to stop harassment is a well-written legal notice from your attorney outlining your rights and the absence of any valid legal basis for the allegations. You may handle this situation assertively and legally by keeping lines of communication open, keeping records of events, and getting legal counsel.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,There is no express clause in Indian law that labels routine domestic chores like walking as a nuisance. State-specific rules or local municipal ordinances typically address noise-related issues. You could want to keep a journal of your everyday activities to show that your behaviors are within reasonable bounds and take proactive measures to address the situation before it arises. If you receive a legal notice, you should think about getting legal counsel. The complainant might not have a strong case unless you're making loud, bothersome noises. Maintaining an open line of communication with your neighbor may also prove advantageous. Seek to come to an agreement or compromise on the permissible noise levels during particular hours. Keep track of any proof that demonstrates your adherence to noise ordinances; it may come in handy while arguing your position. Since the police frequently get involved in serious conflicts in India, taking the initiative to resolve the issue could save needless judicial action.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Calling off a marriage",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, ending a relationship is typically regarded as a civil matter as opposed to a legal one. However, if formal wedding invitations have been sent out or if substantial sums of money have been exchanged, there might be legal repercussions. Taking into account your circumstances, it's critical to realize that an engagement is a vow to marry, and ending it should preferably be done peacefully. Legally speaking, there might not be any repercussions if there hasn't been a formal wedding ceremony or if there haven't been any contracts or financial obligations formed. Given the situation, where the bride is the subject of ongoing criminal proceedings, it becomes sense to take care of those matters first before moving forward with the marriage. You have good reason to be concerned about the possible repercussions of cruelty against a married lady, as stated inSection 498Aof theIndian Penal Code. Make sure you honor any contractual duties and handle the situation delicately. An amicable outcome requires open communication about the decision with the bride's family and a mutually beneficial understanding.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "As long as the marriage is not solemnized in India according toHindu Marriage act(assuming the bride is also Hindu), it is not a valid marriage and any pre-marriage engagement can be called off based on mutual understanding. In this case, if the bride's side is not ready to call it off, you can simply return any worth received from them through a known relative or family member.Ideally, in this scenario, when you do not have confidence about the sustainability of this relationship, it is understandable since marriage involves not only the parties into marriage but families as well are part of the arrangement.

    "answer": "Dear client,The ownership and succession rights are determined by the particular laws that apply in your area. Such matters are governed in India by theHindu Succession Act, 1956. All coparceners own a part of ancestral property.Typically, assets inherited up to four generations ago are considered ancestral property. The grandchildren might be entitled to the property if it is shown to be ancestral, but this will rely on a number of circumstances, such as whether the property was divided up beforehand.Sending a legal notification may or may not be permitted under local legislation and the particular circumstances.A legal notice could be sent by the grandchild.To make sure a registered Deed of Confirmation is legitimate and useful in your case, you need take it into consideration first.Regarding maternal grandfather's property:Property is classified as ancestral based on the legal framework in place at the time of acquisition and how it was used.Grandchildren's rights are contingent upon the type of property and particular conditions.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It might not be enough to file for divorce based only on the fact that your sister tested positive for HIV. The husband may seek a divorce on the grounds of cruelty or irreversible mental disease, but it might be difficult to support these arguments in court. Usually, considerations of the child's best interests guide custody choices. Your sister might be able to keep custody if she can prove she can create a secure and caring home. HIV status shouldn't be the only deciding factor in disputes over custody. The wellbeing of the kid may be the court's primary concern, thus evidence of appropriate parenting will be crucial.

    "answer": "Dear client,Although it's not required by law, post-dated checks, or PDCs, are frequently requested as a security measure by builders in India. But given the approaching home loan disbursement, the builder's insistence on PDCs raises questions. A key requirement for a valid sale is the payment of the entire consideration, as stated in Section 13(1) of the Sale of Goods Act. This seems to be at odds with the builder's need for PDCs, particularly in light of the approaching house loan payout. You might want to think about getting a formal statement from the builder that clearly states that the PDCs will be returned once the bank receives the entire amount as a precaution. You can also consult the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA), which safeguards homebuyers' interests and places a strong emphasis on openness. In the event that the builder declines to assist, you may consult the Real Estate Regulatory Authority of the state in question for advice.

According to Indian law, you can ask the court to order your neighbor to fix the leak by filing a lawsuit under the Specific Relief Act. In addition, you may use the principles of tort law to pursue damages for losses you have incurred as a result of the injury. A civil case may take a variety of lengths, and delays are usual. On the other hand, deadlines for various phases of the legal process are specified in the Code of Civil Procedure. To bolster your case, you must obtain proof and meticulously record the damages. Even though some civil lawsuits could drag on for years, aggressive legal tactics, such as mediation and other forms of alternative dispute resolution, may help hasten the resolution process.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Sorry to hear about your situation. This kind of circumstance might be difficult to handle, but it's important to do it in a cool, collected, and lawful manner. You have certain rights and alternatives, but common residential activities like wandering within your flat are not specifically governed by legislation in India. First, make an effort to speak civilly and gently with your neighbor. Describe your daily schedule and the nature of your activities, and show that you understand his worries. Provide possible remedies, like putting in carpets or giving him your phone information so he can get in touch with you directly if the noise starts to bother you. If the problem continues, keep a record of the dates and specifics of any complaints your neighbor has made. This can come in handy if you ever need to defend your behavior. As an additional option, you may think about adding soundproofing or rugs to lessen the effect of your regular activities. If your neighbor is interfering unjustly with your enjoyment of your property, you may want to file a complaint in India under Section 268 of theIndian Penal Code, which addresses public nuisances. But it's important to use caution while making legal threats. Sometimes, all it takes to stop harassment is a well-written legal notice from your attorney outlining your rights and the absence of any valid legal basis for the allegations. You may handle this situation assertively and legally by keeping lines of communication open, keeping records of events, and getting legal counsel.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "My downstairs neighbour has a problem with me walking in my flat",
    "answer": "Dear client,There is no express clause in Indian law that labels routine domestic chores like walking as a nuisance. State-specific rules or local municipal ordinances typically address noise-related issues. You could want to keep a journal of your everyday activities to show that your behaviors are within reasonable bounds and take proactive measures to address the situation before it arises. If you receive a legal notice, you should think about getting legal counsel. The complainant might not have a strong case unless you're making loud, bothersome noises. Maintaining an open line of communication with your neighbor may also prove advantageous. Seek to come to an agreement or compromise on the permissible noise levels during particular hours. Keep track of any proof that demonstrates your adherence to noise ordinances; it may come in handy while arguing your position. Since the police frequently get involved in serious conflicts in India, taking the initiative to resolve the issue could save needless judicial action.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Filing cheating and other criminal cases",
    "answer": "Dear client,I'm sorry to hear about the situation you're facing with the delayed possession of your flat in Bangalore. Legal recourse in such matters involves various actions that can be taken against the builder based on the contractual agreements and theConsumer Protection Act. You've mentioned that a consumer case is already filed, which is a good step. Pursuing this avenue can help in seeking compensation for the delay in possession and breach of agreement. Based on the clauses in the Agreement of Sale where the builder provided an undertaking that the property is free from encumbrances, you might consider filing a criminal complaint against the builder for offenses such as:-Cheating: If the builder knowingly provided false information regarding the encroachments or the status of the property.-Breach of Contract: If the builder has violated the terms of the agreement by failing to deliver possession as promised.You can file a complaint with the police against the builder for fraudulent activities or cheating. Ensure that you have all the necessary documents and evidence to support your case.Filing a criminal case against the builder directly in your home state's High Court or in a sub-ordinate/district court in Agra without approaching the police might not be the typical route for criminal cases. Usually, criminal cases are initiated through the police, who investigate the matter and then file a charge sheet in the appropriate court. However, in some exceptional circumstances, especially when there's a clear and direct case of fraud or other criminal offenses, it might be possible to approach the court directly.To file a criminal case directly in court without involving the police, you'll need to:1. Prepare a Complaint: Draft a comprehensive complaint outlining the criminal offenses committed by the builder, supported by all relevant documents and evidence.2. Approach the Court: You can approach the High Court or a sub-ordinate/district court in Agra directly to file a private criminal complaint. This complaint should detail the offenses committed by the builder and why you're seeking legal action directly through the court.3. Court's Discretion: Whether the court accepts your complaint and initiates proceedings directly or requires police intervention might vary based on the specifics of your case and the court's discretion.This approach involves a different legal procedure and might have its own complexities. It's crucial to have strong evidence and legal guidance when pursuing this route.Filing an FIR (First Information Report) with the police station regarding the delayed possession of your property doesn't necessarily require an immediate incident or a physical place involved. In cases of alleged fraud, breach of contract, or other criminal offenses related to property matters, an FIR can be filed based on the documents and evidence supporting your complaint. The police will record the details provided in your complaint, which includes the allegations against the builder, the documents supporting your claim, and any other relevant information you provide. After the FIR is lodged, the police are responsible for conducting an investigation. They may visit the site, gather further evidence, and interview relevant parties to verify the claims made in the complaint. Based on their investigation, the police will compile a report detailing their findings. This report will be submitted to the appropriate authorities for further action. Depending on the findings of their investigation, the police may take legal action against the accused, which could involve arrests, further questioning, or filing a charge sheet in court. Even if the case primarily involves documents and financial matters without an immediate physical incident, the police are obligated to investigate the matter based on the information provided in the FIR.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Sending a legal notice in Hyderabad might cost anywhere between ₹3,000 and ₹10,000, depending on the intricacy of the case and the attorney's level of experience. According to Indian law, you can ask the court to order your neighbor to fix the leak by filing a lawsuit under the Specific Relief Act. In addition, you may use the principles of tort law to pursue damages for losses you have incurred as a result of the injury. A civil case may take a variety of lengths, and delays are usual. On the other hand, deadlines for various phases of the legal process are specified in the Code of Civil Procedure. To bolster your case, you must obtain proof and meticulously record the damages. Even though some civil lawsuits could drag on for years, aggressive legal tactics, such as mediation and other forms of alternative dispute resolution, may help hasten the resolution process.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It might not be enough to file for divorce based only on the fact that your sister tested positive for HIV. The husband may seek a divorce on the grounds of cruelty or irreversible mental disease, but it might be difficult to support these arguments in court. Usually, considerations of the child's best interests guide custody choices. Your sister might be able to keep custody if she can prove she can create a secure and caring home. HIV status shouldn't be the only deciding factor in disputes over custody. The wellbeing of the kid may be the court's primary concern, thus evidence of appropriate parenting will be crucial.

    "answer": "Dear client,Sorry to hear about your situation. This kind of circumstance might be difficult to handle, but it's important to do it in a cool, collected, and lawful manner. You have certain rights and alternatives, but common residential activities like wandering within your flat are not specifically governed by legislation in India. First, make an effort to speak civilly and gently with your neighbor. Describe your daily schedule and the nature of your activities, and show that you understand his worries. Provide possible remedies, like putting in carpets or giving him your phone information so he can get in touch with you directly if the noise starts to bother you. If the problem continues, keep a record of the dates and specifics of any complaints your neighbor has made. This can come in handy if you ever need to defend your behavior. As an additional option, you may think about adding soundproofing or rugs to lessen the effect of your regular activities. If your neighbor is interfering unjustly with your enjoyment of your property, you may want to file a complaint in India under Section 268 of theIndian Penal Code, which addresses public nuisances. But it's important to use caution while making legal threats. Sometimes, all it takes to stop harassment is a well-written legal notice from your attorney outlining your rights and the absence of any valid legal basis for the allegations. You may handle this situation assertively and legally by keeping lines of communication open, keeping records of events, and getting legal counsel.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "My downstairs neighbour has a problem with me walking in my flat",
    "answer": "Dear client,There is no express clause in Indian law that labels routine domestic chores like walking as a nuisance. State-specific rules or local municipal ordinances typically address noise-related issues. You could want to keep a journal of your everyday activities to show that your behaviors are within reasonable bounds and take proactive measures to address the situation before it arises. If you receive a legal notice, you should think about getting legal counsel. The complainant might not have a strong case unless you're making loud, bothersome noises. Maintaining an open line of communication with your neighbor may also prove advantageous. Seek to come to an agreement or compromise on the permissible noise levels during particular hours. Keep track of any proof that demonstrates your adherence to noise ordinances; it may come in handy while arguing your position. Since the police frequently get involved in serious conflicts in India, taking the initiative to resolve the issue could save needless judicial action.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Calling off a marriage",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, ending a relationship is typically regarded as a civil matter as opposed to a legal one. However, if formal wedding invitations have been sent out or if substantial sums of money have been exchanged, there might be legal repercussions. Taking into account your circumstances, it's critical to realize that an engagement is a vow to marry, and ending it should preferably be done peacefully. Legally speaking, there might not be any repercussions if there hasn't been a formal wedding ceremony or if there haven't been any contracts or financial obligations formed. Given the situation, where the bride is the subject of ongoing criminal proceedings, it becomes sense to take care of those matters first before moving forward with the marriage. You have good reason to be concerned about the possible repercussions of cruelty against a married lady, as stated inSection 498Aof theIndian Penal Code. Make sure you honor any contractual duties and handle the situation delicately. An amicable outcome requires open communication about the decision with the bride's family and a mutually beneficial understanding.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Divorce on grounds of HIV",
    "answer": "Dear client,TheHindu Marriage Act, theSpecial Marriage Act, and other personal laws control divorce rules in India. It might not be enough to file for divorce based only on the fact that your sister tested positive for HIV. The husband may seek a divorce on the grounds of cruelty or irreversible mental disease, but it might be difficult to support these arguments in court. Usually, considerations of the child's best interests guide custody choices. Your sister might be able to keep custody if she can prove she can create a secure and caring home. HIV status shouldn't be the only deciding factor in disputes over custody. The wellbeing of the kid may be the court's primary concern, thus evidence of appropriate parenting will be crucial. Your sister is under no obligation to consent to a divorce.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, you can think about having a symbolic or religious ceremony to renew your commitment to each other in order to satisfy the German embassy's requirement for a fresh marriage certificate with the 2024 date. All the necessary Hindu rites should be performed during this ceremony, just as they were during your Arya Samaj marriage. This ceremony can be used to receive a certificate from the priest or the Arya Samaj temple acknowledging the ceremonies conducted, even though it won't have legal standing. The German embassy might then get this certificate as further proof of the marriage celebration on the intended date. To further explain the initial lack of photographic evidence, you can also present paperwork from the Arya Samaj temple or a priest attesting to the legitimacy of the ceremonies carried out during the 2023 marriage.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,In India, ending a relationship is typically regarded as a civil matter as opposed to a legal one. However, if formal wedding invitations have been sent out or if substantial sums of money have been exchanged, there might be legal repercussions. Taking into account your circumstances, it's critical to realize that an engagement is a vow to marry, and ending it should preferably be done peacefully. Legally speaking, there might not be any repercussions if there hasn't been a formal wedding ceremony or if there haven't been any contracts or financial obligations formed. Given the situation, where the bride is the subject of ongoing criminal proceedings, it becomes sense to take care of those matters first before moving forward with the marriage. You have good reason to be concerned about the possible repercussions of cruelty against a married lady, as stated inSection 498Aof theIndian Penal Code. Make sure you honor any contractual duties and handle the situation delicately.

    "question": "Divorce on grounds of HIV",
    "answer": "Dear client,TheHindu Marriage Act, theSpecial Marriage Act, and other personal laws control divorce rules in India. It might not be enough to file for divorce based only on the fact that your sister tested positive for HIV. The husband may seek a divorce on the grounds of cruelty or irreversible mental disease, but it might be difficult to support these arguments in court. Usually, considerations of the child's best interests guide custody choices. Your sister might be able to keep custody if she can prove she can create a secure and caring home. HIV status shouldn't be the only deciding factor in disputes over custody. The wellbeing of the kid may be the court's primary concern, thus evidence of appropriate parenting will be crucial. Your sister is under no obligation to consent to a divorce.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "the builder's demand is unreasonablethere is no such 'standard procedure'it is merely some internal arbitrary procedure of the builder companyand saying that they will register the agreement for sale only on receipt of full sale price is itself illegal because i believe even in your state there will be a requirement that on receipt of 10% of the total sale price the builder has to mandatorily register an agreement for sale with the purchaser. The Central RERA is clear on this.it appears that the builder wants the PDC not against the balance 25% but for other charges which in case you fail to pay, the builder can enter that amount in the cheque and encash itthis is completely unprofessional and cheapi suggest that you give this PDC to the builder only under cover of your letter in which you have to state in detail the circumstances under which you are giving this cheque and how it is to be dealt with as represented to you by the builder, so that the builder cannot play any mischief in futureYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Builder asking for Post-Dated Cheques",
    "answer": "Dear client,Although it's not required by law, post-dated checks, or PDCs, are frequently requested as a security measure by builders in India. But given the approaching home loan disbursement, the builder's insistence on PDCs raises questions. A key requirement for a valid sale is the payment of the entire consideration, as stated in Section 13(1) of the Sale of Goods Act. This seems to be at odds with the builder's need for PDCs, particularly in light of the approaching house loan payout. You might want to think about getting a formal statement from the builder that clearly states that the PDCs will be returned once the bank receives the entire amount as a precaution. You can also consult the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA), which safeguards homebuyers' interests and places a strong emphasis on openness. In the event that the builder declines to assist, you may consult the Real Estate Regulatory Authority of the state in question for advice. When it comes to paperwork, written communication should always come first.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,If the charges are linked and stem from the same set of facts, they may be tried concurrently under Sections 406 and 420 of theIndian Penal Code(IPC). The particulars of your case may influence the court to take this into account.Whether or not a bail bond needs to be provided is up to the court. You could occasionally be asked to post bail even before your guilt is established.The cost of filing the paperwork associated with a bail bond might vary depending on the lawyer's experience and the intricacy of the case. It's a good idea to go over costs up front with your attorney and look at options that suit your budget.One alternative is to file a case for the quashing of the FIR in the High Court under Section 482 of theCode of Criminal Procedure(CrPC). The specifics of your situation will determine if it's wise.Answer to your further questions are as follow:ConsideringIPC 406(Criminal Breach of Trust), changing terms and conditions without giving parties enough notice could have an effect on their mutual trust.IPC 418 (Cheating with knowledge that the person whose interest the criminal is obligated to defend may suffer unlawful loss): An in-depth analysis of the evidence is necessary to determine fraud intent.IPC 420(Cheating and dishonestly inducing property delivery): Rejecting a NACH transaction may not always equate to fraud. Examine if the situation satisfiesIPC 420requirements and whether your conduct falls under the legal definition of fraud.According toIndian Penal Code,Section 506, criminal intimidation requires the presence of a genuine threat that instills fear. Determine if the conversation qualifies as intimidation under the law.Answers to the last set of questions asked by you are as follow:Even thoughIPC 406and 420 are non-bailable offenses, whether or not they can be charged simultaneously will depend on the particulars of each case. If it is proven that there has been a misuse of the legal system or that the accusations are baseless, courts have the authority to dismiss charges made underCrPC 482. Nonetheless, the High Court has the final say over whether to quake.Gathering proof is a wise move. Include all pertinent paperwork in your police complaint if you choose to submit one. During court procedures, the admissibility of these papers will be decided.It's critical to keep yourself updated on any FIRs filed against you. In order to comprehend the situation and take the necessary measures, legal counsel should be consulted as soon as possible if no notice has been received.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "I bought a property from a bank auction under SARFAESI Act, but the defaulter already sold the land",
    "answer": "Dear client,By bringing a writ suit against the bank, the registration authorities, and other relevant persons, you have acted appropriately. Your purchase made through an online auction is generally regarded as legitimate under the SARFAESI Act, and the bank's sale certificate supports this claim. Seeking legal recourse is consistent with your focus on using a writ petition to contest the forged documents. In the court proceedings, it is imperative that you draw attention to the violations of SARFAESI Act Sections 13(2) and 13(4), stressing the bank's notice and your adherence to the lawful acquisition process. Furthermore, since registration agencies are involved in registering and confirming real estate transactions, their involvement is essential. Their inability to stop fraudulent transactions and keep proper records—possibly in violation of applicable land registration laws—is probably the basis of your case against them. Make sure your legal counsel highlights the disparities in the Encumbrance Certificate and proves the legitimacy of your acquisition via the SARFAESI Act.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If the marriage is not a valid marriage ...it is not a marriage in the eyes of law. The 'saptapadi' ceremony under the Hindu law is one of the essential ingredients to constitute a valid marriage.TheAllahabad High Courthas upheld that a Hindu marriage is invalid without the 'Saptapadi' ceremony and other rituals,However the marriage registered cannot be cancelled .The marriage will stand dissolved by a decree of divorce pronounced by court.The subsequent marriage solemnised following the rituals can be registeredT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Dear client,In India, a marriage cannot be re-registered on a different date once it has been registered. However, you can think about having a symbolic or religious ceremony to renew your commitment to each other in order to satisfy the German embassy's requirement for a fresh marriage certificate with the 2024 date. All the necessary Hindu rites should be performed during this ceremony, just as they were during your Arya Samaj marriage. This ceremony can be used to receive a certificate from the priest or the Arya Samaj temple acknowledging the ceremonies conducted, even though it won't have legal standing. The German embassy might then get this certificate as further proof of the marriage celebration on the intended date. To further explain the initial lack of photographic evidence, you can also present paperwork from the Arya Samaj temple or a priest attesting to the legitimacy of the ceremonies carried out during the 2023 marriage.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Calling off a marriage",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, ending a relationship is typically regarded as a civil matter as opposed to a legal one. However, if formal wedding invitations have been sent out or if substantial sums of money have been exchanged, there might be legal repercussions. Taking into account your circumstances, it's critical to realize that an engagement is a vow to marry, and ending it should preferably be done peacefully. Legally speaking, there might not be any repercussions if there hasn't been a formal wedding ceremony or if there haven't been any contracts or financial obligations formed. Given the situation, where the bride is the subject of ongoing criminal proceedings, it becomes sense to take care of those matters first before moving forward with the marriage. You have good reason to be concerned about the possible repercussions of cruelty against a married lady, as stated inSection 498Aof theIndian Penal Code. Make sure you honor any contractual duties and handle the situation delicately. An amicable outcome requires open communication about the decision with the bride's family and a mutually beneficial understanding.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Although it's not required by law, post-dated checks, or PDCs, are frequently requested as a security measure by builders in India. But given the approaching home loan disbursement, the builder's insistence on PDCs raises questions. A key requirement for a valid sale is the payment of the entire consideration, as stated in Section 13(1) of the Sale of Goods Act. This seems to be at odds with the builder's need for PDCs, particularly in light of the approaching house loan payout. You might want to think about getting a formal statement from the builder that clearly states that the PDCs will be returned once the bank receives the entire amount as a precaution. You can also consult the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA), which safeguards homebuyers' interests and places a strong emphasis on openness. In the event that the builder declines to assist, you may consult the Real Estate Regulatory Authority of the state in question for advice.

    "question": "Is Amendment in plaint required for new contention (Law point)",
    "answer": "Dear client,In order to prevent issues later, it is often advised in the Indian legal system to include all pertinent claims and reliefs requested in the initial plaint. There is a chance that the court won't take the argument pertaining to Section 22 of theHindu Succession Actinto consideration because it was added to the replication and not contained in the original plaint. Formally amending the plaint would ensure that the court treats your position regarding Section 22 appropriately. The reference to provision 22 of theHindu Succession Actand the request for suitable relief under this provision should be made clear in this revision. If the plaint is not amended, the court may be less inclined to address this particular argument because the pleadings in the plaint usually serve as the basis for issue framing. Order VI, Rule 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 grants the court the authority to permit pleading revisions, so long as the other party is not adversely affected. It is therefore advised to alter the plaint to specifically incorporate Section 22 and the related remedies.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,If the charges are linked and stem from the same set of facts, they may be tried concurrently under Sections 406 and 420 of theIndian Penal Code(IPC). The particulars of your case may influence the court to take this into account.Whether or not a bail bond needs to be provided is up to the court. You could occasionally be asked to post bail even before your guilt is established.The cost of filing the paperwork associated with a bail bond might vary depending on the lawyer's experience and the intricacy of the case. It's a good idea to go over costs up front with your attorney and look at options that suit your budget.One alternative is to file a case for the quashing of the FIR in the High Court under Section 482 of theCode of Criminal Procedure(CrPC). The specifics of your situation will determine if it's wise.Answer to your further questions are as follow:ConsideringIPC 406(Criminal Breach of Trust), changing terms and conditions without giving parties enough notice could have an effect on their mutual trust.IPC 418 (Cheating with knowledge that the person whose interest the criminal is obligated to defend may suffer unlawful loss): An in-depth analysis of the evidence is necessary to determine fraud intent.IPC 420(Cheating and dishonestly inducing property delivery): Rejecting a NACH transaction may not always equate to fraud. Examine if the situation satisfiesIPC 420requirements and whether your conduct falls under the legal definition of fraud.According toIndian Penal Code,Section 506, criminal intimidation requires the presence of a genuine threat that instills fear. Determine if the conversation qualifies as intimidation under the law.Answers to the last set of questions asked by you are as follow:Even thoughIPC 406and 420 are non-bailable offenses, whether or not they can be charged simultaneously will depend on the particulars of each case. If it is proven that there has been a misuse of the legal system or that the accusations are baseless, courts have the authority to dismiss charges made underCrPC 482. Nonetheless, the High Court has the final say over whether to quake.Gathering proof is a wise move. Include all pertinent paperwork in your police complaint if you choose to submit one. During court procedures, the admissibility of these papers will be decided.It's critical to keep yourself updated on any FIRs filed against you. In order to comprehend the situation and take the necessary measures, legal counsel should be consulted as soon as possible if no notice has been received.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Filing cheating and other criminal cases",
    "answer": "Dear client,I'm sorry to hear about the situation you're facing with the delayed possession of your flat in Bangalore. Legal recourse in such matters involves various actions that can be taken against the builder based on the contractual agreements and theConsumer Protection Act. You've mentioned that a consumer case is already filed, which is a good step. Pursuing this avenue can help in seeking compensation for the delay in possession and breach of agreement. Based on the clauses in the Agreement of Sale where the builder provided an undertaking that the property is free from encumbrances, you might consider filing a criminal complaint against the builder for offenses such as:-Cheating: If the builder knowingly provided false information regarding the encroachments or the status of the property.-Breach of Contract: If the builder has violated the terms of the agreement by failing to deliver possession as promised.You can file a complaint with the police against the builder for fraudulent activities or cheating. Ensure that you have all the necessary documents and evidence to support your case.Filing a criminal case against the builder directly in your home state's High Court or in a sub-ordinate/district court in Agra without approaching the police might not be the typical route for criminal cases. Usually, criminal cases are initiated through the police, who investigate the matter and then file a charge sheet in the appropriate court. However, in some exceptional circumstances, especially when there's a clear and direct case of fraud or other criminal offenses, it might be possible to approach the court directly.To file a criminal case directly in court without involving the police, you'll need to:1. Prepare a Complaint: Draft a comprehensive complaint outlining the criminal offenses committed by the builder, supported by all relevant documents and evidence.2. Approach the Court: You can approach the High Court or a sub-ordinate/district court in Agra directly to file a private criminal complaint. This complaint should detail the offenses committed by the builder and why you're seeking legal action directly through the court.3. Court's Discretion: Whether the court accepts your complaint and initiates proceedings directly or requires police intervention might vary based on the specifics of your case and the court's discretion.This approach involves a different legal procedure and might have its own complexities. It's crucial to have strong evidence and legal guidance when pursuing this route.Filing an FIR (First Information Report) with the police station regarding the delayed possession of your property doesn't necessarily require an immediate incident or a physical place involved. In cases of alleged fraud, breach of contract, or other criminal offenses related to property matters, an FIR can be filed based on the documents and evidence supporting your complaint. The police will record the details provided in your complaint, which includes the allegations against the builder, the documents supporting your claim, and any other relevant information you provide. After the FIR is lodged, the police are responsible for conducting an investigation. They may visit the site, gather further evidence, and interview relevant parties to verify the claims made in the complaint. Based on their investigation, the police will compile a report detailing their findings. This report will be submitted to the appropriate authorities for further action. Depending on the findings of their investigation, the police may take legal action against the accused, which could involve arrests, further questioning, or filing a charge sheet in court. Even if the case primarily involves documents and financial matters without an immediate physical incident, the police are obligated to investigate the matter based on the information provided in the FIR.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If the marriage is not a valid marriage ...it is not a marriage in the eyes of law. The 'saptapadi' ceremony under the Hindu law is one of the essential ingredients to constitute a valid marriage.TheAllahabad High Courthas upheld that a Hindu marriage is invalid without the 'Saptapadi' ceremony and other rituals,However the marriage registered cannot be cancelled .The marriage will stand dissolved by a decree of divorce pronounced by court.The subsequent marriage solemnised following the rituals can be registeredT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Dear client,In India, a marriage cannot be re-registered on a different date once it has been registered. However, you can think about having a symbolic or religious ceremony to renew your commitment to each other in order to satisfy the German embassy's requirement for a fresh marriage certificate with the 2024 date. All the necessary Hindu rites should be performed during this ceremony, just as they were during your Arya Samaj marriage. This ceremony can be used to receive a certificate from the priest or the Arya Samaj temple acknowledging the ceremonies conducted, even though it won't have legal standing. The German embassy might then get this certificate as further proof of the marriage celebration on the intended date. To further explain the initial lack of photographic evidence, you can also present paperwork from the Arya Samaj temple or a priest attesting to the legitimacy of the ceremonies carried out during the 2023 marriage.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969 governs marriage registration in India. The Act's Section 15 highlights the need for a marriage to be officially registered in the location of the ceremony. TheIndian Penal Code, specificallySection 420concerning deception and Section 494 concerning bigamy, may deem the creation of a second marriage certificate to be fraudulent and impose penalties. Legal guidelines for marriage registration are outlined in theHindu Marriage Actof 1955 and the Registration of Births and Deaths Act.

The Central RERA is clear on this.it appears that the builder wants the PDC not against the balance 25% but for other charges which in case you fail to pay, the builder can enter that amount in the cheque and encash itthis is completely unprofessional and cheapi suggest that you give this PDC to the builder only under cover of your letter in which you have to state in detail the circumstances under which you are giving this cheque and how it is to be dealt with as represented to you by the builder, so that the builder cannot play any mischief in futureYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Builder asking for Post-Dated Cheques",
    "answer": "Dear client,Although it's not required by law, post-dated checks, or PDCs, are frequently requested as a security measure by builders in India. But given the approaching home loan disbursement, the builder's insistence on PDCs raises questions. A key requirement for a valid sale is the payment of the entire consideration, as stated in Section 13(1) of the Sale of Goods Act. This seems to be at odds with the builder's need for PDCs, particularly in light of the approaching house loan payout. You might want to think about getting a formal statement from the builder that clearly states that the PDCs will be returned once the bank receives the entire amount as a precaution. You can also consult the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA), which safeguards homebuyers' interests and places a strong emphasis on openness. In the event that the builder declines to assist, you may consult the Real Estate Regulatory Authority of the state in question for advice. When it comes to paperwork, written communication should always come first.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

You could occasionally be asked to post bail even before your guilt is established.The cost of filing the paperwork associated with a bail bond might vary depending on the lawyer's experience and the intricacy of the case. It's a good idea to go over costs up front with your attorney and look at options that suit your budget.One alternative is to file a case for the quashing of the FIR in the High Court under Section 482 of theCode of Criminal Procedure(CrPC). The specifics of your situation will determine if it's wise.Answer to your further questions are as follow:ConsideringIPC 406(Criminal Breach of Trust), changing terms and conditions without giving parties enough notice could have an effect on their mutual trust.IPC 418 (Cheating with knowledge that the person whose interest the criminal is obligated to defend may suffer unlawful loss): An in-depth analysis of the evidence is necessary to determine fraud intent.IPC 420(Cheating and dishonestly inducing property delivery): Rejecting a NACH transaction may not always equate to fraud. Examine if the situation satisfiesIPC 420requirements and whether your conduct falls under the legal definition of fraud.According toIndian Penal Code,Section 506, criminal intimidation requires the presence of a genuine threat that instills fear. Determine if the conversation qualifies as intimidation under the law.Answers to the last set of questions asked by you are as follow:Even thoughIPC 406and 420 are non-bailable offenses, whether or not they can be charged simultaneously will depend on the particulars of each case. If it is proven that there has been a misuse of the legal system or that the accusations are baseless, courts have the authority to dismiss charges made underCrPC 482. Nonetheless, the High Court has the final say over whether to quake.Gathering proof is a wise move. Include all pertinent paperwork in your police complaint if you choose to submit one. During court procedures, the admissibility of these papers will be decided.It's critical to keep yourself updated on any FIRs filed against you. In order to comprehend the situation and take the necessary measures, legal counsel should be consulted as soon as possible if no notice has been received.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "I bought a property from a bank auction under SARFAESI Act, but the defaulter already sold the land",
    "answer": "Dear client,By bringing a writ suit against the bank, the registration authorities, and other relevant persons, you have acted appropriately. Your purchase made through an online auction is generally regarded as legitimate under the SARFAESI Act, and the bank's sale certificate supports this claim. Seeking legal recourse is consistent with your focus on using a writ petition to contest the forged documents. In the court proceedings, it is imperative that you draw attention to the violations of SARFAESI Act Sections 13(2) and 13(4), stressing the bank's notice and your adherence to the lawful acquisition process. Furthermore, since registration agencies are involved in registering and confirming real estate transactions, their involvement is essential. Their inability to stop fraudulent transactions and keep proper records—possibly in violation of applicable land registration laws—is probably the basis of your case against them. Make sure your legal counsel highlights the disparities in the Encumbrance Certificate and proves the legitimacy of your acquisition via the SARFAESI Act.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Filing cheating and other criminal cases",
    "answer": "Dear client,I'm sorry to hear about the situation you're facing with the delayed possession of your flat in Bangalore. Legal recourse in such matters involves various actions that can be taken against the builder based on the contractual agreements and theConsumer Protection Act. You've mentioned that a consumer case is already filed, which is a good step. Pursuing this avenue can help in seeking compensation for the delay in possession and breach of agreement. Based on the clauses in the Agreement of Sale where the builder provided an undertaking that the property is free from encumbrances, you might consider filing a criminal complaint against the builder for offenses such as:-Cheating: If the builder knowingly provided false information regarding the encroachments or the status of the property.-Breach of Contract: If the builder has violated the terms of the agreement by failing to deliver possession as promised.You can file a complaint with the police against the builder for fraudulent activities or cheating. Ensure that you have all the necessary documents and evidence to support your case.Filing a criminal case against the builder directly in your home state's High Court or in a sub-ordinate/district court in Agra without approaching the police might not be the typical route for criminal cases. Usually, criminal cases are initiated through the police, who investigate the matter and then file a charge sheet in the appropriate court. However, in some exceptional circumstances, especially when there's a clear and direct case of fraud or other criminal offenses, it might be possible to approach the court directly.To file a criminal case directly in court without involving the police, you'll need to:1. Prepare a Complaint: Draft a comprehensive complaint outlining the criminal offenses committed by the builder, supported by all relevant documents and evidence.2. Approach the Court: You can approach the High Court or a sub-ordinate/district court in Agra directly to file a private criminal complaint. This complaint should detail the offenses committed by the builder and why you're seeking legal action directly through the court.3. Court's Discretion: Whether the court accepts your complaint and initiates proceedings directly or requires police intervention might vary based on the specifics of your case and the court's discretion.This approach involves a different legal procedure and might have its own complexities. It's crucial to have strong evidence and legal guidance when pursuing this route.Filing an FIR (First Information Report) with the police station regarding the delayed possession of your property doesn't necessarily require an immediate incident or a physical place involved. In cases of alleged fraud, breach of contract, or other criminal offenses related to property matters, an FIR can be filed based on the documents and evidence supporting your complaint. The police will record the details provided in your complaint, which includes the allegations against the builder, the documents supporting your claim, and any other relevant information you provide. After the FIR is lodged, the police are responsible for conducting an investigation. They may visit the site, gather further evidence, and interview relevant parties to verify the claims made in the complaint. Based on their investigation, the police will compile a report detailing their findings. This report will be submitted to the appropriate authorities for further action. Depending on the findings of their investigation, the police may take legal action against the accused, which could involve arrests, further questioning, or filing a charge sheet in court. Even if the case primarily involves documents and financial matters without an immediate physical incident, the police are obligated to investigate the matter based on the information provided in the FIR.You can reach out to us for further assistanceAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,The precision of property measures is emphasized in Section 17 of the Registration Act. Hire a surveyor to update records and resolve discrepancies. The Karnataka Town and Country Planning Act is one Indian statute that may offer guidelines on standardizing measurements. Unauthorized additions to rooms present legal issues. Be considerate when approaching impacted parties and stress the importance of following community and legal requirements. Apply the sanctions for non-compliance specified in the association's bylaws. Use the Karnataka Apartment Ownership Act as legal support if necessary.

    "question": "Require legal guidelines to determine the accurate chargeable area for maintenance calculations",
    "answer": "-As per rule, the popular methods to calculate the maintenance fee for the association is1. Equal Fee for All, but it is common in the association , where all the villas are of same sized.2. The most commonly used method is Area Wise maintenance charge, A rate is fixed for one square feet and then multiplied by the total square feet area of the Villa in this method. It means that if you have a larger home, you will end up paying more.- Further, the common areas are divided equally using a fixed rate while flats are calculated depending on the size of the villa .3. Partially Equal Fee i.e. particular amount of money is charged on the area up to a predetermined square feet value, and beyond that, any increment in area is charged according to a unit decided by the association.4.Hybrid Charges , i.e. Splitting the charges into two with the first part including all the common expenses incurred on security staff salary, stationary, property taxes, conveyance, audit fees, meeting charges, common electricity etc. , and the second part includes the area based charges that are specific to the association such as water charge and electricity usage.- Further , if you don't want to create problem for the owner who has constructed the additional rooms , then the association can charge extra amount from them after passing a resolution in GBM for the same.- However, the association has right to take legal action against them .Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "Dear client,By bringing a writ suit against the bank, the registration authorities, and other relevant persons, you have acted appropriately. Your purchase made through an online auction is generally regarded as legitimate under the SARFAESI Act, and the bank's sale certificate supports this claim. Seeking legal recourse is consistent with your focus on using a writ petition to contest the forged documents. In the court proceedings, it is imperative that you draw attention to the violations of SARFAESI Act Sections 13(2) and 13(4), stressing the bank's notice and your adherence to the lawful acquisition process. Furthermore, since registration agencies are involved in registering and confirming real estate transactions, their involvement is essential. Their inability to stop fraudulent transactions and keep proper records—possibly in violation of applicable land registration laws—is probably the basis of your case against them. Make sure your legal counsel highlights the disparities in the Encumbrance Certificate and proves the legitimacy of your acquisition via the SARFAESI Act.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It relies on a number of things, such as the volume of cases and the workings of the court.You might look into alternate conflict resolution procedures like mediation or arbitration if the opposing party isn't open to negotiating.The particulars of your case and the court's discretion may determine the amount of bail that is necessary, if any.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "I bought a property from a bank auction under SARFAESI Act, but the defaulter already sold the land",
    "answer": "Dear client,By bringing a writ suit against the bank, the registration authorities, and other relevant persons, you have acted appropriately. Your purchase made through an online auction is generally regarded as legitimate under the SARFAESI Act, and the bank's sale certificate supports this claim. Seeking legal recourse is consistent with your focus on using a writ petition to contest the forged documents. In the court proceedings, it is imperative that you draw attention to the violations of SARFAESI Act Sections 13(2) and 13(4), stressing the bank's notice and your adherence to the lawful acquisition process. Furthermore, since registration agencies are involved in registering and confirming real estate transactions, their involvement is essential. Their inability to stop fraudulent transactions and keep proper records—possibly in violation of applicable land registration laws—is probably the basis of your case against them. Make sure your legal counsel highlights the disparities in the Encumbrance Certificate and proves the legitimacy of your acquisition via the SARFAESI Act.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Reinventing Capital Gain tax",
    "answer": "Dear client,If the proceeds from the sale of one property are reinvested in another residential property, the individual may be free from capital gains tax under Indian tax regulations, specifically under Section 54 of the Income Tax Act. But the most important requirement is that the property in which the reinvestment is made must belong to the taxpayer. It could be difficult to claim complete capital gains tax exemption in the scenario you described if the daughter-in-law and the father-in-law are listed as joint owners on the selling deed and all of the sale's proceeds are invested in the new property. This is due to the possibility that the daughter-in-law may not be eligible for the Section 54 exemption because she is not the original property owner. It is best to have the father-in-law, who is the property's legitimate owner, included as the first name on the selling deed in order to optimize tax benefits. This guarantees that the capital gains exemption is clearer and complies with Section 54's requirements.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Child's surname",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, the custom of patrilineal naming dictates that a child takes on the surname of his father as the family name. That being said, there isn't a legal restriction on a child assuming their parents' last names. Personal preferences and cultural conventions frequently have an impact on the naming process. Legally, the lack of a uniform rule allowing for two surnames could cause issues with documentation. A single surname is typically required for a variety of official papers, including government documents, passports, and school certificates. Inconsistencies in identification and administrative difficulties may result from this. The Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969 is the legal framework for the registration of names. This Act's Section 15 outlines the process for entering names. Although it does not specifically address multiple surnames, it gives the Registrar the power to make adjustments.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Maintenance for divorce",
    "answer": "Dear client,The length of the marriage, the style of living, and unique circumstances are some of the variables that can affect the amount and duration of alimony. Alimony can be awarded in India for a respectable amount of time, usually half the length of the marriage.The standard of living, possessions, and income of the spouse all play a role in determining how much alimony is granted. It's possible that your respective incomes and savings will be taken into account when calculating alimony.Sometimes parties will agree on lump sum settlements, but in order to guard against future claims, it's imperative to have a legally enforceable agreement in place.Transferring assets to escape alimony responsibilities might not be a legally sound move in terms of property transfers. When deciding alimony, courts may take these actions into account.Since laws can differ, it is best to speak with an attorney to understand how infidelity may affect the divorce process. Remember that using audio recordings as evidence could have legal ramifications as well, so it's best to speak with a legal professional about these.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Maintenance for divorce",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, alimony or maintenance payments are made in lump sums rather than being strictly based on a husband's net worth percentage. To calculate a fair and just sum, the court takes into account a number of variables, including the husband's income, assets, and way of life. According to the wife's necessities and the husband's financial situation, the court may grant maintenance under Section 25 of theHindu Marriage Actand Section 125 of theCode of Criminal Procedure. Usually, to determine your net worth, you deduct your liabilities from your assets. Since you stated that you make 3 lakhs a month and have 2 crores in savings, your net worth would be the sum of your savings less any obligations or liabilities. It's crucial to remember that courts take into account a variety of criteria when making maintenance judgments, so the amount of alimony given may not necessarily match the results of this net worth assessment.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Child's surname",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, the custom of patrilineal naming dictates that a child takes on the surname of his father as the family name. That being said, there isn't a legal restriction on a child assuming their parents' last names. Personal preferences and cultural conventions frequently have an impact on the naming process. Legally, the lack of a uniform rule allowing for two surnames could cause issues with documentation. A single surname is typically required for a variety of official papers, including government documents, passports, and school certificates. Inconsistencies in identification and administrative difficulties may result from this. The Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969 is the legal framework for the registration of names. This Act's Section 15 outlines the process for entering names. Although it does not specifically address multiple surnames, it gives the Registrar the power to make adjustments.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

You can think about dividing the cost and making payments both in advance and throughout the undertaking. It is imperative that these transactions be properly documented with receipts. If both parties are in agreement, Indian law permits staggered payments. As far as possessions go, you should arrange with your spouse for a calm return of her stuff. If you are concerned about safety, you might use a reputable courier to deliver the items to her home while keeping a record of the delivery. Section 13B of theHindu Marriage Act, which governs Indian divorce laws, permits divorces by mutual consent. Make sure that every discussion and agreement is recorded in writing. Pay with caution, and make sure the conditions of the settlement agreement are spelled out in detail. Keep records in difficult situations for legal protection. If necessary, think about employing impartial mediators or local law enforcement to ensure safety during in-law meetings.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Mutual divorce: offline settlement process",
    "answer": "Dear client,Financial settlements are usually agreed upon prior to filing the joint petition in a mutual divorce. You can think about dividing the cost and making payments both in advance and throughout the undertaking. It is imperative that these transactions be properly documented with receipts. If both parties are in agreement, Indian law permits staggered payments. As far as possessions go, you should arrange with your spouse for a calm return of her stuff. If you are concerned about safety, you might use a reputable courier to deliver the items to her home while keeping a record of the delivery. Section 13B of theHindu Marriage Act, which governs Indian divorce laws, permits divorces by mutual consent. Make sure that every discussion and agreement is recorded in writing. Pay with caution, and make sure the conditions of the settlement agreement are spelled out in detail. Keep records in difficult situations for legal protection. If necessary, think about employing impartial mediators or local law enforcement to ensure safety during in-law meetings.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

But it's best to ask the court for clarification if there is a legal separation on the horizon. The father may petition the court for relief if the mother is restricting contact or visitation without a valid reason. In order to obtain visitation rights or the enforcement of already-existing rights, he may file a petition under the Guardians and Wards Act. When making decisions, the court will take the child's best interests into account.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

You have legal options to make corrections if your ancestral property has been mistakenly labeled as private forest land. First, compile all pertinent data, such as the town planning zone certificate from 1997, the 7/12 and \"pher phar\" records, and any other proof that the land is still agricultural. Make contact with the District Collector, presenting this documentation and elucidating the disparity in the land's classification. As a public servant, the District Collector is qualified to examine and correct such mistakes. Should the problem continue, you can think about bringing a writ suit against the incorrect designation in the High Court under Article 226 of theIndian Constitution. Though it could take some time, this procedure is legal remedy to seek justice.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The buyer-seller relationship is principally established by the sale deed, therefore having unrelated third-party transactions could make things more complicated.

    "question": "Payment for property sales",
    "answer": "Dear client,TheTransfer of Property Act, Registration Act, and other pertinent legislation usually govern property transactions. Any differences between the actual payment arrangements and the deed may cause for concern as the deed usually represents the true nature of the transaction. Although collecting money from numerous accounts isn't specifically illegal, it's nevertheless important to maintain legal norms and transparency. The buyer-seller relationship is principally established by the sale deed, therefore having unrelated third-party transactions could make things more complicated. The Registration Act requires all transactions to be accurately documented, and any inconsistencies could jeopardize the legality of the sale.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

You have legal options to make corrections if your ancestral property has been mistakenly labeled as private forest land. First, compile all pertinent data, such as the town planning zone certificate from 1997, the 7/12 and \"pher phar\" records, and any other proof that the land is still agricultural. Make contact with the District Collector, presenting this documentation and elucidating the disparity in the land's classification. As a public servant, the District Collector is qualified to examine and correct such mistakes. Should the problem continue, you can think about bringing a writ suit against the incorrect designation in the High Court under Article 226 of theIndian Constitution.

    "question": "How to voluntarily withdraw a temp injunction",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, a voluntary removal of a temporary injunction can be requested by submitting an application to the court. Section 151 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) gives the court the authority to impose orders that are required to further the interests of justice. Furthermore, a plaintiff may, with the consent of the court, withdraw an action or give up some of the claim under Order 23 Rule 1. Generally speaking, the action would be dismissed if an injunction order was withdrawn. But the withdrawal itself gives your neighbor no authority over your property. The lifting of the injunction order means that the restriction is no longer in place, but your neighbor would still need to establish independent legal authority to claim ownership or control over your land.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "1. release or relinquishment of your share in the property in favour of the other co-owner is one of the types of transfer of property which is required to be effected by a transfer document like gift deed or release deed [with or without consideration] which is compulsorily required to be registered under S.17 of the Registration Act2. so the buyer refusing to accept your notarised NOC is right in his apprehension3. as regards your query no.2 i feel it is the result of being excessively sticky and cautious which is really not required since once you register a gift deed or release deed in favour of your uncle [in which the factum of your noc can be stated in the recital portion], the giving up of your right in your noc will get subsumed in the gift/release deed. and even if your uncle has given the copies of your noc to some prospective buyers, i really do not see how you can be entangled in any legal proceeding! when one says in his noc that i give up my right that means that thereafter he would have nothing to do with the property. anything done after the noc by any other person in respect of the property will not come to haunt the noc giver. so please relax and think rationally and practicallyYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Dear client,It is imperative to comprehend that theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, specifically Section 52, addresses the notion of lis pendens, which translates as \"pending legal action.\" It limits the transfer of assets that are being contested in court. Given the ongoing civil lawsuit, it appears that the bank wants to make sure the lease is still legitimate, which is why they are asking the court for approval under Section 52. You have a strong claim because you own the property and it has changed to your name. Given the involvement of their legal department, the bank's request may be a preventive move rather than an outright challenge to your ownership. Make sure that all of your correspondence with the bank, leasing agreements, and property rights are properly documented. It's critical to keep lines of communication open with the bank and your legal counsel if you're not subject to any court orders or injunctions. Rather than an attempt to bother you, the tactic can just be a formality in the process.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In 2010, the Allahabad High Court ruled that the 2.77 acres (1.12 ha) of disputed land be divided into 3 parts, with1⁄3going to the Ram Lalla or Infant Lord Rama represented by the Hindu Mahasabha for the construction of the Ram temple,1⁄3going to the Muslim Sunni Waqf Board and the remaining1⁄3going to a Hindu religious denomination Nirmohi Akhara.When the Allahabad high court decided to partition the property into three parts and to allot one such share to Muslim Sunni Wakf board, was there any claim made by The Allah the Great directly to the court or whether the court accepted the consent parties as representatives of Allah The Great.A detailed explanation about the origin of title has been given in the verdict which includes various arguments for and agaisnt by eminent lawyers and great personalities appeared before the apex court.Therefore you can find the answers for all your queries if time permits your to peruse the SC verdict on the subject.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

The court acknowledged the Ram Janmabhoomi temple's existence as well as the site's sacred significance to Hindus. The verdict addressed the particular problem pertaining to the contested territory rather than necessarily supporting one religious organization over another. Regarding the decision of the court to build a temple instead of other types of infrastructure, it is important to remember that the ruling was particular to the instance in question. The historical assertion that the location is where Lord Ram was born was at the center of the judicial procedures. The court's ruling does not rule out the potential of such religious or educational initiatives in other settings. Constitutional considerations, such as the defense of religious freedom and the interpretation of statutes pertaining to property and historical claims, would probably serve as the foundation for the ruling.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "How to voluntarily withdraw a temp injunction",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, a voluntary removal of a temporary injunction can be requested by submitting an application to the court. Section 151 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) gives the court the authority to impose orders that are required to further the interests of justice. Furthermore, a plaintiff may, with the consent of the court, withdraw an action or give up some of the claim under Order 23 Rule 1. Generally speaking, the action would be dismissed if an injunction order was withdrawn. But the withdrawal itself gives your neighbor no authority over your property. The lifting of the injunction order means that the restriction is no longer in place, but your neighbor would still need to establish independent legal authority to claim ownership or control over your land.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "How to voluntarily withdraw a temp injunction",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, a voluntary removal of a temporary injunction can be requested by submitting an application to the court. Section 151 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) gives the court the authority to impose orders that are required to further the interests of justice. Furthermore, a plaintiff may, with the consent of the court, withdraw an action or give up some of the claim under Order 23 Rule 1. Generally speaking, the action would be dismissed if an injunction order was withdrawn. But the withdrawal itself gives your neighbor no authority over your property. The lifting of the injunction order means that the restriction is no longer in place, but your neighbor would still need to establish independent legal authority to claim ownership or control over your land.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Bank has stopped paying rent",
    "answer": "Dear client,It is imperative to comprehend that theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, specifically Section 52, addresses the notion of lis pendens, which translates as \"pending legal action.\" It limits the transfer of assets that are being contested in court. Given the ongoing civil lawsuit, it appears that the bank wants to make sure the lease is still legitimate, which is why they are asking the court for approval under Section 52. You have a strong claim because you own the property and it has changed to your name. Given the involvement of their legal department, the bank's request may be a preventive move rather than an outright challenge to your ownership. Make sure that all of your correspondence with the bank, leasing agreements, and property rights are properly documented. It's critical to keep lines of communication open with the bank and your legal counsel if you're not subject to any court orders or injunctions. Rather than an attempt to bother you, the tactic can just be a formality in the process.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In 2010, the Allahabad High Court ruled that the 2.77 acres (1.12 ha) of disputed land be divided into 3 parts, with1⁄3going to the Ram Lalla or Infant Lord Rama represented by the Hindu Mahasabha for the construction of the Ram temple,1⁄3going to the Muslim Sunni Waqf Board and the remaining1⁄3going to a Hindu religious denomination Nirmohi Akhara.When the Allahabad high court decided to partition the property into three parts and to allot one such share to Muslim Sunni Wakf board, was there any claim made by The Allah the Great directly to the court or whether the court accepted the consent parties as representatives of Allah The Great.A detailed explanation about the origin of title has been given in the verdict which includes various arguments for and agaisnt by eminent lawyers and great personalities appeared before the apex court.Therefore you can find the answers for all your queries if time permits your to peruse the SC verdict on the subject.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

The court acknowledged the Ram Janmabhoomi temple's existence as well as the site's sacred significance to Hindus. The verdict addressed the particular problem pertaining to the contested territory rather than necessarily supporting one religious organization over another. Regarding the decision of the court to build a temple instead of other types of infrastructure, it is important to remember that the ruling was particular to the instance in question. The historical assertion that the location is where Lord Ram was born was at the center of the judicial procedures. The court's ruling does not rule out the potential of such religious or educational initiatives in other settings. Constitutional considerations, such as the defense of religious freedom and the interpretation of statutes pertaining to property and historical claims, would probably serve as the foundation for the ruling.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Bank has stopped paying rent",
    "answer": "Dear client,It is imperative to comprehend that theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, specifically Section 52, addresses the notion of lis pendens, which translates as \"pending legal action.\" It limits the transfer of assets that are being contested in court. Given the ongoing civil lawsuit, it appears that the bank wants to make sure the lease is still legitimate, which is why they are asking the court for approval under Section 52. You have a strong claim because you own the property and it has changed to your name. Given the involvement of their legal department, the bank's request may be a preventive move rather than an outright challenge to your ownership. Make sure that all of your correspondence with the bank, leasing agreements, and property rights are properly documented. It's critical to keep lines of communication open with the bank and your legal counsel if you're not subject to any court orders or injunctions. Rather than an attempt to bother you, the tactic can just be a formality in the process.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,If the proceeds from the sale of one property are reinvested in another residential property, the individual may be free from capital gains tax under Indian tax regulations, specifically under Section 54 of the Income Tax Act. But the most important requirement is that the property in which the reinvestment is made must belong to the taxpayer. It could be difficult to claim complete capital gains tax exemption in the scenario you described if the daughter-in-law and the father-in-law are listed as joint owners on the selling deed and all of the sale's proceeds are invested in the new property. This is due to the possibility that the daughter-in-law may not be eligible for the Section 54 exemption because she is not the original property owner. It is best to have the father-in-law, who is the property's legitimate owner, included as the first name on the selling deed in order to optimize tax benefits. This guarantees that the capital gains exemption is clearer and complies with Section 54's requirements.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Even though you've taken action to move the assets into your name, it's imperative to make sure that the paperwork is in order to prevent problems down the road. The transfer of shares into your name with regard to the demat account is a good step. To confirm the transfer, you must, however, update the records with the depository participant and supply the required paperwork. It's also a good idea to save all pertinent documents for later use. It is imperative that you update the savings accounts and FDs in your name with the banks and remove your uncle's name from them. To expedite this process, make sure you turn in the death certificate as soon as possible. In terms of taxes, inheritance is typically not subject to taxation in India. All income derived from the inherited assets, including interest from foreign funds and dividends from shares, will be subject to taxation based on the relevant income tax slabs. Make careful to track this revenue and appropriately declare it on your income tax filings.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In 2010, the Allahabad High Court ruled that the 2.77 acres (1.12 ha) of disputed land be divided into 3 parts, with1⁄3going to the Ram Lalla or Infant Lord Rama represented by the Hindu Mahasabha for the construction of the Ram temple,1⁄3going to the Muslim Sunni Waqf Board and the remaining1⁄3going to a Hindu religious denomination Nirmohi Akhara.When the Allahabad high court decided to partition the property into three parts and to allot one such share to Muslim Sunni Wakf board, was there any claim made by The Allah the Great directly to the court or whether the court accepted the consent parties as representatives of Allah The Great.A detailed explanation about the origin of title has been given in the verdict which includes various arguments for and agaisnt by eminent lawyers and great personalities appeared before the apex court.Therefore you can find the answers for all your queries if time permits your to peruse the SC verdict on the subject.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

The court acknowledged the Ram Janmabhoomi temple's existence as well as the site's sacred significance to Hindus. The verdict addressed the particular problem pertaining to the contested territory rather than necessarily supporting one religious organization over another. Regarding the decision of the court to build a temple instead of other types of infrastructure, it is important to remember that the ruling was particular to the instance in question. The historical assertion that the location is where Lord Ram was born was at the center of the judicial procedures. The court's ruling does not rule out the potential of such religious or educational initiatives in other settings. Constitutional considerations, such as the defense of religious freedom and the interpretation of statutes pertaining to property and historical claims, would probably serve as the foundation for the ruling.Hope this helps you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"
