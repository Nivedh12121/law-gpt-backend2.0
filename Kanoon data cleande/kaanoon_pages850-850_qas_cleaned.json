    "question": "Wife has taken away my child",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You can file a habeas corpus petition to seek the immediate return of your child if you can demonstrate that she is being unlawfully detained or not in a safe environment. You will need to show that your child is being unlawfully held and that you have legal custody rights. Providing evidence of your ex-wife’s condition and the environment in which your child is living can support your case. You can also approach the Child Welfare Department or the Child Protection Services with evidence of your ex-wife's condition and the environment in which your child is living.Since your ex-wife has taken your child and is refusing to allow you to see her, you can file an application for custody in the Family Court. You can request the court to grant you visitation rights or even custody if you can prove that the environment provided by your ex-wife is harmful to the child. If your ex-wife has filed a petition to set aside the ex-parte decree by claiming she never received summons you will need to provide evidence that summons was duly served to counter her claim. Ensure that you document all interactions, keep evidence of your ex-wife's condition, and consult with your lawyer to take the appropriate legal actions.

    "question": "Our society is made up of plots. Plot holders are owners. One plot owner has given building for student housing without consent.",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Commercial activities are typically not permitted within residential societies unless specifically allowed by the society’s bylaws and with proper approvals. Using a residential property for student housing and providing meals would generally be considered a commercial activity. Such use could be in violation of the cooperative society's rules, as it transforms the residential space into a quasi-commercial establishment. Check your society's bylaws or rules to see if they address or permit commercial activities or specific uses like student housing. If the bylaws do not address this scenario explicitly, the plot holder might need to seek approval from the society's committee or general body.If the plot is jointly owned, the signature requirements for form 10A can depend on the nature of joint ownership. Typically, for joint ownership, the signatures of all joint owners are required to authorize one person to act on behalf of the joint owners. Since cooperative society rules can vary slightly, it is best to check with your specific society's rules or the election officer regarding the exact requirements for signatures on Form 10A.

This means that each partner is liable for the whole balance of the firm's debts. However, any payments made towards a firm's debt will reduce the balance owed by each partner.Recently, the Supreme Court of India (“Supreme Court”) inS.P. Mani and Mohan Dairy v. Dr. Snehalatha Elangovanheld that vicarious liability can be imposed on the partners of a firm when specific averments are made in the complaint as to the status of the partner qua the firm. The Supreme Court also clarified that a complaint filed under Sections 138 and 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (“NI Act”) can be quashed if the accused produces unimpeachable and incontrovertible evidence to show that the person could not have been concerned with issuance of the dishonored cheque.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Validity of cheque given by ex-partner",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Since the replacement cheque was signed solely by your wife, the first legal issue is whether this cheque can bind the partnership firm. According to Section 18 of the Partnership Act, 1932, a partner can bind the firm by acts done in the course of the business of the firm. However, once your wife exited the partnership, her authority to bind the firm would generally cease. The cheque issued by a partner who has left the firm may not be enforceable against the firm unless the partnership deed or any subsequent agreement provides otherwise.Under the Partnership Act,1932 all partners are jointly and severally liable for the acts of the firm. However, the liability of the partners is tied to acts done while they were partners as if the cheque is issued after your wife left the firm, and only her signature is on it, then the remaining partners may argue that they are not liable for the cheque. Check the partnership agreement to see if it provides for any specific remedies or liabilities of the partners after a partner leaves the firm. Given the complexities of using a cheque signed by a former partner, you might consider filing a civil suit for the recovery of the loan amount against the firm and the remaining partners.

    "question": "Validity of cheque given by ex-partner",
    "answer": "Dear Client,A cheque signed by your wife before her retirement from the partnership may still be valid, provided it was issued when she was an active partner and authorized to sign on behalf of the firm. However, if she is no longer a partner at the time of presenting the cheque, her authority to bind the firm with that cheque may be questioned. This could affect the enforceability of the cheque against the firm or the remaining partners.The fact that the cheque was initially blank and later filled in does not inherently affect its validity. However, if there is any dispute about the amount filled in or other details, it could lead to challenges regarding the cheque's enforceability.If the bank returns the cheque because your wife is no longer a signing authority, Section 138 of the NI Act could still apply. The reason for dishonour may it be due to insufficient funds or any other reason, such as the drawer not being authorized, can trigger action under Section 138. However, the defence may argue that the cheque was issued without authority if it was presented after her retirement.If your wife's account was settled and her retirement deed specifies that she is no longer liable for debts incurred after her retirement, she might not be liable for the firm's debts. However, she may still be liable for obligations or debts incurred before her retirement, depending on the terms of the retirement agreement and how the cheque was issued.Your parents can choose to sue the partnership and the surviving partners while excluding your wife. By this, the remaining partners are generally liable for the debts of the firm incurred while they were partners, but excluding your wife from the lawsuit would mean that she is not being held accountable for the cheque or the debt associated with it.If your parents decide to sue your wife, she could potentially argue that She was no longer a partner when the cheque was presented, her account was settled at the time of her retirement, and she had no further obligations towards the firm’s debts or the cheque was not presented during the time she was an active partner, questioning its validity as binding on her, and therefore, she should not be liable.Should you require any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"
