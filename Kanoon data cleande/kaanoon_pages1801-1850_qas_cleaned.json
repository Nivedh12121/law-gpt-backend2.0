    "question": "Publishing a novel",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Review Employment Contract:Start by reviewing your employment contract or company policies to ensure there are no clauses that prohibit you from engaging in outside activities or businesses, including self-publishing a novel. Some companies have specific policies regarding intellectual property created by their employees, so it's essential to understand your contractual obligations.Conflict of Interest:Consider whether your novel could be seen as a conflict of interest with your current job. If your novel is unrelated to your work and does not compete with your employer's interests, it may be less likely to raise concerns. However, if there is any potential overlap or conflict, you should discuss it with your employer or HR department.Use of Company Resources:Ensure that you are not using your employer's resources, such as company time, equipment, or materials, to work on your novel. Keep your writing activities separate from your job responsibilities.Disclosure to Employer:While you may not be legally required to inform your employer about your novel, it may be a good idea to have an open and honest discussion with them, especially if you have any concerns about potential conflicts or if you anticipate that your novel may become commercially successful.ISBN Number:An ISBN (International Standard Book Number) is not related to copyright but is used for tracking and selling books. It's typically required for printed books but not mandatory for e-books. If you plan to sell physical copies of your novel, obtaining an ISBN is advisable.Ultimately, whether publishing a novel while working is permissible depends on your specific situation, your employment contract or company policies, and the nature of your novel.

    "question": "Tax Filing, Link Aadhar, Building Home in Inherited Land",
    "answer": "1) Tax Filing in India:If you are an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) holder and a foreign resident, your tax liability in India primarily depends on your source of income in India. Interest earned in NRE and NRO accounts is taxable in India. However, if the total income you earn in India is below the taxable threshold (currently Rs 2.5 lakhs per year), you may not have to file taxes.2) Linking Aadhaar and PAN:As of my knowledge, linking Aadhaar with PAN was mandatory for filing income tax returns in India.3) Validity of Indian Driving License:Indian driving licenses are generally valid for driving in India.4) Obtaining a New Driver's License after 2029:Since you are not an Indian citizen and don't hold an Indian passport, it may be challenging to obtain a new Indian driver's license after the expiration of your existing license.5) Validity of Indian Documents:Indian documents such as a driver's license, PAN card, and Aadhaar card may remain valid even if you become a foreign citizen, as long as they have not expired. However, you may not be able to use them for official purposes in your foreign country of residence, as they are issued by the Indian government.6) Building a Home in India:Building a home in India as an OCI holder should not pose significant legal issues. However, it's crucial to ensure that you comply with all local building codes, regulations, and land ownership laws. You may need to work with local authorities and obtain the necessary permits and approvals for construction. Consulting with a local lawyer or real estate expert in the specific region where you plan to build is advisable to navigate any local legal requirements effectively.Akram KhanAdvocate, Gwalior20 AnswersTalk to Advocate Akram Khan"

Maintenance can be sought separately by your wife under the appropriate provisions of the law. The court may still award maintenance to her based on her needs and your financial capacity, even if you file for RCR.Quashing of 498A FIR:The fact that the 498A FIR against you and your family is stayed by the High Court indicates that you are already in a legal process. Hence RCR may not have any positive impact to avoid maintenance.Child Custody:Since you have a child, the court's primary concern will be the welfare of the child. Filing for RCR may not necessarily influence child custody or maintenance decisions.

    "question": "Should I file Restitution of Conjugal Rights to avoid maintenance?",
    "answer": ".Restitution of Conjugal Rights(RCR) is a legal remedy that allows a spouse to seek the court’s intervention to restore the marital relationship when the other spouse has withdrawn from the society of the other without any reasonable cause. It is available under Section 9 of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, which applies to Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and Sikhs. The purpose of RCR is to preserve the marriage as far as possible and to prevent the breakdown of the matrimonial bond.However, filing an RCR does not automatically prevent or reduce the maintenance or alimony that may be claimed by the other spouse. Maintenance or alimony is a financial support that is granted by the court to a spouse who does not have adequate means to take care of his or her basic needs after divorce or judicial separation. It can be awarded as a lump sum amount or as a monthly or periodic payment. The amount and duration of maintenance or alimony depend on various factors, such as the income and property of both parties, the conduct and circumstances of the case, the social status and lifestyle of both parties, the age and health condition of both parties, the duration of marriage, and the expenses for education and upbringing of the child or children.Therefore, even if you file an RCR and obtain a decree in your favor, your wife may still file a claim for maintenance or alimony against you if she can prove that she has no sufficient means to maintain herself and that you have neglected or refused to maintain her. The court will then decide whether to grant her claim or not based on the facts and evidence of the case. Filing an RCR may not necessarily put you in a safer position, as it may also invite counterclaims from your wife, such as cruelty, desertion, adultery, etc., which may affect your chances of getting a favorable outcome.Moreover, filing an RCR may also have implications for your pending 498A FIR case.Section 498Aof theIndian Penal Code(IPC) deals with cruelty done to a married woman by her husband or his relatives for dowry or other unlawful demands. It is a non-bailable and cognizable offence that carries a punishment of up to three years imprisonment and fine. If your wife has filed a 498A FIR against you and your family, and you have challenged it in the High Court by filing a quashing petition, then filing an RCR may create a contradiction in your stand. The High Court may think that you are willing to compromise with your wife and live with her, which may weaken your case for quashing. On the other hand, if you are not willing to compromise and live with her, then filing an RCR may be seen as a pressure tactic or a harassment measure by the court, which may also go against you.Hence, before filing an RCR, you should carefully consider the pros and cons of your decision and consult a qualified lawyer who can advise you on the best course of action for your case. You should also keep in mind that filing an RCR does not guarantee that your wife will come back to you or that your marriage will be saved. It is ultimately up to her whether she wants to resume cohabitation with you or not. If she does not comply with the RCR decree within one year, then you may file for divorce on the ground of non-restoration of conjugal rights. However, divorce is not an easy process and it may involve a lot of emotional and financial stress for both parties and their child.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

    "answer": "The RCR petition will not protect your interests and it will not come to your rescue to avoid paying maintenance to her in case she files a petition seeking maintenance.There is no use of filing the proposed RCR case because it will not solve any purpose  hence it will be just a wast of time, money and energy.If you are fed up of her and do not want her back into your life again, you can better file a divorce case directly, it will be more meaningful.The FIR quash will not depend on the RCR case or the divorce case, it will be considered on its own merits.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "The FIR quash petition will be decided on merits, in fact the high court will not entertain the FIR quash as the investigation has not been completed and the charge sheet has not been filed yet.Therefore the very idea of filing the FIR quash petition itself is not a good advise.You do not have to be worried even if the FIR is not quashed, because the high court will not quash the FIR until and unless she is expressing No Objection by an affidavit before the high court and that will happen only if you settle the huge demand of money as settlement to her in order to compromise the issue.This is not possible because you are not willing to settle any amount to her, hence you may not rely upon the ongoing quash petition, better challenge the false case on merits before high court after the police is filing the charge sheet.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,If you do not wish to settle with your wife, then you should not file the RCR. The RCR is a document that is filed by the accused person in the criminal case, requesting the court to withdraw the case. If you file the RCR, it will be seen as an indication that you are willing to settle with your wife, and the High Court may be more likely to quash the FIR on the ground of settlement.However, if you do not file the RCR, and the High Court does not quash the FIR on the basis of merits, then the case will continue. In this case, you may be required to attend court hearings and give evidence.Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to settle with your wife and file the RCR is up to you. You should weigh the pros and cons of each option and decide what is best for you.The strength of your case on merits. If you believe that you have a strong case on merits, then you may be able to get the FIR quashed without having to settle.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Should I file Restitution of Conjugal Rights to avoid maintenance?",
    "answer": "Filing aRestitution of Conjugal Rights(RCR) petition is a legal option that you have. However, it is important to note that filing an RCR does not guarantee that your wife will return to live with you. It is also important to note that filing an RCR does not prevent your wife from filing a maintenance case against you.In your case, since your wife has already filed a 498A FIR against you, filing an RCR may be seen by the High Court as an attempt to compromise the case. This could make it more difficult for you to get the FIR quashed.If you are not willing to compromise on the 498A FIR, then you should not file an RCR. You should instead focus on getting the FIR quashed on the merits. This means that you will need to provide evidence to the High Court that the allegations in the FIR are false.If you are able to get the FIR quashed, then your wife will no longer be able to use it as a basis to file a maintenance case against you. However, she may still be able to file a maintenance case against you on other grounds, such as your income and your ability to support her."

Some companies have specific policies regarding intellectual property created by their employees, so it's essential to understand your contractual obligations.Conflict of Interest:Consider whether your novel could be seen as a conflict of interest with your current job. If your novel is unrelated to your work and does not compete with your employer's interests, it may be less likely to raise concerns. However, if there is any potential overlap or conflict, you should discuss it with your employer or HR department.Use of Company Resources:Ensure that you are not using your employer's resources, such as company time, equipment, or materials, to work on your novel. Keep your writing activities separate from your job responsibilities.Disclosure to Employer:While you may not be legally required to inform your employer about your novel, it may be a good idea to have an open and honest discussion with them, especially if you have any concerns about potential conflicts or if you anticipate that your novel may become commercially successful.ISBN Number:An ISBN (International Standard Book Number) is not related to copyright but is used for tracking and selling books. It's typically required for printed books but not mandatory for e-books.

The court may still award maintenance to her based on her needs and your financial capacity, even if you file for RCR.Quashing of 498A FIR:The fact that the 498A FIR against you and your family is stayed by the High Court indicates that you are already in a legal process. Hence RCR may not have any positive impact to avoid maintenance.Child Custody:Since you have a child, the court's primary concern will be the welfare of the child. Filing for RCR may not necessarily influence child custody or maintenance decisions.

  {
    "context": "Asked 1 year ago in Family Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Should I file Restitution of Conjugal Rights to avoid maintenance?",
    "answer": ".Restitution of Conjugal Rights(RCR) is a legal remedy that allows a spouse to seek the court’s intervention to restore the marital relationship when the other spouse has withdrawn from the society of the other without any reasonable cause. It is available under Section 9 of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, which applies to Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and Sikhs. The purpose of RCR is to preserve the marriage as far as possible and to prevent the breakdown of the matrimonial bond.However, filing an RCR does not automatically prevent or reduce the maintenance or alimony that may be claimed by the other spouse. Maintenance or alimony is a financial support that is granted by the court to a spouse who does not have adequate means to take care of his or her basic needs after divorce or judicial separation. It can be awarded as a lump sum amount or as a monthly or periodic payment. The amount and duration of maintenance or alimony depend on various factors, such as the income and property of both parties, the conduct and circumstances of the case, the social status and lifestyle of both parties, the age and health condition of both parties, the duration of marriage, and the expenses for education and upbringing of the child or children.Therefore, even if you file an RCR and obtain a decree in your favor, your wife may still file a claim for maintenance or alimony against you if she can prove that she has no sufficient means to maintain herself and that you have neglected or refused to maintain her. The court will then decide whether to grant her claim or not based on the facts and evidence of the case. Filing an RCR may not necessarily put you in a safer position, as it may also invite counterclaims from your wife, such as cruelty, desertion, adultery, etc., which may affect your chances of getting a favorable outcome.Moreover, filing an RCR may also have implications for your pending 498A FIR case.Section 498Aof theIndian Penal Code(IPC) deals with cruelty done to a married woman by her husband or his relatives for dowry or other unlawful demands. It is a non-bailable and cognizable offence that carries a punishment of up to three years imprisonment and fine. If your wife has filed a 498A FIR against you and your family, and you have challenged it in the High Court by filing a quashing petition, then filing an RCR may create a contradiction in your stand. The High Court may think that you are willing to compromise with your wife and live with her, which may weaken your case for quashing. On the other hand, if you are not willing to compromise and live with her, then filing an RCR may be seen as a pressure tactic or a harassment measure by the court, which may also go against you.Hence, before filing an RCR, you should carefully consider the pros and cons of your decision and consult a qualified lawyer who can advise you on the best course of action for your case. You should also keep in mind that filing an RCR does not guarantee that your wife will come back to you or that your marriage will be saved. It is ultimately up to her whether she wants to resume cohabitation with you or not. If she does not comply with the RCR decree within one year, then you may file for divorce on the ground of non-restoration of conjugal rights. However, divorce is not an easy process and it may involve a lot of emotional and financial stress for both parties and their child.Muraleedharan RAdvocate, Trivandrum386 Answers2 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Muraleedharan R"

If you file the RCR, it will be seen as an indication that you are willing to settle with your wife, and the High Court may be more likely to quash the FIR on the ground of settlement.However, if you do not file the RCR, and the High Court does not quash the FIR on the basis of merits, then the case will continue.

    "answer": "Filing aRestitution of Conjugal Rights(RCR) petition is a legal option that you have. However, it is important to note that filing an RCR does not guarantee that your wife will return to live with you. It is also important to note that filing an RCR does not prevent your wife from filing a maintenance case against you.In your case, since your wife has already filed a 498A FIR against you, filing an RCR may be seen by the High Court as an attempt to compromise the case. This could make it more difficult for you to get the FIR quashed.If you are not willing to compromise on the 498A FIR, then you should not file an RCR. You should instead focus on getting the FIR quashed on the merits. This means that you will need to provide evidence to the High Court that the allegations in the FIR are false.If you are able to get the FIR quashed, then your wife will no longer be able to use it as a basis to file a maintenance case against you. However, she may still be able to file a maintenance case against you on other grounds, such as your income and your ability to support her."

Alternatively, grandparents or another trusted individual can also be appointed as a Guardian.Your minor daughter can indeed obtain a PAN Card through an online application process.The process for obtaining a PAN Card for your minor daughter remains the same as mentioned in point 4.Even if you are residing in the US, you can still gift the property to your minor daughter in India by appointing an Agent or Attorney in India through a Power of Attorney (POA).To execute this transfer, you may engage the services of a local lawyer in India who can assist in the preparation and registration of the Gift Deed at the appropriate Sub Registrar's Office within the jurisdiction.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Publishing a novel",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Review Employment Contract:Start by reviewing your employment contract or company policies to ensure there are no clauses that prohibit you from engaging in outside activities or businesses, including self-publishing a novel. Some companies have specific policies regarding intellectual property created by their employees, so it's essential to understand your contractual obligations.Conflict of Interest:Consider whether your novel could be seen as a conflict of interest with your current job. If your novel is unrelated to your work and does not compete with your employer's interests, it may be less likely to raise concerns. However, if there is any potential overlap or conflict, you should discuss it with your employer or HR department.Use of Company Resources:Ensure that you are not using your employer's resources, such as company time, equipment, or materials, to work on your novel. Keep your writing activities separate from your job responsibilities.Disclosure to Employer:While you may not be legally required to inform your employer about your novel, it may be a good idea to have an open and honest discussion with them, especially if you have any concerns about potential conflicts or if you anticipate that your novel may become commercially successful.ISBN Number:An ISBN (International Standard Book Number) is not related to copyright but is used for tracking and selling books. It's typically required for printed books but not mandatory for e-books. If you plan to sell physical copies of your novel, obtaining an ISBN is advisable.Ultimately, whether publishing a novel while working is permissible depends on your specific situation, your employment contract or company policies, and the nature of your novel.

    "question": "Landlord selling properties to many customers",
    "answer": "Before granting a loan, banks are required to conduct thorough due diligence procedures. In your case, you have diligently ensured timely payment of EMIs and have maintained a flawless record without any defaults. However, it's essential to be cautious about the authenticity of documents involved in property transactions. For instance, if fraudulent documents are exploited in the sale of flats, there is a significant risk of legal repercussions. Such actions could lead to the original flat owner pursuing legal action against both you and the broker for engaging in forgery and document fabrication.It's noteworthy that you currently don't have any pending criminal cases against you. This clean legal record affords you the freedom to travel abroad for work-related purposes without any constraints. It's imperative for property transactions that sellers provide valid identification documents such as their Aadhar card and PAN card during the sale deed registration process.However, in situations where counterfeit Aadhar cards are employed, it becomes necessary to initiate legal proceedings against both the broker and the imposter involved in the fraudulent sale of the flat. This ensures that appropriate action is taken against those responsible for such deceitful actions.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The Executing Court has the discretionary power to allow the application of a third party (TP) to be impleaded in an execution proceeding under Order 1 Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC). However, whether the application is maintainable in the first place is a pure question of law that the Court must first determine.The Supreme Court has held that the Court must first determine the maintainability of the application before exercising its discretion to allow it. In the case of Smt. Sushila Devi vs. Smt. Nirmala Devi, the Court held that \"the question whether the application is maintainable under Order 1 Rule 10 CPC is a pure question of law which does not depend upon the facts of the case and the Court must decide it before exercising its discretion under the said provision.\"In your case, the opposing party has raised a pure question of law as to whether the application of the TP is maintainable under Order 1 Rule 10 CPC. The Executing Court must first determine this question before considering whether the TP is a necessary party.If the Court finds that the application is maintainable, it will then have to consider whether the TP is a necessary party. A necessary party is a person whose presence in the suit is essential for the adjudication of the matter. In other words, the absence of the TP would make it impossible for the Court to decide the case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, there may be some practical considerations to keep in mind. For example, if your cousin is not familiar with the property transaction process in India, they may need more help and guidance from you.In your case, since your cousin will be handling the final transaction and receiving the balance of the purchase price, it is important to make sure that they are trustworthy and reliable. You should also make sure that they understand their responsibilities under the power of attorney.Make sure that your cousin is willing and able to take on the responsibility.Be clear about the specific powers that you are giving them.Get the power of attorney in writing and have it signed by both of you.Have the power of attorney registered with the sub-registrar's office in the district where the property is located.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This is because the buyer would not be getting the property that they bargained for.However, if the incorrect survey numbers are not material to the description of the property, then the deed may still be valid. For example, if the sale deed describes the property as a plot of land in a particular village, but the schedule property boundaries show that the plot is actually located in a different part of the village, then the deed may still be valid.

    "answer": "Dear Client,The Executing Court has the discretionary power to allow the application of a third party (TP) to be impleaded in an execution proceeding under Order 1 Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC). However, whether the application is maintainable in the first place is a pure question of law that the Court must first determine.The Supreme Court has held that the Court must first determine the maintainability of the application before exercising its discretion to allow it. In the case of Smt. Sushila Devi vs. Smt. Nirmala Devi, the Court held that \"the question whether the application is maintainable under Order 1 Rule 10 CPC is a pure question of law which does not depend upon the facts of the case and the Court must decide it before exercising its discretion under the said provision.\"In your case, the opposing party has raised a pure question of law as to whether the application of the TP is maintainable under Order 1 Rule 10 CPC. The Executing Court must first determine this question before considering whether the TP is a necessary party.If the Court finds that the application is maintainable, it will then have to consider whether the TP is a necessary party. A necessary party is a person whose presence in the suit is essential for the adjudication of the matter. In other words, the absence of the TP would make it impossible for the Court to decide the case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, the survey numbers mentioned in the schedule property boundaries are incorrect. This could make the deed invalid if the incorrect survey numbers are material to the description of the property.For example, if the sale deed describes the property as a plot with survey number 1234, but the schedule property boundaries show that the plot actually has survey number 5678, then the deed could be considered invalid. This is because the buyer would not be getting the property that they bargained for.However, if the incorrect survey numbers are not material to the description of the property, then the deed may still be valid. For example, if the sale deed describes the property as a plot of land in a particular village, but the schedule property boundaries show that the plot is actually located in a different part of the village, then the deed may still be valid. This is because the buyer would still be getting the property that they bargained for, even though the exact location of the property is different.Ultimately, the validity of the sale deed will depend on the specific facts and circumstances of the case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

A look out notice is a formal request to law enforcement agencies to detain or arrest a person when they try to enter or leave the country.Dear Client,It is possible that there is a look out notice against you even though your PCC is clean. This is because the police may have issued the look out notice after you applied for the PCC.If you are concerned about a look out notice, you can contact the nearest Indian embassy or consulate in Canada and ask them to check for you. They will be able to access the police records and tell you whether there is a look out notice against you.If there is a look out notice against you, you will not be able to enter India even if you have a valid Indian passport or OCI card. You will need to get the look out notice withdrawn before you can travel to India.You can apply for the withdrawal of the look out notice through your lawyer or directly through the police station where the notice was issued. The police will consider your application and decide whether to withdraw the notice.If the police refuse to withdraw the look out notice, you can challenge their decision in court.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Look out notice",
    "answer": "- The LOC notice is issued by an officer not below the rank of Deputy Secretary to the Government of India/Joint Secretary in the State Government/Superintendent of Police concerned at the district level.- Further, it is mandatory that the accused should be informed for the said notice has been issued against him, but generally an accused person comes to know about such notice only when he/she is stopped or arrested by the immigration authorities at the airport/border etc- Since, you got clean PCC in 2022 , then there is least chances to issue the LOC- However, you should enquire from the Court before coming to India and to remove the apprehension of arrest.- Further, even there is NBW against you , then being an accused you can be arrested by the police.- Hence, before coming to India, you can apply for getting anticipatory bail from the session court.- However, if you are already a Canadian citizen and having no Indian passport , then there will be no problem for coming to India.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "Before granting a loan, banks are required to conduct thorough due diligence procedures. In your case, you have diligently ensured timely payment of EMIs and have maintained a flawless record without any defaults. However, it's essential to be cautious about the authenticity of documents involved in property transactions. For instance, if fraudulent documents are exploited in the sale of flats, there is a significant risk of legal repercussions. Such actions could lead to the original flat owner pursuing legal action against both you and the broker for engaging in forgery and document fabrication.It's noteworthy that you currently don't have any pending criminal cases against you. This clean legal record affords you the freedom to travel abroad for work-related purposes without any constraints. It's imperative for property transactions that sellers provide valid identification documents such as their Aadhar card and PAN card during the sale deed registration process.However, in situations where counterfeit Aadhar cards are employed, it becomes necessary to initiate legal proceedings against both the broker and the imposter involved in the fraudulent sale of the flat. This ensures that appropriate action is taken against those responsible for such deceitful actions.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The Executing Court has the discretionary power to allow the application of a third party (TP) to be impleaded in an execution proceeding under Order 1 Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC). However, whether the application is maintainable in the first place is a pure question of law that the Court must first determine.The Supreme Court has held that the Court must first determine the maintainability of the application before exercising its discretion to allow it. In the case of Smt. Sushila Devi vs. Smt. Nirmala Devi, the Court held that \"the question whether the application is maintainable under Order 1 Rule 10 CPC is a pure question of law which does not depend upon the facts of the case and the Court must decide it before exercising its discretion under the said provision.\"In your case, the opposing party has raised a pure question of law as to whether the application of the TP is maintainable under Order 1 Rule 10 CPC. The Executing Court must first determine this question before considering whether the TP is a necessary party.If the Court finds that the application is maintainable, it will then have to consider whether the TP is a necessary party. A necessary party is a person whose presence in the suit is essential for the adjudication of the matter. In other words, the absence of the TP would make it impossible for the Court to decide the case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,A clean PCC means that there is no adverse information against you in the police records. However, a clean PCC does not guarantee that there is no look out notice against you. A look out notice is a formal request to law enforcement agencies to detain or arrest a person when they try to enter or leave the country.Dear Client,It is possible that there is a look out notice against you even though your PCC is clean. This is because the police may have issued the look out notice after you applied for the PCC.If you are concerned about a look out notice, you can contact the nearest Indian embassy or consulate in Canada and ask them to check for you. They will be able to access the police records and tell you whether there is a look out notice against you.If there is a look out notice against you, you will not be able to enter India even if you have a valid Indian passport or OCI card. You will need to get the look out notice withdrawn before you can travel to India.You can apply for the withdrawal of the look out notice through your lawyer or directly through the police station where the notice was issued. The police will consider your application and decide whether to withdraw the notice.If the police refuse to withdraw the look out notice, you can challenge their decision in court.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If any consideration amount is paid then the gift deed becomes invalid.In fact if the donee pays the stamp duty, it can amount to consideration paid by the donee for the gift under theTransfer of Property Act. Sincethere cannot be a consideration in a gift deed, the deed may be considered void when the donee pays the stamp duty. So, the donor is responsible for paying the stamp duty.The mother of the minor son can accept the property transferred through a gift deed to her minor son in the capacity of the guardian and next friend of the minor child.Hence the stamp duty paid by the mother/ donor in the capacity of donor cannot be considered as a consideration amount towards payment of stamp duty.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,A clean PCC means that there is no adverse information against you in the police records. However, a clean PCC does not guarantee that there is no look out notice against you. A look out notice is a formal request to law enforcement agencies to detain or arrest a person when they try to enter or leave the country.Dear Client,It is possible that there is a look out notice against you even though your PCC is clean. This is because the police may have issued the look out notice after you applied for the PCC.If you are concerned about a look out notice, you can contact the nearest Indian embassy or consulate in Canada and ask them to check for you. They will be able to access the police records and tell you whether there is a look out notice against you.If there is a look out notice against you, you will not be able to enter India even if you have a valid Indian passport or OCI card. You will need to get the look out notice withdrawn before you can travel to India.You can apply for the withdrawal of the look out notice through your lawyer or directly through the police station where the notice was issued. The police will consider your application and decide whether to withdraw the notice.If the police refuse to withdraw the look out notice, you can challenge their decision in court.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The Executing Court has the discretionary power to allow the application of a third party (TP) to be impleaded in an execution proceeding under Order 1 Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC). However, whether the application is maintainable in the first place is a pure question of law that the Court must first determine.The Supreme Court has held that the Court must first determine the maintainability of the application before exercising its discretion to allow it. In the case of Smt. Sushila Devi vs. Smt. Nirmala Devi, the Court held that \"the question whether the application is maintainable under Order 1 Rule 10 CPC is a pure question of law which does not depend upon the facts of the case and the Court must decide it before exercising its discretion under the said provision.\"In your case, the opposing party has raised a pure question of law as to whether the application of the TP is maintainable under Order 1 Rule 10 CPC. The Executing Court must first determine this question before considering whether the TP is a necessary party.If the Court finds that the application is maintainable, it will then have to consider whether the TP is a necessary party. A necessary party is a person whose presence in the suit is essential for the adjudication of the matter. In other words, the absence of the TP would make it impossible for the Court to decide the case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It is imperative that all the original deed's signatories collectively participate in the execution of the rectification deed as well, reaffirming their mutual consent.Subsequently, the passbook associated with the deed should undergo rectification. This step is essential to ensure that the passbook accurately reflects the corrected details as per the rectification deed.To address the issue of incorrect survey numbers mentioned in the passbook, you have the option to formally request the Revenue Divisional Officer (RDO) for the passbook's cancellation. This course of action is necessary to rectify the discrepancies and inaccuracies present. By doing so, you can facilitate the rewriting of the passbook with the accurate survey numbers, thereby aligning it with the corrected information provided in the rectification deed.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The schedule property boundaries are just a description of the property, and the survey number is the actual identifier of the property.However, the incorrect survey numbers in the schedule property boundaries can create problems if you ever need to sell the property or get a loan against it. The buyer or lender may want to verify the boundaries of the property, and they may not be able to do so if the survey numbers are incorrect.In this case, you can either get the seller to execute a rectification deed to correct the survey numbers in the schedule property boundaries, or you can get a survey done to confirm the boundaries of the property and then update the schedule property boundaries in the sale deed."

However, the survey numbers mentioned in the schedule property boundaries are incorrect. This could make the deed invalid if the incorrect survey numbers are material to the description of the property.For example, if the sale deed describes the property as a plot with survey number 1234, but the schedule property boundaries show that the plot actually has survey number 5678, then the deed could be considered invalid. This is because the buyer would not be getting the property that they bargained for.However, if the incorrect survey numbers are not material to the description of the property, then the deed may still be valid. For example, if the sale deed describes the property as a plot of land in a particular village, but the schedule property boundaries show that the plot is actually located in a different part of the village, then the deed may still be valid. This is because the buyer would still be getting the property that they bargained for, even though the exact location of the property is different.Ultimately, the validity of the sale deed will depend on the specific facts and circumstances of the case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, the survey numbers mentioned in the schedule property boundaries are incorrect. This could make the deed invalid if the incorrect survey numbers are material to the description of the property.For example, if the sale deed describes the property as a plot with survey number 1234, but the schedule property boundaries show that the plot actually has survey number 5678, then the deed could be considered invalid. This is because the buyer would not be getting the property that they bargained for.However, if the incorrect survey numbers are not material to the description of the property, then the deed may still be valid. For example, if the sale deed describes the property as a plot of land in a particular village, but the schedule property boundaries show that the plot is actually located in a different part of the village, then the deed may still be valid. This is because the buyer would still be getting the property that they bargained for, even though the exact location of the property is different.Ultimately, the validity of the sale deed will depend on the specific facts and circumstances of the case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The employer can simply credit the employee's salary to their bank account, but withhold the PF contribution until the UAN is activated. Once the UAN is activated, the employer can then remit the PF contribution to the EPFO.Question 2 - Yes you have to return all the assets which were provided to you by the company for the wellfare of the company and that are used during the course of the employment for the business of the company.Akshit AggarwalAdvocate, Delhi52 AnswersTalk to Advocate Akshit Aggarwal"

    "question": "PF credit to relative account and agreement doubt",
    "answer": "The first issue pertains to the company's refusal to deposit your salary into a relative's account. Moving on to the second matter, the Universal Account Number (UAN) proves to be a versatile tool for an individual's professional journey. By simply providing your UAN and PF account particulars to different employers, you are all set, as the UAN links together all prior accounts under one umbrella. Accessing your UAN card necessitates registration on the EPFO member portal.Addressing the third point, Annexure 1 becomes essential as it outlines the inventory of company assets allocated to the employee. This includes only those assets directly provided by the company.It's worth noting that a third question hasn't been raised in relation to the second matter.Shifting focus back to the second issue, it's imperative that any assets provided by the company are returned upon conclusion of employment. Failure to do so might result in the company recuperating the associated costs from you."

    "question": "Defendant is dead",
    "answer": "In legal proceedings, there are certain important steps and considerations that need to be kept in mind. Firstly, it's crucial to promptly inform the court about any significant developments, such as the unfortunate demise of the defendant. Adhering to the established legal processes is of utmost importance. If you find yourself in a situation where you're unsure about the best course of action, it's advisable to seek guidance from your legal counsel; following their advice can provide you with a sense of confidence and understanding.When it comes to involving other parties, there is a formal approach. If you intend to include the Legal Representatives (LRs) of a party, you can formally submit an application to the court for their inclusion. Subsequently, the LRs will receive official summonses. Should they hold any objections to their involvement, they are required to communicate this to the court, which will then make a decision based on the information provided.In instances where legal proceedings are at risk of being halted due to certain circumstances, it's necessary to take proactive steps. To address situations like the abatement of a case, you'll need to initiate a legal petition to set aside this abatement.It's important to note that, in the pursuit of legal actions, you are generally expected to approach one court at a time rather than pursuing simultaneous action in multiple courts. This approach ensures clarity and adherence to proper legal procedures."

    "answer": "Adhering to the legal procedures is essential if you intend to seek respite from the court and delay the ongoing criminal proceedings. To achieve this, it's imperative to engage with the necessary legal steps. One effective way is to provide your lawyer with a vakalatnama, granting them the authority to represent you. They can then formally appear on your behalf and submit a memorandum to the court. This memorandum should be accompanied by a copy of the stay order from the high court. The primary goal here is to petition the court to halt the ongoing proceedings until the high court has made its decision. By following these steps meticulously, you can navigate the legal process with the intention of achieving a temporary suspension of the criminal proceedings against you."

    "question": "Landlord selling properties to many customers",
    "answer": "Before granting a loan, banks are required to conduct thorough due diligence procedures. In your case, you have diligently ensured timely payment of EMIs and have maintained a flawless record without any defaults. However, it's essential to be cautious about the authenticity of documents involved in property transactions. For instance, if fraudulent documents are exploited in the sale of flats, there is a significant risk of legal repercussions. Such actions could lead to the original flat owner pursuing legal action against both you and the broker for engaging in forgery and document fabrication.It's noteworthy that you currently don't have any pending criminal cases against you. This clean legal record affords you the freedom to travel abroad for work-related purposes without any constraints. It's imperative for property transactions that sellers provide valid identification documents such as their Aadhar card and PAN card during the sale deed registration process.However, in situations where counterfeit Aadhar cards are employed, it becomes necessary to initiate legal proceedings against both the broker and the imposter involved in the fraudulent sale of the flat. This ensures that appropriate action is taken against those responsible for such deceitful actions.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, the survey numbers mentioned in the schedule property boundaries are incorrect.

This is because the buyer would not be getting the property that they bargained for.However, if the incorrect survey numbers are not material to the description of the property, then the deed may still be valid. For example, if the sale deed describes the property as a plot of land in a particular village, but the schedule property boundaries show that the plot is actually located in a different part of the village, then the deed may still be valid. This is because the buyer would still be getting the property that they bargained for, even though the exact location of the property is different.Ultimately, the validity of the sale deed will depend on the specific facts and circumstances of the case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It is imperative that all the original deed's signatories collectively participate in the execution of the rectification deed as well, reaffirming their mutual consent.Subsequently, the passbook associated with the deed should undergo rectification. This step is essential to ensure that the passbook accurately reflects the corrected details as per the rectification deed.To address the issue of incorrect survey numbers mentioned in the passbook, you have the option to formally request the Revenue Divisional Officer (RDO) for the passbook's cancellation. This course of action is necessary to rectify the discrepancies and inaccuracies present.

The schedule property boundaries are just a description of the property, and the survey number is the actual identifier of the property.However, the incorrect survey numbers in the schedule property boundaries can create problems if you ever need to sell the property or get a loan against it. The buyer or lender may want to verify the boundaries of the property, and they may not be able to do so if the survey numbers are incorrect.In this case, you can either get the seller to execute a rectification deed to correct the survey numbers in the schedule property boundaries, or you can get a survey done to confirm the boundaries of the property and then update the schedule property boundaries in the sale deed."

However, the survey numbers mentioned in the schedule property boundaries are incorrect. This could make the deed invalid if the incorrect survey numbers are material to the description of the property.For example, if the sale deed describes the property as a plot with survey number 1234, but the schedule property boundaries show that the plot actually has survey number 5678, then the deed could be considered invalid. This is because the buyer would not be getting the property that they bargained for.However, if the incorrect survey numbers are not material to the description of the property, then the deed may still be valid. For example, if the sale deed describes the property as a plot of land in a particular village, but the schedule property boundaries show that the plot is actually located in a different part of the village, then the deed may still be valid. This is because the buyer would still be getting the property that they bargained for, even though the exact location of the property is different.Ultimately, the validity of the sale deed will depend on the specific facts and circumstances of the case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Defendant is dead",
    "answer": "In legal proceedings, there are certain important steps and considerations that need to be kept in mind. Firstly, it's crucial to promptly inform the court about any significant developments, such as the unfortunate demise of the defendant. Adhering to the established legal processes is of utmost importance. If you find yourself in a situation where you're unsure about the best course of action, it's advisable to seek guidance from your legal counsel; following their advice can provide you with a sense of confidence and understanding.When it comes to involving other parties, there is a formal approach. If you intend to include the Legal Representatives (LRs) of a party, you can formally submit an application to the court for their inclusion. Subsequently, the LRs will receive official summonses. Should they hold any objections to their involvement, they are required to communicate this to the court, which will then make a decision based on the information provided.In instances where legal proceedings are at risk of being halted due to certain circumstances, it's necessary to take proactive steps. To address situations like the abatement of a case, you'll need to initiate a legal petition to set aside this abatement.It's important to note that, in the pursuit of legal actions, you are generally expected to approach one court at a time rather than pursuing simultaneous action in multiple courts. This approach ensures clarity and adherence to proper legal procedures."

Adding legal representative's name: If you have discovered that Defendant No. 1 has passed away and you wish to add their legal representative's name to the suit, it's advisable to consult with a lawyer. They can guide you on the specific procedures and requirements for adding a legal representative's name to the suit. While the general rule under Order 22 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) is to add the legal representative's name within 90 days, Section 5 of the Limitation Act allows for condonation of delay in certain cases. The court will consider the circumstances and justification provided in the application for condonation of delay.2. Serving documents to legal representative: If you need to serve documents to the legal representative of Defendant No. 1, it's advisable to consult with a lawyer to understand the specific requirements. Generally, you may need to serve a copy of the relevant documents, including the written statement filed by Defendant No. 1, to the legal representative.

    "question": "Landlord selling properties to many customers",
    "answer": "Before granting a loan, banks are required to conduct thorough due diligence procedures. In your case, you have diligently ensured timely payment of EMIs and have maintained a flawless record without any defaults. However, it's essential to be cautious about the authenticity of documents involved in property transactions. For instance, if fraudulent documents are exploited in the sale of flats, there is a significant risk of legal repercussions. Such actions could lead to the original flat owner pursuing legal action against both you and the broker for engaging in forgery and document fabrication.It's noteworthy that you currently don't have any pending criminal cases against you. This clean legal record affords you the freedom to travel abroad for work-related purposes without any constraints. It's imperative for property transactions that sellers provide valid identification documents such as their Aadhar card and PAN card during the sale deed registration process.However, in situations where counterfeit Aadhar cards are employed, it becomes necessary to initiate legal proceedings against both the broker and the imposter involved in the fraudulent sale of the flat. This ensures that appropriate action is taken against those responsible for such deceitful actions.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

To achieve this, it's imperative to engage with the necessary legal steps. One effective way is to provide your lawyer with a vakalatnama, granting them the authority to represent you. They can then formally appear on your behalf and submit a memorandum to the court. This memorandum should be accompanied by a copy of the stay order from the high court. The primary goal here is to petition the court to halt the ongoing proceedings until the high court has made its decision. By following these steps meticulously, you can navigate the legal process with the intention of achieving a temporary suspension of the criminal proceedings against you."

Moving on to the second matter, the Universal Account Number (UAN) proves to be a versatile tool for an individual's professional journey. By simply providing your UAN and PF account particulars to different employers, you are all set, as the UAN links together all prior accounts under one umbrella. Accessing your UAN card necessitates registration on the EPFO member portal.Addressing the third point, Annexure 1 becomes essential as it outlines the inventory of company assets allocated to the employee. This includes only those assets directly provided by the company.It's worth noting that a third question hasn't been raised in relation to the second matter.Shifting focus back to the second issue, it's imperative that any assets provided by the company are returned upon conclusion of employment.

    "answer": "it is not nice to conceal true facts from the Courta person who has approached the Court has to do so with clean handsas you are aware from certain information that D1 is dead then you should bring this to the notice of the courtyou can tell the court that you do not know about the whereabouts of deceased D1if the legal heirs are not joined within the statutory period under the CPC then the suit will simply abate, however only against the dead defendantthat means your suit will still continueso whatever is the fact must be brought to the notice of the Courtif your information about death of D1 is correct then i do not agree with your advocate that the same should be concealed from the Court so that you get an ex-parte decree. As a responsible officer of the Court it is the duty of the advocate to bring to the notice of the court the true and correct facts. Concealing and suppressing material facts is a professional misconduct. An advocate aside from espousing the cause of his client also has a corresponding duty towards the Courtthe revenue court and local MC has no jurisdiction to decide the dispute which is involved in your present suit.

    "question": "Defendant is dead",
    "answer": "In legal proceedings, there are certain important steps and considerations that need to be kept in mind. Firstly, it's crucial to promptly inform the court about any significant developments, such as the unfortunate demise of the defendant. Adhering to the established legal processes is of utmost importance. If you find yourself in a situation where you're unsure about the best course of action, it's advisable to seek guidance from your legal counsel; following their advice can provide you with a sense of confidence and understanding.When it comes to involving other parties, there is a formal approach. If you intend to include the Legal Representatives (LRs) of a party, you can formally submit an application to the court for their inclusion. Subsequently, the LRs will receive official summonses. Should they hold any objections to their involvement, they are required to communicate this to the court, which will then make a decision based on the information provided.In instances where legal proceedings are at risk of being halted due to certain circumstances, it's necessary to take proactive steps. To address situations like the abatement of a case, you'll need to initiate a legal petition to set aside this abatement.It's important to note that, in the pursuit of legal actions, you are generally expected to approach one court at a time rather than pursuing simultaneous action in multiple courts. This approach ensures clarity and adherence to proper legal procedures."

    "answer": "Before granting a loan, banks are required to conduct thorough due diligence procedures. In your case, you have diligently ensured timely payment of EMIs and have maintained a flawless record without any defaults. However, it's essential to be cautious about the authenticity of documents involved in property transactions. For instance, if fraudulent documents are exploited in the sale of flats, there is a significant risk of legal repercussions. Such actions could lead to the original flat owner pursuing legal action against both you and the broker for engaging in forgery and document fabrication.It's noteworthy that you currently don't have any pending criminal cases against you. This clean legal record affords you the freedom to travel abroad for work-related purposes without any constraints. It's imperative for property transactions that sellers provide valid identification documents such as their Aadhar card and PAN card during the sale deed registration process.However, in situations where counterfeit Aadhar cards are employed, it becomes necessary to initiate legal proceedings against both the broker and the imposter involved in the fraudulent sale of the flat.

They can then formally appear on your behalf and submit a memorandum to the court. This memorandum should be accompanied by a copy of the stay order from the high court. The primary goal here is to petition the court to halt the ongoing proceedings until the high court has made its decision.

    "question": "Falsely accused in a suicide note",
    "answer": "- As per the Madras High Court , merely because a person, who has committed suicide, has left a suicide note, one cannot immediately jump to a conclusion that it is enough to mulct the accused with criminal liability under Section 306 IPC,, and one has to analyze and examine the contents of the suicide note to find out whether it contains any incriminating information in the nature of instigation, provocation, forcing the victim to commit suicide.- Further, the Punjab and Haryana High Court also held that merely a person’s name in the suicide note is not enough to conclude that the individual is guilty of abetment of suicide while quashing a 2011 FIR against four lawyers and two employees of a private company- Since, a complaint was earlier filed against your said mausa for his act of drunk and tried to commit suicide or threatening to suicide , then it is clear that he was not having good relation with other family members, and hence there is much ground for getting bail and to quash the FIR.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Falsely accused in a suicide note",
    "answer": "In order to challenge a First Information Report (FIR) effectively, it is important that no aspect of the FIR's contents inadvertently supports the case. The provided evidence, as previously mentioned, should not be factored in when evaluating the potential for quashing the FIR. During the consideration of the request to quash, the court's focus will solely remain on the FIR itself, along with the chargesheet or police report. It appears that the accused has valid reasons for seeking bail, especially given their current incarceration status and the absence of any necessity for further investigation."

CHENNAI: Any woman residing in India either temporarily or permanently is entitled to seek relief from a court of law under theDomestic ViolenceAct even if her spouse lives outside the country, the Madras high court said Wednesday.Justice S M Subramaniam issued the order while dismissing a petition filed by a US citizen, challenging adomestic violencecomplaint filed by his wife against him in a Chennai family court. \"The cause of action arises in India since the aggrieved person is residing here, even if abused economically by the spouse residing in another country,\" he said.The court recently rejected a plea by an Indian man who claimed that a magistrate's court in Nagpur can not act on a complaint ofdomestic violence.A court in India can take cognizance of a case ofdomestic violenceeven if the alleged offence takes place in a foreign country, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court has held.In the present case, consequence of trauma, suffering and distress carried by the complainant woman when she returned to her parents would be sufficient to reject her estranged husband's claims that an Indian court would have no jurisdiction to hear the case, the judge said.The Bombay High Court recently held thatjudicial magistrate in India can take cognizance ofdomestic violencecommitted in foreign soilunder the Protection of Women FromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005 (DV Act).Therefore you can initiate the DV case process.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "DV event in USA, can same be filed in Indian court",
    "answer": "Your lawyer's assertion is accurate. While not legally binding, the recent ruling of the Bombay High Court regarding the extraterritorial application of the Protection of Women FromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005 (DV Act) holds persuasive value. The court in Bombay emphasized that the DV Act is essentially a \"social beneficial legislation,\" and its applicability isn't contingent on the location where the offense occurred. This means that a judicial magistrate in India can indeed consider instances ofdomestic violenceperpetrated on foreign soil under the provisions of the DV Act. This ruling can be particularly relevant in jurisdictions like Kerala, where no conflicting judgments from the Kerala High Court have been presented. Therefore, the court in Kerala could potentially draw upon the Bombay High Court's decision as a precedent, given the absence of contrary judgments within the state.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Before granting a loan, banks are required to conduct thorough due diligence procedures. In your case, you have diligently ensured timely payment of EMIs and have maintained a flawless record without any defaults. However, it's essential to be cautious about the authenticity of documents involved in property transactions. For instance, if fraudulent documents are exploited in the sale of flats, there is a significant risk of legal repercussions. Such actions could lead to the original flat owner pursuing legal action against both you and the broker for engaging in forgery and document fabrication.It's noteworthy that you currently don't have any pending criminal cases against you. This clean legal record affords you the freedom to travel abroad for work-related purposes without any constraints. It's imperative for property transactions that sellers provide valid identification documents such as their Aadhar card and PAN card during the sale deed registration process.However, in situations where counterfeit Aadhar cards are employed, it becomes necessary to initiate legal proceedings against both the broker and the imposter involved in the fraudulent sale of the flat. This ensures that appropriate action is taken against those responsible for such deceitful actions.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Adhering to the legal procedures is essential if you intend to seek respite from the court and delay the ongoing criminal proceedings. To achieve this, it's imperative to engage with the necessary legal steps. One effective way is to provide your lawyer with a vakalatnama, granting them the authority to represent you. They can then formally appear on your behalf and submit a memorandum to the court. This memorandum should be accompanied by a copy of the stay order from the high court. The primary goal here is to petition the court to halt the ongoing proceedings until the high court has made its decision. By following these steps meticulously, you can navigate the legal process with the intention of achieving a temporary suspension of the criminal proceedings against you."

This can take some time, but it is necessary to ensure that the case is fair to everyone involved.Question 3:Your advocate is correct that you do not need to inform the court about the death of the defendant if you are confident that you will be able to get an ex-parte order.

    "question": "Defendant is dead",
    "answer": "In legal proceedings, there are certain important steps and considerations that need to be kept in mind. Firstly, it's crucial to promptly inform the court about any significant developments, such as the unfortunate demise of the defendant. Adhering to the established legal processes is of utmost importance. If you find yourself in a situation where you're unsure about the best course of action, it's advisable to seek guidance from your legal counsel; following their advice can provide you with a sense of confidence and understanding.When it comes to involving other parties, there is a formal approach. If you intend to include the Legal Representatives (LRs) of a party, you can formally submit an application to the court for their inclusion. Subsequently, the LRs will receive official summonses. Should they hold any objections to their involvement, they are required to communicate this to the court, which will then make a decision based on the information provided.In instances where legal proceedings are at risk of being halted due to certain circumstances, it's necessary to take proactive steps. To address situations like the abatement of a case, you'll need to initiate a legal petition to set aside this abatement.It's important to note that, in the pursuit of legal actions, you are generally expected to approach one court at a time rather than pursuing simultaneous action in multiple courts. This approach ensures clarity and adherence to proper legal procedures."

    "answer": "The first issue pertains to the company's refusal to deposit your salary into a relative's account. Moving on to the second matter, the Universal Account Number (UAN) proves to be a versatile tool for an individual's professional journey. By simply providing your UAN and PF account particulars to different employers, you are all set, as the UAN links together all prior accounts under one umbrella. Accessing your UAN card necessitates registration on the EPFO member portal.Addressing the third point, Annexure 1 becomes essential as it outlines the inventory of company assets allocated to the employee. This includes only those assets directly provided by the company.It's worth noting that a third question hasn't been raised in relation to the second matter.Shifting focus back to the second issue, it's imperative that any assets provided by the company are returned upon conclusion of employment. Failure to do so might result in the company recuperating the associated costs from you."

    "question": "PF credit to relative account and agreement doubt",
    "answer": "The first issue pertains to the company's refusal to deposit your salary into a relative's account. Moving on to the second matter, the Universal Account Number (UAN) proves to be a versatile tool for an individual's professional journey. By simply providing your UAN and PF account particulars to different employers, you are all set, as the UAN links together all prior accounts under one umbrella. Accessing your UAN card necessitates registration on the EPFO member portal.Addressing the third point, Annexure 1 becomes essential as it outlines the inventory of company assets allocated to the employee. This includes only those assets directly provided by the company.It's worth noting that a third question hasn't been raised in relation to the second matter.Shifting focus back to the second issue, it's imperative that any assets provided by the company are returned upon conclusion of employment. Failure to do so might result in the company recuperating the associated costs from you."

The provided evidence, as previously mentioned, should not be factored in when evaluating the potential for quashing the FIR. During the consideration of the request to quash, the court's focus will solely remain on the FIR itself, along with the chargesheet or police report. It appears that the accused has valid reasons for seeking bail, especially given their current incarceration status and the absence of any necessity for further investigation."

While not legally binding, the recent ruling of the Bombay High Court regarding the extraterritorial application of the Protection of Women FromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005 (DV Act) holds persuasive value. The court in Bombay emphasized that the DV Act is essentially a \"social beneficial legislation,\" and its applicability isn't contingent on the location where the offense occurred. This means that a judicial magistrate in India can indeed consider instances ofdomestic violenceperpetrated on foreign soil under the provisions of the DV Act. This ruling can be particularly relevant in jurisdictions like Kerala, where no conflicting judgments from the Kerala High Court have been presented.

    "question": "PF credit to relative account and agreement doubt",
    "answer": "1. The employer canot hold the payment of PF just because your UAN is deactivatedif you have worked for different companies, you may have several PF account numbers.One member can have multiple PF numbers but only one UAN.UAN is a permanent number, eligible throughout an individual's lifetime.Once the UAN is automatically deactivated,the old EPF account will be linked to the new UAN. The EPFO member will receive an SMS that notifies the deactivation status of the old UAN. In case the new UAN has not been activated by the employee, he/she will receive a request to activate the new UAN.Universal account numbers  are dormant in case of no activity for36 months.After the transfer process,the EPFO will block your previous UAN, which can never be used after de-activation. 4. Once the EPFO has validated your new UAN, it will be linked to your PF account automatically2.

    "answer": "Credit salary but hold PF until UAN issue sorted:This is the most legally safe option, as it does not involve any violation of the EPF Act. The employer can simply credit the employee's salary to their bank account, but withhold the PF contribution until the UAN is activated. Once the UAN is activated, the employer can then remit the PF contribution to the EPFO.Question 2 - Yes you have to return all the assets which were provided to you by the company for the wellfare of the company and that are used during the course of the employment for the business of the company.Akshit AggarwalAdvocate, Delhi52 AnswersTalk to Advocate Akshit Aggarwal"

    "question": "PF credit to relative account and agreement doubt",
    "answer": "The first issue pertains to the company's refusal to deposit your salary into a relative's account. Moving on to the second matter, the Universal Account Number (UAN) proves to be a versatile tool for an individual's professional journey. By simply providing your UAN and PF account particulars to different employers, you are all set, as the UAN links together all prior accounts under one umbrella. Accessing your UAN card necessitates registration on the EPFO member portal.Addressing the third point, Annexure 1 becomes essential as it outlines the inventory of company assets allocated to the employee. This includes only those assets directly provided by the company.It's worth noting that a third question hasn't been raised in relation to the second matter.Shifting focus back to the second issue, it's imperative that any assets provided by the company are returned upon conclusion of employment. Failure to do so might result in the company recuperating the associated costs from you."

The court will then issue an order to add the legal representatives of the deceased defendant to the case.Question 2:If you inform the court, the case will be paused until the legal representatives of the deceased defendant are added. This can take some time, but it is necessary to ensure that the case is fair to everyone involved.Question 3:Your advocate is correct that you do not need to inform the court about the death of the defendant if you are confident that you will be able to get an ex-parte order. However, it is still a good idea to inform the court, as this will avoid any potential problems down the road.Question 4:If you do not inform the court about the death of the defendant, the case may be abated. This means that the case will be dismissed. You can then file a new case against the legal representatives of the deceased defendant.Question 5:Yes, you can add the legal representatives of the deceased defendant to the case even after 6 months have passed. However, you will need to provide evidence of the death of the defendant.Question 6:If the case is abated, you can file a new case against the legal representatives of the deceased defendant.

    "question": "Defendant is dead",
    "answer": "In legal proceedings, there are certain important steps and considerations that need to be kept in mind. Firstly, it's crucial to promptly inform the court about any significant developments, such as the unfortunate demise of the defendant. Adhering to the established legal processes is of utmost importance. If you find yourself in a situation where you're unsure about the best course of action, it's advisable to seek guidance from your legal counsel; following their advice can provide you with a sense of confidence and understanding.When it comes to involving other parties, there is a formal approach. If you intend to include the Legal Representatives (LRs) of a party, you can formally submit an application to the court for their inclusion. Subsequently, the LRs will receive official summonses. Should they hold any objections to their involvement, they are required to communicate this to the court, which will then make a decision based on the information provided.In instances where legal proceedings are at risk of being halted due to certain circumstances, it's necessary to take proactive steps. To address situations like the abatement of a case, you'll need to initiate a legal petition to set aside this abatement.It's important to note that, in the pursuit of legal actions, you are generally expected to approach one court at a time rather than pursuing simultaneous action in multiple courts. This approach ensures clarity and adherence to proper legal procedures."

    "answer": "The high courts in Madras and Bombay have clearly given verdicts tht thedomestic violencecase can be entertained even if the incidents are reported to have taken place in a foreign soil.Therefore you better file a DV case in your jurisdictional court in Kerala without attaching the judgment at this stage.The judgments can be relied upon only at the time of final arguments and not in the preliminary stage itself.If your lawyer is not cooperating then you can engage any other lawyer who is willing to take up your case.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "DV event in USA, can same be filed in Indian court",
    "answer": "Your lawyer's assertion is accurate. While not legally binding, the recent ruling of the Bombay High Court regarding the extraterritorial application of the Protection of Women FromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005 (DV Act) holds persuasive value. The court in Bombay emphasized that the DV Act is essentially a \"social beneficial legislation,\" and its applicability isn't contingent on the location where the offense occurred. This means that a judicial magistrate in India can indeed consider instances ofdomestic violenceperpetrated on foreign soil under the provisions of the DV Act. This ruling can be particularly relevant in jurisdictions like Kerala, where no conflicting judgments from the Kerala High Court have been presented. Therefore, the court in Kerala could potentially draw upon the Bombay High Court's decision as a precedent, given the absence of contrary judgments within the state.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This can take some time, but it is necessary to ensure that the case is fair to everyone involved.Question 3:Your advocate is correct that you do not need to inform the court about the death of the defendant if you are confident that you will be able to get an ex-parte order. However, it is still a good idea to inform the court, as this will avoid any potential problems down the road.Question 4:If you do not inform the court about the death of the defendant, the case may be abated.

    "question": "Defendant is dead",
    "answer": "In legal proceedings, there are certain important steps and considerations that need to be kept in mind. Firstly, it's crucial to promptly inform the court about any significant developments, such as the unfortunate demise of the defendant. Adhering to the established legal processes is of utmost importance. If you find yourself in a situation where you're unsure about the best course of action, it's advisable to seek guidance from your legal counsel; following their advice can provide you with a sense of confidence and understanding.When it comes to involving other parties, there is a formal approach. If you intend to include the Legal Representatives (LRs) of a party, you can formally submit an application to the court for their inclusion. Subsequently, the LRs will receive official summonses. Should they hold any objections to their involvement, they are required to communicate this to the court, which will then make a decision based on the information provided.In instances where legal proceedings are at risk of being halted due to certain circumstances, it's necessary to take proactive steps. To address situations like the abatement of a case, you'll need to initiate a legal petition to set aside this abatement.It's important to note that, in the pursuit of legal actions, you are generally expected to approach one court at a time rather than pursuing simultaneous action in multiple courts. This approach ensures clarity and adherence to proper legal procedures."

The provided evidence, as previously mentioned, should not be factored in when evaluating the potential for quashing the FIR. During the consideration of the request to quash, the court's focus will solely remain on the FIR itself, along with the chargesheet or police report.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Wife's Right to Residence in Parental Property:A wife can claim a right to reside in her husband's property or the matrimonial home. This could potentially still apply even if you move out and provide an alternate residence for her.Denying Residence Rights:Transferring property to someone else solely to deny residence rights to your wife might not necessarily be a straightforward solution. Courts might look into the intention behind such transfers and whether they were done with the intent to evade legal responsibilities.Transferring Property to Sister:Transferring property to your sister might not necessarily prevent your wife from claiming residence rights, especially if it is deemed that the transfer was done to circumvent her rights. The laws and regulations around property transfers and family rights can be complex and may have provisions to prevent such maneuvers.

If the lender wishes to enforce the terms of the sale agreement, they could potentially file a lawsuit for \"specific performance.\" This legal remedy seeks to force the other party to fulfill their contractual obligations, which, in this case, could mean completing the purchase at the agreed-upon price.If the purchaser is using threats of physical violence, the lender might consider involving the local police and filing a complaint about the threats.Sukumar JadhavAdvocate, Mumbai35 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sukumar Jadhav"

    "answer": "It is assumed that the agreement is unregistered, with a stipulated time limit of three months. In light of this, the vendor's strategy would involve maintaining silence until the sale agreement's expiry. Subsequently, the vendor could inform the buyer of the agreement's cancellation due to its expiration, and propose the return of the initial advance payment received.Given that the agreement lacks registration, its enforceability is limited. Nevertheless, the court might issue a directive for the reimbursement of the advance payment, along with accrued interest from the date of payment receipt.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Your lawyer's assertion is accurate. While not legally binding, the recent ruling of the Bombay High Court regarding the extraterritorial application of the Protection of Women FromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005 (DV Act) holds persuasive value. The court in Bombay emphasized that the DV Act is essentially a \"social beneficial legislation,\" and its applicability isn't contingent on the location where the offense occurred. This means that a judicial magistrate in India can indeed consider instances ofdomestic violenceperpetrated on foreign soil under the provisions of the DV Act. This ruling can be particularly relevant in jurisdictions like Kerala, where no conflicting judgments from the Kerala High Court have been presented. Therefore, the court in Kerala could potentially draw upon the Bombay High Court's decision as a precedent, given the absence of contrary judgments within the state.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The provided evidence, as previously mentioned, should not be factored in when evaluating the potential for quashing the FIR.

CHENNAI: Any woman residing in India either temporarily or permanently is entitled to seek relief from a court of law under theDomestic ViolenceAct even if her spouse lives outside the country, the Madras high court said Wednesday.Justice S M Subramaniam issued the order while dismissing a petition filed by a US citizen, challenging adomestic violencecomplaint filed by his wife against him in a Chennai family court. \"The cause of action arises in India since the aggrieved person is residing here, even if abused economically by the spouse residing in another country,\" he said.The court recently rejected a plea by an Indian man who claimed that a magistrate's court in Nagpur can not act on a complaint ofdomestic violence.A court in India can take cognizance of a case ofdomestic violenceeven if the alleged offence takes place in a foreign country, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court has held.In the present case, consequence of trauma, suffering and distress carried by the complainant woman when she returned to her parents would be sufficient to reject her estranged husband's claims that an Indian court would have no jurisdiction to hear the case, the judge said.The Bombay High Court recently held thatjudicial magistrate in India can take cognizance ofdomestic violencecommitted in foreign soilunder the Protection of Women FromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005 (DV Act).Therefore you can initiate the DV case process.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Your lawyer's assertion is accurate. While not legally binding, the recent ruling of the Bombay High Court regarding the extraterritorial application of the Protection of Women FromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005 (DV Act) holds persuasive value. The court in Bombay emphasized that the DV Act is essentially a \"social beneficial legislation,\" and its applicability isn't contingent on the location where the offense occurred. This means that a judicial magistrate in India can indeed consider instances ofdomestic violenceperpetrated on foreign soil under the provisions of the DV Act. This ruling can be particularly relevant in jurisdictions like Kerala, where no conflicting judgments from the Kerala High Court have been presented. Therefore, the court in Kerala could potentially draw upon the Bombay High Court's decision as a precedent, given the absence of contrary judgments within the state.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

CHENNAI: Any woman residing in India either temporarily or permanently is entitled to seek relief from a court of law under theDomestic ViolenceAct even if her spouse lives outside the country, the Madras high court said Wednesday.Justice S M Subramaniam issued the order while dismissing a petition filed by a US citizen, challenging adomestic violencecomplaint filed by his wife against him in a Chennai family court. \"The cause of action arises in India since the aggrieved person is residing here, even if abused economically by the spouse residing in another country,\" he said.The court recently rejected a plea by an Indian man who claimed that a magistrate's court in Nagpur can not act on a complaint ofdomestic violence.A court in India can take cognizance of a case ofdomestic violenceeven if the alleged offence takes place in a foreign country, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court has held.In the present case, consequence of trauma, suffering and distress carried by the complainant woman when she returned to her parents would be sufficient to reject her estranged husband's claims that an Indian court would have no jurisdiction to hear the case, the judge said.The Bombay High Court recently held thatjudicial magistrate in India can take cognizance ofdomestic violencecommitted in foreign soilunder the Protection of Women FromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005 (DV Act).Therefore you can initiate the DV case process.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

While not legally binding, the recent ruling of the Bombay High Court regarding the extraterritorial application of the Protection of Women FromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005 (DV Act) holds persuasive value. The court in Bombay emphasized that the DV Act is essentially a \"social beneficial legislation,\" and its applicability isn't contingent on the location where the offense occurred. This means that a judicial magistrate in India can indeed consider instances ofdomestic violenceperpetrated on foreign soil under the provisions of the DV Act. This ruling can be particularly relevant in jurisdictions like Kerala, where no conflicting judgments from the Kerala High Court have been presented.

    "answer": "If your father is not willing to distribute the property, you can file a suit for partition in the civil court, claiming your share . You can also send a legal notice to your brother if he is pressuring your father to sign a deed that transfers all the properties to him. If you have been denied a share in your ancestral property, you can also file a suit for declaration and partition against all brothers.It's important to note that fraud and cheating are criminal offenses. If you suspect that your brother has obtained the property by fraud or cheating, you can lodge an FIR against him for cheating and criminal breach of trust in the concerned police station. If the police do not take cognizance of your complaint, you can file a private case undersection 420of theIndian Penal Codebefore the Magistrate court.I hope this information helps.

This could potentially still apply even if you move out and provide an alternate residence for her.Denying Residence Rights:Transferring property to someone else solely to deny residence rights to your wife might not necessarily be a straightforward solution. Courts might look into the intention behind such transfers and whether they were done with the intent to evade legal responsibilities.Transferring Property to Sister:Transferring property to your sister might not necessarily prevent your wife from claiming residence rights, especially if it is deemed that the transfer was done to circumvent her rights. The laws and regulations around property transfers and family rights can be complex and may have provisions to prevent such maneuvers.

    "question": "Argument on pure question of law",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Firstly, the positioning of Order 1 Rule 10 CPC within the titled section \"Parties to Suit\" inherently denotes its intended scope, primarily pertaining to suits. This classification underscores the distinctiveness of the legal context in which this provision operates.Additionally, it is firmly established by the apex court that execution proceedings do not constitute a mere continuation of the original suit. The explicit divergence in the nature, purpose, and procedural course of execution proceedings vis-à-vis a suit serves as the foundation for this principle, as recognized by the Supreme Court.In consonance with this legal tenet, it becomes pivotal to analyze the applicability of Order 1 Rule 10 CPC within the context of execution proceedings. The High Court's stance, as articulated, aligns with the principle that Order 1 Rule 10 is intrinsically tailored to the dynamics of a suit and does not seamlessly extend its ambit to execution proceedings.This pivotal standpoint informs the critical contention that an application filed by a third party under Order 1 Rule 10 CPC for impleadment in execution proceedings is inherently devoid of merit. The contours of Order 1 Rule 10's jurisdiction are distinctly circumscribed by its contextual alignment with suits, thereby precluding its transposition to execution proceedings.Moreover, the acknowledgment by the third party applicant (TP) that the application was indeed filed under Order 1 Rule 10 fortifies the argument. The court is respectfully urged to recognize the inherent limitation of this provision's applicability outside the sphere of suits, rendering the present application legally unsustainable.Therefore, with a respectful submission to the court's discernment, the present application is fervently prayed to be dismissed on the basis of the law as expounded. It is asserted that the argument, albeit concise, delineates a comprehensive legal framework that harmonizes Order 1 Rule 10 CPC, the distinctiveness of execution proceedings, and the nuanced boundaries of jurisdiction.However, with due deference to the court's directive, should it incline towards the possibility of the application's maintainability, the applicant implores for the opportunity to present detailed factual contentions. The current presentation seeks to establish the legal foundation upon which the subsequent factual narrative would be superimposed.In summation, the intricate web of legal principles and provisions meticulously woven from 1 to 7 forms a cohesive fabric that illuminates the limitations of Order 1 Rule 10 CPC within the realm of execution proceedings. It is sincerely hoped that the elucidation provided herein resonates with the court's quest for a comprehensive exposition and serves to navigate the legal discourse in a direction that aligns with the dictates of justice.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Argument on pure question of law",
    "answer": "Madreas High court in the cae of Thiagarajar Polytechnic vs C.Rajaveeran on 22 March, 2011 has stated in the 12th  paragraph tht in the present case, we are faced with only an application for impleadment in an execution proceedings. Therefore, this Court is required to examine whether such impleadment application in the light of the provision of Order 1, Rule 10 CPC and to see whether the petitioner herein is a proper and necessary party to execution proceedings. While examining such application, the Court is given ample discretion to consider as to whether the party seeking impleadment is a necessary party.Also stated thatIt is seen that the Executing Court in the impugned order has not dealt with any of the contentions raised by the petitioner and rejected the same by cryptic and non-speaking order. Therefore, this Court is fully satisfied that the order passed by the Executing Court deserves to be interfered.15. In the light of the above discussion, it is held that the petitioner is a proper and necessary party to the Executing Court in the light of the fact that the first respondent/land owner has made a claim in the execution petition under the head equitable compensation which according to the petitioner did not form part of the decree passed by the Reference Court as confirmed by this Court.Therefore, the order passed by the Executing Court is set aside and the Executing Court is directed to implead the petitioner herein as the second respondent in the execution petition, afforded an opportunity to the petitioner to file their counter affidavit to the execution petition and decide the matter on merits and in accordance with law. It is made clear that this Court has decided the question regarding impleadment alone and has not gone into question as regards the first respondent's entitlement for compensation under the head 'equitable compensation, which shall be decided by the Executing Court on merits and in accordance with law.The principles governing the power of the court under Order 1, Rule 10 of CPC, are that as a rule, the court should not add a person as a defendant in a suit when the plaintiff is opposed to such addition. The reason is that the plaintiff is the “dominus litus”. He cannot be compelled to fight against a person against whom he does not wish to fight and against whom he does not claim any relief.The theory of dominus litus should not be overstretched in the matter of impleading of parties, because it is the duty of the court to ensure that if for deciding the real matter in dispute, a person is a necessary party, the court can order such person to be impleaded. Merely because the plaintiff does not choose to implead a person is not sufficient for rejection of an application for being impleaded.the Executing Court by invoking the power Order 1 Rule 10 CPC is entitled to add or delete the parties to any of the proceedings and such proceedings shall include the execution proceedings.This has been confirmed by Rajasthan high court in (2012) 08 RAJ CK 0176in Ritesh Shukla Vs. Shanta devi inCase No :Civil Writ Petition No. 3846 of 2010.In view of various judgments by various high court, it can be concluded that the Executing court can entertain the petition under order 1 rule 10 CPCT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "If your father is not willing to distribute the property, you can file a suit for partition in the civil court, claiming your share . You can also send a legal notice to your brother if he is pressuring your father to sign a deed that transfers all the properties to him. If you have been denied a share in your ancestral property, you can also file a suit for declaration and partition against all brothers.It's important to note that fraud and cheating are criminal offenses. If you suspect that your brother has obtained the property by fraud or cheating, you can lodge an FIR against him for cheating and criminal breach of trust in the concerned police station. If the police do not take cognizance of your complaint, you can file a private case undersection 420of theIndian Penal Codebefore the Magistrate court.I hope this information helps.

    "question": "Argument on pure question of law",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Firstly, the positioning of Order 1 Rule 10 CPC within the titled section \"Parties to Suit\" inherently denotes its intended scope, primarily pertaining to suits. This classification underscores the distinctiveness of the legal context in which this provision operates.Additionally, it is firmly established by the apex court that execution proceedings do not constitute a mere continuation of the original suit. The explicit divergence in the nature, purpose, and procedural course of execution proceedings vis-à-vis a suit serves as the foundation for this principle, as recognized by the Supreme Court.In consonance with this legal tenet, it becomes pivotal to analyze the applicability of Order 1 Rule 10 CPC within the context of execution proceedings. The High Court's stance, as articulated, aligns with the principle that Order 1 Rule 10 is intrinsically tailored to the dynamics of a suit and does not seamlessly extend its ambit to execution proceedings.This pivotal standpoint informs the critical contention that an application filed by a third party under Order 1 Rule 10 CPC for impleadment in execution proceedings is inherently devoid of merit. The contours of Order 1 Rule 10's jurisdiction are distinctly circumscribed by its contextual alignment with suits, thereby precluding its transposition to execution proceedings.Moreover, the acknowledgment by the third party applicant (TP) that the application was indeed filed under Order 1 Rule 10 fortifies the argument. The court is respectfully urged to recognize the inherent limitation of this provision's applicability outside the sphere of suits, rendering the present application legally unsustainable.Therefore, with a respectful submission to the court's discernment, the present application is fervently prayed to be dismissed on the basis of the law as expounded. It is asserted that the argument, albeit concise, delineates a comprehensive legal framework that harmonizes Order 1 Rule 10 CPC, the distinctiveness of execution proceedings, and the nuanced boundaries of jurisdiction.However, with due deference to the court's directive, should it incline towards the possibility of the application's maintainability, the applicant implores for the opportunity to present detailed factual contentions. The current presentation seeks to establish the legal foundation upon which the subsequent factual narrative would be superimposed.In summation, the intricate web of legal principles and provisions meticulously woven from 1 to 7 forms a cohesive fabric that illuminates the limitations of Order 1 Rule 10 CPC within the realm of execution proceedings. It is sincerely hoped that the elucidation provided herein resonates with the court's quest for a comprehensive exposition and serves to navigate the legal discourse in a direction that aligns with the dictates of justice.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Argument on pure question of law",
    "answer": "Madreas High court in the cae of Thiagarajar Polytechnic vs C.Rajaveeran on 22 March, 2011 has stated in the 12th  paragraph tht in the present case, we are faced with only an application for impleadment in an execution proceedings. Therefore, this Court is required to examine whether such impleadment application in the light of the provision of Order 1, Rule 10 CPC and to see whether the petitioner herein is a proper and necessary party to execution proceedings. While examining such application, the Court is given ample discretion to consider as to whether the party seeking impleadment is a necessary party.Also stated thatIt is seen that the Executing Court in the impugned order has not dealt with any of the contentions raised by the petitioner and rejected the same by cryptic and non-speaking order. Therefore, this Court is fully satisfied that the order passed by the Executing Court deserves to be interfered.15. In the light of the above discussion, it is held that the petitioner is a proper and necessary party to the Executing Court in the light of the fact that the first respondent/land owner has made a claim in the execution petition under the head equitable compensation which according to the petitioner did not form part of the decree passed by the Reference Court as confirmed by this Court.Therefore, the order passed by the Executing Court is set aside and the Executing Court is directed to implead the petitioner herein as the second respondent in the execution petition, afforded an opportunity to the petitioner to file their counter affidavit to the execution petition and decide the matter on merits and in accordance with law. It is made clear that this Court has decided the question regarding impleadment alone and has not gone into question as regards the first respondent's entitlement for compensation under the head 'equitable compensation, which shall be decided by the Executing Court on merits and in accordance with law.The principles governing the power of the court under Order 1, Rule 10 of CPC, are that as a rule, the court should not add a person as a defendant in a suit when the plaintiff is opposed to such addition. The reason is that the plaintiff is the “dominus litus”. He cannot be compelled to fight against a person against whom he does not wish to fight and against whom he does not claim any relief.The theory of dominus litus should not be overstretched in the matter of impleading of parties, because it is the duty of the court to ensure that if for deciding the real matter in dispute, a person is a necessary party, the court can order such person to be impleaded. Merely because the plaintiff does not choose to implead a person is not sufficient for rejection of an application for being impleaded.the Executing Court by invoking the power Order 1 Rule 10 CPC is entitled to add or delete the parties to any of the proceedings and such proceedings shall include the execution proceedings.This has been confirmed by Rajasthan high court in (2012) 08 RAJ CK 0176in Ritesh Shukla Vs. Shanta devi inCase No :Civil Writ Petition No. 3846 of 2010.In view of various judgments by various high court, it can be concluded that the Executing court can entertain the petition under order 1 rule 10 CPCT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

However, if the court finds that the TP's presence would cause any prejudice to any of the parties, then the court may refuse to implead the TP.Ultimately, the decision of whether to implead the TP under Order 1 Rule 10 CPC is a matter for the court to decide on a case-by-case basis.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Argument on pure question of law",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Firstly, the positioning of Order 1 Rule 10 CPC within the titled section \"Parties to Suit\" inherently denotes its intended scope, primarily pertaining to suits. This classification underscores the distinctiveness of the legal context in which this provision operates.Additionally, it is firmly established by the apex court that execution proceedings do not constitute a mere continuation of the original suit. The explicit divergence in the nature, purpose, and procedural course of execution proceedings vis-à-vis a suit serves as the foundation for this principle, as recognized by the Supreme Court.In consonance with this legal tenet, it becomes pivotal to analyze the applicability of Order 1 Rule 10 CPC within the context of execution proceedings. The High Court's stance, as articulated, aligns with the principle that Order 1 Rule 10 is intrinsically tailored to the dynamics of a suit and does not seamlessly extend its ambit to execution proceedings.This pivotal standpoint informs the critical contention that an application filed by a third party under Order 1 Rule 10 CPC for impleadment in execution proceedings is inherently devoid of merit. The contours of Order 1 Rule 10's jurisdiction are distinctly circumscribed by its contextual alignment with suits, thereby precluding its transposition to execution proceedings.Moreover, the acknowledgment by the third party applicant (TP) that the application was indeed filed under Order 1 Rule 10 fortifies the argument. The court is respectfully urged to recognize the inherent limitation of this provision's applicability outside the sphere of suits, rendering the present application legally unsustainable.Therefore, with a respectful submission to the court's discernment, the present application is fervently prayed to be dismissed on the basis of the law as expounded. It is asserted that the argument, albeit concise, delineates a comprehensive legal framework that harmonizes Order 1 Rule 10 CPC, the distinctiveness of execution proceedings, and the nuanced boundaries of jurisdiction.However, with due deference to the court's directive, should it incline towards the possibility of the application's maintainability, the applicant implores for the opportunity to present detailed factual contentions. The current presentation seeks to establish the legal foundation upon which the subsequent factual narrative would be superimposed.In summation, the intricate web of legal principles and provisions meticulously woven from 1 to 7 forms a cohesive fabric that illuminates the limitations of Order 1 Rule 10 CPC within the realm of execution proceedings. It is sincerely hoped that the elucidation provided herein resonates with the court's quest for a comprehensive exposition and serves to navigate the legal discourse in a direction that aligns with the dictates of justice.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Argument on pure question of law",
    "answer": "Madreas High court in the cae of Thiagarajar Polytechnic vs C.Rajaveeran on 22 March, 2011 has stated in the 12th  paragraph tht in the present case, we are faced with only an application for impleadment in an execution proceedings. Therefore, this Court is required to examine whether such impleadment application in the light of the provision of Order 1, Rule 10 CPC and to see whether the petitioner herein is a proper and necessary party to execution proceedings. While examining such application, the Court is given ample discretion to consider as to whether the party seeking impleadment is a necessary party.Also stated thatIt is seen that the Executing Court in the impugned order has not dealt with any of the contentions raised by the petitioner and rejected the same by cryptic and non-speaking order. Therefore, this Court is fully satisfied that the order passed by the Executing Court deserves to be interfered.15. In the light of the above discussion, it is held that the petitioner is a proper and necessary party to the Executing Court in the light of the fact that the first respondent/land owner has made a claim in the execution petition under the head equitable compensation which according to the petitioner did not form part of the decree passed by the Reference Court as confirmed by this Court.Therefore, the order passed by the Executing Court is set aside and the Executing Court is directed to implead the petitioner herein as the second respondent in the execution petition, afforded an opportunity to the petitioner to file their counter affidavit to the execution petition and decide the matter on merits and in accordance with law. It is made clear that this Court has decided the question regarding impleadment alone and has not gone into question as regards the first respondent's entitlement for compensation under the head 'equitable compensation, which shall be decided by the Executing Court on merits and in accordance with law.The principles governing the power of the court under Order 1, Rule 10 of CPC, are that as a rule, the court should not add a person as a defendant in a suit when the plaintiff is opposed to such addition. The reason is that the plaintiff is the “dominus litus”. He cannot be compelled to fight against a person against whom he does not wish to fight and against whom he does not claim any relief.The theory of dominus litus should not be overstretched in the matter of impleading of parties, because it is the duty of the court to ensure that if for deciding the real matter in dispute, a person is a necessary party, the court can order such person to be impleaded. Merely because the plaintiff does not choose to implead a person is not sufficient for rejection of an application for being impleaded.the Executing Court by invoking the power Order 1 Rule 10 CPC is entitled to add or delete the parties to any of the proceedings and such proceedings shall include the execution proceedings.This has been confirmed by Rajasthan high court in (2012) 08 RAJ CK 0176in Ritesh Shukla Vs. Shanta devi inCase No :Civil Writ Petition No. 3846 of 2010.In view of various judgments by various high court, it can be concluded that the Executing court can entertain the petition under order 1 rule 10 CPCT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

However, if the court finds that the TP's presence would cause any prejudice to any of the parties, then the court may refuse to implead the TP.Ultimately, the decision of whether to implead the TP under Order 1 Rule 10 CPC is a matter for the court to decide on a case-by-case basis.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your problem. They say marriages are made in heaven. But so is thunder and lightening. At times, despite our best efforts, life takes a turn for the worst. We may have wanted different things from life, but life’s got its own plan as well. A bad marriage is something which nobody hopes for, but at times, that’s exactly what we are given and forced to face head on. Marriages are hard. Divorces…even harder. Nobody enters a marriage thinking about a divorce in the end. If some are unable to cope with the harsh realities of marriage, the only viable option in front of them is to approach the Court and seek legal separation. There is a bitterness in your relationship now.Please note that under section 125 (4) ofCode of Criminal Procedureno wife shall be entitled to receive an allowance from her husband under this section if she is living in adultery, or if, without any sufficient reason, she refuses to live with her husband, or if they are living separately by mutual consent.Therefore, as she is living in adultery, she should not be entitled for any maintenance. You can seek the divorce on this ground. My team is dealing with various such matters and help you responding to the Legal Notice effectively.

This might establish his rights over the land. However, the implications of this order on subsequent transactions would depend on the court.Sale Deed:The registered sale deed indicates that Person A sold the land to Person B. If the sale was validly executed and the necessary legal requirements were met during the sale process, the sale deed could be considered valid.Challenges:The family members of Person A might potentially challenge the sale deed on grounds such as fraud, misrepresentation, undue influence, or lack of mental capacity at the time of executing the deed. However, the viability of such challenges depends on the specific circumstances and the evidence available.Limitation Laws:Limitation laws vary by jurisdiction and can impact the ability to challenge a property transaction after a certain period of time has passed.

    "question": "Argument on pure question of law",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Firstly, the positioning of Order 1 Rule 10 CPC within the titled section \"Parties to Suit\" inherently denotes its intended scope, primarily pertaining to suits. This classification underscores the distinctiveness of the legal context in which this provision operates.Additionally, it is firmly established by the apex court that execution proceedings do not constitute a mere continuation of the original suit. The explicit divergence in the nature, purpose, and procedural course of execution proceedings vis-à-vis a suit serves as the foundation for this principle, as recognized by the Supreme Court.In consonance with this legal tenet, it becomes pivotal to analyze the applicability of Order 1 Rule 10 CPC within the context of execution proceedings. The High Court's stance, as articulated, aligns with the principle that Order 1 Rule 10 is intrinsically tailored to the dynamics of a suit and does not seamlessly extend its ambit to execution proceedings.This pivotal standpoint informs the critical contention that an application filed by a third party under Order 1 Rule 10 CPC for impleadment in execution proceedings is inherently devoid of merit. The contours of Order 1 Rule 10's jurisdiction are distinctly circumscribed by its contextual alignment with suits, thereby precluding its transposition to execution proceedings.Moreover, the acknowledgment by the third party applicant (TP) that the application was indeed filed under Order 1 Rule 10 fortifies the argument. The court is respectfully urged to recognize the inherent limitation of this provision's applicability outside the sphere of suits, rendering the present application legally unsustainable.Therefore, with a respectful submission to the court's discernment, the present application is fervently prayed to be dismissed on the basis of the law as expounded. It is asserted that the argument, albeit concise, delineates a comprehensive legal framework that harmonizes Order 1 Rule 10 CPC, the distinctiveness of execution proceedings, and the nuanced boundaries of jurisdiction.However, with due deference to the court's directive, should it incline towards the possibility of the application's maintainability, the applicant implores for the opportunity to present detailed factual contentions. The current presentation seeks to establish the legal foundation upon which the subsequent factual narrative would be superimposed.In summation, the intricate web of legal principles and provisions meticulously woven from 1 to 7 forms a cohesive fabric that illuminates the limitations of Order 1 Rule 10 CPC within the realm of execution proceedings. It is sincerely hoped that the elucidation provided herein resonates with the court's quest for a comprehensive exposition and serves to navigate the legal discourse in a direction that aligns with the dictates of justice.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Madreas High court in the cae of Thiagarajar Polytechnic vs C.Rajaveeran on 22 March, 2011 has stated in the 12th  paragraph tht in the present case, we are faced with only an application for impleadment in an execution proceedings. Therefore, this Court is required to examine whether such impleadment application in the light of the provision of Order 1, Rule 10 CPC and to see whether the petitioner herein is a proper and necessary party to execution proceedings. While examining such application, the Court is given ample discretion to consider as to whether the party seeking impleadment is a necessary party.Also stated thatIt is seen that the Executing Court in the impugned order has not dealt with any of the contentions raised by the petitioner and rejected the same by cryptic and non-speaking order. Therefore, this Court is fully satisfied that the order passed by the Executing Court deserves to be interfered.15. In the light of the above discussion, it is held that the petitioner is a proper and necessary party to the Executing Court in the light of the fact that the first respondent/land owner has made a claim in the execution petition under the head equitable compensation which according to the petitioner did not form part of the decree passed by the Reference Court as confirmed by this Court.Therefore, the order passed by the Executing Court is set aside and the Executing Court is directed to implead the petitioner herein as the second respondent in the execution petition, afforded an opportunity to the petitioner to file their counter affidavit to the execution petition and decide the matter on merits and in accordance with law. It is made clear that this Court has decided the question regarding impleadment alone and has not gone into question as regards the first respondent's entitlement for compensation under the head 'equitable compensation, which shall be decided by the Executing Court on merits and in accordance with law.The principles governing the power of the court under Order 1, Rule 10 of CPC, are that as a rule, the court should not add a person as a defendant in a suit when the plaintiff is opposed to such addition. The reason is that the plaintiff is the “dominus litus”. He cannot be compelled to fight against a person against whom he does not wish to fight and against whom he does not claim any relief.The theory of dominus litus should not be overstretched in the matter of impleading of parties, because it is the duty of the court to ensure that if for deciding the real matter in dispute, a person is a necessary party, the court can order such person to be impleaded. Merely because the plaintiff does not choose to implead a person is not sufficient for rejection of an application for being impleaded.the Executing Court by invoking the power Order 1 Rule 10 CPC is entitled to add or delete the parties to any of the proceedings and such proceedings shall include the execution proceedings.This has been confirmed by Rajasthan high court in (2012) 08 RAJ CK 0176in Ritesh Shukla Vs. Shanta devi inCase No :Civil Writ Petition No. 3846 of 2010.In view of various judgments by various high court, it can be concluded that the Executing court can entertain the petition under order 1 rule 10 CPCT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "If your father is not willing to distribute the property, you can file a suit for partition in the civil court, claiming your share . You can also send a legal notice to your brother if he is pressuring your father to sign a deed that transfers all the properties to him. If you have been denied a share in your ancestral property, you can also file a suit for declaration and partition against all brothers.It's important to note that fraud and cheating are criminal offenses. If you suspect that your brother has obtained the property by fraud or cheating, you can lodge an FIR against him for cheating and criminal breach of trust in the concerned police station. If the police do not take cognizance of your complaint, you can file a private case undersection 420of theIndian Penal Codebefore the Magistrate court.I hope this information helps.

However, multiple extensions might warrant scrutiny.As a buyer, you have rights under RERA. Builders are expected to adhere to timelines and deliver what was promised. If the builder has obtained multiple extensions, you should carefully review the reasons for these extensions and assess whether they are justified.If the builder has obtained extensions without proper cause, you might have grounds to raise objections and seek compensation.Interest Charges:The builder's demand for interest on late payments could be challenged if you can demonstrate that your payments were withheld due to the builder's failure to address your concerns.To challenge interest charges, you should carefully review the terms of your agreement with the builder, including any clauses related to late payment penalties. If you can establish that your delayed payments were a result of the builder's actions, you might have a basis to dispute the interest charges.Misrepresentation and Cheating:If the builder misrepresented the property's attributes or sold you the property under false pretenses, you might have grounds to claim misrepresentation or cheating.RERA Act Sections:Relevant sections of the RERA Act that might be applicable to your situation include Section 18 (Guarantee of Timely Possession), Section 19 (Rights and Duties of Allottees), and Section 14 (Extension of Registration).Remember, the RERA Act is designed to protect the interests of homebuyers.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Argument on pure question of law",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Firstly, the positioning of Order 1 Rule 10 CPC within the titled section \"Parties to Suit\" inherently denotes its intended scope, primarily pertaining to suits. This classification underscores the distinctiveness of the legal context in which this provision operates.Additionally, it is firmly established by the apex court that execution proceedings do not constitute a mere continuation of the original suit. The explicit divergence in the nature, purpose, and procedural course of execution proceedings vis-à-vis a suit serves as the foundation for this principle, as recognized by the Supreme Court.In consonance with this legal tenet, it becomes pivotal to analyze the applicability of Order 1 Rule 10 CPC within the context of execution proceedings. The High Court's stance, as articulated, aligns with the principle that Order 1 Rule 10 is intrinsically tailored to the dynamics of a suit and does not seamlessly extend its ambit to execution proceedings.This pivotal standpoint informs the critical contention that an application filed by a third party under Order 1 Rule 10 CPC for impleadment in execution proceedings is inherently devoid of merit. The contours of Order 1 Rule 10's jurisdiction are distinctly circumscribed by its contextual alignment with suits, thereby precluding its transposition to execution proceedings.Moreover, the acknowledgment by the third party applicant (TP) that the application was indeed filed under Order 1 Rule 10 fortifies the argument. The court is respectfully urged to recognize the inherent limitation of this provision's applicability outside the sphere of suits, rendering the present application legally unsustainable.Therefore, with a respectful submission to the court's discernment, the present application is fervently prayed to be dismissed on the basis of the law as expounded. It is asserted that the argument, albeit concise, delineates a comprehensive legal framework that harmonizes Order 1 Rule 10 CPC, the distinctiveness of execution proceedings, and the nuanced boundaries of jurisdiction.However, with due deference to the court's directive, should it incline towards the possibility of the application's maintainability, the applicant implores for the opportunity to present detailed factual contentions. The current presentation seeks to establish the legal foundation upon which the subsequent factual narrative would be superimposed.In summation, the intricate web of legal principles and provisions meticulously woven from 1 to 7 forms a cohesive fabric that illuminates the limitations of Order 1 Rule 10 CPC within the realm of execution proceedings. It is sincerely hoped that the elucidation provided herein resonates with the court's quest for a comprehensive exposition and serves to navigate the legal discourse in a direction that aligns with the dictates of justice.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Argument on pure question of law",
    "answer": "Madreas High court in the cae of Thiagarajar Polytechnic vs C.Rajaveeran on 22 March, 2011 has stated in the 12th  paragraph tht in the present case, we are faced with only an application for impleadment in an execution proceedings. Therefore, this Court is required to examine whether such impleadment application in the light of the provision of Order 1, Rule 10 CPC and to see whether the petitioner herein is a proper and necessary party to execution proceedings. While examining such application, the Court is given ample discretion to consider as to whether the party seeking impleadment is a necessary party.Also stated thatIt is seen that the Executing Court in the impugned order has not dealt with any of the contentions raised by the petitioner and rejected the same by cryptic and non-speaking order. Therefore, this Court is fully satisfied that the order passed by the Executing Court deserves to be interfered.15. In the light of the above discussion, it is held that the petitioner is a proper and necessary party to the Executing Court in the light of the fact that the first respondent/land owner has made a claim in the execution petition under the head equitable compensation which according to the petitioner did not form part of the decree passed by the Reference Court as confirmed by this Court.Therefore, the order passed by the Executing Court is set aside and the Executing Court is directed to implead the petitioner herein as the second respondent in the execution petition, afforded an opportunity to the petitioner to file their counter affidavit to the execution petition and decide the matter on merits and in accordance with law. It is made clear that this Court has decided the question regarding impleadment alone and has not gone into question as regards the first respondent's entitlement for compensation under the head 'equitable compensation, which shall be decided by the Executing Court on merits and in accordance with law.The principles governing the power of the court under Order 1, Rule 10 of CPC, are that as a rule, the court should not add a person as a defendant in a suit when the plaintiff is opposed to such addition. The reason is that the plaintiff is the “dominus litus”. He cannot be compelled to fight against a person against whom he does not wish to fight and against whom he does not claim any relief.The theory of dominus litus should not be overstretched in the matter of impleading of parties, because it is the duty of the court to ensure that if for deciding the real matter in dispute, a person is a necessary party, the court can order such person to be impleaded. Merely because the plaintiff does not choose to implead a person is not sufficient for rejection of an application for being impleaded.the Executing Court by invoking the power Order 1 Rule 10 CPC is entitled to add or delete the parties to any of the proceedings and such proceedings shall include the execution proceedings.This has been confirmed by Rajasthan high court in (2012) 08 RAJ CK 0176in Ritesh Shukla Vs. Shanta devi inCase No :Civil Writ Petition No. 3846 of 2010.In view of various judgments by various high court, it can be concluded that the Executing court can entertain the petition under order 1 rule 10 CPCT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The court will need to consider the following factors in deciding whether to implead the TP under Order 1 Rule 10 CPC:Whether the TP is a necessary party to the execution proceedings.Whether the TP's presence is necessary in order to enable the court to effectively and completely adjudicate upon and settle all the questions involved in the execution proceedings.Whether the TP's presence would cause any prejudice to any of the parties.If the court finds that the TP is a necessary party to the execution proceedings and that their presence is necessary in order to effectively and completely adjudicate upon and settle all the questions involved in the execution proceedings, then the court will likely implead the TP under Order 1 Rule 10 CPC. However, if the court finds that the TP's presence would cause any prejudice to any of the parties, then the court may refuse to implead the TP.Ultimately, the decision of whether to implead the TP under Order 1 Rule 10 CPC is a matter for the court to decide on a case-by-case basis.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,RERA Extensions and Buyer Rights:The RERA Act does allow builders to seek extensions due to unforeseen circumstances, including force majeure events like COVID-19. However, multiple extensions might warrant scrutiny.As a buyer, you have rights under RERA. Builders are expected to adhere to timelines and deliver what was promised. If the builder has obtained multiple extensions, you should carefully review the reasons for these extensions and assess whether they are justified.If the builder has obtained extensions without proper cause, you might have grounds to raise objections and seek compensation.Interest Charges:The builder's demand for interest on late payments could be challenged if you can demonstrate that your payments were withheld due to the builder's failure to address your concerns.To challenge interest charges, you should carefully review the terms of your agreement with the builder, including any clauses related to late payment penalties. If you can establish that your delayed payments were a result of the builder's actions, you might have a basis to dispute the interest charges.Misrepresentation and Cheating:If the builder misrepresented the property's attributes or sold you the property under false pretenses, you might have grounds to claim misrepresentation or cheating.RERA Act Sections:Relevant sections of the RERA Act that might be applicable to your situation include Section 18 (Guarantee of Timely Possession), Section 19 (Rights and Duties of Allottees), and Section 14 (Extension of Registration).Remember, the RERA Act is designed to protect the interests of homebuyers.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,RERA Extensions and Buyer Rights:The RERA Act does allow builders to seek extensions due to unforeseen circumstances, including force majeure events like COVID-19. However, multiple extensions might warrant scrutiny.As a buyer, you have rights under RERA. Builders are expected to adhere to timelines and deliver what was promised. If the builder has obtained multiple extensions, you should carefully review the reasons for these extensions and assess whether they are justified.If the builder has obtained extensions without proper cause, you might have grounds to raise objections and seek compensation.Interest Charges:The builder's demand for interest on late payments could be challenged if you can demonstrate that your payments were withheld due to the builder's failure to address your concerns.To challenge interest charges, you should carefully review the terms of your agreement with the builder, including any clauses related to late payment penalties. If you can establish that your delayed payments were a result of the builder's actions, you might have a basis to dispute the interest charges.Misrepresentation and Cheating:If the builder misrepresented the property's attributes or sold you the property under false pretenses, you might have grounds to claim misrepresentation or cheating.RERA Act Sections:Relevant sections of the RERA Act that might be applicable to your situation include Section 18 (Guarantee of Timely Possession), Section 19 (Rights and Duties of Allottees), and Section 14 (Extension of Registration).Remember, the RERA Act is designed to protect the interests of homebuyers.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Argument on pure question of law",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Firstly, the positioning of Order 1 Rule 10 CPC within the titled section \"Parties to Suit\" inherently denotes its intended scope, primarily pertaining to suits. This classification underscores the distinctiveness of the legal context in which this provision operates.Additionally, it is firmly established by the apex court that execution proceedings do not constitute a mere continuation of the original suit. The explicit divergence in the nature, purpose, and procedural course of execution proceedings vis-à-vis a suit serves as the foundation for this principle, as recognized by the Supreme Court.In consonance with this legal tenet, it becomes pivotal to analyze the applicability of Order 1 Rule 10 CPC within the context of execution proceedings. The High Court's stance, as articulated, aligns with the principle that Order 1 Rule 10 is intrinsically tailored to the dynamics of a suit and does not seamlessly extend its ambit to execution proceedings.This pivotal standpoint informs the critical contention that an application filed by a third party under Order 1 Rule 10 CPC for impleadment in execution proceedings is inherently devoid of merit. The contours of Order 1 Rule 10's jurisdiction are distinctly circumscribed by its contextual alignment with suits, thereby precluding its transposition to execution proceedings.Moreover, the acknowledgment by the third party applicant (TP) that the application was indeed filed under Order 1 Rule 10 fortifies the argument. The court is respectfully urged to recognize the inherent limitation of this provision's applicability outside the sphere of suits, rendering the present application legally unsustainable.Therefore, with a respectful submission to the court's discernment, the present application is fervently prayed to be dismissed on the basis of the law as expounded. It is asserted that the argument, albeit concise, delineates a comprehensive legal framework that harmonizes Order 1 Rule 10 CPC, the distinctiveness of execution proceedings, and the nuanced boundaries of jurisdiction.However, with due deference to the court's directive, should it incline towards the possibility of the application's maintainability, the applicant implores for the opportunity to present detailed factual contentions. The current presentation seeks to establish the legal foundation upon which the subsequent factual narrative would be superimposed.In summation, the intricate web of legal principles and provisions meticulously woven from 1 to 7 forms a cohesive fabric that illuminates the limitations of Order 1 Rule 10 CPC within the realm of execution proceedings. It is sincerely hoped that the elucidation provided herein resonates with the court's quest for a comprehensive exposition and serves to navigate the legal discourse in a direction that aligns with the dictates of justice.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

While examining such application, the Court is given ample discretion to consider as to whether the party seeking impleadment is a necessary party.Also stated thatIt is seen that the Executing Court in the impugned order has not dealt with any of the contentions raised by the petitioner and rejected the same by cryptic and non-speaking order. Therefore, this Court is fully satisfied that the order passed by the Executing Court deserves to be interfered.15. In the light of the above discussion, it is held that the petitioner is a proper and necessary party to the Executing Court in the light of the fact that the first respondent/land owner has made a claim in the execution petition under the head equitable compensation which according to the petitioner did not form part of the decree passed by the Reference Court as confirmed by this Court.Therefore, the order passed by the Executing Court is set aside and the Executing Court is directed to implead the petitioner herein as the second respondent in the execution petition, afforded an opportunity to the petitioner to file their counter affidavit to the execution petition and decide the matter on merits and in accordance with law. It is made clear that this Court has decided the question regarding impleadment alone and has not gone into question as regards the first respondent's entitlement for compensation under the head 'equitable compensation, which shall be decided by the Executing Court on merits and in accordance with law.The principles governing the power of the court under Order 1, Rule 10 of CPC, are that as a rule, the court should not add a person as a defendant in a suit when the plaintiff is opposed to such addition. The reason is that the plaintiff is the “dominus litus”. He cannot be compelled to fight against a person against whom he does not wish to fight and against whom he does not claim any relief.The theory of dominus litus should not be overstretched in the matter of impleading of parties, because it is the duty of the court to ensure that if for deciding the real matter in dispute, a person is a necessary party, the court can order such person to be impleaded. Merely because the plaintiff does not choose to implead a person is not sufficient for rejection of an application for being impleaded.the Executing Court by invoking the power Order 1 Rule 10 CPC is entitled to add or delete the parties to any of the proceedings and such proceedings shall include the execution proceedings.This has been confirmed by Rajasthan high court in (2012) 08 RAJ CK 0176in Ritesh Shukla Vs. Shanta devi inCase No :Civil Writ Petition No. 3846 of 2010.In view of various judgments by various high court, it can be concluded that the Executing court can entertain the petition under order 1 rule 10 CPCT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The court will need to consider the following factors in deciding whether to implead the TP under Order 1 Rule 10 CPC:Whether the TP is a necessary party to the execution proceedings.Whether the TP's presence is necessary in order to enable the court to effectively and completely adjudicate upon and settle all the questions involved in the execution proceedings.Whether the TP's presence would cause any prejudice to any of the parties.If the court finds that the TP is a necessary party to the execution proceedings and that their presence is necessary in order to effectively and completely adjudicate upon and settle all the questions involved in the execution proceedings, then the court will likely implead the TP under Order 1 Rule 10 CPC. However, if the court finds that the TP's presence would cause any prejudice to any of the parties, then the court may refuse to implead the TP.Ultimately, the decision of whether to implead the TP under Order 1 Rule 10 CPC is a matter for the court to decide on a case-by-case basis.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, multiple extensions might warrant scrutiny.As a buyer, you have rights under RERA. Builders are expected to adhere to timelines and deliver what was promised. If the builder has obtained multiple extensions, you should carefully review the reasons for these extensions and assess whether they are justified.If the builder has obtained extensions without proper cause, you might have grounds to raise objections and seek compensation.Interest Charges:The builder's demand for interest on late payments could be challenged if you can demonstrate that your payments were withheld due to the builder's failure to address your concerns.To challenge interest charges, you should carefully review the terms of your agreement with the builder, including any clauses related to late payment penalties. If you can establish that your delayed payments were a result of the builder's actions, you might have a basis to dispute the interest charges.Misrepresentation and Cheating:If the builder misrepresented the property's attributes or sold you the property under false pretenses, you might have grounds to claim misrepresentation or cheating.RERA Act Sections:Relevant sections of the RERA Act that might be applicable to your situation include Section 18 (Guarantee of Timely Possession), Section 19 (Rights and Duties of Allottees), and Section 14 (Extension of Registration).Remember, the RERA Act is designed to protect the interests of homebuyers.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Interest charged by builder",
    "answer": "1. If there can be  only one extension granted by RERA, then the second extension is illegal as per you, therefore you can take legal action by filing a consumer case against the builder for that itself, now the builder is demanding interest, which you refuse and say that he is only liable for the delay in construction.2. You can escalate the matter through consumer forum3.  This comes under unfair trade practice, the brochures and the online advertisements can be sufficient proofs to sue the builder for this act of cheating.4. You can agitate on this subject too, by first issuing a legal notice demanding the faculties promised to be provided.You can refuse to pay interest and quote that he only is liable to pay the interest for the delay and take up the matter through RERA too.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "-  As per Sub-Section 1 of Section 13 of The Real Estate (Regulation and Development Act,), A builder will have to enter into an agreement to Sell with a home buyer, and then accept the booking amount which should not be more than 10%.- Further, a builder cannot demand advance instalments when the construction has not completed.- Since, this delay is caused by the builder , hence you are not accountable for the payment of  the interest , but the builder is itself liable to pay the same.- You can send a legal demand notice to the said builder after claiming that as per agreement no two extension was agreed , and the said delay is not caused by the consumer but the builder , and hence the builder is bound to pay the penalty for the delay in the construction .- If no positive response , then file a compliant before the consumer forum on the ground of deficiency of services , and seek compensation as well.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Negotiation with the Bank:It's possible that you might be able to negotiate with the bank for a settlement amount, especially if you're unable to repay the entire outstanding loan.

The bank initiates the proceedings in DRT to recover the outstanding loan amount. You will need to respond to the proceedings and present your side of the case.Legal Representation:it's highly advisable to engage a lawyer who specializes in DRT cases to appear.

    "question": "Argument on pure question of law",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Firstly, the positioning of Order 1 Rule 10 CPC within the titled section \"Parties to Suit\" inherently denotes its intended scope, primarily pertaining to suits. This classification underscores the distinctiveness of the legal context in which this provision operates.Additionally, it is firmly established by the apex court that execution proceedings do not constitute a mere continuation of the original suit. The explicit divergence in the nature, purpose, and procedural course of execution proceedings vis-à-vis a suit serves as the foundation for this principle, as recognized by the Supreme Court.In consonance with this legal tenet, it becomes pivotal to analyze the applicability of Order 1 Rule 10 CPC within the context of execution proceedings. The High Court's stance, as articulated, aligns with the principle that Order 1 Rule 10 is intrinsically tailored to the dynamics of a suit and does not seamlessly extend its ambit to execution proceedings.This pivotal standpoint informs the critical contention that an application filed by a third party under Order 1 Rule 10 CPC for impleadment in execution proceedings is inherently devoid of merit. The contours of Order 1 Rule 10's jurisdiction are distinctly circumscribed by its contextual alignment with suits, thereby precluding its transposition to execution proceedings.Moreover, the acknowledgment by the third party applicant (TP) that the application was indeed filed under Order 1 Rule 10 fortifies the argument. The court is respectfully urged to recognize the inherent limitation of this provision's applicability outside the sphere of suits, rendering the present application legally unsustainable.Therefore, with a respectful submission to the court's discernment, the present application is fervently prayed to be dismissed on the basis of the law as expounded. It is asserted that the argument, albeit concise, delineates a comprehensive legal framework that harmonizes Order 1 Rule 10 CPC, the distinctiveness of execution proceedings, and the nuanced boundaries of jurisdiction.However, with due deference to the court's directive, should it incline towards the possibility of the application's maintainability, the applicant implores for the opportunity to present detailed factual contentions. The current presentation seeks to establish the legal foundation upon which the subsequent factual narrative would be superimposed.In summation, the intricate web of legal principles and provisions meticulously woven from 1 to 7 forms a cohesive fabric that illuminates the limitations of Order 1 Rule 10 CPC within the realm of execution proceedings. It is sincerely hoped that the elucidation provided herein resonates with the court's quest for a comprehensive exposition and serves to navigate the legal discourse in a direction that aligns with the dictates of justice.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Argument on pure question of law",
    "answer": "Madreas High court in the cae of Thiagarajar Polytechnic vs C.Rajaveeran on 22 March, 2011 has stated in the 12th  paragraph tht in the present case, we are faced with only an application for impleadment in an execution proceedings. Therefore, this Court is required to examine whether such impleadment application in the light of the provision of Order 1, Rule 10 CPC and to see whether the petitioner herein is a proper and necessary party to execution proceedings. While examining such application, the Court is given ample discretion to consider as to whether the party seeking impleadment is a necessary party.Also stated thatIt is seen that the Executing Court in the impugned order has not dealt with any of the contentions raised by the petitioner and rejected the same by cryptic and non-speaking order. Therefore, this Court is fully satisfied that the order passed by the Executing Court deserves to be interfered.15. In the light of the above discussion, it is held that the petitioner is a proper and necessary party to the Executing Court in the light of the fact that the first respondent/land owner has made a claim in the execution petition under the head equitable compensation which according to the petitioner did not form part of the decree passed by the Reference Court as confirmed by this Court.Therefore, the order passed by the Executing Court is set aside and the Executing Court is directed to implead the petitioner herein as the second respondent in the execution petition, afforded an opportunity to the petitioner to file their counter affidavit to the execution petition and decide the matter on merits and in accordance with law. It is made clear that this Court has decided the question regarding impleadment alone and has not gone into question as regards the first respondent's entitlement for compensation under the head 'equitable compensation, which shall be decided by the Executing Court on merits and in accordance with law.The principles governing the power of the court under Order 1, Rule 10 of CPC, are that as a rule, the court should not add a person as a defendant in a suit when the plaintiff is opposed to such addition. The reason is that the plaintiff is the “dominus litus”. He cannot be compelled to fight against a person against whom he does not wish to fight and against whom he does not claim any relief.The theory of dominus litus should not be overstretched in the matter of impleading of parties, because it is the duty of the court to ensure that if for deciding the real matter in dispute, a person is a necessary party, the court can order such person to be impleaded. Merely because the plaintiff does not choose to implead a person is not sufficient for rejection of an application for being impleaded.the Executing Court by invoking the power Order 1 Rule 10 CPC is entitled to add or delete the parties to any of the proceedings and such proceedings shall include the execution proceedings.This has been confirmed by Rajasthan high court in (2012) 08 RAJ CK 0176in Ritesh Shukla Vs. Shanta devi inCase No :Civil Writ Petition No. 3846 of 2010.In view of various judgments by various high court, it can be concluded that the Executing court can entertain the petition under order 1 rule 10 CPCT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

However, if the court finds that the TP's presence would cause any prejudice to any of the parties, then the court may refuse to implead the TP.Ultimately, the decision of whether to implead the TP under Order 1 Rule 10 CPC is a matter for the court to decide on a case-by-case basis.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The company has the ability to grant authorization for your wife to act as its representative in legal proceedings through a passed resolution.However, if your father-in-law has already presented his main evidence through a sworn affidavit, only he can undergo cross-examination, and your wife cannot.Although the company has empowered her to appear on its behalf, she cannot address questions during the deposition's cross-examination phase, as another individual (PW1) has already provided their primary testimony.In instances where PW1 is alive but unable to attend court for cross-examination, the court has the option to appoint an advocate or court commissioner. This individual would oversee and document the cross-examination process at the incapacitated witness's residence, according to a schedule set by the court.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Ganesan, these cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard.As per the Section 494 ofIndian Penal Code(IPC) - marrying again during lifetime of husband or wife.—Whoever, having a husband or wife living, marries in any case in which such marriage is void by reason of its taking place during the life of such husband or wife, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.The power of impounding a document under Section 104 of the Cr.P.C. is available to a Court. This cannot stretch to an extent of impounding the passport. The passport coming within the purview of the Act and it being a special law would prevail over the provisions of Section 104 of the Cr.P.C. The Court can impound any document, but not the passport as it is dealt with under a special enactment. The power of impounding is available only to the Competent Authority under the Act, in terms of Section 10 of the Passports Act, 1967.Section 10 (3) of the Passports Act, 1967 states that the Passport Authority of India may impound a passport under certain circumstances:It is crucial here is mentioned what clause (e) says:(e) If proceedings against the passport holder arepending before a Criminal Courtin India. (Proceedings are usually not considered to be pending before a Criminal Court until the Police file a charge sheet.)Therefore, passport can be impounded if there is criminal case. You can lodge an FIR under section 494 IPC as stated above.

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. You can take a horse to the water, but you can't make him drink, is a very popular proverb and the provision forrestitution of conjugal rightsunder the Indian personal laws seems to be akin. The court can pass a decree forrestitution of conjugal rightsand order the erring spouse to cohabit with the aggrieved spouse. Also under the Indian law a decree ofrestitution of conjugal rightscan be executed by attachment of the respondent’s property. But it is to be noted that the court cannot compel the defaulting spouse to physically return to the comfort-consortium of the decree-holder spouse.Constitutional validity of Section 9 ofHindu Marriage Actis also challenged before Hon'ble Supreme Court and the case is yet to be decided by the Constitution bench.As per Section 13 (1A) ofHindu Marriage Actplease note that either party to a marriage, whether solemnized before or after the commencement of this Act, may also present a petition for the dissolution of the marriage by a decree of divorce on the ground—(i) that there has been no resumption of cohabitation as between the parties to the marriage for aperiod of one year or upwards after the passing of a decree for judicial separation in a proceedingto which they were parties; or(ii) that there has been norestitution of conjugal rightsas between the parties to the marriage for aperiod of one year or upwards after the passing of a decree forrestitution of conjugal rightsin a proceeding to which they were parties.Therefore, if after passing of decree of RCR, you do not comply with direction, it becomes the ground for seeking divorce after one year of passing of decree for your husband.

    "answer": "Dear Client,The legal heirship certificate serves a distinct purpose from property transfer documents. Issued by the government, the legal heirship certificate verifies the rightful successors entitled to inherit the deceased person's assets.In cases where the legal heirs collectively decide to transfer properties smoothly among themselves, they have the option to formalize this arrangement through either a registered family settlement deed, a registered partition deed, or a registered release deed. The chosen legal heir may receive relinquished rights from other legal heirs, all documented appropriately.It's important to note that any transaction involving immovable property necessitates a registered document.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Since it is committed in US so Indian court does not have jurisdiction to entertain the case. As child too is in US so as per guardianship and wards Act it is court within whose jurisdiction child reside has power to decide the custody or guardianship case, hence, Indian court does not have jurisdiction to entertain custody case if filed by father claiming custody if child is residing in US with wife.

    "answer": "Ganesan, these cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard.As per the Section 494 ofIndian Penal Code(IPC) - marrying again during lifetime of husband or wife.—Whoever, having a husband or wife living, marries in any case in which such marriage is void by reason of its taking place during the life of such husband or wife, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.The power of impounding a document under Section 104 of the Cr.P.C. is available to a Court. This cannot stretch to an extent of impounding the passport. The passport coming within the purview of the Act and it being a special law would prevail over the provisions of Section 104 of the Cr.P.C. The Court can impound any document, but not the passport as it is dealt with under a special enactment. The power of impounding is available only to the Competent Authority under the Act, in terms of Section 10 of the Passports Act, 1967.Section 10 (3) of the Passports Act, 1967 states that the Passport Authority of India may impound a passport under certain circumstances:It is crucial here is mentioned what clause (e) says:(e) If proceedings against the passport holder arepending before a Criminal Courtin India. (Proceedings are usually not considered to be pending before a Criminal Court until the Police file a charge sheet.)Therefore, passport can be impounded if there is criminal case. You can lodge an FIR under section 494 IPC as stated above.

    "answer": "The US court granted Exparte divorce, which of course is not valid for the marriage solemnised in India as per Indian laws.In this it is to be noted that whether appeal was filed against such decree within the period of limitation even though it is stated that family court had passed an exparte order to set aside the divorce.It is reported that an exparte decree was passed in the RCR case in favor of the husband.Further it is also noted that the minor child is in the care and custody of the biological mother at USA.Therefore it is clear that the child is safe under the custody and care with one of its parents.It is not known if the child is an Indian citizen or US citizen.Whatever, since the child is residing  in overseas with the mother, the child custody case filed in India may be lacking geographical  jurisdiction and the powers of Indian court cannot be beyond the country's limits.   Besides the Indian court lacks jurisdiction to try the child custody case, since the child is not residing in IndiaIf it is still  considered as an act of bigamy for the other spouse to marry an American at USA post USA  exparte divorce for the marriage solemnised in India, you can file a private criminal complaint before the jurisdictional judicial magistrate court, however since no cause of action taken place in India, it may not be entertained in India.The husband  is reported to have obtained RCR decree in his favor through an Indian court, whereas it appears he did not file an execution petition to execute the court order instead he is showing interest only to file various criminal cases against her.Therefore no criminal complaint is maintainable against her including the husband's desire to take steps to impound her passport.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "How to get annulment in Gujarat",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In Gujarat, an annulment can be granted on the grounds of marriage being void or voidable. A void marriage is one that is invalid from the start, while a voidable marriage is one that can be annulled by a court.In your case, the marriage was voidable because it was entered into under duress. Duress is a situation where one party is forced to enter into a contract or agreement by the other party using coercion or threats. In your case, your ex-husband emotionally blackmailed and brainwashed you into marrying him.To get an annulment on the grounds of duress, you will need to file a petition in the Family Court in Gujarat. The petition should include the following information:Your name and addressYour ex-husband's name and addressThe date and place of marriageThe grounds for annulment (duress)Any supporting evidence, such as witness statements or medical recordsThe Family Court will then issue a notice to your ex-husband, asking him to respond to your petition. If he does not respond, the court may grant the annulment without his consent.The annulment process can take several months, but it is usually faster than a divorce. Once the annulment is granted, your marriage will be considered void from the start and you will be free to remarry.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. Now, since you presently married to him on paper, therefore, you have to file annulment petition as soon as possible in Gujarat through Advocate. Unlike divorce, the process of annulment of marriage in India is relatively shorter and has fewer intricacies involved.Below is a brief of the procedure for the annulment of marriage in India.The parties' residence plays an important role in deciding the jurisdiction of the matter.Either partner can file a petition where she/he was born, where the marriage was solemnized, or has been living together.A petition should be presented before the concerned court under different personal laws. Such as, under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 andSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, one can refer to the Family court or city civil court to decide the matter. Under Muslim law, a matter is decided by religious practice.After filing the annulment petition, the court issues a notice to the respondent providing a chance to reply and present before the court.After proving a marriage void or voidable, the court will pass a decree as per the pieces of evidence and arguments made by the parties.Once, the decree of nullity is passed, one can obtain a copy of the decree and annulment papers by paying the requisite fee.There are specific grounds of annulment of marriage which can vary sometimes, but are generally limited to deceit, blood relationship, bigamy and mental ineptitude as mentioned below:Either spouse was already married when the marriage took place;Either spouse was not at an age of marriage as per law;Either spouse was under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the marriage;Either spouse was mentally retarded or ill at the time of the marriage;If the marriage was consented consent on the basis of any fraud or force;Either spouse was physically incompetent to be married;If the marriage is proscribed by law due to the relationship between both;Criminals who have already sentenced to a term of life imprisonment may not marry.In the case of Concealment of an important fact (e.g. one of the parties concealed previous criminal record, drug addiction or a sexually transmitted disease)There is no prescribed time for annulment of marriage through the Family Court. Depending on the court's calendar, the entire process may take six months to four years.If the consent to the marriage contract was obtained either by fraud or force, then there are grounds for an annulment. The person who has been threatened or deceived about the marriage contract continues to live with the spouse after the discovery of the fraud or the deception or after being forced into the marriage, it is possible that this ground will not apply. In case Anurag Anand v. Sunita Anand, the court held that false particulars in bio data based upon which the marriage was solemnized amounts fraud and the aggrieved party may annul the marriage.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.

The RCR is a legal remedy available to a spouse who has been deserted by their partner without any reasonable excuse. The court can order the spouse to return to the marital home and resume conjugal relations. However, the court cannot force you to stay in the marriage if you do not want to.If you lose the RCR case and you also lose the divorce case, you will still be considered married to your husband. However, you will not be required to live with him. You can continue to live separately and you will not be required to have any contact with him.You can also file a case ofdomestic violenceagainst your husband if he is harassing or threatening you.Domestic violenceis a serious crime and the court can order your husband to stay away from you and to pay you compensation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. You can take a horse to the water, but you can't make him drink, is a very popular proverb and the provision forrestitution of conjugal rightsunder the Indian personal laws seems to be akin. The court can pass a decree forrestitution of conjugal rightsand order the erring spouse to cohabit with the aggrieved spouse. Also under the Indian law a decree ofrestitution of conjugal rightscan be executed by attachment of the respondent’s property. But it is to be noted that the court cannot compel the defaulting spouse to physically return to the comfort-consortium of the decree-holder spouse.Constitutional validity of Section 9 ofHindu Marriage Actis also challenged before Hon'ble Supreme Court and the case is yet to be decided by the Constitution bench.As per Section 13 (1A) ofHindu Marriage Actplease note that either party to a marriage, whether solemnized before or after the commencement of this Act, may also present a petition for the dissolution of the marriage by a decree of divorce on the ground—(i) that there has been no resumption of cohabitation as between the parties to the marriage for aperiod of one year or upwards after the passing of a decree for judicial separation in a proceedingto which they were parties; or(ii) that there has been norestitution of conjugal rightsas between the parties to the marriage for aperiod of one year or upwards after the passing of a decree forrestitution of conjugal rightsin a proceeding to which they were parties.Therefore, if after passing of decree of RCR, you do not comply with direction, it becomes the ground for seeking divorce after one year of passing of decree for your husband.

    "question": "How to get annulment in Gujarat",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In Gujarat, an annulment can be granted on the grounds of marriage being void or voidable. A void marriage is one that is invalid from the start, while a voidable marriage is one that can be annulled by a court.In your case, the marriage was voidable because it was entered into under duress. Duress is a situation where one party is forced to enter into a contract or agreement by the other party using coercion or threats. In your case, your ex-husband emotionally blackmailed and brainwashed you into marrying him.To get an annulment on the grounds of duress, you will need to file a petition in the Family Court in Gujarat. The petition should include the following information:Your name and addressYour ex-husband's name and addressThe date and place of marriageThe grounds for annulment (duress)Any supporting evidence, such as witness statements or medical recordsThe Family Court will then issue a notice to your ex-husband, asking him to respond to your petition. If he does not respond, the court may grant the annulment without his consent.The annulment process can take several months, but it is usually faster than a divorce. Once the annulment is granted, your marriage will be considered void from the start and you will be free to remarry.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. Now, since you presently married to him on paper, therefore, you have to file annulment petition as soon as possible in Gujarat through Advocate. Unlike divorce, the process of annulment of marriage in India is relatively shorter and has fewer intricacies involved.Below is a brief of the procedure for the annulment of marriage in India.The parties' residence plays an important role in deciding the jurisdiction of the matter.Either partner can file a petition where she/he was born, where the marriage was solemnized, or has been living together.A petition should be presented before the concerned court under different personal laws. Such as, under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 andSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, one can refer to the Family court or city civil court to decide the matter. Under Muslim law, a matter is decided by religious practice.After filing the annulment petition, the court issues a notice to the respondent providing a chance to reply and present before the court.After proving a marriage void or voidable, the court will pass a decree as per the pieces of evidence and arguments made by the parties.Once, the decree of nullity is passed, one can obtain a copy of the decree and annulment papers by paying the requisite fee.There are specific grounds of annulment of marriage which can vary sometimes, but are generally limited to deceit, blood relationship, bigamy and mental ineptitude as mentioned below:Either spouse was already married when the marriage took place;Either spouse was not at an age of marriage as per law;Either spouse was under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the marriage;Either spouse was mentally retarded or ill at the time of the marriage;If the marriage was consented consent on the basis of any fraud or force;Either spouse was physically incompetent to be married;If the marriage is proscribed by law due to the relationship between both;Criminals who have already sentenced to a term of life imprisonment may not marry.In the case of Concealment of an important fact (e.g. one of the parties concealed previous criminal record, drug addiction or a sexually transmitted disease)There is no prescribed time for annulment of marriage through the Family Court. Depending on the court's calendar, the entire process may take six months to four years.If the consent to the marriage contract was obtained either by fraud or force, then there are grounds for an annulment. The person who has been threatened or deceived about the marriage contract continues to live with the spouse after the discovery of the fraud or the deception or after being forced into the marriage, it is possible that this ground will not apply. In case Anurag Anand v. Sunita Anand, the court held that false particulars in bio data based upon which the marriage was solemnized amounts fraud and the aggrieved party may annul the marriage.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your problem. They say marriages are made in heaven. But so is thunder and lightening. At times, despite our best efforts, life takes a turn for the worst. We may have wanted different things from life, but life’s got its own plan as well. A bad marriage is something which nobody hopes for, but at times, that’s exactly what we are given and forced to face head on. Marriages are hard. Divorces…even harder. Nobody enters a marriage thinking about a divorce in the end. If some are unable to cope with the harsh realities of marriage, the only viable option in front of them is to approach the Court and seek legal separation. There is a bitterness in your relationship now.Please note that under section 125 (4) ofCode of Criminal Procedureno wife shall be entitled to receive an allowance from her husband under this section if she is living in adultery, or if, without any sufficient reason, she refuses to live with her husband, or if they are living separately by mutual consent.Therefore, as she is living in adultery, she should not be entitled for any maintenance. You can seek the divorce on this ground. My team is dealing with various such matters and help you responding to the Legal Notice effectively. Detailed discussion is required in such cases.You may contact my secretary to connect with me.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,No, you do not have to live with your husband again if he files arestitution of conjugal rights(RCR) against you and you lose the case. The RCR is a legal remedy available to a spouse who has been deserted by their partner without any reasonable excuse. The court can order the spouse to return to the marital home and resume conjugal relations. However, the court cannot force you to stay in the marriage if you do not want to.If you lose the RCR case and you also lose the divorce case, you will still be considered married to your husband. However, you will not be required to live with him. You can continue to live separately and you will not be required to have any contact with him.You can also file a case ofdomestic violenceagainst your husband if he is harassing or threatening you.Domestic violenceis a serious crime and the court can order your husband to stay away from you and to pay you compensation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. You can take a horse to the water, but you can't make him drink, is a very popular proverb and the provision forrestitution of conjugal rightsunder the Indian personal laws seems to be akin. The court can pass a decree forrestitution of conjugal rightsand order the erring spouse to cohabit with the aggrieved spouse. Also under the Indian law a decree ofrestitution of conjugal rightscan be executed by attachment of the respondent’s property. But it is to be noted that the court cannot compel the defaulting spouse to physically return to the comfort-consortium of the decree-holder spouse.Constitutional validity of Section 9 ofHindu Marriage Actis also challenged before Hon'ble Supreme Court and the case is yet to be decided by the Constitution bench.As per Section 13 (1A) ofHindu Marriage Actplease note that either party to a marriage, whether solemnized before or after the commencement of this Act, may also present a petition for the dissolution of the marriage by a decree of divorce on the ground—(i) that there has been no resumption of cohabitation as between the parties to the marriage for aperiod of one year or upwards after the passing of a decree for judicial separation in a proceedingto which they were parties; or(ii) that there has been norestitution of conjugal rightsas between the parties to the marriage for aperiod of one year or upwards after the passing of a decree forrestitution of conjugal rightsin a proceeding to which they were parties.Therefore, if after passing of decree of RCR, you do not comply with direction, it becomes the ground for seeking divorce after one year of passing of decree for your husband.

    "answer": "- As per the Supreme Court Judgment, if you sold your vehicle and failed to transfer the ownership through legal way, then you will remain the owner of the vehicle, and further you will be responsible for any untoward incident and accident by the buyer.- As per the Indian Motor Vehicle, the transferor (seller) has to inform the Regional Transport Offices (RTO) within 14 days of the transfer of ownership.- Further , this Act also instructs the transferee (buyer) to inform the RTO about the change in vehicle ownership and produce all the required documents within 30 days of the transfer.- You should first lodged your complaint with the police station after narrating all the facts and submit all the documents you have in your support.- Further, also inform the RTO in written, after enclosing the said police complaint receiving copy , and thereby  request the official to change the ownership.- However, you can also send al legal notice to the said agent for the sameMohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Bike sold to an agent who sells it without ownership transfer a year ago",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard.Firstly, you need to understand the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in this regard.Supreme Court in the case ofNaveen Kumarv.Vijay Kumar, (2018)held that:Firstly, let us see what is the definition of owner in the Motor Vehicles Act. Section 2(30) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, definesowner(of a vehicle) as under:“(30) “owner” means a person in whose name a motor vehicle stands registered, and where such person is a minor, the guardian of such minor, and in relation to a motor vehicle which is the subject of a hire-purchase, agreement, or an agreement of lease or an agreement of hypothecation, the person in possession of the vehicle under that agreement;”Interpreting this clause, the Supreme Court observed that the person in whose name a motor vehicle stands registered is the owner of the vehicle for the purposes of the Act. The use of the expression “means” is a clear indication of the position that it is the registered owner whom Parliament has regarded as the owner of the vehicle.The Court referred to the earlier Motor Vehicles Act of 1939, wherein the expression “owner” was defined in Section 2(19) as follows:“(19)“owner” means, where the person in possession of a motor vehicle is a minor, the guardian of such minor, and in relation to a motor vehicle which is the subject of a hire-purchase agreement, the person in possession of the vehicle under that agreement.”The Supreme Court held that the Parliament while enacting the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 made a specific change by recasting the earlier definition. Section 2(19) of the earlier Act stipulated that where a person in possession of a motor vehicle is a minor, the guardian of the minor would be the owner and where the motor vehicle was subject to a hire-purchase agreement, the person in possession of the vehicle under the agreement would be the owner. The Court observed:“The 1988 Act has provided in the first part of Section 2(30) that the owner would be the person in whose name the motor vehicle stands registered. Where such a person is a minor the guardian of the minor would be the owner. In relation to a motor vehicle which is the subject of an agreement of hire purchase, lease or hypothecation, the person in possession of the vehicle under that agreement would be the owner. The latter part of the definition is in the nature of an exception which applies where the motor vehicle is the subject of a hire-purchase agreement or of an agreement of lease or hypothecation. Otherwise the definition stipulates that for the purposes of the Act, the person in whose name the motor vehicle stands registered is treated as the owner.”The Court took note of Section 50 of the Act which deals with transfer of ownership of a vehicle, and also referred to various previous judgments, in particular, the following cases, which were affirmed:Pushpav.Shakuntala, (2011) 2 SCC 240;T.V. Josev.Chacko P.M., (2001) 8 SCC 748;P.P. Mohammedv.K. Rajappan, (2008) 17 SCC 624.After considering all these aspects, the Supreme Court held:“…in view of the definition of the expression “owner” in Section 2(30), it is the person in whose name the motor vehicle stands registered who, for the purposes of the Act, would be treated as the “owner”. However, where a person is a minor, the guardian of the minor would be treated as the owner. Where a motor vehicle is subject to an agreement of hire purchase, lease or hypothecation, the person in possession of the vehicle under that agreement is treated as the owner. In a situation … where the registered owner has purported to transfer the vehicle but continues to be reflected in the records of the Registering Authority as the owner of the vehicle, he would not stand absolved of liability. Parliament has consciously introduced the definition of the expression “owner” in Section 2(30), making a departure from the provisions of Section 2(19) in the earlier 1939 Act. The principle underlying the provisions of Section 2(30) is that the victim of a motor accident or, in the case of a death, the legal heirs of the deceased victim should not be left in a state of uncertainty. A claimant for compensation ought not to be burdened with following a trail of successive transfers, which are not registered with the Registering Authority. To hold otherwise would be to defeat the salutary object and purpose of the Act. Hence, the interpretation to be placed must facilitate the fulfilment of the object of the law.”Thus, it was clearly held by the Supreme Court that a person continues to be owner of the vehicle, even if he has sold his vehicle to another person, if the transfer of the vehicle is not reflected in the RTO records and if the vehicle continues to be in the name of the original owner despite the sale of vehicle. Accordingly, such original owner would continue to be liable for compensation, if any, to be paid by the owner for any accident, despite he having sold the vehicle.It is therefore in the interest of those who sell their vehicles, to get the vehicles transferred in the name of the buyer by following the procedure laid down for transfer of vehicles, particularly in Section 50 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.Therefore, as per the facts you mentioned you can report the matter to the nearest police station of your area in West Bengal and also the Regional Transport Office. Also, you can issue the legal notice through Advocate in this regard to the concerned person so as to safeguard yourself.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Yes, there are a few things you can do to legally protect yourself from any responsibility that might arise from the unlawful usage of your vehicle which continues to be in your name.File a police complaint against the agent.This will create a paper trail of your complaint and establish that you are not the one responsible for the unlawful usage of the vehicle.Send a legal notice to the agent demanding that he transfer the ownership of the vehicle to you immediately.This will put the agent on notice that you are serious about taking legal action if he does not comply.Contact the RTO and inform them that you are not the current owner of the vehicle and that you have not authorized anyone to use it.This will help to prevent the RTO from issuing any further challans or taking any other action against you.Take out an insurance policy on the vehicle in your name.This will protect you financially in case the vehicle is involved in an accident or other incident while it is still in your name.If you take these steps, you will be in a much stronger position to defend yourself if you are ever held liable for the unlawful usage of your vehicle.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "How to get annulment in Gujarat",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In Gujarat, an annulment can be granted on the grounds of marriage being void or voidable. A void marriage is one that is invalid from the start, while a voidable marriage is one that can be annulled by a court.In your case, the marriage was voidable because it was entered into under duress. Duress is a situation where one party is forced to enter into a contract or agreement by the other party using coercion or threats. In your case, your ex-husband emotionally blackmailed and brainwashed you into marrying him.To get an annulment on the grounds of duress, you will need to file a petition in the Family Court in Gujarat. The petition should include the following information:Your name and addressYour ex-husband's name and addressThe date and place of marriageThe grounds for annulment (duress)Any supporting evidence, such as witness statements or medical recordsThe Family Court will then issue a notice to your ex-husband, asking him to respond to your petition. If he does not respond, the court may grant the annulment without his consent.The annulment process can take several months, but it is usually faster than a divorce. Once the annulment is granted, your marriage will be considered void from the start and you will be free to remarry.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. Now, since you presently married to him on paper, therefore, you have to file annulment petition as soon as possible in Gujarat through Advocate. Unlike divorce, the process of annulment of marriage in India is relatively shorter and has fewer intricacies involved.Below is a brief of the procedure for the annulment of marriage in India.The parties' residence plays an important role in deciding the jurisdiction of the matter.Either partner can file a petition where she/he was born, where the marriage was solemnized, or has been living together.A petition should be presented before the concerned court under different personal laws. Such as, under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 andSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, one can refer to the Family court or city civil court to decide the matter. Under Muslim law, a matter is decided by religious practice.After filing the annulment petition, the court issues a notice to the respondent providing a chance to reply and present before the court.After proving a marriage void or voidable, the court will pass a decree as per the pieces of evidence and arguments made by the parties.Once, the decree of nullity is passed, one can obtain a copy of the decree and annulment papers by paying the requisite fee.There are specific grounds of annulment of marriage which can vary sometimes, but are generally limited to deceit, blood relationship, bigamy and mental ineptitude as mentioned below:Either spouse was already married when the marriage took place;Either spouse was not at an age of marriage as per law;Either spouse was under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the marriage;Either spouse was mentally retarded or ill at the time of the marriage;If the marriage was consented consent on the basis of any fraud or force;Either spouse was physically incompetent to be married;If the marriage is proscribed by law due to the relationship between both;Criminals who have already sentenced to a term of life imprisonment may not marry.In the case of Concealment of an important fact (e.g. one of the parties concealed previous criminal record, drug addiction or a sexually transmitted disease)There is no prescribed time for annulment of marriage through the Family Court. Depending on the court's calendar, the entire process may take six months to four years.If the consent to the marriage contract was obtained either by fraud or force, then there are grounds for an annulment. The person who has been threatened or deceived about the marriage contract continues to live with the spouse after the discovery of the fraud or the deception or after being forced into the marriage, it is possible that this ground will not apply. In case Anurag Anand v. Sunita Anand, the court held that false particulars in bio data based upon which the marriage was solemnized amounts fraud and the aggrieved party may annul the marriage.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.

    "question": "Bike sold to an agent who sells it without ownership transfer a year ago",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard.Firstly, you need to understand the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in this regard.Supreme Court in the case ofNaveen Kumarv.Vijay Kumar, (2018)held that:Firstly, let us see what is the definition of owner in the Motor Vehicles Act. Section 2(30) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, definesowner(of a vehicle) as under:“(30) “owner” means a person in whose name a motor vehicle stands registered, and where such person is a minor, the guardian of such minor, and in relation to a motor vehicle which is the subject of a hire-purchase, agreement, or an agreement of lease or an agreement of hypothecation, the person in possession of the vehicle under that agreement;”Interpreting this clause, the Supreme Court observed that the person in whose name a motor vehicle stands registered is the owner of the vehicle for the purposes of the Act. The use of the expression “means” is a clear indication of the position that it is the registered owner whom Parliament has regarded as the owner of the vehicle.The Court referred to the earlier Motor Vehicles Act of 1939, wherein the expression “owner” was defined in Section 2(19) as follows:“(19)“owner” means, where the person in possession of a motor vehicle is a minor, the guardian of such minor, and in relation to a motor vehicle which is the subject of a hire-purchase agreement, the person in possession of the vehicle under that agreement.”The Supreme Court held that the Parliament while enacting the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 made a specific change by recasting the earlier definition. Section 2(19) of the earlier Act stipulated that where a person in possession of a motor vehicle is a minor, the guardian of the minor would be the owner and where the motor vehicle was subject to a hire-purchase agreement, the person in possession of the vehicle under the agreement would be the owner. The Court observed:“The 1988 Act has provided in the first part of Section 2(30) that the owner would be the person in whose name the motor vehicle stands registered. Where such a person is a minor the guardian of the minor would be the owner. In relation to a motor vehicle which is the subject of an agreement of hire purchase, lease or hypothecation, the person in possession of the vehicle under that agreement would be the owner. The latter part of the definition is in the nature of an exception which applies where the motor vehicle is the subject of a hire-purchase agreement or of an agreement of lease or hypothecation. Otherwise the definition stipulates that for the purposes of the Act, the person in whose name the motor vehicle stands registered is treated as the owner.”The Court took note of Section 50 of the Act which deals with transfer of ownership of a vehicle, and also referred to various previous judgments, in particular, the following cases, which were affirmed:Pushpav.Shakuntala, (2011) 2 SCC 240;T.V. Josev.Chacko P.M., (2001) 8 SCC 748;P.P. Mohammedv.K. Rajappan, (2008) 17 SCC 624.After considering all these aspects, the Supreme Court held:“…in view of the definition of the expression “owner” in Section 2(30), it is the person in whose name the motor vehicle stands registered who, for the purposes of the Act, would be treated as the “owner”. However, where a person is a minor, the guardian of the minor would be treated as the owner. Where a motor vehicle is subject to an agreement of hire purchase, lease or hypothecation, the person in possession of the vehicle under that agreement is treated as the owner. In a situation … where the registered owner has purported to transfer the vehicle but continues to be reflected in the records of the Registering Authority as the owner of the vehicle, he would not stand absolved of liability. Parliament has consciously introduced the definition of the expression “owner” in Section 2(30), making a departure from the provisions of Section 2(19) in the earlier 1939 Act. The principle underlying the provisions of Section 2(30) is that the victim of a motor accident or, in the case of a death, the legal heirs of the deceased victim should not be left in a state of uncertainty. A claimant for compensation ought not to be burdened with following a trail of successive transfers, which are not registered with the Registering Authority. To hold otherwise would be to defeat the salutary object and purpose of the Act. Hence, the interpretation to be placed must facilitate the fulfilment of the object of the law.”Thus, it was clearly held by the Supreme Court that a person continues to be owner of the vehicle, even if he has sold his vehicle to another person, if the transfer of the vehicle is not reflected in the RTO records and if the vehicle continues to be in the name of the original owner despite the sale of vehicle. Accordingly, such original owner would continue to be liable for compensation, if any, to be paid by the owner for any accident, despite he having sold the vehicle.It is therefore in the interest of those who sell their vehicles, to get the vehicles transferred in the name of the buyer by following the procedure laid down for transfer of vehicles, particularly in Section 50 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.Therefore, as per the facts you mentioned you can report the matter to the nearest police station of your area in West Bengal and also the Regional Transport Office. Also, you can issue the legal notice through Advocate in this regard to the concerned person so as to safeguard yourself.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

A bad marriage is something which nobody hopes for, but at times, that’s exactly what we are given and forced to face head on. Marriages are hard. Divorces…even harder.

    "answer": "If this property has been considered as ancestral, then your father should have allocated a portion from his share of the sale proceeds.If he hasn't allocated any portion for you, you have the option to file a partition lawsuit against your father. This legal action can also involve the subsequent buyers, including your nephew, as necessary parties.However, if the property is not ancestral, you do not possess any rights to the property. Pursuing any actions to claim a share would be futile in this scenario. In the case of ancestral property, initiating a partition lawsuit against your father and involving subsequent buyers, including your nephew, would be a viable course of action.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "How to get annulment in Gujarat",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In Gujarat, an annulment can be granted on the grounds of marriage being void or voidable. A void marriage is one that is invalid from the start, while a voidable marriage is one that can be annulled by a court.In your case, the marriage was voidable because it was entered into under duress. Duress is a situation where one party is forced to enter into a contract or agreement by the other party using coercion or threats. In your case, your ex-husband emotionally blackmailed and brainwashed you into marrying him.To get an annulment on the grounds of duress, you will need to file a petition in the Family Court in Gujarat. The petition should include the following information:Your name and addressYour ex-husband's name and addressThe date and place of marriageThe grounds for annulment (duress)Any supporting evidence, such as witness statements or medical recordsThe Family Court will then issue a notice to your ex-husband, asking him to respond to your petition. If he does not respond, the court may grant the annulment without his consent.The annulment process can take several months, but it is usually faster than a divorce. Once the annulment is granted, your marriage will be considered void from the start and you will be free to remarry.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "How to get annulment in Gujarat",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. Now, since you presently married to him on paper, therefore, you have to file annulment petition as soon as possible in Gujarat through Advocate. Unlike divorce, the process of annulment of marriage in India is relatively shorter and has fewer intricacies involved.Below is a brief of the procedure for the annulment of marriage in India.The parties' residence plays an important role in deciding the jurisdiction of the matter.Either partner can file a petition where she/he was born, where the marriage was solemnized, or has been living together.A petition should be presented before the concerned court under different personal laws. Such as, under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 andSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, one can refer to the Family court or city civil court to decide the matter. Under Muslim law, a matter is decided by religious practice.After filing the annulment petition, the court issues a notice to the respondent providing a chance to reply and present before the court.After proving a marriage void or voidable, the court will pass a decree as per the pieces of evidence and arguments made by the parties.Once, the decree of nullity is passed, one can obtain a copy of the decree and annulment papers by paying the requisite fee.There are specific grounds of annulment of marriage which can vary sometimes, but are generally limited to deceit, blood relationship, bigamy and mental ineptitude as mentioned below:Either spouse was already married when the marriage took place;Either spouse was not at an age of marriage as per law;Either spouse was under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the marriage;Either spouse was mentally retarded or ill at the time of the marriage;If the marriage was consented consent on the basis of any fraud or force;Either spouse was physically incompetent to be married;If the marriage is proscribed by law due to the relationship between both;Criminals who have already sentenced to a term of life imprisonment may not marry.In the case of Concealment of an important fact (e.g. one of the parties concealed previous criminal record, drug addiction or a sexually transmitted disease)There is no prescribed time for annulment of marriage through the Family Court. Depending on the court's calendar, the entire process may take six months to four years.If the consent to the marriage contract was obtained either by fraud or force, then there are grounds for an annulment. The person who has been threatened or deceived about the marriage contract continues to live with the spouse after the discovery of the fraud or the deception or after being forced into the marriage, it is possible that this ground will not apply. In case Anurag Anand v. Sunita Anand, the court held that false particulars in bio data based upon which the marriage was solemnized amounts fraud and the aggrieved party may annul the marriage.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.

Your brother's legal heirs will not have any claim to the property.The legal precedence in support of this view is the case of Ram Gopal v. State of Punjab, (1974) 1 SCC 381. In this case, the Supreme Court held that the beneficial ownership of a property will pass to the legal heirs of the person who paid for the property, even if the property was allotted in the name of another person.The following additional documents may also be helpful in proving that your father paid for the property:Bank statements showing the transfer of funds from your father's account to the HUDA accountLetter from the HUDA authorities acknowledging receipt of the payment from your fatherWitness statements from people who were present when your father paid for the propertyAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. You can take a horse to the water, but you can't make him drink, is a very popular proverb and the provision forrestitution of conjugal rightsunder the Indian personal laws seems to be akin. The court can pass a decree forrestitution of conjugal rightsand order the erring spouse to cohabit with the aggrieved spouse. Also under the Indian law a decree ofrestitution of conjugal rightscan be executed by attachment of the respondent’s property. But it is to be noted that the court cannot compel the defaulting spouse to physically return to the comfort-consortium of the decree-holder spouse.Constitutional validity of Section 9 ofHindu Marriage Actis also challenged before Hon'ble Supreme Court and the case is yet to be decided by the Constitution bench.As per Section 13 (1A) ofHindu Marriage Actplease note that either party to a marriage, whether solemnized before or after the commencement of this Act, may also present a petition for the dissolution of the marriage by a decree of divorce on the ground—(i) that there has been no resumption of cohabitation as between the parties to the marriage for aperiod of one year or upwards after the passing of a decree for judicial separation in a proceedingto which they were parties; or(ii) that there has been norestitution of conjugal rightsas between the parties to the marriage for aperiod of one year or upwards after the passing of a decree forrestitution of conjugal rightsin a proceeding to which they were parties.Therefore, if after passing of decree of RCR, you do not comply with direction, it becomes the ground for seeking divorce after one year of passing of decree for your husband.

If there was a DV judgment (under Section 12 with various sub-sections) in May 2019 that directed maintenance for your minor daughter, she might be seeking enforcement of this maintenance order through Section 128 CrPC.Section 31 of the DV Act allows a Magistrate to grant interim and ex parte orders, and it's possible that due to the time elapsed since the judgment in May 2019, she might not be able to file under this section anymore. The reason for choosing Section 128 CrPC could be related to enforcement and execution of the existing DV judgment.Filing Section 128 CrPC Connected to DV Case:Whether she can file a petition under Section 128 CrPC connected to the DV case would depend on the laws and rules?You might be able to challenge the filing based on reasons such as delay, but whether the petition is maintainable would depend on precedents .How to Proceed:If you have evidence to support your claim that the allegations in the DV case were false, it's important to present this evidence to the court.Transfer of Visitation Rights Case and Challenge to Section 128 CrPC:Transferring the visitation rights case and challenging the Section 128 CrPC petition could be options, but the viability of these options would depend on the specific circumstances.Yes, you have strong grounds to believe that the police complaint and CSR could support your case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Purchase of Property: Before purchasing any property, it’s crucial to conduct a thorough due diligence process. This includes verifying the title deeds, checking for any encumbrances, and ensuring that all property taxes have been paid up to date. It’s also advisable to consult with a legal expert before proceeding with the purchase.Claim by Daughters: As per theHindu Succession Act, when a father dies intestate, his self-acquired property must be shared equally among his class 1 heirs including daughters. However, in your case, it appears that some of the daughters and sons have already relinquished their rights to the property through the registered sale deed of 1999. This could potentially act as a relinquishment of right by these 5 children.Protection for Sons: The sons could potentially be protected by Article 110 of the Limitation Act if the remaining 2 daughters had knowledge of the said sale in 1999 and registered partition in 2000, and 23 years have passed. The Limitation Act stipulates that any person who has been in possession of a property for an uninterrupted period of 12 years can claim ownership through adverse possession.Sukumar JadhavAdvocate, Mumbai35 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sukumar Jadhav"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your problem. They say marriages are made in heaven. But so is thunder and lightening. At times, despite our best efforts, life takes a turn for the worst. We may have wanted different things from life, but life’s got its own plan as well. A bad marriage is something which nobody hopes for, but at times, that’s exactly what we are given and forced to face head on. Marriages are hard. Divorces…even harder. Nobody enters a marriage thinking about a divorce in the end. If some are unable to cope with the harsh realities of marriage, the only viable option in front of them is to approach the Court and seek legal separation. There is a bitterness in your relationship now.Please note that under section 125 (4) ofCode of Criminal Procedureno wife shall be entitled to receive an allowance from her husband under this section if she is living in adultery, or if, without any sufficient reason, she refuses to live with her husband, or if they are living separately by mutual consent.Therefore, as she is living in adultery, she should not be entitled for any maintenance. You can seek the divorce on this ground. My team is dealing with various such matters and help you responding to the Legal Notice effectively.

    "answer": "If you want cancelling your marriage after the engagement, it’s important to remember that the engagement is like an agreement instead of a final contract. Therefore, any party to the engagement has right to repudiate it on a valid ground.Cancellation of the engagement is possible on valid grounds, and the aggrieved party is entitled to compensation and recovery of expenses incurred in the engagement ceremony. Be prepared to pay expenses and return all gifts received.Communicate clearly with the other party and their family.If the cancellation is due to dowry demands, the guilty party is liable under theDowry Prohibition Act. You said that your fiancé’s family is making false allegation of dowry. If you prove that the alleged allegation of dowry demand is false, then your fiancé’s family is not entitled to get compensation in lieu of cancellation of engagement.If you are threatened with false charges of dowry or harassment, document these threats for possible legal action.When they lodge FIR against you for demand of dowry then approach the High Court for the quashing of that FIR. Evidence of threatening will further empower the court to quash the FIR.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "How to get annulment in Gujarat",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In Gujarat, an annulment can be granted on the grounds of marriage being void or voidable. A void marriage is one that is invalid from the start, while a voidable marriage is one that can be annulled by a court.In your case, the marriage was voidable because it was entered into under duress. Duress is a situation where one party is forced to enter into a contract or agreement by the other party using coercion or threats. In your case, your ex-husband emotionally blackmailed and brainwashed you into marrying him.To get an annulment on the grounds of duress, you will need to file a petition in the Family Court in Gujarat. The petition should include the following information:Your name and addressYour ex-husband's name and addressThe date and place of marriageThe grounds for annulment (duress)Any supporting evidence, such as witness statements or medical recordsThe Family Court will then issue a notice to your ex-husband, asking him to respond to your petition. If he does not respond, the court may grant the annulment without his consent.The annulment process can take several months, but it is usually faster than a divorce. Once the annulment is granted, your marriage will be considered void from the start and you will be free to remarry.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. Now, since you presently married to him on paper, therefore, you have to file annulment petition as soon as possible in Gujarat through Advocate. Unlike divorce, the process of annulment of marriage in India is relatively shorter and has fewer intricacies involved.Below is a brief of the procedure for the annulment of marriage in India.The parties' residence plays an important role in deciding the jurisdiction of the matter.Either partner can file a petition where she/he was born, where the marriage was solemnized, or has been living together.A petition should be presented before the concerned court under different personal laws. Such as, under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 andSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, one can refer to the Family court or city civil court to decide the matter. Under Muslim law, a matter is decided by religious practice.After filing the annulment petition, the court issues a notice to the respondent providing a chance to reply and present before the court.After proving a marriage void or voidable, the court will pass a decree as per the pieces of evidence and arguments made by the parties.Once, the decree of nullity is passed, one can obtain a copy of the decree and annulment papers by paying the requisite fee.There are specific grounds of annulment of marriage which can vary sometimes, but are generally limited to deceit, blood relationship, bigamy and mental ineptitude as mentioned below:Either spouse was already married when the marriage took place;Either spouse was not at an age of marriage as per law;Either spouse was under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the marriage;Either spouse was mentally retarded or ill at the time of the marriage;If the marriage was consented consent on the basis of any fraud or force;Either spouse was physically incompetent to be married;If the marriage is proscribed by law due to the relationship between both;Criminals who have already sentenced to a term of life imprisonment may not marry.In the case of Concealment of an important fact (e.g. one of the parties concealed previous criminal record, drug addiction or a sexually transmitted disease)There is no prescribed time for annulment of marriage through the Family Court. Depending on the court's calendar, the entire process may take six months to four years.If the consent to the marriage contract was obtained either by fraud or force, then there are grounds for an annulment. The person who has been threatened or deceived about the marriage contract continues to live with the spouse after the discovery of the fraud or the deception or after being forced into the marriage, it is possible that this ground will not apply. In case Anurag Anand v. Sunita Anand, the court held that false particulars in bio data based upon which the marriage was solemnized amounts fraud and the aggrieved party may annul the marriage.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.

But so is thunder and lightening. At times, despite our best efforts, life takes a turn for the worst. We may have wanted different things from life, but life’s got its own plan as well. A bad marriage is something which nobody hopes for, but at times, that’s exactly what we are given and forced to face head on. Marriages are hard. Divorces…even harder. Nobody enters a marriage thinking about a divorce in the end. If some are unable to cope with the harsh realities of marriage, the only viable option in front of them is to approach the Court and seek legal separation. There is a bitterness in your relationship now.Please note that under section 125 (4) ofCode of Criminal Procedureno wife shall be entitled to receive an allowance from her husband under this section if she is living in adultery, or if, without any sufficient reason, she refuses to live with her husband, or if they are living separately by mutual consent.Therefore, as she is living in adultery, she should not be entitled for any maintenance. You can seek the divorce on this ground. My team is dealing with various such matters and help you responding to the Legal Notice effectively.

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. You can take a horse to the water, but you can't make him drink, is a very popular proverb and the provision forrestitution of conjugal rightsunder the Indian personal laws seems to be akin. The court can pass a decree forrestitution of conjugal rightsand order the erring spouse to cohabit with the aggrieved spouse. Also under the Indian law a decree ofrestitution of conjugal rightscan be executed by attachment of the respondent’s property. But it is to be noted that the court cannot compel the defaulting spouse to physically return to the comfort-consortium of the decree-holder spouse.Constitutional validity of Section 9 ofHindu Marriage Actis also challenged before Hon'ble Supreme Court and the case is yet to be decided by the Constitution bench.As per Section 13 (1A) ofHindu Marriage Actplease note that either party to a marriage, whether solemnized before or after the commencement of this Act, may also present a petition for the dissolution of the marriage by a decree of divorce on the ground—(i) that there has been no resumption of cohabitation as between the parties to the marriage for aperiod of one year or upwards after the passing of a decree for judicial separation in a proceedingto which they were parties; or(ii) that there has been norestitution of conjugal rightsas between the parties to the marriage for aperiod of one year or upwards after the passing of a decree forrestitution of conjugal rightsin a proceeding to which they were parties.Therefore, if after passing of decree of RCR, you do not comply with direction, it becomes the ground for seeking divorce after one year of passing of decree for your husband.

    "answer": "Purchase of Property: Before purchasing any property, it’s crucial to conduct a thorough due diligence process. This includes verifying the title deeds, checking for any encumbrances, and ensuring that all property taxes have been paid up to date. It’s also advisable to consult with a legal expert before proceeding with the purchase.Claim by Daughters: As per theHindu Succession Act, when a father dies intestate, his self-acquired property must be shared equally among his class 1 heirs including daughters. However, in your case, it appears that some of the daughters and sons have already relinquished their rights to the property through the registered sale deed of 1999. This could potentially act as a relinquishment of right by these 5 children.Protection for Sons: The sons could potentially be protected by Article 110 of the Limitation Act if the remaining 2 daughters had knowledge of the said sale in 1999 and registered partition in 2000, and 23 years have passed. The Limitation Act stipulates that any person who has been in possession of a property for an uninterrupted period of 12 years can claim ownership through adverse possession.Sukumar JadhavAdvocate, Mumbai35 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sukumar Jadhav"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Forensic Analysis of Ink:Forensic laboratories can analyze ink to determine certain characteristics such as its composition, color, chemical properties, and aging patterns. Techniques like Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC), Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) can be used to analyze ink samples.Aging of Ink:The aging of ink on paper can be influenced by factors like exposure to light, humidity, temperature, and chemical interactions. However, accurately determining the exact age of ink, especially over long periods, can be challenging.Availability of Techniques:Forensic analysis of ink is available in both government and private forensic laboratories in many countries, including India. However, the extent of capabilities can vary between labs.Legal Proceedings and Forensic Evidence:In legal proceedings, forensic evidence, including ink analysis, can be presented to the court to support a case. However, it's important to note that forensic analysis is not always definitive and might provide only probabilities or indications. The court considers all available evidence, including expert opinions, when making decisions.Consult with Forensic Experts:If you have concerns about the authenticity of a document or signature, you should consult with a forensic expert who specializes in ink analysis. They can provide insights into the feasibility of analyzing the ink's age and the potential significance of such analysis in your specific case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Will dispute - detail of laboratories and forensic expert",
    "answer": "There are six Central Forensic Science Laboratories (CFSLs) in India under the control of the Directorate of Forensic Science Services (DFSS), MHA, GOI and one CFSL under Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) besides 29 State FSL in each state with some having Regional and District FSLs.Truth Labs, the first independent forensic science laboratory in India, has been rendering a wide range of forensic analytical and field investigation services for the last 12 years. Currently, Truth Labs is operating from its 6 metropolitan offices located in Hyderabad, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore and Kolkata.In A. Sivagnana Pandian vs M. Ravichandran on 23 December, 2010 of Mdras High court it was held thatThe expression that there is no scientific method available anywhere in the country or State, more particularly in the Forensic Science Department for scientific assessment of the age of handwriting to offer opinion is far from acceptance. A careful survey of the above authorities would unveil a fact that settled plans of actions for experiments are very much available and when one steps into such experiments, there is further scope for upswing in the technology. It is bounden duty of the official concerned to follow the procedures.It was even note  that even anterior to 1964, in a decision rendered by the Supreme Court, in Shashi kumar Banerjee's Case, before the trial Court, the expert had stated that the determination of the age could be ascertained definitely by a chemical test. It reveals that even prior to 1964, chemical tests were in application to find out age of ink. Now, the science in this branch has prospered to considerable dimensions and it cannot hereafter be contended that it is not possible to ascertain the age of the ink by scientific method and exact result could not be secured. The scientists/experts should appear before the Courts with opinionated evidence in this regard, on their successful accomplishment of this assignment.In furtherance, it was held that:29. Adverting to the facts of the present case, since various scientific avenues are available for finding out the age of the ink in a document, it must be subjected to tests as suggested by various scientists. I follow the ratio in the decisions in Kalyani Baskar's case and T.Nagappa's case above, and direct to refer the disputed document to such examination in order to provide an opportunity to the accused, when a good material is available, to rebut the presumption as per law, by non-destructive method in this regard.(Emphasis supplied).30. If the expert concerned considers that such examination would destruct a part of the document or the document itself, they may report the fact before the Court and the Court thereafter shall pass further orders for the proof of the facts on the basis of pleadings and other evidence. Latching the opportunity to the accused in the attempt at the stage of rebutting the presumption under Section 118(a) and 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is not at all \"fair trial\". As per the settled law, every opportunity shall be extended to the accused to establish his defence.31. In this situation, it is also regarded that it is the view of the Supreme Court that some delay in taking steps for referring the document to the wisdom of the expert cannot be a legal embargo for entertaining the plea.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Labbala Sundara Rao Chowdary vs Voona Ramachandra Gupta on 8 November, 2019 of AP high court at Amravati, it was held that :C. R. P. No.2646 of 2019 Expert to the Andhra Pradesh Forensic Science Laboratory, Hyderabad, toascertaintheageof theink. The said petition was allowed by the learned Judge by his order dated 29.08.2017. However, the said document was returned by the A.P. Forensic Science Laboratory on the ground that theageofinkcannot beascertainedin their laboratory. Therefore, the petitioner has again filed present petition requesting the Court to send Ex.A-1 promissory note to the Truth Labs and Truth Finders, Hyderabad, toascertaintheageof theinkand to submit its report. The said petition was dismissed by the learned Judge by the impugned order on the ground that when the Court allowed the petition in I.A.No.480 of 2017 earlier and sent Ex.A-1 promissory note to the Government Expert that the Court received a letter dated 30.10.2017 from the Forensic Science Laboratory, Hyderabad that it is not possible toascertaintheageof theinkof writings and signatures and as such, there are no grounds to again send Ex.A-1 promissory note to private expert for the same purpose.Learned counsel for the petitioner-defendant would submit that as there are no sufficient facilities in A.P. Forensic Science Laboratory, Hyderabad, that they have returned Ex.A-1 promissory note stating that theageofinkcannot beascertainedon it in their laboratory. However, the Truth Labs and Truth Finders, Hyderabad have the necessary facilities in their laboratory along with the experts on the said subject and theageofinkcan beascertainedin the said Lab. In support of his contention, he relied on the judgment of the Punjab and Haryana High Court rendered in the case of Ram Kishan Fauji v. State of Haryana1 to show that Truth Lab is an ISO certified company and even recommended by several governmental organizations. Therefore, he would contend that mere fact that when the Court has sent the document for examination to Forensic Science Laboratory, Hyderabad by its earlier order that it was returned on the ground that there is no possibility toascertaintheageofink, cannot be a valid ground to dismiss the second petition filed by the petitioner to send the same to the Truth Labs and Truth Finders, Hyderabad which have the necessary facilities along with the experts on the subject toascertaintheageofink. Therefore, he prays to set aside the impugned order and allow the present petition.Learned counsel for the defendant has assailed the said findings as discussed supra on the grounds that there are no adequate facilities in the said laboratory toascertaintheageofinkthat they have returned the said document and since the Truth Labs and Truth Finders, Hyderabad, which is an ISO certified company, are equipped with the necessary facilities along with experts on the subject that the same can beascertainedin the said lab.Therefore, as the trial Court has already come to a conclusion in its earlier order passed in I.A.No.480 of 2017 that as requested by the defendant that the document i.e. Ex.A-1 promissory note is to be sent to the expert for examination toascertaintheageof theink, the second application filed by him to send the said Ex.A-1 promissory note to another lab i.e. the Truth Labs and Truth Finders, Hyderabad, which is equipped with the necessary facilities and experts on the subject, toascertaintheageof theinkCMR,J."

    "question": "Agricultural land sold without my signature - what can I do to get my share",
    "answer": "If this property has been considered as ancestral, then your father should have allocated a portion from his share of the sale proceeds.If he hasn't allocated any portion for you, you have the option to file a partition lawsuit against your father. This legal action can also involve the subsequent buyers, including your nephew, as necessary parties.However, if the property is not ancestral, you do not possess any rights to the property. Pursuing any actions to claim a share would be futile in this scenario. In the case of ancestral property, initiating a partition lawsuit against your father and involving subsequent buyers, including your nephew, would be a viable course of action.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Status of an earlier Indian marriage after one spouse becomes US citizen and implications on divorce",
    "answer": "1. Even if one of the spouses later becomes a US citizen, the marriage of two Indian nationals that took place and registered in India is often considered as valid. The marriage is still legitimate notwithstanding the wife's change of citizenship.2. If the husband wants to divorce, he can file for divorce in India where the marriage took place. However, he needs to fulfill the residency requirements. Even though the wife is now a US citizen, it’s still possible to file for divorce in the US. But according to the latest Supreme Court of India ruling, the grounds for divorce should be recognized by Indian law.3. In terms of alimony, it’s generally the husband who is ordered by the court to pay to the wife for sustenance, while and after undergoing a divorce. The court considers various parameters to decide on the amount to be given as alimony, including: income of the spouse(s), their standard of living and financial status. If the wife is working and drawing a salary that covers her living expenses, the court will certainly take that into consideration along with the husband’s income.Sukumar JadhavAdvocate, Mumbai35 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sukumar Jadhav"

Civil Action: You can file a civil suit in court for the recovery of property. This could involve filing a suit for declaration and possession, which is a legal remedy used to declare the rights of a party over a particular property. You could also consider filing a suit for partition if the property is jointly owned.2. Criminal Action: If you believe that your elder brother has fraudulently grabbed the property, you could consider filing a criminal complaint. This could involve lodging a complaint underSection 420(Cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) orSection 406(Punishment for criminal breach of trust) of theIndian Penal Code.3. Power of Attorney (PoA) Issue: If your elder brother has executed a fresh PoA in his name without proper authorization, this could potentially be challenged in court.

This includes verifying the title deeds, checking for any encumbrances, and ensuring that all property taxes have been paid up to date. It’s also advisable to consult with a legal expert before proceeding with the purchase.Claim by Daughters: As per theHindu Succession Act, when a father dies intestate, his self-acquired property must be shared equally among his class 1 heirs including daughters. However, in your case, it appears that some of the daughters and sons have already relinquished their rights to the property through the registered sale deed of 1999. This could potentially act as a relinquishment of right by these 5 children.Protection for Sons: The sons could potentially be protected by Article 110 of the Limitation Act if the remaining 2 daughters had knowledge of the said sale in 1999 and registered partition in 2000, and 23 years have passed. The Limitation Act stipulates that any person who has been in possession of a property for an uninterrupted period of 12 years can claim ownership through adverse possession.Sukumar JadhavAdvocate, Mumbai35 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sukumar Jadhav"

Techniques like Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC), Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) can be used to analyze ink samples.Aging of Ink:The aging of ink on paper can be influenced by factors like exposure to light, humidity, temperature, and chemical interactions.

However, the extent of capabilities can vary between labs.Legal Proceedings and Forensic Evidence:In legal proceedings, forensic evidence, including ink analysis, can be presented to the court to support a case. However, it's important to note that forensic analysis is not always definitive and might provide only probabilities or indications. The court considers all available evidence, including expert opinions, when making decisions.Consult with Forensic Experts:If you have concerns about the authenticity of a document or signature, you should consult with a forensic expert who specializes in ink analysis.

A careful survey of the above authorities would unveil a fact that settled plans of actions for experiments are very much available and when one steps into such experiments, there is further scope for upswing in the technology. It is bounden duty of the official concerned to follow the procedures.It was even note  that even anterior to 1964, in a decision rendered by the Supreme Court, in Shashi kumar Banerjee's Case, before the trial Court, the expert had stated that the determination of the age could be ascertained definitely by a chemical test. It reveals that even prior to 1964, chemical tests were in application to find out age of ink. Now, the science in this branch has prospered to considerable dimensions and it cannot hereafter be contended that it is not possible to ascertain the age of the ink by scientific method and exact result could not be secured.

Therefore, the petitioner has again filed present petition requesting the Court to send Ex.A-1 promissory note to the Truth Labs and Truth Finders, Hyderabad, toascertaintheageof theinkand to submit its report. The said petition was dismissed by the learned Judge by the impugned order on the ground that when the Court allowed the petition in I.A.No.480 of 2017 earlier and sent Ex.A-1 promissory note to the Government Expert that the Court received a letter dated 30.10.2017 from the Forensic Science Laboratory, Hyderabad that it is not possible toascertaintheageof theinkof writings and signatures and as such, there are no grounds to again send Ex.A-1 promissory note to private expert for the same purpose.Learned counsel for the petitioner-defendant would submit that as there are no sufficient facilities in A.P.

In support of his contention, he relied on the judgment of the Punjab and Haryana High Court rendered in the case of Ram Kishan Fauji v.

Therefore, he would contend that mere fact that when the Court has sent the document for examination to Forensic Science Laboratory, Hyderabad by its earlier order that it was returned on the ground that there is no possibility toascertaintheageofink, cannot be a valid ground to dismiss the second petition filed by the petitioner to send the same to the Truth Labs and Truth Finders, Hyderabad which have the necessary facilities along with the experts on the subject toascertaintheageofink.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Forensic Analysis of Ink:Forensic laboratories can analyze ink to determine certain characteristics such as its composition, color, chemical properties, and aging patterns. Techniques like Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC), Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) can be used to analyze ink samples.Aging of Ink:The aging of ink on paper can be influenced by factors like exposure to light, humidity, temperature, and chemical interactions. However, accurately determining the exact age of ink, especially over long periods, can be challenging.Availability of Techniques:Forensic analysis of ink is available in both government and private forensic laboratories in many countries, including India. However, the extent of capabilities can vary between labs.Legal Proceedings and Forensic Evidence:In legal proceedings, forensic evidence, including ink analysis, can be presented to the court to support a case. However, it's important to note that forensic analysis is not always definitive and might provide only probabilities or indications. The court considers all available evidence, including expert opinions, when making decisions.Consult with Forensic Experts:If you have concerns about the authenticity of a document or signature, you should consult with a forensic expert who specializes in ink analysis. They can provide insights into the feasibility of analyzing the ink's age and the potential significance of such analysis in your specific case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "If you want cancelling your marriage after the engagement, it’s important to remember that the engagement is like an agreement instead of a final contract. Therefore, any party to the engagement has right to repudiate it on a valid ground.Cancellation of the engagement is possible on valid grounds, and the aggrieved party is entitled to compensation and recovery of expenses incurred in the engagement ceremony. Be prepared to pay expenses and return all gifts received.Communicate clearly with the other party and their family.If the cancellation is due to dowry demands, the guilty party is liable under theDowry Prohibition Act. You said that your fiancé’s family is making false allegation of dowry. If you prove that the alleged allegation of dowry demand is false, then your fiancé’s family is not entitled to get compensation in lieu of cancellation of engagement.If you are threatened with false charges of dowry or harassment, document these threats for possible legal action.When they lodge FIR against you for demand of dowry then approach the High Court for the quashing of that FIR.

    "question": "What documents can I inspect under MCS Act and Cooperative Housing Society bye-laws",
    "answer": "1. As per the Society Model Bye Law No 22 to 24, a member has the right to inspect free of cost books, registers, documents etc. as provided in Section 32 (1) of the Act and get copies of the documents as provided under Section 32 (2) of the Act, on payment of the fees prescribed under the bye-law No. 172. This suggests that you should be able to access documents from before you became a member.2. If your society has not been sharing documents for the last 3 months, you could consider taking legal action. If documents are not made available to a member, the committee could be made to pay a fine. You may also file an appeal before the registrar of society or send a legal notice to the society.3. Regarding access to documents for different wings in your society, I couldn’t find specific information. However, if your society’s registration is common for both wings, it would seem logical that you should have access to documents for both wings.I hope this answer helpsy you!Sukumar JadhavAdvocate, Mumbai35 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sukumar Jadhav"

The exact documents you're entitled to inspect and the time frame for which you can request them might be outlined in the Cooperative Housing Society's Bylaws and the relevant Cooperative Society Acts. It's common for members to be allowed to inspect documents for a certain period of time, often the last 3-5 years.Non-Sharing of Documents:If the society is not providing you with the documents you have the right to inspect, you should follow these general steps:Check Bylaws and Laws: Verify what the Cooperative Housing Society's Bylaws and the applicable cooperative society legislation say about members' rights to inspect documents and the process for obtaining them.Written Request:Send a formal written request to the management committee, specifying the documents you are requesting and the reasons for your request. This creates a record of your attempt to access the documents.Access to Documents for B-Wing vs. A-Wing:Whether you have the right to access documents for the entire cooperative housing society, including both A-Wing and B-Wing, depends on the rules and regulations of the society .. In some cases, there might be restrictions on accessing documents specific to your wing only. However, if the registration of the cooperative housing society is common, you might have grounds to request access to documents related to the entire society.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Status of an earlier Indian marriage after one spouse becomes US citizen and implications on divorce",
    "answer": "1. Even if one of the spouses later becomes a US citizen, the marriage of two Indian nationals that took place and registered in India is often considered as valid. The marriage is still legitimate notwithstanding the wife's change of citizenship.2. If the husband wants to divorce, he can file for divorce in India where the marriage took place. However, he needs to fulfill the residency requirements. Even though the wife is now a US citizen, it’s still possible to file for divorce in the US. But according to the latest Supreme Court of India ruling, the grounds for divorce should be recognized by Indian law.3. In terms of alimony, it’s generally the husband who is ordered by the court to pay to the wife for sustenance, while and after undergoing a divorce. The court considers various parameters to decide on the amount to be given as alimony, including: income of the spouse(s), their standard of living and financial status. If the wife is working and drawing a salary that covers her living expenses, the court will certainly take that into consideration along with the husband’s income.Sukumar JadhavAdvocate, Mumbai35 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sukumar Jadhav"

Civil Action: You can file a civil suit in court for the recovery of property. This could involve filing a suit for declaration and possession, which is a legal remedy used to declare the rights of a party over a particular property. You could also consider filing a suit for partition if the property is jointly owned.2. Criminal Action: If you believe that your elder brother has fraudulently grabbed the property, you could consider filing a criminal complaint. This could involve lodging a complaint underSection 420(Cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) orSection 406(Punishment for criminal breach of trust) of theIndian Penal Code.3. Power of Attorney (PoA) Issue: If your elder brother has executed a fresh PoA in his name without proper authorization, this could potentially be challenged in court. The Supreme Court of India has held that a person given power of attorney over a property cannot sell the asset unless there is a specific provision giving him the power.4. Non-Registrable Property: If the property is non-registrable, it might be more challenging to retrieve documents and determine the status of the property.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Enforcement of DV Case through Section 128 CrPC:Section 128 of theCriminal Procedure Code(CrPC) deals with the execution of orders passed by a Magistrate. If there was a DV judgment (under Section 12 with various sub-sections) in May 2019 that directed maintenance for your minor daughter, she might be seeking enforcement of this maintenance order through Section 128 CrPC.Section 31 of the DV Act allows a Magistrate to grant interim and ex parte orders, and it's possible that due to the time elapsed since the judgment in May 2019, she might not be able to file under this section anymore. The reason for choosing Section 128 CrPC could be related to enforcement and execution of the existing DV judgment.Filing Section 128 CrPC Connected to DV Case:Whether she can file a petition under Section 128 CrPC connected to the DV case would depend on the laws and rules?You might be able to challenge the filing based on reasons such as delay, but whether the petition is maintainable would depend on precedents .How to Proceed:If you have evidence to support your claim that the allegations in the DV case were false, it's important to present this evidence to the court.Transfer of Visitation Rights Case and Challenge to Section 128 CrPC:Transferring the visitation rights case and challenging the Section 128 CrPC petition could be options, but the viability of these options would depend on the specific circumstances.Yes, you have strong grounds to believe that the police complaint and CSR could support your case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "In the case of A. Sivagnana Pandian v. M. Ravichandran, as documented in (2011) 2 MLJ (Crl) 595 and 596, the Madras High Court has emphasized the significance of employing various scientific techniques to ascertain the age of ink in a document. The court has proposed subjecting the document in question to tests recommended by experts in the field. This approach aligns with the court's adoption of the principles established in the cases of Kalyani Baskar v. M.S. Sampoornam (2007) 1 MLJ (Crl) 1020 and T. Nagappa v. Y.R. Mudaliar (2008) 2 MLJ (Crl) 956. The court's direction in this matter is to have the disputed document undergo examination through non-destructive methods, thereby affording the accused the opportunity to challenge any presumptions of law using credible evidence. Consequently, it is mandated that the contested document be referred to a government forensic laboratory for the application of such testing procedures. This measure ensures that a fair and well-founded assessment of the document's authenticity is carried out."

Therefore, any party to the engagement has right to repudiate it on a valid ground.Cancellation of the engagement is possible on valid grounds, and the aggrieved party is entitled to compensation and recovery of expenses incurred in the engagement ceremony. Be prepared to pay expenses and return all gifts received.Communicate clearly with the other party and their family.If the cancellation is due to dowry demands, the guilty party is liable under theDowry Prohibition Act. You said that your fiancé’s family is making false allegation of dowry. If you prove that the alleged allegation of dowry demand is false, then your fiancé’s family is not entitled to get compensation in lieu of cancellation of engagement.If you are threatened with false charges of dowry or harassment, document these threats for possible legal action.When they lodge FIR against you for demand of dowry then approach the High Court for the quashing of that FIR.

    "question": "Status of an earlier Indian marriage after one spouse becomes US citizen and implications on divorce",
    "answer": "1. Even if one of the spouses later becomes a US citizen, the marriage of two Indian nationals that took place and registered in India is often considered as valid. The marriage is still legitimate notwithstanding the wife's change of citizenship.2. If the husband wants to divorce, he can file for divorce in India where the marriage took place. However, he needs to fulfill the residency requirements. Even though the wife is now a US citizen, it’s still possible to file for divorce in the US. But according to the latest Supreme Court of India ruling, the grounds for divorce should be recognized by Indian law.3. In terms of alimony, it’s generally the husband who is ordered by the court to pay to the wife for sustenance, while and after undergoing a divorce. The court considers various parameters to decide on the amount to be given as alimony, including: income of the spouse(s), their standard of living and financial status. If the wife is working and drawing a salary that covers her living expenses, the court will certainly take that into consideration along with the husband’s income.Sukumar JadhavAdvocate, Mumbai35 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sukumar Jadhav"

This could involve lodging a complaint underSection 420(Cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) orSection 406(Punishment for criminal breach of trust) of theIndian Penal Code.3. Power of Attorney (PoA) Issue: If your elder brother has executed a fresh PoA in his name without proper authorization, this could potentially be challenged in court. The Supreme Court of India has held that a person given power of attorney over a property cannot sell the asset unless there is a specific provision giving him the power.4. Non-Registrable Property: If the property is non-registrable, it might be more challenging to retrieve documents and determine the status of the property.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In 1999, a sale deed was executed, clearly outlining an arrangement allocating 60 guntas of land among three sons, which was also acknowledged and confirmed by the remaining 5 children. Subsequently, in 2000, the three sons conducted a partition among themselves, and it's noteworthy that neither the sale deed nor the partition deed faced any challenges from the other sons and daughters over the span of 23 years. This unchallenged passage of time serves to firmly establish both the partition and the original agreement. Given the absence of current claims, there is a robust foundation to proceed with the purchase.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Purchase of Property: Before purchasing any property, it’s crucial to conduct a thorough due diligence process. This includes verifying the title deeds, checking for any encumbrances, and ensuring that all property taxes have been paid up to date. It’s also advisable to consult with a legal expert before proceeding with the purchase.Claim by Daughters: As per theHindu Succession Act, when a father dies intestate, his self-acquired property must be shared equally among his class 1 heirs including daughters. However, in your case, it appears that some of the daughters and sons have already relinquished their rights to the property through the registered sale deed of 1999. This could potentially act as a relinquishment of right by these 5 children.Protection for Sons: The sons could potentially be protected by Article 110 of the Limitation Act if the remaining 2 daughters had knowledge of the said sale in 1999 and registered partition in 2000, and 23 years have passed. The Limitation Act stipulates that any person who has been in possession of a property for an uninterrupted period of 12 years can claim ownership through adverse possession.Sukumar JadhavAdvocate, Mumbai35 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sukumar Jadhav"

    "answer": "In the case of A. Sivagnana Pandian v. M. Ravichandran, as documented in (2011) 2 MLJ (Crl) 595 and 596, the Madras High Court has emphasized the significance of employing various scientific techniques to ascertain the age of ink in a document. The court has proposed subjecting the document in question to tests recommended by experts in the field. This approach aligns with the court's adoption of the principles established in the cases of Kalyani Baskar v. M.S. Sampoornam (2007) 1 MLJ (Crl) 1020 and T. Nagappa v. Y.R. Mudaliar (2008) 2 MLJ (Crl) 956. The court's direction in this matter is to have the disputed document undergo examination through non-destructive methods, thereby affording the accused the opportunity to challenge any presumptions of law using credible evidence. Consequently, it is mandated that the contested document be referred to a government forensic laboratory for the application of such testing procedures. This measure ensures that a fair and well-founded assessment of the document's authenticity is carried out."

Techniques like Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC), Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) can be used to analyze ink samples.Aging of Ink:The aging of ink on paper can be influenced by factors like exposure to light, humidity, temperature, and chemical interactions. However, accurately determining the exact age of ink, especially over long periods, can be challenging.Availability of Techniques:Forensic analysis of ink is available in both government and private forensic laboratories in many countries, including India. However, the extent of capabilities can vary between labs.Legal Proceedings and Forensic Evidence:In legal proceedings, forensic evidence, including ink analysis, can be presented to the court to support a case. However, it's important to note that forensic analysis is not always definitive and might provide only probabilities or indications. The court considers all available evidence, including expert opinions, when making decisions.Consult with Forensic Experts:If you have concerns about the authenticity of a document or signature, you should consult with a forensic expert who specializes in ink analysis. They can provide insights into the feasibility of analyzing the ink's age and the potential significance of such analysis in your specific case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"
