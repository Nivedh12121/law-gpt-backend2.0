    "answer": "If the property has been held by the owners for over 2 years then the TDS in respect of sale of immovable property by sellers holding foreign citizenship is 20%+cess+Surcharge.The TDS is required to be deducted whenever any payment is made to the NRI for purchase of property.Even if the advance is being paid for purchase of property,  TDS is required to be deducted.Even if the value of property is less than Rs. 50 lakhs,  this TDS is required to be deducted.If the TDS is wrongly deducted or not deducted then the income tax department will not do anything to the seller but will catch hold of the buyer of the property to deposit the TDS. If the buyer forgot to deposit or deposit less amount towards TDS then the income tax department would recover the TDS from the buyer.Even if the seller has Indian pan card or AADHAR card,  he can still be considered a  NRI.  The residential status is determined only on the basis of number of days spent in India.If the seller gets a certificate from the income tax department for computation of capital gains,  the TDS may be deducted at a  lower rateT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Buying a flat from someone who has German citizenship - TDS Question",
    "answer": "Essential points to follow during finding out whether the seller is a resident or NRICountries’ citizenship does not matter during finding out if the seller is a resident or non-resident in India. Despite when an individual is a citizen of India however lives in a foreign country he will be recognized as a non-resident for income tax purposes. The income tax act does not discuss citizenship it only reveals the number of days spent in India.Despite if the seller owns an Indian Aadhaar card and PAN card he would still recognize as a non-resident in India.The number of days spent in India reveals the residential status of the person and it does not reveal on the grounds of the Aadhaar Card or PAN Card. The type of bank account of the seller does not have any influence on the residential status of the seller. It is due to the person does not convert his resident savings account to NRI bank accounts he would still acknowledge as a non-resident.You may ask the seller toobtain the certificate from the income tax department to calculate the capital gains that would diminish the TDS to be deducted.Various documents such as Purchase Price, Date of Purchase, any expenses on Renovation/ Construction, and others are needed to be submitted including with Form 13. The income tax officer would review these documents and if he accepted then he would provide a certificate for the lesser TDS deduction.When the seller would not able to get the certificate then the TDS shall be deducted on the sale value and would be rendered towards the surplus deduction of TDS.If the TDS is wrongly deducted or not deducted then the income tax department will not do anything to the seller but will catch hold of the buyer of the property to deposit the TDS. If the buyer forgot to deposit or deposit less amount towards TDS then the income tax department would recover the TDS from the buyer.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "From the facts presented, I understand that the PoA was 'attested' by the Indian Deputy High Commission in Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, and upon its arrival in India, it was notarized in Mumbai, but the UP registrar is refusing to accept it. As the stamp act varies from State to State in India, I am of the view that the UP registrar is asking for an adjudication (assessing for stamp duty) of the PoA. In the circumstances, execute a fresh PoA and get it either 'attested' by the Indian Dy. High Commission OR 'notarized' in the UK, and send it to your mother. Then, upon its arrival in India, ask her to get it 'adjudicated' by the UP registrar, within three months.Swaminathan NeelakantanAdvocate, Coimbatore3023 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Swaminathan Neelakantan"

    "answer": "1. i dont know how even s.340 applies since that pertains to -in respect of a document produced or given in evidence in a proceeding in that Court2.the 7/11 application has to be decided first since it goes to the root of the matter. if the other side does not file its reply then press for a 'no say' order. for a decision on 7/11 application the court only has to look into the averments in the plaint and NOT the defence of the defendant. since the P has not yet filed his reply to the 7/11 application, you can request the court to peruse the plaint and adjudicate if any of the clauses under 7/11 are applicable for rejecting the plaint.also there is no bar to deciding the 11/16 application despite pendency of the 7/11 application since by the 11/16 application the applicant only seeks that the other side produce documents which he has relied in his pleadings. so a Court would have the jurisdiction to pass an order on the 11/16 even if 7/11 is pending since the jurisdiction of the court to pass such an order is not affected. had it been a case of 7/10 application for return of plaint then the court would have lacked the jurisdiction to pass any order at all in the suitYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Hello,It is unlikely for the police to register an FIR for stalking or criminal intimidation as his wife and child are residing with you. You must however, file a complaint with the police stating the relevant facts and the constant harassment and nuisance caused by him. The police can certainly warn him and restrain him from troubling you any further.The lady can file a case ofDomestic violenceagainst her husband and seek protection that includes a prohibitory/restraining  order, order for maintenance for her and the child and residence.If the lady has decided not to live with the abusive husband, she must file for divorce on grounds of cruelty and she stands a better chance to get custody of the child.The court decision in a divorce petition can take 2-3 years. Restraining order can be obtained as stated in a DV complaint.For your safety, you must allow the domestic help to interact with the lawyer directly and besides make her file a complaint with the local police against her husband with all the details of her stay with you and the harassment that has driven her to you to seek help. Keep a copy of the complaint with you.S J MathewAdvocate, Mumbai3603 Answers175 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate S J Mathew"

    "question": "Khata for DC converted land",
    "answer": "If you have already purchased the property by a registered document then there is no necessity for registration of property once again.Form 9 verifies that the location is within the village, whereas Form 11B property is a registry that indicates who is accountable for tax payment. Both the panchayat development officer (PDO) and the gram panchayat secretary issue these forms.Form-9 and Form-11 are basicallyused to aid the collection of property tax. However, these forms are also mandatory for registration of non-agricultural properties that fall under the jurisdiction of GPs, as per the Revenue department circular number RD 344 MUNOMU 2005 dated 6 April 2009.The Town planning authority has approved the construction plan and accordingly they have allotted space for parking vehicles, which is the one what you mention as 0.5 acres.However since this space is also part of the schedule of property as mentioned in the registered sale document on your name, you have to obtain khata for the entire proeprty.You may find that the entire area or the entire schedule of property has been  mentioned in the manually issued khata.Thus if the E-khata is showing a different extent of property you may have to apply for rectification of the same and get it corrected to the property extent as shown in the registered deed.If the additional kharab land is not part of the schedule of property as per the registered sale deed, then you may not be able to get the same mentioned in the e-khata, but you can produce the evidence of possession and try to get khata for that alsoT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Dear client, you can buy e-khata.E-katha property in Village limits ( This is referred to as 11B property —. As per e-swathu website ), this property is D.C converted. As per my knowledge, the BBMP limits is definitely going to increase, as many apartments in the outskirts can be included to add tax revenue ( govt is not going to provide any facilities, they look at the way they can increase the tax collection and bribe for them to survive.)If your individual DC converted plot has E-Katha it equivalent to A Katha property in BBMP limits,since the property is already assigned PID( In village panchayat there is no concept of B katha and A katha) . Secondly, D.C converted properties that are registered before June 2013 in village limits can only get E-Katha for the D.C converted individual plot. Also, there is a fine line to be considered don't confuse with E-Katha for the entire layout. A D.C converted layout which is developed after June 2013 cannot obtain E-Katha for the individual plot if it is not BMRDA approved. Please use E-swathu website to check whether the property can be registered or not.Do not confuse 11B properties (Village panchayat) with B Katha properties (BBMP). Form 11B e-Katha properties are D.C converted properties, these properties can be registered without form 9 if you have an E-katha 11B property form. Please read below in the E-Katha section which is clearly mentioned with a note.B katha properties are revenue properties in BBMP limits, which are not converted and No one issues E-Katha for these propertiesAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "POA from wife for Purchase of Land",
    "answer": "1. Earlier in order to save stamp duty people used to sell property by giving an irrevocable POA to purchaser alongwith a Will in which the property being sold would be bequeathed to the purchaser. The irrevocable poa would authorize the purchaser to do various things in respect of the property which an owner can do. Both the irrevocable poa and Will attracted no stamp duty. So SC held that such property transactions are illegal. In your case that is not so. Your wife is only giving you a poa to sign on the sale deed on her behalf and to complete the registration formalities on your behalf. Full stamp duty will be paid on the sale deed. In the cases before SC the parties did not enter into any sale deed which attracted stamp duty2. Title will be clear. You are only acting as her poa restricted for the aforesaid purpose3.

    "answer": "If you have already purchased the property by a registered document then there is no necessity for registration of property once again.Form 9 verifies that the location is within the village, whereas Form 11B property is a registry that indicates who is accountable for tax payment. Both the panchayat development officer (PDO) and the gram panchayat secretary issue these forms.Form-9 and Form-11 are basicallyused to aid the collection of property tax. However, these forms are also mandatory for registration of non-agricultural properties that fall under the jurisdiction of GPs, as per the Revenue department circular number RD 344 MUNOMU 2005 dated 6 April 2009.The Town planning authority has approved the construction plan and accordingly they have allotted space for parking vehicles, which is the one what you mention as 0.5 acres.However since this space is also part of the schedule of property as mentioned in the registered sale document on your name, you have to obtain khata for the entire proeprty.You may find that the entire area or the entire schedule of property has been  mentioned in the manually issued khata.Thus if the E-khata is showing a different extent of property you may have to apply for rectification of the same and get it corrected to the property extent as shown in the registered deed.If the additional kharab land is not part of the schedule of property as per the registered sale deed, then you may not be able to get the same mentioned in the e-khata, but you can produce the evidence of possession and try to get khata for that alsoT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

As per my knowledge, the BBMP limits is definitely going to increase, as many apartments in the outskirts can be included to add tax revenue ( govt is not going to provide any facilities, they look at the way they can increase the tax collection and bribe for them to survive.)If your individual DC converted plot has E-Katha it equivalent to A Katha property in BBMP limits,since the property is already assigned PID( In village panchayat there is no concept of B katha and A katha) . Secondly, D.C converted properties that are registered before June 2013 in village limits can only get E-Katha for the D.C converted individual plot. Also, there is a fine line to be considered don't confuse with E-Katha for the entire layout. A D.C converted layout which is developed after June 2013 cannot obtain E-Katha for the individual plot if it is not BMRDA approved. Please use E-swathu website to check whether the property can be registered or not.Do not confuse 11B properties (Village panchayat) with B Katha properties (BBMP). Form 11B e-Katha properties are D.C converted properties, these properties can be registered without form 9 if you have an E-katha 11B property form.

    "question": "POA from wife for Purchase of Land",
    "answer": "1. Earlier in order to save stamp duty people used to sell property by giving an irrevocable POA to purchaser alongwith a Will in which the property being sold would be bequeathed to the purchaser. The irrevocable poa would authorize the purchaser to do various things in respect of the property which an owner can do. Both the irrevocable poa and Will attracted no stamp duty. So SC held that such property transactions are illegal. In your case that is not so. Your wife is only giving you a poa to sign on the sale deed on her behalf and to complete the registration formalities on your behalf. Full stamp duty will be paid on the sale deed. In the cases before SC the parties did not enter into any sale deed which attracted stamp duty2. Title will be clear. You are only acting as her poa restricted for the aforesaid purpose3.

    "question": "POA from wife for Purchase of Land",
    "answer": "1. Earlier in order to save stamp duty people used to sell property by giving an irrevocable POA to purchaser alongwith a Will in which the property being sold would be bequeathed to the purchaser. The irrevocable poa would authorize the purchaser to do various things in respect of the property which an owner can do. Both the irrevocable poa and Will attracted no stamp duty. So SC held that such property transactions are illegal. In your case that is not so. Your wife is only giving you a poa to sign on the sale deed on her behalf and to complete the registration formalities on your behalf. Full stamp duty will be paid on the sale deed. In the cases before SC the parties did not enter into any sale deed which attracted stamp duty2. Title will be clear. You are only acting as her poa restricted for the aforesaid purpose3.

    "answer": "1. Earlier in order to save stamp duty people used to sell property by giving an irrevocable POA to purchaser alongwith a Will in which the property being sold would be bequeathed to the purchaser. The irrevocable poa would authorize the purchaser to do various things in respect of the property which an owner can do. Both the irrevocable poa and Will attracted no stamp duty. So SC held that such property transactions are illegal. In your case that is not so. Your wife is only giving you a poa to sign on the sale deed on her behalf and to complete the registration formalities on your behalf. Full stamp duty will be paid on the sale deed. In the cases before SC the parties did not enter into any sale deed which attracted stamp duty2. Title will be clear. You are only acting as her poa restricted for the aforesaid purpose3.

    "answer": "1. Earlier in order to save stamp duty people used to sell property by giving an irrevocable POA to purchaser alongwith a Will in which the property being sold would be bequeathed to the purchaser. The irrevocable poa would authorize the purchaser to do various things in respect of the property which an owner can do. Both the irrevocable poa and Will attracted no stamp duty. So SC held that such property transactions are illegal. In your case that is not so. Your wife is only giving you a poa to sign on the sale deed on her behalf and to complete the registration formalities on your behalf. Full stamp duty will be paid on the sale deed.

The irrevocable poa would authorize the purchaser to do various things in respect of the property which an owner can do. Both the irrevocable poa and Will attracted no stamp duty. So SC held that such property transactions are illegal. In your case that is not so. Your wife is only giving you a poa to sign on the sale deed on her behalf and to complete the registration formalities on your behalf. Full stamp duty will be paid on the sale deed.

    "answer": "In 2011, the Supreme Court ruled thatproperty sale through power of attorney (PoA) is illegaland only registered sale deeds provide any legal holding to property transactions.The legislation defined the power of attorney as an instrument empowering a specified person to do any act on behalf of the person executing the transaction,.This power of attorney deed  that your wife would be executing in your favor is for authorising you to purchase of property on her behalf.This has nothing to do with the supreme court judgment in this regard.The title to the property shall be transferred to her name by the seller and the power agent is just an instrument to  make it happen in her absence to sign the deed on her behalf.The power of attorney given in anyone's favor has to be by a registered document and the principal has to appear before the registrar to get it registered. However it may not be necessary for the power agent to be present before the registrar to confirm the acceptance.Owing to the convenience it provides, a POA is also handy for extremely busy people, such as businessmen and people who cannot perform various personal and professional tasks.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Joint Sale Deed",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard.In case of Maktul vs. Mst. Manbhari & Others  (1958) Supreme Court held that 'ancestral property' used in the ordinary meaning, viz., property which devolves upon a person from his ancestor and not in the restricted sense of the Hindu law which imports the idea of the acquisition of interest on birth by a son jointly with his father. In case of a classified ancestral property that has remained undivided, four generations of the male lineage have their claim. Basically, the father, the grandfather, the great grandfather and the great-great grandfather have inheritance rights over an undivided ancestral property. This means, say, on Ram’s ancestral property, his son Shyam, Shyam’s son Ghanshyam and Ghanshyam’s son Radhe Shyam have inheritance rights.As per Hindu Law, a person automatically acquires the right to his or her share in the ancestral property at the time of their birth. An ancestral property is the one which is inherited up to four generations of male lineage. A property is regarded ancestral under two conditions - if it is inherited by the father from his father that is the grandfather after his death; or inherited from the grandfather who partitioned the property during his lifetime.As per the facts you mentioned, the property cannot be ancestral in nature as per the settled law in India. Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete facts (documents).You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal Verma,Advocate on Record & Amicus Curiae,Supreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, Delhi418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma"

The irrevocable poa would authorize the purchaser to do various things in respect of the property which an owner can do. Both the irrevocable poa and Will attracted no stamp duty. So SC held that such property transactions are illegal. In your case that is not so. Your wife is only giving you a poa to sign on the sale deed on her behalf and to complete the registration formalities on your behalf. Full stamp duty will be paid on the sale deed.

    "answer": "1. Earlier in order to save stamp duty people used to sell property by giving an irrevocable POA to purchaser alongwith a Will in which the property being sold would be bequeathed to the purchaser. The irrevocable poa would authorize the purchaser to do various things in respect of the property which an owner can do. Both the irrevocable poa and Will attracted no stamp duty. So SC held that such property transactions are illegal. In your case that is not so. Your wife is only giving you a poa to sign on the sale deed on her behalf and to complete the registration formalities on your behalf. Full stamp duty will be paid on the sale deed. In the cases before SC the parties did not enter into any sale deed which attracted stamp duty2. Title will be clear. You are only acting as her poa restricted for the aforesaid purpose3.

    "question": "Joint Sale Deed",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard.In case of Maktul vs. Mst. Manbhari & Others  (1958) Supreme Court held that 'ancestral property' used in the ordinary meaning, viz., property which devolves upon a person from his ancestor and not in the restricted sense of the Hindu law which imports the idea of the acquisition of interest on birth by a son jointly with his father. In case of a classified ancestral property that has remained undivided, four generations of the male lineage have their claim. Basically, the father, the grandfather, the great grandfather and the great-great grandfather have inheritance rights over an undivided ancestral property. This means, say, on Ram’s ancestral property, his son Shyam, Shyam’s son Ghanshyam and Ghanshyam’s son Radhe Shyam have inheritance rights.As per Hindu Law, a person automatically acquires the right to his or her share in the ancestral property at the time of their birth. An ancestral property is the one which is inherited up to four generations of male lineage. A property is regarded ancestral under two conditions - if it is inherited by the father from his father that is the grandfather after his death; or inherited from the grandfather who partitioned the property during his lifetime.As per the facts you mentioned, the property cannot be ancestral in nature as per the settled law in India.

    "answer": "1. Earlier in order to save stamp duty people used to sell property by giving an irrevocable POA to purchaser alongwith a Will in which the property being sold would be bequeathed to the purchaser. The irrevocable poa would authorize the purchaser to do various things in respect of the property which an owner can do. Both the irrevocable poa and Will attracted no stamp duty. So SC held that such property transactions are illegal. In your case that is not so. Your wife is only giving you a poa to sign on the sale deed on her behalf and to complete the registration formalities on your behalf. Full stamp duty will be paid on the sale deed. In the cases before SC the parties did not enter into any sale deed which attracted stamp duty2. Title will be clear. You are only acting as her poa restricted for the aforesaid purpose3.

    "question": "Joint Sale Deed",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard.In case of Maktul vs. Mst. Manbhari & Others  (1958) Supreme Court held that 'ancestral property' used in the ordinary meaning, viz., property which devolves upon a person from his ancestor and not in the restricted sense of the Hindu law which imports the idea of the acquisition of interest on birth by a son jointly with his father. In case of a classified ancestral property that has remained undivided, four generations of the male lineage have their claim. Basically, the father, the grandfather, the great grandfather and the great-great grandfather have inheritance rights over an undivided ancestral property. This means, say, on Ram’s ancestral property, his son Shyam, Shyam’s son Ghanshyam and Ghanshyam’s son Radhe Shyam have inheritance rights.As per Hindu Law, a person automatically acquires the right to his or her share in the ancestral property at the time of their birth. An ancestral property is the one which is inherited up to four generations of male lineage. A property is regarded ancestral under two conditions - if it is inherited by the father from his father that is the grandfather after his death; or inherited from the grandfather who partitioned the property during his lifetime.As per the facts you mentioned, the property cannot be ancestral in nature as per the settled law in India. Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete facts (documents).You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal Verma,Advocate on Record & Amicus Curiae,Supreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, Delhi418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma"

    "question": "POA from wife for Purchase of Land",
    "answer": "1. Earlier in order to save stamp duty people used to sell property by giving an irrevocable POA to purchaser alongwith a Will in which the property being sold would be bequeathed to the purchaser. The irrevocable poa would authorize the purchaser to do various things in respect of the property which an owner can do. Both the irrevocable poa and Will attracted no stamp duty. So SC held that such property transactions are illegal. In your case that is not so. Your wife is only giving you a poa to sign on the sale deed on her behalf and to complete the registration formalities on your behalf. Full stamp duty will be paid on the sale deed. In the cases before SC the parties did not enter into any sale deed which attracted stamp duty2. Title will be clear. You are only acting as her poa restricted for the aforesaid purpose3.

    "question": "Joint Sale Deed",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard.In case of Maktul vs. Mst. Manbhari & Others  (1958) Supreme Court held that 'ancestral property' used in the ordinary meaning, viz., property which devolves upon a person from his ancestor and not in the restricted sense of the Hindu law which imports the idea of the acquisition of interest on birth by a son jointly with his father. In case of a classified ancestral property that has remained undivided, four generations of the male lineage have their claim. Basically, the father, the grandfather, the great grandfather and the great-great grandfather have inheritance rights over an undivided ancestral property. This means, say, on Ram’s ancestral property, his son Shyam, Shyam’s son Ghanshyam and Ghanshyam’s son Radhe Shyam have inheritance rights.As per Hindu Law, a person automatically acquires the right to his or her share in the ancestral property at the time of their birth. An ancestral property is the one which is inherited up to four generations of male lineage. A property is regarded ancestral under two conditions - if it is inherited by the father from his father that is the grandfather after his death; or inherited from the grandfather who partitioned the property during his lifetime.As per the facts you mentioned, the property cannot be ancestral in nature as per the settled law in India.

The  judge is totally ignorant of law and directions issued by SC. The  case is Y. Narsimha Rao v. Y. Venkat Lakshimi where the  SC declared such divorce decrees are invalid and illegal.What ever the grounds urged in U.S. that is not even material for consideration.Ravi ShindeAdvocate, Hyderabad4923 Answers42 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ravi Shinde"

    "question": "Married in India under Special Marriage Act but divorced in USA",
    "answer": "The exparte divorce obtained by your husband in USA is not valid in India.The 'no fault divorce' decree granted by US court is not legally valid or recognised as legally valid divorce for the marriages conducted in India as per Indian laws.A divorce decree obtained in a Foreign Country will not be recognized in India when it is not satisfied the condition that even though the opposite side may have been served but not appearing and the decision was taken in the absence of another party to the case.Parties to the divorce must have had the opportunity to represent their case in the foreign court. To recognize a foreign divorce decree, the court in India will ensure that there was fairness, good faith, and diligence of each party.Indian courts will not recognize a divorce decree obtained in the US if the grounds are not recognized by the Indian divorce law.If the family court in India is not passing a divorce decree even after satisfying the grounds pleaded in the petition for divorce and arguments made in your favor, you may prefer an appeal before high court agaisnt the decision.You can inform the court since the divorce granted by US court has no validity as per Indian laws, there is no necessity for you to produce the divorce decree copies before this court, but since you have filed the divorce case here, the court may be requested to pass orders on merits.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

Earlier in order to save stamp duty people used to sell property by giving an irrevocable POA to purchaser alongwith a Will in which the property being sold would be bequeathed to the purchaser. The irrevocable poa would authorize the purchaser to do various things in respect of the property which an owner can do. Both the irrevocable poa and Will attracted no stamp duty. So SC held that such property transactions are illegal. In your case that is not so. Your wife is only giving you a poa to sign on the sale deed on her behalf and to complete the registration formalities on your behalf. Full stamp duty will be paid on the sale deed. In the cases before SC the parties did not enter into any sale deed which attracted stamp duty2. Title will be clear. You are only acting as her poa restricted for the aforesaid purpose3.

    "answer": "1. Earlier in order to save stamp duty people used to sell property by giving an irrevocable POA to purchaser alongwith a Will in which the property being sold would be bequeathed to the purchaser. The irrevocable poa would authorize the purchaser to do various things in respect of the property which an owner can do. Both the irrevocable poa and Will attracted no stamp duty. So SC held that such property transactions are illegal. In your case that is not so. Your wife is only giving you a poa to sign on the sale deed on her behalf and to complete the registration formalities on your behalf. Full stamp duty will be paid on the sale deed. In the cases before SC the parties did not enter into any sale deed which attracted stamp duty2. Title will be clear. You are only acting as her poa restricted for the aforesaid purpose3.

    "question": "Joint Sale Deed",
    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard.In case of Maktul vs. Mst. Manbhari & Others  (1958) Supreme Court held that 'ancestral property' used in the ordinary meaning, viz., property which devolves upon a person from his ancestor and not in the restricted sense of the Hindu law which imports the idea of the acquisition of interest on birth by a son jointly with his father. In case of a classified ancestral property that has remained undivided, four generations of the male lineage have their claim. Basically, the father, the grandfather, the great grandfather and the great-great grandfather have inheritance rights over an undivided ancestral property. This means, say, on Ram’s ancestral property, his son Shyam, Shyam’s son Ghanshyam and Ghanshyam’s son Radhe Shyam have inheritance rights.As per Hindu Law, a person automatically acquires the right to his or her share in the ancestral property at the time of their birth. An ancestral property is the one which is inherited up to four generations of male lineage. A property is regarded ancestral under two conditions - if it is inherited by the father from his father that is the grandfather after his death; or inherited from the grandfather who partitioned the property during his lifetime.As per the facts you mentioned, the property cannot be ancestral in nature as per the settled law in India. Detailed discussion is required in such cases with complete facts (documents).You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal Verma,Advocate on Record & Amicus Curiae,Supreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, Delhi418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma"

Under Muslim Law, there are two forms ofmutual consent divorce, namely: Khula and Mubarat.- Under Khula, the wife can give or agree to give a consideration to the husband for her release from the marriage tie , and also can relieve the husband from payment of Mahr to the wife .- Under Mubarat, both husband and wife are against the continuation of marriage and want to separate.Either the husband or the wife can make the offer.The other must accept it.When accepted, it becomes irrevocableIddat period necessary-  Among the  the Sunnis when the parties to marriage enter into a mubarat all mutual rights and obligations come to an end, but in the Shias insist on a proper form. The Shias insist that the word mubarat should be followed by the word talaq, otherwise no divorce would result.- However, In both, Shias and Sunnis, mubarat is irrevocable.- Further in both the form , the wife must undergo the period of iddat , and in both form , the divorce can take place under the supervision of Qazi , and no intervention by the court is required.- For getting divorce from the court , you will have file a petition for mutual divorce under the Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act, 1939 in the family court or District Judge.- Hence , for getting mutual divorce , both consent should be there , and if one party not agrees , then it cannot take place legally , and will have to file divorce petition .2.

    "question": "Procedure for Mubarath and Can wife take U - turn after taking lumpsum alimony",
    "answer": "Mubarat: Under this method of divorcing under the Islamic law, both wife and husband are not ready to live together anymore and want to get separated as soon as possible dissolving the marriage.The husband or the wife, either of them can make the offer.The other spouse must need to accept the divorce proposal.Once it is accepted by the other partner, it becomes irremediable.Iddat period is mandatory before the divorce is approved.the wife must have to follow the period of iddat;  a divorce is basically an act of both the partners and thus, no intervention by the court is entertained.Since this is a dissolution of marriage by mutual consent as per Muslim personal law (Shariat law), there is no necessity to file any petition before court, however the mubarathnama can be written through a Moulvi of the mosque that you belong to.This document may be produced by her before court while she is withdrawing all the cases filed by her against you in court of law.The conditions and the terms may be reduced to writing and get it attested before the Jamath.For all your subsequent queries that in case wife is playing fraud after the 'mubarath' has been finalised, then you may produce your copy of the mubarathnama which contains the signature of both and duly attested by the Jamath, before court and get her false cases dismissed if in case she resorts to such dirty habits in future.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Procedure for Mubarath and Can wife take U - turn after taking lumpsum alimony",
    "answer": "As a Muslim, the  Talaq-e-Ahesan given by you has reached finality after your expiry of third notice. Mubarat/Khula by her is now redundant. Obtain a Talaqnamha from Wakf Board signed by Kazi. This is absolute proof of divorce for a Muslim.So far as withdrawal of Section 125, if she agrees to withdraw it, you can keep the  settlement amount with a third person acceptable to both and after withdrawal of 125  petition, the  third person will hand over the  settlement money to her. She has not choice but to accept the  Talaq-e-Ahesan. It is irrevocable and absolute.There is no guarantee that after settlement she will not file any criminal cases under DV, 498A, DP Act etc. She cannot be restrained from filing such cases as any agreement in restrain of legal proceeding is void and not enforceable. You can involve elders of Jamath in reaching an understanding that she will not file any cases. Even after that she files such cases, you can take assistance elders of Jamath in your favor to fight the  cases.Ravi ShindeAdvocate, Hyderabad4923 Answers42 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ravi Shinde"

    "question": "Procedure for Mubarath and Can wife take U - turn after taking lumpsum alimony",
    "answer": "1. Under Muslim Law, there are two forms ofmutual consent divorce, namely: Khula and Mubarat.- Under Khula, the wife can give or agree to give a consideration to the husband for her release from the marriage tie , and also can relieve the husband from payment of Mahr to the wife .- Under Mubarat, both husband and wife are against the continuation of marriage and want to separate.Either the husband or the wife can make the offer.The other must accept it.When accepted, it becomes irrevocableIddat period necessary-  Among the  the Sunnis when the parties to marriage enter into a mubarat all mutual rights and obligations come to an end, but in the Shias insist on a proper form. The Shias insist that the word mubarat should be followed by the word talaq, otherwise no divorce would result.- However, In both, Shias and Sunnis, mubarat is irrevocable.- Further in both the form , the wife must undergo the period of iddat , and in both form , the divorce can take place under the supervision of Qazi , and no intervention by the court is required.- For getting divorce from the court , you will have file a petition for mutual divorce under the Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act, 1939 in the family court or District Judge.- Hence , for getting mutual divorce , both consent should be there , and if one party not agrees , then it cannot take place legally , and will have to file divorce petition .2. Yes, you should enter into an agreement with her after mentioning the conditions of payment and divorce , and you can produce the same before the court on her refusal to proceed for divorce.3. Two motions of HMA not applied in Muslim law mutual divorce4. After getting divorce under the Mubarat , she cannot file any case against you .Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "The exparte divorce obtained by your husband in USA is not valid in India.The 'no fault divorce' decree granted by US court is not legally valid or recognised as legally valid divorce for the marriages conducted in India as per Indian laws.A divorce decree obtained in a Foreign Country will not be recognized in India when it is not satisfied the condition that even though the opposite side may have been served but not appearing and the decision was taken in the absence of another party to the case.Parties to the divorce must have had the opportunity to represent their case in the foreign court. To recognize a foreign divorce decree, the court in India will ensure that there was fairness, good faith, and diligence of each party.Indian courts will not recognize a divorce decree obtained in the US if the grounds are not recognized by the Indian divorce law.If the family court in India is not passing a divorce decree even after satisfying the grounds pleaded in the petition for divorce and arguments made in your favor, you may prefer an appeal before high court agaisnt the decision.You can inform the court since the divorce granted by US court has no validity as per Indian laws, there is no necessity for you to produce the divorce decree copies before this court, but since you have filed the divorce case here, the court may be requested to pass orders on merits.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Regd Agreement of sale along regd GPA year 1995",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,It is very complicated matter and even courts cannot give correct answer and always the person who is in physical possession of property will enjoy the benefits.  The last transaction seems to be valid transaction and immediately the last purchaser shall change Katha in his name on the basis of last sale deed as it was executed by original owner. The Supreme Court put a stop for the sales by way of Power of Attorney. The updated law on the above subject is as follows:===================================================================Imp points on Power of Attorney by NRIA property transaction through Power of Attorney executed by NRI calls for extra checks/scrutiny. A sale deed can be declared NULL and VOID because of a small mistake or error in the execution of Power of Attorney by NRI. Sometimes these errors/mistakes are intentional and most of the times unintentional. In recent past, i came across multiple cases wherein a property transaction was challenged based on error/mistake in the execution of Power of Attorney (POA) by NRI. In many cases, the status of NRI is being concealed by his lawyer/CA in POA to avoid TDS. An NRI executing POA in India cannot declare his/her status as Resident Indian. As i keep highlighting that a buyer or seller in India should mention the status of another party in sale deed to avoid any future tax disputes. A case of the false declaration in sale deed may not put the onus of concealment of facts on the resident Indian in the property transaction.My general observation is that Resident Indian’s are not aware of do’s and don’t of Power of Attorney executed by NRI. Even professional help does not help in most of the cases due to lack of knowledge. A Power of Attorney is issued by NRI if he/she cannot be physically present in India for the execution of property transaction. As a buyer or seller, you should insist on the physical presence of NRI Buyer/Seller in India for sale deed. It will avoid a lot of future hassles. The risk is HIGH if the buyer is Resident Indian, and Seller is NRI, who is represented by Power of Attorney holder. In this post, we will discuss this particular scenario for simplicity purpose. Though it is equally important if a seller is Resident Indian, and Power of Attorney holder represents the NRI Buyer. Reason being, it is important to trace money trail from NRI buyer i.e. whether money is being properly channeled for the property transaction. Let’s check important points or Do’s and Dont’s by Resident Indian Buyer if the transaction is through Power of Attorney by NRI.Reason for Execution of Power of AttorneyA resident Indian buyer should AVOID property transaction through Power of Attorney holder of an NRI. The best case scenario is the presence of an NRI seller in India for execution of sale deed. Sometimes the circumstances do not permit so a buyer you should check the reason for the execution of Power of Attorney. The reason should be reasonable and logical. If the buyer is convinced with the reasoning, then he should insist that NRI Seller should include this particular reason, in Power of Attorney. In short, the purpose/reason for the execution of a power of attorney should be clearly mentioned in the Power of Attorney.Process to Execute Power of AttorneyThe most critical step is to check whether the Power of Attorney is executed as per the laid down process. It’s a 2 step process i.e. attestation of POA at Indian Consulate/Embassy and the registration of same in India. Attestation of POA is required even if the seller is not an NRI i.e. not completed 180 days outside India. On the other hand, if NRI executes POA on Indian Soil then attestation is not required. In short, a POA executed on foreign soil irrespective of the status of a seller require attestation at Indian Consulate/Embassy. The registration process in India follows it. Let me highlight steps/checks for a buyer.Step1:NRI seller creates two copies of Power of Attorney with detailed terms and conditions. As a buyer, you should go through each and every clause carefully to understand the content.Step 2:Check whether the POA is signed by two witnesses present in the country of residence of a seller.Step 3:Check whether the witnesses were physically present in Indian Consulate/Embassy at the time of signature or not. If they were not physically present, then their signatures should be attested by the Local Notary.Step 4:The POA should be attested by the Indian Consulate/Embassy.Step 5:TheAttested POAshould be registered in the India by the resident Indian i.e. POA holder. The registration process in India should be completed within three months from the date of execution of POA. The POA can be registered in SDM (Sub Divisional Magistrate) office or Sub-Registrar Office. The rule may vary from state to state.The relation between the NRI and POA holder should be mentioned in the POA. Preferably the details of ID proof of a POA holder issued by Indian Govt should be specified in the POA. The buyer retains the original copy of Power of Attorney for future reference.Also, note that in some cases POA holder simply notarize the POA in India instead of registering it in SDM or Sub-registrar office. A “Notarized POA” is not the same as “Registered POA”. A notarized POA is legally not valid in India. A POA executed by NRI on foreign soil should be registered in SDM or Sub-Registrar office.Payment to NRI SellerIn a recent case, i observed that buyer was cheated by Power of Attorney holder of an NRI Seller. It’s a misconception that payment towards property transaction should be transferred to POA holder. Please understand that Power of Attorney holder is only a representative of an NRI seller. The resident Indian buyer should make payment only to the NRI seller in his her NRE/NRO account. An NRI seller can authorize POA holder to accept payment on his behalf but cannot authorize payment to POA holder. Even if NRI seller authorizes POA holder to receive direct payment, the buyer should avoid such property transactions. It may land a buyer in tax trouble.In the case of multiple NRI sellers, the payment should be transferred in the proportion of ownership in the property to each seller. In another case, one of my clients was cheated by NRI Seller. NRI couple jointly held the property. There was a dispute between husband and wife & my client was not aware of same. NRI husband insisted on transferring 100% consideration value in his account. After the deal had been done, the wife of a seller filed a case of cheating and fraud by his husband. Therefore, all the payment should be made in the proportion of ownership in the property. Each of the sellers should execute separate Power of Attorney.TDS u/s 195In one of the case, my client received notice for not deducting TDS u/s 195. In my post, How to deduct TDS on NRI u/s 195? i explained this in detail. In this case, the transaction was completed by POA holder. The POA holder told my client that as she (POA holder)  is resident Indian therefore relevant TDS will be 1% u/s 194IA. Again i would like to clarify that POA holder is only a representative of NRI Seller. The TDS will be deducted u/s 195 in the case of NRI seller. The only exception is if NRI seller produces NIL or Lower Tax deduction certificate that i explained in my post How NRI’s can lower TDS on property sale?.Indemnity ClauseLastly, each property transaction is unique with multiple permutations and combinations. Therefore, a buyer can safeguard his/her financial interests by including a blanket indemnity clause in the sale deed. To avoid being caught on the wrong side also ensure that sale deed clauses are in concurrence with the terms and conditions of the POA. It will eliminate any possibility of legal/tax hassles.Concluding Remarks:If you are buying/selling property from NRI then it is advisable to seek professional help to avoid any unpleasant surprises in future. The rules and regulations governing such transactions are bit complicated, especially on the taxation front. Always remember that Indian Law or Tax Authorities will not have any jurisdiction on the NRI residing abroad. On the other hand, a buyer who is resident Indian cannot escape the Indian Law/Tax Authorities. Moreover, the 100% onus of legal/tax compliance rests with the Resident Indian buyer.http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/property-sale-through-gpa-not-valid/1/154711.htmlNo property sale on power of attorney: Supreme CourtThe court rules that transfer through general power of attorney cannot give ownesrship title to the buyer.Property sales through the common practice of general power of attorney (GPA) will not give ownership title to the buyer.In a landmark judgment that is expected to send a large number of property owners into a tizzy, the Supreme Court held that the GPA method of immovable property sales is not a valid form of transfer of property.A three-judge bench presided over by Justice R. V. Raveendran said that property can be lawfully transferred only through registered sale deeds.\"A power of attorney is not an instrument of transfer in regard to any right, title or interest in an immovable property,\" the bench said, after interpreting various provisions of the law concerning property sales. However, the bench said the judgment will not affect \"genuine transactions\" under the GPA.The judgment delivered on Wednesday would have an impact on both freehold and leasehold properties and affect the mode of transfer of property in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) where GPA sales are very common. Even though it can cause some hardship to those who have already purchased property through the GPA, the order will help curb evasion of duties, flow of black money into real estate and also save people from being cheated by unscrupulous owners selling the same property to several people.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, Bangalore6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar"

In that case there's no need for adjudication of the registered GPA now.2.  Yes, the Specific performance case is barred by limitation. However you can make an attempt and pray for condonation of delay and in case your prayer is accepted for condonation of delay, then you can proceed with specific performance against the seller.3.  As you have rightly suggested, you can seek injunction instead of refund of advance amount.4.  When the seller has acknowledged receipt for having received the full consideration, I wonder what prevented you from taking further action to your advantage then. Better late than never.5.  It will be to your advantage that the seller has acknowledged the full and final settlement towards the purchase of property.6.  The buyer or his POA can file the suit in the jurisdictional Forum. The main impediment is inordinate delay and is barred by limitation. If the delay could be condoned, then only there's chance.Shashidhar S.

    "context": "Asked 2 years ago in Civil Law",
    "question": "Regd Agreement of sale along regd GPA year 1995",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,It is very complicated matter and even courts cannot give correct answer and always the person who is in physical possession of property will enjoy the benefits.  The last transaction seems to be valid transaction and immediately the last purchaser shall change Katha in his name on the basis of last sale deed as it was executed by original owner. The Supreme Court put a stop for the sales by way of Power of Attorney. The updated law on the above subject is as follows:===================================================================Imp points on Power of Attorney by NRIA property transaction through Power of Attorney executed by NRI calls for extra checks/scrutiny. A sale deed can be declared NULL and VOID because of a small mistake or error in the execution of Power of Attorney by NRI. Sometimes these errors/mistakes are intentional and most of the times unintentional. In recent past, i came across multiple cases wherein a property transaction was challenged based on error/mistake in the execution of Power of Attorney (POA) by NRI. In many cases, the status of NRI is being concealed by his lawyer/CA in POA to avoid TDS. An NRI executing POA in India cannot declare his/her status as Resident Indian. As i keep highlighting that a buyer or seller in India should mention the status of another party in sale deed to avoid any future tax disputes. A case of the false declaration in sale deed may not put the onus of concealment of facts on the resident Indian in the property transaction.My general observation is that Resident Indian’s are not aware of do’s and don’t of Power of Attorney executed by NRI. Even professional help does not help in most of the cases due to lack of knowledge. A Power of Attorney is issued by NRI if he/she cannot be physically present in India for the execution of property transaction. As a buyer or seller, you should insist on the physical presence of NRI Buyer/Seller in India for sale deed. It will avoid a lot of future hassles. The risk is HIGH if the buyer is Resident Indian, and Seller is NRI, who is represented by Power of Attorney holder. In this post, we will discuss this particular scenario for simplicity purpose. Though it is equally important if a seller is Resident Indian, and Power of Attorney holder represents the NRI Buyer. Reason being, it is important to trace money trail from NRI buyer i.e. whether money is being properly channeled for the property transaction. Let’s check important points or Do’s and Dont’s by Resident Indian Buyer if the transaction is through Power of Attorney by NRI.Reason for Execution of Power of AttorneyA resident Indian buyer should AVOID property transaction through Power of Attorney holder of an NRI. The best case scenario is the presence of an NRI seller in India for execution of sale deed. Sometimes the circumstances do not permit so a buyer you should check the reason for the execution of Power of Attorney. The reason should be reasonable and logical. If the buyer is convinced with the reasoning, then he should insist that NRI Seller should include this particular reason, in Power of Attorney. In short, the purpose/reason for the execution of a power of attorney should be clearly mentioned in the Power of Attorney.Process to Execute Power of AttorneyThe most critical step is to check whether the Power of Attorney is executed as per the laid down process. It’s a 2 step process i.e. attestation of POA at Indian Consulate/Embassy and the registration of same in India. Attestation of POA is required even if the seller is not an NRI i.e. not completed 180 days outside India. On the other hand, if NRI executes POA on Indian Soil then attestation is not required. In short, a POA executed on foreign soil irrespective of the status of a seller require attestation at Indian Consulate/Embassy. The registration process in India follows it. Let me highlight steps/checks for a buyer.Step1:NRI seller creates two copies of Power of Attorney with detailed terms and conditions. As a buyer, you should go through each and every clause carefully to understand the content.Step 2:Check whether the POA is signed by two witnesses present in the country of residence of a seller.Step 3:Check whether the witnesses were physically present in Indian Consulate/Embassy at the time of signature or not. If they were not physically present, then their signatures should be attested by the Local Notary.Step 4:The POA should be attested by the Indian Consulate/Embassy.Step 5:TheAttested POAshould be registered in the India by the resident Indian i.e. POA holder. The registration process in India should be completed within three months from the date of execution of POA. The POA can be registered in SDM (Sub Divisional Magistrate) office or Sub-Registrar Office. The rule may vary from state to state.The relation between the NRI and POA holder should be mentioned in the POA. Preferably the details of ID proof of a POA holder issued by Indian Govt should be specified in the POA. The buyer retains the original copy of Power of Attorney for future reference.Also, note that in some cases POA holder simply notarize the POA in India instead of registering it in SDM or Sub-registrar office. A “Notarized POA” is not the same as “Registered POA”. A notarized POA is legally not valid in India. A POA executed by NRI on foreign soil should be registered in SDM or Sub-Registrar office.Payment to NRI SellerIn a recent case, i observed that buyer was cheated by Power of Attorney holder of an NRI Seller. It’s a misconception that payment towards property transaction should be transferred to POA holder. Please understand that Power of Attorney holder is only a representative of an NRI seller. The resident Indian buyer should make payment only to the NRI seller in his her NRE/NRO account. An NRI seller can authorize POA holder to accept payment on his behalf but cannot authorize payment to POA holder. Even if NRI seller authorizes POA holder to receive direct payment, the buyer should avoid such property transactions. It may land a buyer in tax trouble.In the case of multiple NRI sellers, the payment should be transferred in the proportion of ownership in the property to each seller. In another case, one of my clients was cheated by NRI Seller. NRI couple jointly held the property. There was a dispute between husband and wife & my client was not aware of same. NRI husband insisted on transferring 100% consideration value in his account. After the deal had been done, the wife of a seller filed a case of cheating and fraud by his husband. Therefore, all the payment should be made in the proportion of ownership in the property. Each of the sellers should execute separate Power of Attorney.TDS u/s 195In one of the case, my client received notice for not deducting TDS u/s 195. In my post, How to deduct TDS on NRI u/s 195? i explained this in detail. In this case, the transaction was completed by POA holder. The POA holder told my client that as she (POA holder)  is resident Indian therefore relevant TDS will be 1% u/s 194IA. Again i would like to clarify that POA holder is only a representative of NRI Seller. The TDS will be deducted u/s 195 in the case of NRI seller. The only exception is if NRI seller produces NIL or Lower Tax deduction certificate that i explained in my post How NRI’s can lower TDS on property sale?.Indemnity ClauseLastly, each property transaction is unique with multiple permutations and combinations. Therefore, a buyer can safeguard his/her financial interests by including a blanket indemnity clause in the sale deed. To avoid being caught on the wrong side also ensure that sale deed clauses are in concurrence with the terms and conditions of the POA. It will eliminate any possibility of legal/tax hassles.Concluding Remarks:If you are buying/selling property from NRI then it is advisable to seek professional help to avoid any unpleasant surprises in future. The rules and regulations governing such transactions are bit complicated, especially on the taxation front. Always remember that Indian Law or Tax Authorities will not have any jurisdiction on the NRI residing abroad. On the other hand, a buyer who is resident Indian cannot escape the Indian Law/Tax Authorities. Moreover, the 100% onus of legal/tax compliance rests with the Resident Indian buyer.http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/property-sale-through-gpa-not-valid/1/154711.htmlNo property sale on power of attorney: Supreme CourtThe court rules that transfer through general power of attorney cannot give ownesrship title to the buyer.Property sales through the common practice of general power of attorney (GPA) will not give ownership title to the buyer.In a landmark judgment that is expected to send a large number of property owners into a tizzy, the Supreme Court held that the GPA method of immovable property sales is not a valid form of transfer of property.A three-judge bench presided over by Justice R. V. Raveendran said that property can be lawfully transferred only through registered sale deeds.\"A power of attorney is not an instrument of transfer in regard to any right, title or interest in an immovable property,\" the bench said, after interpreting various provisions of the law concerning property sales. However, the bench said the judgment will not affect \"genuine transactions\" under the GPA.The judgment delivered on Wednesday would have an impact on both freehold and leasehold properties and affect the mode of transfer of property in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) where GPA sales are very common. Even though it can cause some hardship to those who have already purchased property through the GPA, the order will help curb evasion of duties, flow of black money into real estate and also save people from being cheated by unscrupulous owners selling the same property to several people.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, Bangalore6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar"

In that case there's no need for adjudication of the registered GPA now.2.  Yes, the Specific performance case is barred by limitation. However you can make an attempt and pray for condonation of delay and in case your prayer is accepted for condonation of delay, then you can proceed with specific performance against the seller.3.  As you have rightly suggested, you can seek injunction instead of refund of advance amount.4.  When the seller has acknowledged receipt for having received the full consideration, I wonder what prevented you from taking further action to your advantage then. Better late than never.5.  It will be to your advantage that the seller has acknowledged the full and final settlement towards the purchase of property.6.  The buyer or his POA can file the suit in the jurisdictional Forum. The main impediment is inordinate delay and is barred by limitation. If the delay could be condoned, then only there's chance.Shashidhar S.

    "question": "Regd Agreement of sale along regd GPA year 1995",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,It is very complicated matter and even courts cannot give correct answer and always the person who is in physical possession of property will enjoy the benefits.  The last transaction seems to be valid transaction and immediately the last purchaser shall change Katha in his name on the basis of last sale deed as it was executed by original owner. The Supreme Court put a stop for the sales by way of Power of Attorney. The updated law on the above subject is as follows:===================================================================Imp points on Power of Attorney by NRIA property transaction through Power of Attorney executed by NRI calls for extra checks/scrutiny. A sale deed can be declared NULL and VOID because of a small mistake or error in the execution of Power of Attorney by NRI. Sometimes these errors/mistakes are intentional and most of the times unintentional. In recent past, i came across multiple cases wherein a property transaction was challenged based on error/mistake in the execution of Power of Attorney (POA) by NRI. In many cases, the status of NRI is being concealed by his lawyer/CA in POA to avoid TDS. An NRI executing POA in India cannot declare his/her status as Resident Indian. As i keep highlighting that a buyer or seller in India should mention the status of another party in sale deed to avoid any future tax disputes. A case of the false declaration in sale deed may not put the onus of concealment of facts on the resident Indian in the property transaction.My general observation is that Resident Indian’s are not aware of do’s and don’t of Power of Attorney executed by NRI. Even professional help does not help in most of the cases due to lack of knowledge. A Power of Attorney is issued by NRI if he/she cannot be physically present in India for the execution of property transaction. As a buyer or seller, you should insist on the physical presence of NRI Buyer/Seller in India for sale deed. It will avoid a lot of future hassles. The risk is HIGH if the buyer is Resident Indian, and Seller is NRI, who is represented by Power of Attorney holder. In this post, we will discuss this particular scenario for simplicity purpose. Though it is equally important if a seller is Resident Indian, and Power of Attorney holder represents the NRI Buyer. Reason being, it is important to trace money trail from NRI buyer i.e. whether money is being properly channeled for the property transaction. Let’s check important points or Do’s and Dont’s by Resident Indian Buyer if the transaction is through Power of Attorney by NRI.Reason for Execution of Power of AttorneyA resident Indian buyer should AVOID property transaction through Power of Attorney holder of an NRI. The best case scenario is the presence of an NRI seller in India for execution of sale deed. Sometimes the circumstances do not permit so a buyer you should check the reason for the execution of Power of Attorney. The reason should be reasonable and logical. If the buyer is convinced with the reasoning, then he should insist that NRI Seller should include this particular reason, in Power of Attorney. In short, the purpose/reason for the execution of a power of attorney should be clearly mentioned in the Power of Attorney.Process to Execute Power of AttorneyThe most critical step is to check whether the Power of Attorney is executed as per the laid down process. It’s a 2 step process i.e. attestation of POA at Indian Consulate/Embassy and the registration of same in India. Attestation of POA is required even if the seller is not an NRI i.e. not completed 180 days outside India. On the other hand, if NRI executes POA on Indian Soil then attestation is not required. In short, a POA executed on foreign soil irrespective of the status of a seller require attestation at Indian Consulate/Embassy. The registration process in India follows it. Let me highlight steps/checks for a buyer.Step1:NRI seller creates two copies of Power of Attorney with detailed terms and conditions. As a buyer, you should go through each and every clause carefully to understand the content.Step 2:Check whether the POA is signed by two witnesses present in the country of residence of a seller.Step 3:Check whether the witnesses were physically present in Indian Consulate/Embassy at the time of signature or not. If they were not physically present, then their signatures should be attested by the Local Notary.Step 4:The POA should be attested by the Indian Consulate/Embassy.Step 5:TheAttested POAshould be registered in the India by the resident Indian i.e. POA holder. The registration process in India should be completed within three months from the date of execution of POA. The POA can be registered in SDM (Sub Divisional Magistrate) office or Sub-Registrar Office. The rule may vary from state to state.The relation between the NRI and POA holder should be mentioned in the POA. Preferably the details of ID proof of a POA holder issued by Indian Govt should be specified in the POA. The buyer retains the original copy of Power of Attorney for future reference.Also, note that in some cases POA holder simply notarize the POA in India instead of registering it in SDM or Sub-registrar office. A “Notarized POA” is not the same as “Registered POA”. A notarized POA is legally not valid in India. A POA executed by NRI on foreign soil should be registered in SDM or Sub-Registrar office.Payment to NRI SellerIn a recent case, i observed that buyer was cheated by Power of Attorney holder of an NRI Seller. It’s a misconception that payment towards property transaction should be transferred to POA holder. Please understand that Power of Attorney holder is only a representative of an NRI seller. The resident Indian buyer should make payment only to the NRI seller in his her NRE/NRO account. An NRI seller can authorize POA holder to accept payment on his behalf but cannot authorize payment to POA holder. Even if NRI seller authorizes POA holder to receive direct payment, the buyer should avoid such property transactions. It may land a buyer in tax trouble.In the case of multiple NRI sellers, the payment should be transferred in the proportion of ownership in the property to each seller. In another case, one of my clients was cheated by NRI Seller. NRI couple jointly held the property. There was a dispute between husband and wife & my client was not aware of same. NRI husband insisted on transferring 100% consideration value in his account. After the deal had been done, the wife of a seller filed a case of cheating and fraud by his husband. Therefore, all the payment should be made in the proportion of ownership in the property. Each of the sellers should execute separate Power of Attorney.TDS u/s 195In one of the case, my client received notice for not deducting TDS u/s 195. In my post, How to deduct TDS on NRI u/s 195? i explained this in detail. In this case, the transaction was completed by POA holder. The POA holder told my client that as she (POA holder)  is resident Indian therefore relevant TDS will be 1% u/s 194IA. Again i would like to clarify that POA holder is only a representative of NRI Seller. The TDS will be deducted u/s 195 in the case of NRI seller. The only exception is if NRI seller produces NIL or Lower Tax deduction certificate that i explained in my post How NRI’s can lower TDS on property sale?.Indemnity ClauseLastly, each property transaction is unique with multiple permutations and combinations. Therefore, a buyer can safeguard his/her financial interests by including a blanket indemnity clause in the sale deed. To avoid being caught on the wrong side also ensure that sale deed clauses are in concurrence with the terms and conditions of the POA. It will eliminate any possibility of legal/tax hassles.Concluding Remarks:If you are buying/selling property from NRI then it is advisable to seek professional help to avoid any unpleasant surprises in future. The rules and regulations governing such transactions are bit complicated, especially on the taxation front. Always remember that Indian Law or Tax Authorities will not have any jurisdiction on the NRI residing abroad. On the other hand, a buyer who is resident Indian cannot escape the Indian Law/Tax Authorities. Moreover, the 100% onus of legal/tax compliance rests with the Resident Indian buyer.http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/property-sale-through-gpa-not-valid/1/154711.htmlNo property sale on power of attorney: Supreme CourtThe court rules that transfer through general power of attorney cannot give ownesrship title to the buyer.Property sales through the common practice of general power of attorney (GPA) will not give ownership title to the buyer.In a landmark judgment that is expected to send a large number of property owners into a tizzy, the Supreme Court held that the GPA method of immovable property sales is not a valid form of transfer of property.A three-judge bench presided over by Justice R. V. Raveendran said that property can be lawfully transferred only through registered sale deeds.\"A power of attorney is not an instrument of transfer in regard to any right, title or interest in an immovable property,\" the bench said, after interpreting various provisions of the law concerning property sales. However, the bench said the judgment will not affect \"genuine transactions\" under the GPA.The judgment delivered on Wednesday would have an impact on both freehold and leasehold properties and affect the mode of transfer of property in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) where GPA sales are very common. Even though it can cause some hardship to those who have already purchased property through the GPA, the order will help curb evasion of duties, flow of black money into real estate and also save people from being cheated by unscrupulous owners selling the same property to several people.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, Bangalore6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar"

However you can make an attempt and pray for condonation of delay and in case your prayer is accepted for condonation of delay, then you can proceed with specific performance against the seller.3.  As you have rightly suggested, you can seek injunction instead of refund of advance amount.4.  When the seller has acknowledged receipt for having received the full consideration, I wonder what prevented you from taking further action to your advantage then. Better late than never.5.  It will be to your advantage that the seller has acknowledged the full and final settlement towards the purchase of property.6.  The buyer or his POA can file the suit in the jurisdictional Forum.

The Special PoA needs to be either notarized or attested by the Indian High Commission in Australia. Within three months of its arrival in India it has to be adjudicated (assessed for applicable stamp duty in India) by the land registry under whose jurisdiction the property falls.

    "question": "Regd Agreement of sale along regd GPA year 1995",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,It is very complicated matter and even courts cannot give correct answer and always the person who is in physical possession of property will enjoy the benefits.  The last transaction seems to be valid transaction and immediately the last purchaser shall change Katha in his name on the basis of last sale deed as it was executed by original owner. The Supreme Court put a stop for the sales by way of Power of Attorney. The updated law on the above subject is as follows:===================================================================Imp points on Power of Attorney by NRIA property transaction through Power of Attorney executed by NRI calls for extra checks/scrutiny. A sale deed can be declared NULL and VOID because of a small mistake or error in the execution of Power of Attorney by NRI. Sometimes these errors/mistakes are intentional and most of the times unintentional. In recent past, i came across multiple cases wherein a property transaction was challenged based on error/mistake in the execution of Power of Attorney (POA) by NRI. In many cases, the status of NRI is being concealed by his lawyer/CA in POA to avoid TDS. An NRI executing POA in India cannot declare his/her status as Resident Indian. As i keep highlighting that a buyer or seller in India should mention the status of another party in sale deed to avoid any future tax disputes. A case of the false declaration in sale deed may not put the onus of concealment of facts on the resident Indian in the property transaction.My general observation is that Resident Indian’s are not aware of do’s and don’t of Power of Attorney executed by NRI. Even professional help does not help in most of the cases due to lack of knowledge. A Power of Attorney is issued by NRI if he/she cannot be physically present in India for the execution of property transaction. As a buyer or seller, you should insist on the physical presence of NRI Buyer/Seller in India for sale deed. It will avoid a lot of future hassles. The risk is HIGH if the buyer is Resident Indian, and Seller is NRI, who is represented by Power of Attorney holder. In this post, we will discuss this particular scenario for simplicity purpose. Though it is equally important if a seller is Resident Indian, and Power of Attorney holder represents the NRI Buyer. Reason being, it is important to trace money trail from NRI buyer i.e. whether money is being properly channeled for the property transaction. Let’s check important points or Do’s and Dont’s by Resident Indian Buyer if the transaction is through Power of Attorney by NRI.Reason for Execution of Power of AttorneyA resident Indian buyer should AVOID property transaction through Power of Attorney holder of an NRI. The best case scenario is the presence of an NRI seller in India for execution of sale deed. Sometimes the circumstances do not permit so a buyer you should check the reason for the execution of Power of Attorney. The reason should be reasonable and logical. If the buyer is convinced with the reasoning, then he should insist that NRI Seller should include this particular reason, in Power of Attorney. In short, the purpose/reason for the execution of a power of attorney should be clearly mentioned in the Power of Attorney.Process to Execute Power of AttorneyThe most critical step is to check whether the Power of Attorney is executed as per the laid down process. It’s a 2 step process i.e. attestation of POA at Indian Consulate/Embassy and the registration of same in India. Attestation of POA is required even if the seller is not an NRI i.e. not completed 180 days outside India. On the other hand, if NRI executes POA on Indian Soil then attestation is not required. In short, a POA executed on foreign soil irrespective of the status of a seller require attestation at Indian Consulate/Embassy. The registration process in India follows it. Let me highlight steps/checks for a buyer.Step1:NRI seller creates two copies of Power of Attorney with detailed terms and conditions. As a buyer, you should go through each and every clause carefully to understand the content.Step 2:Check whether the POA is signed by two witnesses present in the country of residence of a seller.Step 3:Check whether the witnesses were physically present in Indian Consulate/Embassy at the time of signature or not. If they were not physically present, then their signatures should be attested by the Local Notary.Step 4:The POA should be attested by the Indian Consulate/Embassy.Step 5:TheAttested POAshould be registered in the India by the resident Indian i.e. POA holder. The registration process in India should be completed within three months from the date of execution of POA. The POA can be registered in SDM (Sub Divisional Magistrate) office or Sub-Registrar Office. The rule may vary from state to state.The relation between the NRI and POA holder should be mentioned in the POA. Preferably the details of ID proof of a POA holder issued by Indian Govt should be specified in the POA. The buyer retains the original copy of Power of Attorney for future reference.Also, note that in some cases POA holder simply notarize the POA in India instead of registering it in SDM or Sub-registrar office. A “Notarized POA” is not the same as “Registered POA”. A notarized POA is legally not valid in India. A POA executed by NRI on foreign soil should be registered in SDM or Sub-Registrar office.Payment to NRI SellerIn a recent case, i observed that buyer was cheated by Power of Attorney holder of an NRI Seller. It’s a misconception that payment towards property transaction should be transferred to POA holder. Please understand that Power of Attorney holder is only a representative of an NRI seller. The resident Indian buyer should make payment only to the NRI seller in his her NRE/NRO account. An NRI seller can authorize POA holder to accept payment on his behalf but cannot authorize payment to POA holder. Even if NRI seller authorizes POA holder to receive direct payment, the buyer should avoid such property transactions. It may land a buyer in tax trouble.In the case of multiple NRI sellers, the payment should be transferred in the proportion of ownership in the property to each seller. In another case, one of my clients was cheated by NRI Seller. NRI couple jointly held the property. There was a dispute between husband and wife & my client was not aware of same. NRI husband insisted on transferring 100% consideration value in his account. After the deal had been done, the wife of a seller filed a case of cheating and fraud by his husband. Therefore, all the payment should be made in the proportion of ownership in the property. Each of the sellers should execute separate Power of Attorney.TDS u/s 195In one of the case, my client received notice for not deducting TDS u/s 195. In my post, How to deduct TDS on NRI u/s 195? i explained this in detail. In this case, the transaction was completed by POA holder. The POA holder told my client that as she (POA holder)  is resident Indian therefore relevant TDS will be 1% u/s 194IA. Again i would like to clarify that POA holder is only a representative of NRI Seller. The TDS will be deducted u/s 195 in the case of NRI seller. The only exception is if NRI seller produces NIL or Lower Tax deduction certificate that i explained in my post How NRI’s can lower TDS on property sale?.Indemnity ClauseLastly, each property transaction is unique with multiple permutations and combinations. Therefore, a buyer can safeguard his/her financial interests by including a blanket indemnity clause in the sale deed. To avoid being caught on the wrong side also ensure that sale deed clauses are in concurrence with the terms and conditions of the POA. It will eliminate any possibility of legal/tax hassles.Concluding Remarks:If you are buying/selling property from NRI then it is advisable to seek professional help to avoid any unpleasant surprises in future. The rules and regulations governing such transactions are bit complicated, especially on the taxation front. Always remember that Indian Law or Tax Authorities will not have any jurisdiction on the NRI residing abroad. On the other hand, a buyer who is resident Indian cannot escape the Indian Law/Tax Authorities. Moreover, the 100% onus of legal/tax compliance rests with the Resident Indian buyer.http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/property-sale-through-gpa-not-valid/1/154711.htmlNo property sale on power of attorney: Supreme CourtThe court rules that transfer through general power of attorney cannot give ownesrship title to the buyer.Property sales through the common practice of general power of attorney (GPA) will not give ownership title to the buyer.In a landmark judgment that is expected to send a large number of property owners into a tizzy, the Supreme Court held that the GPA method of immovable property sales is not a valid form of transfer of property.A three-judge bench presided over by Justice R. V. Raveendran said that property can be lawfully transferred only through registered sale deeds.\"A power of attorney is not an instrument of transfer in regard to any right, title or interest in an immovable property,\" the bench said, after interpreting various provisions of the law concerning property sales. However, the bench said the judgment will not affect \"genuine transactions\" under the GPA.The judgment delivered on Wednesday would have an impact on both freehold and leasehold properties and affect the mode of transfer of property in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) where GPA sales are very common. Even though it can cause some hardship to those who have already purchased property through the GPA, the order will help curb evasion of duties, flow of black money into real estate and also save people from being cheated by unscrupulous owners selling the same property to several people.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, Bangalore6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar"

If any legal heir has not given a consent affidavit then the court will issue him a notice using his details provided in the petition. Upon receipt of notice the legal heir has to file a caveat with an affidavit in support stating his grounds of objections against the grant of the petition. If the brother does not disclose the details of all heirs then he will be liable for suppression of material facts and any grant obtained by him from the court by concealing facts from the court, will be liable to be revoked. So there are adequate safeguards against any tricks sought to be played by the Petitioner2. Yes even if the bequeathed property is not mutated in her name, she can still make a Will for that property. If the Will under which the property was bequeathed is not proved as per law then the second Will to the extent of that property will lapse and will be of no effect.3. Not required. Police is useless. It will say that it's a civil matter. Even if you want to place something on record, I would not suggest as it wont serve any purpose. However its your choice if you wish to write any letter to the police4. Yes the heir of the legatee will succeed to the bequest5.

In the eventuality of her passing away, you too aren't obliged to sign any document to get the Will in question probated.Wills are in the domain of civil law, so there's no scope for police complaint.

Unless you know the contents of the Will, its difficult to say.

Without seeing the Will not possible to sayAre the executors of the will required to show a copy of the will to the beneficiaries by law?Not as such. The duty of the executor is to protect the interest of the beneficiary. But here you dont even know who are the beneficiaries named in the WillAll the property tax etc are being paid by my mothers brother(not the executors of the will) Is this ok?He is paying it in his capacity of a co owner on behalf of all legal heirs. So that does not clothe him with the attributes of the owner. On death of testator the property vests in the executor. So he has to ideally take care of all outgoings of the property.

You have the option to call the police by just dialing the police number 100 and police will come to the place mentioned by you in the phone call. They will come to the spot and ask you the problem and then will take the action against them. And, when they will reach the spot you should be having sufficient proof to prove the harassment by neighbors.Harassment Through NuisanceYou may be living in an apartment or in a duplex, often it happens, when you hear loud music sound from the neighbor’s house, you try to ignore that sound for as long as possible but sometimes, such noise may make life difficult. This type of nuisance is defined inSection 268 of the Indian Penal Act.Section 268 of theIndian Penal Codedefines nuisance when the person is guilty of a public nuisance when he does any act which causes injury, danger or annoyance to the public or the people in general who live or occupy the property in the neighborhood.A common nuisance is not excused on the ground that it causes some convenience or advantage.If this type of harassment is faced by you from your neighbor then, you can file an application under Section 268 of IPC in the court of magistrate.Punishment of nuisance is defined in Section 290 of IPC, which is mere Rs. 200 but the court can do much more.As a matter of fact, calling 100 is most effective as, after a visit or two from the police, such nuisance is likely to stop. In extreme cases, police may even confiscate the instruments that are used to cause nuisance like – loudspeakers or sound boxes, or drones, cameras or such other tools.Sometimes, police does not intervene despite laws being there as they do not like extra work on their plate or because the other party is very influential. In such cases, you may need to take help of legal experts. We recommend you get in touch with ClikLawyer.com.Harassment Through MischiefWhen you live in a duplex, you are sharing a common wall. If your neighbor starts construction in that common wall you do not have the right to stop him from constructing because it is his legal right but if during the construction work your property gets damaged, you can ask him to compensate for the loss suffered by youbut if your neighbor refuses to pay you the amount then you can file a case under–Section 425 of IPC which statesthat whoever with intent to cause, or knowing that he is likely to cause, wrongful loss or damage to the public or to any person, causes the destruction of any property, or any such change in any property or in the situation thereof as destroys or diminishes its value or utility, or affects it injuriously, commits mischief.You can file suit for declaration and mandatory injunction in a civil court as well.You can claim damages in the same suit.THE KARNATAKA POLICE ACT,(similar State Police Act also existing in each State)Punishment of certain street offences and nuisance.—(1) In any local area to which the Government by notification in the official Gazette from time to time extends this sub-section or any clause thereof, whoever, contrary thereto,— (a) without lawful excuse drives along, or keeps standing in, any street a vehicle of any description or drags or pushes in any street, a vehicle of any description other than a bicycle at any time between half an hour after sunset and one hour before sunrise without a sufficient light or lights;

    "answer": "1. I have similar case of one of my clients to settle. In my case they had informed one day as the date of of religious marriage which was registered as perHindu Marriage Actbut later on realised that on that date the groom was in UK. No proof oa marriage was asked or submitted. The Marriage Registrar has thereafter retired and the Advocate who has engaged the said Registrar is not picking the phone of my client now. I have made them lodging a complaint before the Registrar General of Marriage informing that the Registrar has errored in entering the date of the religious marriage and typed 2022 in place of 2019 while filling the form on line. I have arranged to get a marriage invitation card printed and had attached a copy of it with the above application. The matter is being delayed by the department and I am planning to submit an affidavit by the wife staying in India executed before the 1st Class Judicial Magistrate affirming hat she was religiously married on the sated date in the year 2019 which was wrongly mentioned in the marriage registration certificate as in the year 2022 which is required to be corrected by issuing a fresh marriage certificate.2. I will submit the above affidavit again the Registrar General of Marriage seeking issuance of fresh marriage certificate with corrected date of her religious marriage and if I do not get it within next 15 days, I shall file a Writ Petition before the Calcutta High Court against inaction of the Registrar General of Marriage praying forn order on him to issue the fresh marriage certificate correcting the error.3. You can also follow the same way. Write the Registrar General of Marriage  about the error committed by the Marriage Registrar by not mentioning that you have religiously married on such and such date (you shall have to opt a date) but the Registrar did not ask for the proof of it like marriage invitation card etc. and ask for a fresh certificate correcting the said error.4. Thereafter, if you do not get the certificate afresh, you can follow the path suggested in my case mentioned above.Krishna Kishore GangulyAdvocate, Kolkata27585 Answers726 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Krishna Kishore Ganguly"

    "question": "Divorce filed in USA, is 50-50 law applicable in India?",
    "answer": "Firstly the divorce that may be granted on 'no fault divorce' or 'default divorce' or any other grounds that is not recognised as valid grounds for divorce as perHindu Marriage Act, then this divorce itself is not valid in the eyes of law in India, therefore any orders passed by the USA court regarding distribution of property equally between them is also not executable in India.Besides, there is no provision in India law for 50-50 division of property between the couple on divorce  until and unless it is a jointly owned property.If husband or wife decides to file a divorce case separate in India for the marriage that was solemnised in India as per Indian laws, there is no legal infirmity in it.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Divorce filed in USA, is 50-50 law applicable in India?",
    "answer": "Is 50-50 law which is standard in divorce proceedings in USA applicable in India ?No.Is the judgement given in USA valid in India as the property is in India ?No.Can husband file a separate divorce case in India ?Yes .As per the latest Supreme Court judgment which had held that a decree of divorce granted by a foreign court is not valid in India if the ground is not recognized by Indian law. Who wish to take benefit of Indian laws and legal system to avoid facing up to any foreign judicial system. Indian Marriage solemnized in India according to Indian Matrimonial laws then the Indian courts will have territorial jurisdiction to hear & decide matter relating to this marriage & the foreign court's decision may or may not be acceptable in India hence best course is to get this marriage dissolved according to India court's decree of divorce.Please read the detailed answer .In India, there's nosuch law that gives the wife the right to claim a 50% stake. There are many laws in India which deal with settlement of spousal property.  Indian legal system follows equity distribution during property settlements at the time of divorce. The partners receive their share according to equity/contribution. The courts of equity exercise jurisdiction in personam. (A court within personam jurisdiction in a particular case has enough power over the defendant and his or her property to grant a judgment affecting the defendant in almost any way).In the eyes of the Indian judicial system, the property belongs to the person in whose name it's registered.  If the property is in the name of the husband then the wife has no right on that property.USAFamily Courts may make orders in relation to property in an overseas jurisdiction. However, property settlement orders made by theUSAFamily Courts may not be automatically recognised and enforceable in the overseas jurisdiction. Consequently, problems may be experienced in enforcing the property settlement orders internationally.USA is a Non-reciprocatory territory of India and the Indian court exercises jurisdiction in personam so the property situated in India has divided only under Indian law. When the court grants a divorce, the property will be divided equitably (not always equally) between the two spouses. This is decided under Equitable Distribution Law. During the divorce, both spouses have to tell the court about their income and any debts they owe.  If the lawsuit is to determine title to property (in rem) then the action must be filed where the property exists and is only enforceable there.Under Hindu law, a woman gets a right on her husband’s property only after his death. Since marital bonds are considered sacrosanct and eternal in Hindu belief, there are no strong provisions in the existing law as far as property goes if a couple decides to call it quits. They are only eligible for maintenance, so to speak.A wife has the right to claim maintenance for her livelihood equivalent to husband’s lifestyle, till the time she enters into a second marriage. In India marital bonds are considered sacrosanct and eternal, so a married woman gets a right on her husband’s property only after his death. A woman’s husband’s ancestral property, which he is expected to inherit in the future, remains out of the settlement, and so does his self-acquired property. It is only in the case of a joint property that a woman could claim at the time of divorce.If a property is purchased and paid for by one person and the title is held by another, the person in whose name the property is held will be deemed to be its legal owner. Before we proceed further, it is important to note that this law accepts the property on which his/her name is registered. Contributions made during the purchase of any other party, cash or in-kind, are not recognized, legally speaking, unless you have sufficient evidence to prove otherwise.There are two different types of property for the purposes of divorce. The property that the couple purchased during marriage is called “marital property”. Property that you had before marriage or was just a gift to you from someone other than your spouse is called a “separate property”.Marital property can be divided between two spouses.Separate propertyis an asset that is owned by the premarital spouses. Any inheritance a spouse receives, even during marriage, is separate property. So are personal gifts (unless they came from another spouse or partner) and payments for personal injuries.When the court grants a divorce, the property will be divided equitably (not always equally) between the two spouses. This is decided under Equitable Distribution Law.Ajay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

    "answer": "1. If your marriage is older for more than a year then it would be advisable that you file a contested divorce case on the grounds of cruelty citing that her refusal to cohabit or sexual relationship is one of the grounds of cruelty besides other grounds whatever you may rely upon and have been pleaded in your divorce petition.2.  You should have filed the annulment case within one year from the date of marriage or from the date of such knowledge.3. If you are aggrieved by her attitude or behavior with you, then it is you have to seek the relief and not she.She will remain silent as usual causing more and more grievances to you, hence you only have to initiate actions to get proper remedy to such injuries.4. The time taken for disposal of a matrimonial dispute by court cannot be predicted owing to various factors involved in it, besides it is pertinent that you may have to be present before family court on all the dates of hearing or represented  through your power of attorney agent.The impotency is to be proved by the party who relies upon it as a primary reason, before court by medical evidences;Thedivorce by mutual consentmay get disposed within 6 months from the date of instituting the divorce case.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Divorce on basis of non-consummation of marriage",
    "answer": "You have two options 1. Contested divorce or 2 Mutual divorce.As per the law as it stands, our legal system does not allow divorce to be granted on the grounds of irretrievable breakdown of marriage or irreconcilable differences. To get a divorce one has to prove wrongdoing on the part of other spouse, and impeccable conduct of one’s own in order to win. Divorce is granted only on the proof of fault or guilty conduct of one party and innocence of the other. The most common ground for divorce is cruelty. Another common ground is adultery (sexual intercourse outside wedlock), one instance of lapse of virtue that can lead to divorce.Divorce by Mutual Consent, as the name suggests, is when both parties ie; husband and wife come to a mutual understanding that the marriage be dissolved amicably. It is clear that one of the parties may withdraw their consent at any time before the passing of the decree. The most important requirement for grantingdivorce by mutual consentis free consent of both parties.Divorce by Mutual consentsaves time, money and energy for both,You can file mutual consent / contested divorce with the help of the power of attorney.

In my case they had informed one day as the date of of religious marriage which was registered as perHindu Marriage Actbut later on realised that on that date the groom was in UK. No proof oa marriage was asked or submitted. The Marriage Registrar has thereafter retired and the Advocate who has engaged the said Registrar is not picking the phone of my client now. I have made them lodging a complaint before the Registrar General of Marriage informing that the Registrar has errored in entering the date of the religious marriage and typed 2022 in place of 2019 while filling the form on line. I have arranged to get a marriage invitation card printed and had attached a copy of it with the above application. The matter is being delayed by the department and I am planning to submit an affidavit by the wife staying in India executed before the 1st Class Judicial Magistrate affirming hat she was religiously married on the sated date in the year 2019 which was wrongly mentioned in the marriage registration certificate as in the year 2022 which is required to be corrected by issuing a fresh marriage certificate.2. I will submit the above affidavit again the Registrar General of Marriage seeking issuance of fresh marriage certificate with corrected date of her religious marriage and if I do not get it within next 15 days, I shall file a Writ Petition before the Calcutta High Court against inaction of the Registrar General of Marriage praying forn order on him to issue the fresh marriage certificate correcting the error.3. You can also follow the same way. Write the Registrar General of Marriage  about the error committed by the Marriage Registrar by not mentioning that you have religiously married on such and such date (you shall have to opt a date) but the Registrar did not ask for the proof of it like marriage invitation card etc. and ask for a fresh certificate correcting the said error.4. Thereafter, if you do not get the certificate afresh, you can follow the path suggested in my case mentioned above.Krishna Kishore GangulyAdvocate, Kolkata27585 Answers726 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Krishna Kishore Ganguly"

    "answer": "1. I have similar case of one of my clients to settle. In my case they had informed one day as the date of of religious marriage which was registered as perHindu Marriage Actbut later on realised that on that date the groom was in UK. No proof oa marriage was asked or submitted. The Marriage Registrar has thereafter retired and the Advocate who has engaged the said Registrar is not picking the phone of my client now. I have made them lodging a complaint before the Registrar General of Marriage informing that the Registrar has errored in entering the date of the religious marriage and typed 2022 in place of 2019 while filling the form on line. I have arranged to get a marriage invitation card printed and had attached a copy of it with the above application. The matter is being delayed by the department and I am planning to submit an affidavit by the wife staying in India executed before the 1st Class Judicial Magistrate affirming hat she was religiously married on the sated date in the year 2019 which was wrongly mentioned in the marriage registration certificate as in the year 2022 which is required to be corrected by issuing a fresh marriage certificate.2. I will submit the above affidavit again the Registrar General of Marriage seeking issuance of fresh marriage certificate with corrected date of her religious marriage and if I do not get it within next 15 days, I shall file a Writ Petition before the Calcutta High Court against inaction of the Registrar General of Marriage praying forn order on him to issue the fresh marriage certificate correcting the error.3. You can also follow the same way. Write the Registrar General of Marriage  about the error committed by the Marriage Registrar by not mentioning that you have religiously married on such and such date (you shall have to opt a date) but the Registrar did not ask for the proof of it like marriage invitation card etc. and ask for a fresh certificate correcting the said error.4. Thereafter, if you do not get the certificate afresh, you can follow the path suggested in my case mentioned above.Krishna Kishore GangulyAdvocate, Kolkata27585 Answers726 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Krishna Kishore Ganguly"

If your marriage is older for more than a year then it would be advisable that you file a contested divorce case on the grounds of cruelty citing that her refusal to cohabit or sexual relationship is one of the grounds of cruelty besides other grounds whatever you may rely upon and have been pleaded in your divorce petition.2.  You should have filed the annulment case within one year from the date of marriage or from the date of such knowledge.3. If you are aggrieved by her attitude or behavior with you, then it is you have to seek the relief and not she.She will remain silent as usual causing more and more grievances to you, hence you only have to initiate actions to get proper remedy to such injuries.4. The time taken for disposal of a matrimonial dispute by court cannot be predicted owing to various factors involved in it, besides it is pertinent that you may have to be present before family court on all the dates of hearing or represented  through your power of attorney agent.The impotency is to be proved by the party who relies upon it as a primary reason, before court by medical evidences;Thedivorce by mutual consentmay get disposed within 6 months from the date of instituting the divorce case.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "You have two options 1. Contested divorce or 2 Mutual divorce.As per the law as it stands, our legal system does not allow divorce to be granted on the grounds of irretrievable breakdown of marriage or irreconcilable differences. To get a divorce one has to prove wrongdoing on the part of other spouse, and impeccable conduct of one’s own in order to win. Divorce is granted only on the proof of fault or guilty conduct of one party and innocence of the other. The most common ground for divorce is cruelty. Another common ground is adultery (sexual intercourse outside wedlock), one instance of lapse of virtue that can lead to divorce.Divorce by Mutual Consent, as the name suggests, is when both parties ie; husband and wife come to a mutual understanding that the marriage be dissolved amicably. It is clear that one of the parties may withdraw their consent at any time before the passing of the decree. The most important requirement for grantingdivorce by mutual consentis free consent of both parties.Divorce by Mutual consentsaves time, money and energy for both,You can file mutual consent / contested divorce with the help of the power of attorney.

    "answer": "You need not come to India to sell immovable property. Any immovable property can be sold, purchased or gifted by person residing abroad through Special Power Attorney. The procedure is, draft a special power of attorney on Indian stamp paper of 100 rupees which  is available in all countries  or even on white paper giving SPA to any of your relatives/friend/coowner to sell the property.  Go to Indian consulate/high commissioner and get SPA attested which  the consulate official will readily do. GPA will take the SPA to the District Registrar who will validate it by putting his seal and signature. Fee for validation of SPA is 1 % if it is given to blood relation if given to other person it is 2% of government valuation of the property. With the validated SPA property can be sold by GPA signing for himself and other coowner and proceeds can be deposited in your account.Ravi ShindeAdvocate, Hyderabad4923 Answers42 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ravi Shinde"

    "question": "Divorce on basis of non-consummation of marriage",
    "answer": "1. If your marriage is older for more than a year then it would be advisable that you file a contested divorce case on the grounds of cruelty citing that her refusal to cohabit or sexual relationship is one of the grounds of cruelty besides other grounds whatever you may rely upon and have been pleaded in your divorce petition.2.  You should have filed the annulment case within one year from the date of marriage or from the date of such knowledge.3. If you are aggrieved by her attitude or behavior with you, then it is you have to seek the relief and not she.She will remain silent as usual causing more and more grievances to you, hence you only have to initiate actions to get proper remedy to such injuries.4. The time taken for disposal of a matrimonial dispute by court cannot be predicted owing to various factors involved in it, besides it is pertinent that you may have to be present before family court on all the dates of hearing or represented  through your power of attorney agent.The impotency is to be proved by the party who relies upon it as a primary reason, before court by medical evidences;Thedivorce by mutual consentmay get disposed within 6 months from the date of instituting the divorce case.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Divorce on basis of non-consummation of marriage",
    "answer": "You have two options 1. Contested divorce or 2 Mutual divorce.As per the law as it stands, our legal system does not allow divorce to be granted on the grounds of irretrievable breakdown of marriage or irreconcilable differences. To get a divorce one has to prove wrongdoing on the part of other spouse, and impeccable conduct of one’s own in order to win. Divorce is granted only on the proof of fault or guilty conduct of one party and innocence of the other. The most common ground for divorce is cruelty. Another common ground is adultery (sexual intercourse outside wedlock), one instance of lapse of virtue that can lead to divorce.Divorce by Mutual Consent, as the name suggests, is when both parties ie; husband and wife come to a mutual understanding that the marriage be dissolved amicably. It is clear that one of the parties may withdraw their consent at any time before the passing of the decree. The most important requirement for grantingdivorce by mutual consentis free consent of both parties.Divorce by Mutual consentsaves time, money and energy for both,You can file mutual consent / contested divorce with the help of the power of attorney.
