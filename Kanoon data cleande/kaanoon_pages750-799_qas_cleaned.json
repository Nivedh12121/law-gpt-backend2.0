    "question": "Agricultural land Uttar Pradesh",
    "answer": "In Uttar Pradesh: married daughters in Uttar Pradesh do not have the same inheritance rights as unmarried daughters when it comes to their father's agricultural land:Uttar Pradesh law stated that unmarried daughters could inherit their father's property, but married daughters could not. This effectively forced daughters to choose between marriage and inheritance.Earlier even unmarried daughters were not having equal rights in the agricultural land at par with sons.The state adopted the U.P. Revenue Code, 2006, which gave unmarried daughters the same inheritance rights as sons, but weaker rights to married daughters.Now that the Uttar Pradesh law provides that an unmarried daughter stands to inherit a share of her father’s property and loses that standing when she marries, it effectively becomes a question of choosing either marriage or land ownership. Also, this difference in treatment may encourage her brothers to desire that their sister marry at the earliest possible opportunity, so that she will not compete with them for inheritance.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Agricultural land Uttar Pradesh",
    "answer": "Dear Client,As per your concerns regarding the agricultural land in Uttar Pradesh and your married sister’s actions, let me clarify your legal standing under Indian laws.Firstly, according to theHindu Succession Actof 1956 with amendment in year 2005, the rights of the married as well as unmarried daughter regarding their father’s property including the agricultural one are identical.Due to UP Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950, in Uttar Pradesh married daughters were not allowed to take agriculture land but Supreme Court of India in recent judgments has clarified that daughters also are co-heirs and thus entitled to equal share in ancestral property.Thus your married sister does have your right to the agricultural land.As for your mother’s share, since she died intestate, this share of the property will now go to legal heirs which are you and your sister.However, as far as the existing legislation which governs the property rights in the country concerns, your sister has the legal right to also stake a claim over the share of your mother’s portion.The same can be said for the other assets like the flat and fixed deposits, for nomination in your sisters favor legally entitles her unless of course a civil lawsuit is filed against the nomination.In my opinion, you should object to mutation proceedings and if needed file a partition suit in the civil court to protect your share in the said property.In light of these issues, it is essential to contact a competent lawyer immediately to protect your inheritance from your sister and manage with any unjustified misuse.Please seek further legal advice from a property lawyer as regards to the actions that should be taken especially in compiling evidence, filing for claims among other matters.I hope this perspective adds value to your considerations. If you have any further queries regarding this matter, do not hesitate to contact us again.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,On the question of the Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950 Supreme Court decisions shall override the Act where there is conflict. The Supreme Court has the power to explain the meaning of the laws and provide guidelines that all other courts must follow. For example, there are decisions like Mithlesh Kumari v. Fateh Bahadur Singh defines some aspects of Zamindari Act, thus proving the power of Supreme Court. Hence, although the Zamindari Act and Supreme Court decisions are relevant, where there is a clash, the Supreme Court ruling takes precedence.

In Indian law there is a provision which allows the person to complain to the police even after so much delay.For theft, you should file an FIR under Section 303 of BNS Act. I think it is wise to file a complaint at both Bangalore and at your village in Andhra Pradesh since the theft may have taken place at either of these two places.It is usually accepted by the police especially bearing in mind that a lot of times one can give health issues as the cause of a delay in reporting the incident. Also, be sure to give information regarding the people who had access to the house, such as, the maids, the driver among others.You will get the police involved depending on the information you pass to them. Despite the fact that it has been five months now, it is vital to make the report at the earliest stage possible in order to increase the possibility of the recovery or else investigation.I hope this explanation meets your needs precisely.

    "answer": "Dear Client,I appreciate your worries towards the transfer of self-acquired property that belong to your father and as to your sister’s influence and coercion. According to Indian laws, since the property belongs to your father and it is self-acquired, he has every right to transfer it.However, if you think that your sister influenced this decision while your father was ill mentally, you can object to this transfer on the grounds of ‘undue influence’ or ‘fraud’ under Section 16 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Receipt of medical records that will further support this claim will be vital for this claim.In case your father was of unsound mind at the time of transfer you may approach the court to appoint a guardian under Mental Health Care Act, 2017 to nullify the transactions made during this period.If the property has been transferred, the process is slightly different: you can file civil trial on the grounds of transferring deed and provide such proofs as, for example, medical records or testimonies of witnesses. To deal with such a case, I would advise to consult with a lawyer, especially since legal action should be taken as soon as possible to defend your rights.I hope this response is in line with your expectations.

You have to go for the summon at the Women Police Station, since failure to do so is likely to worsen the situation.When you are there, sensitively explain to them, by providing the chats, emails, FIR copy, and MOU to disprove all the said allegations. Your wife may file cases under sections 85 & 86 of BNS act which relates to cruelty by a party to marriage and section 316 which relates to criminal breach of trust under BNS act, 2023.If you want to safeguard yourself then you should file anticipatory bail under section 482 of BNSS act, 2023. You can even sue for divorce under the provision of Section 12 of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 under the grounds of fraud since you were never informed about her previous relationship. In the same regard, seek legal help on how and when to respond to any orders concerning her access to your home.I hope this information brings clarity to your situation.

In Indian law there is a provision which allows the person to complain to the police even after so much delay.For theft, you should file an FIR under Section 303 of BNS Act. I think it is wise to file a complaint at both Bangalore and at your village in Andhra Pradesh since the theft may have taken place at either of these two places.It is usually accepted by the police especially bearing in mind that a lot of times one can give health issues as the cause of a delay in reporting the incident. Also, be sure to give information regarding the people who had access to the house, such as, the maids, the driver among others.You will get the police involved depending on the information you pass to them. Despite the fact that it has been five months now, it is vital to make the report at the earliest stage possible in order to increase the possibility of the recovery or else investigation.I hope this explanation meets your needs precisely.

The certificate could however only be received by registering the marriage with the local Registrar of Marriages.The pandit cannot issue this certificate. This is if the husband agrees, but if he does not, then you can apply for registration with proof of marriage and in some cases force can be used legally. Again in Australia, people’s marriage which is legal in India is mostly accepted but one must possess a certificate for legal purposes.It is suggested to go for marriage registration so that you are safe legally. To continue, bring documents such as the wedding photographs, invitation cards, statements from the witnesses who assisted in the marriage registration process among others.

    "question": "Contested Divorce",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I understand your concerns regarding your wife's request for a mutual divorce and the custody of your child. Let me address your queries in accordance to Indian laws.Your wife cannot approach the court and request a divorce on mere grounds of irresponsibility or immaturity without supporting evidence.Mutual consent divorcecan only take place if both the parties have consented to the divorce. If you do not agree, she would be required to file for specific causes like cruelty or adultery which are difficult without proof. If you try to fight any divorce proceedings being granted, the entire process could be drawn out over years. During this time, the court may order that the case goes to mediation and this may cause her to change her stand. Your contestation will defer the process of coming to a common agreement on the divorce but this should be done effectively. On the issue of child custody, Indian courts are particularly concerned with the welfare of the child and in most cases prefer joint custody. You are still a father and you have rights to see your child, your wife may have the kid most of the time at the beginning but you can fight for joint custody if you are shown as being involved in your child’s life. It would be impossible for your wife to admit your child to a hostel without your consent. You might be able to convince her that such a decision is not in the child’s best interests and could change the custody.It would be wise to talk to a family lawyer who can assist you in helping you understand these aspects as well as in defending your legal rights concerning the child custody and welfare.I hope this information brings clarity to your situation.

According to Indian laws, since the property belongs to your father and it is self-acquired, he has every right to transfer it.However, if you think that your sister influenced this decision while your father was ill mentally, you can object to this transfer on the grounds of ‘undue influence’ or ‘fraud’ under Section 16 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Receipt of medical records that will further support this claim will be vital for this claim.In case your father was of unsound mind at the time of transfer you may approach the court to appoint a guardian under Mental Health Care Act, 2017 to nullify the transactions made during this period.If the property has been transferred, the process is slightly different: you can file civil trial on the grounds of transferring deed and provide such proofs as, for example, medical records or testimonies of witnesses. To deal with such a case, I would advise to consult with a lawyer, especially since legal action should be taken as soon as possible to defend your rights.I hope this response is in line with your expectations.

    "question": "Regarding  usage of video footage shot in public places",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Regarding the uploading of the footage shot in different places including public places and ASI monuments to YouTube even without monetization, the following legal questions are in best interest based on Indian laws. So, Here is a clear response to help you understand the situationFirstly, filming on the roads and streets and at the ASI monuments needs permission mostly if the purpose is commercial in nature.For shooting, other than commercial purpose like documentary films and advertisement, there is no restriction in fee except in ASI monuments they charge camera fee. Nevertheless, such an operation, as is the uploading of that footage to a channel on YouTube, even for no profit, can seemingly create confusion in this aspect between personal and commercial use.However, although uploading a non-monetized video does not amount to commercial use, it is evident that YouTube is a public domain, and since uploading a video or applying copyright there amounts to applying the video for commercial purposes. In some cases they still would need permission especially if the authorities make perceive the sharing of such footage to be for public viewing.Regarding the ASI monuments, if they utilize any footages and disseminate them to the public, it purely could be violating the rules of protected monuments even if the usage was of non commercial nature. Hence it would be advisable to seek the appropriate permissions or contact the authorities to find out about the intentions of the use.Therefore, regardless of the noncommercial nature of the videos, posting them online can be considered as commercial use, and therefore permission should be sought to avoid possible problems in the future.I hope this response is beneficial for your situation.

    "question": "BDA property gift deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Regarding the issue of your mother-in-law wishing to execute a gift deed for the BDA-allotted site, it is important to consider the specific legal constraints associated with the property. As per BDA allotment rules, the sale or transfer of the allotted property is restricted based on a regulation that does not allow the separation of the property for 10 years from the date of allotment.As the allotment only occurred seven years ago then any dealing regarding the site, through sale or through gift deeds will definitely be considered against these regulations. While a gift deed is not a sale, it is a conveyance of property and as such BDA considers all such conveyances to be restricted until the end of the 10 year term.In case your mother-in-law goes on to execute the gift deed before this period is over then the BDA has the potential client’s right to sue and this can be in a bid to counter the allotment. It would of course be safer from a legal perspective to simply wait ten years, or alternatively apply to the BDA to find out whether an such a transfer, under any circumstances, is possible at all. It is for this reason I advised to conform to these regulations and seek legal advice from a specialized lawyer in order to ensure that your mother-in-law is fully compliant with the regulations outlined by BDA.I hope this insight provides the direction you need.

    "question": "Partition with OS pending",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I appreciate your feelings about the Original Suit (OS) that is due to impact one part of the agricultural land that you co-own. Firstly, since there is no stay order as granted by the court, that in fact you are legally allowed to proceed with the partition of the land. You can subdivide the 5 acres equally and get separate pattas registered in both the plots. However, it must also be noted that the OS which is still pending before the courts concerning the remainder of 1 acre could at some alter the legal position of the portion in question. Hence any activities concerning the territorial claim should be done carefully. Secondly, While the move might not necessarily violate any specific law, other individuals in their right mind that intend to buy a property with the intention of donating it to a charity organization may be deterred by the existing litigation. Hence, it would be wiser not to make any sale or gift before the resolution of the OS to prevent future legal issues or controversies. It is recommended to refrain from the sale or giving of the subject item until the outcome of the OS to prevent any future legal issues or controversies. In brief, it can be said that both part and registration are allowable, but one needs to be very careful while separating one’s share during the litigation. However, for any more information regarding this process, it is advised that you consult a property lawyer to ensure that you do not encounter any problems in the procedure.I hope this explanation resolves your doubts effectively.

Let me explain all these facets supported with laws in India.The wrong pincode in the stamp duty challan, as such, ought not to lead to huge legal complications if all other details on this document are correct and coherent. Although, there is such a thing as pincode related to stamp duty, the pincode is more administrative and does not normally determine the legitimacy of the payment of stamp duty. However, situations that would arise where the pincode filled in the challan differs from the pincode stated in the sale agreement might lead to some concerns during the subsequent selling or legal issues.In the case, where the pincodes filled in the sale agreement and that of the stamp duty challan are different, then either during the loan disbursal or property registration there may be some issues. Most of the times, bankers and the authorities want to have secure and authentic documents to serve the purpose of loan recovery and legal issues. Any chances of inaccuracy, for example, wrong pincodes, might slow the process or may have to be rectified in order to call it a sale agreement.In order to overcome this issue, it is recommended that one should try to rectify the pincode error as soon as possible. In this case, you should inform the particular authority or the office of stamp duty to do the changes on the challan details. Finally, make double-entry to the corrected details in any other documents related to the sale agreement and the loan application forms if the client applied for that.Overall, although the wrong pincode does not necessarily mean that the challan is null and void it is advisable to attend to the loophole in order to prevent future complications such as challenges in property registration or loan procedures.I hope this response is beneficial for your situation.

    "question": "Agricultural land Uttar Pradesh",
    "answer": "Dear Client,As per your concerns regarding the agricultural land in Uttar Pradesh and your married sister’s actions, let me clarify your legal standing under Indian laws.Firstly, according to theHindu Succession Actof 1956 with amendment in year 2005, the rights of the married as well as unmarried daughter regarding their father’s property including the agricultural one are identical.Due to UP Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950, in Uttar Pradesh married daughters were not allowed to take agriculture land but Supreme Court of India in recent judgments has clarified that daughters also are co-heirs and thus entitled to equal share in ancestral property.Thus your married sister does have your right to the agricultural land.As for your mother’s share, since she died intestate, this share of the property will now go to legal heirs which are you and your sister.However, as far as the existing legislation which governs the property rights in the country concerns, your sister has the legal right to also stake a claim over the share of your mother’s portion.The same can be said for the other assets like the flat and fixed deposits, for nomination in your sisters favor legally entitles her unless of course a civil lawsuit is filed against the nomination.In my opinion, you should object to mutation proceedings and if needed file a partition suit in the civil court to protect your share in the said property.In light of these issues, it is essential to contact a competent lawyer immediately to protect your inheritance from your sister and manage with any unjustified misuse.Please seek further legal advice from a property lawyer as regards to the actions that should be taken especially in compiling evidence, filing for claims among other matters.I hope this perspective adds value to your considerations.

    "answer": "Dear Client,On the question of the Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950 Supreme Court decisions shall override the Act where there is conflict. The Supreme Court has the power to explain the meaning of the laws and provide guidelines that all other courts must follow. For example, there are decisions like Mithlesh Kumari v. Fateh Bahadur Singh defines some aspects of Zamindari Act, thus proving the power of Supreme Court. Hence, although the Zamindari Act and Supreme Court decisions are relevant, where there is a clash, the Supreme Court ruling takes precedence.

    "question": "My sister has influenced my father to give her everything",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I appreciate your worries towards the transfer of self-acquired property that belong to your father and as to your sister’s influence and coercion. According to Indian laws, since the property belongs to your father and it is self-acquired, he has every right to transfer it.However, if you think that your sister influenced this decision while your father was ill mentally, you can object to this transfer on the grounds of ‘undue influence’ or ‘fraud’ under Section 16 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Receipt of medical records that will further support this claim will be vital for this claim.In case your father was of unsound mind at the time of transfer you may approach the court to appoint a guardian under Mental Health Care Act, 2017 to nullify the transactions made during this period.If the property has been transferred, the process is slightly different: you can file civil trial on the grounds of transferring deed and provide such proofs as, for example, medical records or testimonies of witnesses. To deal with such a case, I would advise to consult with a lawyer, especially since legal action should be taken as soon as possible to defend your rights.I hope this response is in line with your expectations.

    "answer": "Dear Client,As per your instructions, there is some legal issue you want me to provide you with information how to leave the partnership firm legally so that there is no legal issue in future. Here is the specific approach as prescribed by the Indian laws.First of all, you should prepare a dissolution deed which will state the terms for dissolution and division of assets and liabilities. Above deed should be made on the e-stamp paper and both partners should attach their signatures. It is important that the deed shows that you are releasing all rights in relation to the firm’s property and that the remaining partner shall take responsibility for all debts such as loans and insurance losses. The deed too should, be notarized to prove its legitimacy. Secondly, the registration of the above dissolution deed with the local registrar of firms is not compulsory, but is recommended. It also adds more legal credibility to the document and makes sure that the dissolution is lawful and recognized. Subsequently, inform all related parties of the dissolution of the firm including the bank and the Punjab Finance Corporation. This is useful in recording updates as well as clearing the air that the remaining partner is liable for any owed amounts. Furthermore, to further support the action of dissolving the co-operative, it will be wise to seek a no-objection certificate from the said financial institutions to affirm that they admit the dissolution and that all the outstanding dues have been realized or assigned in terms of the deed.In conclusion the following steps should taken when one wants to legalize the termination of the partnership; the termination should be in writing in a dissolution deed, the deed should be notarized and possibly registered, and all the necessary authorities should be notified. It is also recommended to seek a lawyer’s advice to determine whether all the right procedures are being taken.I hope this response provides the depth you're seeking.

    "answer": "First of all, I'm assuming it's women's cell of police. See, the police hasn't lodged any complaint against you, nor are you summoned for questioning. You can refuse the counselling and refuse to go & I would advice you to refuse to go for any counselling at police station (women's cell). You' must go only if you are summoned for questioning.My advice is based on fact that the police isn't professional trained for counselling. What happens is they pressurize both parties not to complain whatsoever and settle the matter amongst themselves. So it's just a waste of time. You go to professional marriage counsellors for counselling.As to the legalities of the situation,  well you are well within your rights to prohibit disagreeable individuals, the threatening rowdy types from entering your home, be it your wife's relatives and/or parents. Be rest assured, it doesn't amount to any cruelty and hence, you can be defended before any court of law on this count.Rather it's you, who suffers from mental cruelty and harassment on the count of your wife allowing such elements to interfere in your sacrosanct matrimonial relationship. Hence,  I would suggest you encourage your wife to seek assistance of a professional marriage counsellor along with you so that both of you can enjoy matrimonial bliss.As to your wife not yielding to 4, and then your legal remedies,  there are quite a few options involving litigation. You could opt for judicial separation, or petition restraining your wife to entertain such elements at your home without your consent. Divorce would be last resort.Which remedy would best suit your purpose and handling that litigation ---- for that I require an exhaustive consultation session with you first. You need to visit me for that. I'm based in Mumbai /navimumbai just as you are, so it shouldn't be much of an issue for you to visit me.९८२०८९७८८४ (nine eight two zero eight nine seven eight eight four)Netra Mohanchandra PantAdvocate, Navi Mumbai1591 Answers5 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Netra Mohanchandra Pant"

    "question": "How can I prevent my wife's troublesome parents/siblings from visiting my home?",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I recognize the difficulties you are facing due to the repeated disruptive actions of your wife’s parents and siblings, and your intent to prevent them from entering your home. According to Indian laws, the following is a formal legal approach to address this matter.Since you are the owner or the lawful possessor of your residence, you have every right to control who should gain access to your home or not. The previous placement, providing your wife an option to visit her parents without the interference of relatives you consider as problematic, yet denying them access to your home, was logical. Since your wife is now going to complain that you are harassing her mentally by preventing her family from visiting, I want to reiterate to you that you have never locked her out of your house from seeing her family and the restrictions are placed to ensure that you are not disturbed in your home. When counseling, it should be illustrated why certain past incidents of harassment and misconduct had to occur from her family members, and how the previous agreement made by both families was an attempt of good will. Your wife has rights to visit her family members, that you as a husband cannot refuse, but that does not mean the people who have been causing disturbances are free to enter into your home. You may ask the women’s cell or court to allow you to not have disturbance in your home while at the same time still allow your wife to visit her family as she wishes.Thus, you should stick to your decision to let your wife visit her family without limitation while explaining the legitimate grounds for limiting access of those causing disturbances to your home. In the meantime, it is also recommended to consult a lawyer about filing an injunction or any other kind of protection from further harassment.I hope this response is helpful in addressing your challenges.

    "question": "Can Right to Access through a land be revoked",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You have mentioned certain concerns that you have with regards to the pathway described in the 1989 registry and its potential impact to your intended land acquisition. Let me provide a specific response that will answer your questions as follows.First, people inhabiting the area behind your land may also have a right of way across your land, granted to them the pathway in the 1989 registry. Thus, despite the area development and availability of other roads that one can use, a legally required right of way can stay valid most of the times if not formally removed by legal means. It is possibly to stop this pathway; the audience that has benefited from this cycle may attempt to make a demand to be compensated or alternatively allowed to access the channel again.Secondly, the presence of the pathway in the original registry may be an impact on the density coefficient, that is, the permissible built-up area on your land. In case the pathway is either an easement or a designated right of way, then the right of way should be free from obstruction, and this may hamper your construction plans. Consulting with a legal expert along with the specific terms listed in the 1989 registry will explain how it will affect the development possibilities.Concerning the seller’s rights, if the pathway is already formally established, the seller will be in a functionally restricted position in terms of ability to block the stated pathway without considering the rights of the users or beneficiaries of this pathway. Trying to add a provision to the registry that states that the pathway has not been utilized for over twelve years may clear the picture somewhat, yet it may not necessarily eliminate the original historical rights that were created in the registry.Finally, the addition of such a clause may have implications on the possibility of using the land to secure a mortgage. The problem is that banks usually decide to accept the land as security for a loan provided that they are given a clear title and having an unrestricted use of the property and any further or other disputes concerning the right of way may influence the decision of the bank.In general, pathway issue must be solved legally and easements and the rights must be determined and cleared properly before going for the buying. Therefore, seeking the legal advice from a lawyer will be relevant in order to safeguard your interests as you pursue the transaction.I hope this advice will be a useful guide for you.

    "question": "Regarding  usage of video footage shot in public places",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Regarding the uploading of the footage shot in different places including public places and ASI monuments to YouTube even without monetization, the following legal questions are in best interest based on Indian laws. So, Here is a clear response to help you understand the situationFirstly, filming on the roads and streets and at the ASI monuments needs permission mostly if the purpose is commercial in nature.For shooting, other than commercial purpose like documentary films and advertisement, there is no restriction in fee except in ASI monuments they charge camera fee. Nevertheless, such an operation, as is the uploading of that footage to a channel on YouTube, even for no profit, can seemingly create confusion in this aspect between personal and commercial use.However, although uploading a non-monetized video does not amount to commercial use, it is evident that YouTube is a public domain, and since uploading a video or applying copyright there amounts to applying the video for commercial purposes. In some cases they still would need permission especially if the authorities make perceive the sharing of such footage to be for public viewing.Regarding the ASI monuments, if they utilize any footages and disseminate them to the public, it purely could be violating the rules of protected monuments even if the usage was of non commercial nature. Hence it would be advisable to seek the appropriate permissions or contact the authorities to find out about the intentions of the use.Therefore, regardless of the noncommercial nature of the videos, posting them online can be considered as commercial use, and therefore permission should be sought to avoid possible problems in the future.I hope this response is beneficial for your situation.

    "question": "BDA property gift deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Regarding the issue of your mother-in-law wishing to execute a gift deed for the BDA-allotted site, it is important to consider the specific legal constraints associated with the property. As per BDA allotment rules, the sale or transfer of the allotted property is restricted based on a regulation that does not allow the separation of the property for 10 years from the date of allotment.As the allotment only occurred seven years ago then any dealing regarding the site, through sale or through gift deeds will definitely be considered against these regulations. While a gift deed is not a sale, it is a conveyance of property and as such BDA considers all such conveyances to be restricted until the end of the 10 year term.In case your mother-in-law goes on to execute the gift deed before this period is over then the BDA has the potential client’s right to sue and this can be in a bid to counter the allotment. It would of course be safer from a legal perspective to simply wait ten years, or alternatively apply to the BDA to find out whether an such a transfer, under any circumstances, is possible at all. It is for this reason I advised to conform to these regulations and seek legal advice from a specialized lawyer in order to ensure that your mother-in-law is fully compliant with the regulations outlined by BDA.I hope this insight provides the direction you need.

The builder is bound by law to return the money collected from buyers within 45 days.- Hence, if you have already paid 10 percent of the flat value, and the said agreement signed by you , is not registered in the office of the Registrar , then you are liable to get full amount refund paid by you ,even there is a clause present in the agreement for not refunding  , and if the said agreement is registered , then builder has right to deduct booking amount from the paid amount.- If, builder not refunding the same ,then you should lodge your complaint before the Consumer court , and thereby prayed for the refund of paid amount with interest.- However , before filing the complaint you can send a legal demand notice to the builder.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Agricultural land Uttar Pradesh",
    "answer": "Dear Client,As per your concerns regarding the agricultural land in Uttar Pradesh and your married sister’s actions, let me clarify your legal standing under Indian laws.Firstly, according to theHindu Succession Actof 1956 with amendment in year 2005, the rights of the married as well as unmarried daughter regarding their father’s property including the agricultural one are identical.Due to UP Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950, in Uttar Pradesh married daughters were not allowed to take agriculture land but Supreme Court of India in recent judgments has clarified that daughters also are co-heirs and thus entitled to equal share in ancestral property.Thus your married sister does have your right to the agricultural land.As for your mother’s share, since she died intestate, this share of the property will now go to legal heirs which are you and your sister.However, as far as the existing legislation which governs the property rights in the country concerns, your sister has the legal right to also stake a claim over the share of your mother’s portion.The same can be said for the other assets like the flat and fixed deposits, for nomination in your sisters favor legally entitles her unless of course a civil lawsuit is filed against the nomination.In my opinion, you should object to mutation proceedings and if needed file a partition suit in the civil court to protect your share in the said property.In light of these issues, it is essential to contact a competent lawyer immediately to protect your inheritance from your sister and manage with any unjustified misuse.Please seek further legal advice from a property lawyer as regards to the actions that should be taken especially in compiling evidence, filing for claims among other matters.I hope this perspective adds value to your considerations.

The Supreme Court has the power to explain the meaning of the laws and provide guidelines that all other courts must follow. For example, there are decisions like Mithlesh Kumari v. Fateh Bahadur Singh defines some aspects of Zamindari Act, thus proving the power of Supreme Court. Hence, although the Zamindari Act and Supreme Court decisions are relevant, where there is a clash, the Supreme Court ruling takes precedence.

    "question": "Contested Divorce",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I understand your concerns regarding your wife's request for a mutual divorce and the custody of your child. Let me address your queries in accordance to Indian laws.Your wife cannot approach the court and request a divorce on mere grounds of irresponsibility or immaturity without supporting evidence.Mutual consent divorcecan only take place if both the parties have consented to the divorce. If you do not agree, she would be required to file for specific causes like cruelty or adultery which are difficult without proof. If you try to fight any divorce proceedings being granted, the entire process could be drawn out over years. During this time, the court may order that the case goes to mediation and this may cause her to change her stand. Your contestation will defer the process of coming to a common agreement on the divorce but this should be done effectively. On the issue of child custody, Indian courts are particularly concerned with the welfare of the child and in most cases prefer joint custody. You are still a father and you have rights to see your child, your wife may have the kid most of the time at the beginning but you can fight for joint custody if you are shown as being involved in your child’s life. It would be impossible for your wife to admit your child to a hostel without your consent. You might be able to convince her that such a decision is not in the child’s best interests and could change the custody.It would be wise to talk to a family lawyer who can assist you in helping you understand these aspects as well as in defending your legal rights concerning the child custody and welfare.I hope this information brings clarity to your situation.

    "question": "My sister has influenced my father to give her everything",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I appreciate your worries towards the transfer of self-acquired property that belong to your father and as to your sister’s influence and coercion. According to Indian laws, since the property belongs to your father and it is self-acquired, he has every right to transfer it.However, if you think that your sister influenced this decision while your father was ill mentally, you can object to this transfer on the grounds of ‘undue influence’ or ‘fraud’ under Section 16 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Receipt of medical records that will further support this claim will be vital for this claim.In case your father was of unsound mind at the time of transfer you may approach the court to appoint a guardian under Mental Health Care Act, 2017 to nullify the transactions made during this period.If the property has been transferred, the process is slightly different: you can file civil trial on the grounds of transferring deed and provide such proofs as, for example, medical records or testimonies of witnesses. To deal with such a case, I would advise to consult with a lawyer, especially since legal action should be taken as soon as possible to defend your rights.I hope this response is in line with your expectations.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Regarding the uploading of the footage shot in different places including public places and ASI monuments to YouTube even without monetization, the following legal questions are in best interest based on Indian laws. So, Here is a clear response to help you understand the situationFirstly, filming on the roads and streets and at the ASI monuments needs permission mostly if the purpose is commercial in nature.For shooting, other than commercial purpose like documentary films and advertisement, there is no restriction in fee except in ASI monuments they charge camera fee. Nevertheless, such an operation, as is the uploading of that footage to a channel on YouTube, even for no profit, can seemingly create confusion in this aspect between personal and commercial use.However, although uploading a non-monetized video does not amount to commercial use, it is evident that YouTube is a public domain, and since uploading a video or applying copyright there amounts to applying the video for commercial purposes. In some cases they still would need permission especially if the authorities make perceive the sharing of such footage to be for public viewing.Regarding the ASI monuments, if they utilize any footages and disseminate them to the public, it purely could be violating the rules of protected monuments even if the usage was of non commercial nature. Hence it would be advisable to seek the appropriate permissions or contact the authorities to find out about the intentions of the use.Therefore, regardless of the noncommercial nature of the videos, posting them online can be considered as commercial use, and therefore permission should be sought to avoid possible problems in the future.I hope this response is beneficial for your situation.

    "question": "BDA property gift deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Regarding the issue of your mother-in-law wishing to execute a gift deed for the BDA-allotted site, it is important to consider the specific legal constraints associated with the property. As per BDA allotment rules, the sale or transfer of the allotted property is restricted based on a regulation that does not allow the separation of the property for 10 years from the date of allotment.As the allotment only occurred seven years ago then any dealing regarding the site, through sale or through gift deeds will definitely be considered against these regulations. While a gift deed is not a sale, it is a conveyance of property and as such BDA considers all such conveyances to be restricted until the end of the 10 year term.In case your mother-in-law goes on to execute the gift deed before this period is over then the BDA has the potential client’s right to sue and this can be in a bid to counter the allotment. It would of course be safer from a legal perspective to simply wait ten years, or alternatively apply to the BDA to find out whether an such a transfer, under any circumstances, is possible at all. It is for this reason I advised to conform to these regulations and seek legal advice from a specialized lawyer in order to ensure that your mother-in-law is fully compliant with the regulations outlined by BDA.I hope this insight provides the direction you need.

The restriction against alienation, however, could not operate against a mortgage, as provided in Rule 18(2)(iii). The37mortgage is, however, to be one effected for the purpose of construction of the building on the site. Rule 18(2)(c) visits the purchaser, committing breach of any of the conditions in clause (a), inter alia, with the resumption of the site, no doubt, after a reasonable notice. Rule 18(2)(c) further declares that all transactions entered into in contravention of the conditions in Clause (a) and (b) are to be null and void ab initio. The transactions, which are referred to in Rule 18(2)(c), are the transactions which are referred to in Rule 18(2)(a)(iii) or Rule 18(2)(b).Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98567 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "question": "BDA property gift deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Regarding the issue of your mother-in-law wishing to execute a gift deed for the BDA-allotted site, it is important to consider the specific legal constraints associated with the property. As per BDA allotment rules, the sale or transfer of the allotted property is restricted based on a regulation that does not allow the separation of the property for 10 years from the date of allotment.As the allotment only occurred seven years ago then any dealing regarding the site, through sale or through gift deeds will definitely be considered against these regulations. While a gift deed is not a sale, it is a conveyance of property and as such BDA considers all such conveyances to be restricted until the end of the 10 year term.In case your mother-in-law goes on to execute the gift deed before this period is over then the BDA has the potential client’s right to sue and this can be in a bid to counter the allotment. It would of course be safer from a legal perspective to simply wait ten years, or alternatively apply to the BDA to find out whether an such a transfer, under any circumstances, is possible at all. It is for this reason I advised to conform to these regulations and seek legal advice from a specialized lawyer in order to ensure that your mother-in-law is fully compliant with the regulations outlined by BDA.I hope this insight provides the direction you need.

    "question": "My sister has influenced my father to give her everything",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I appreciate your worries towards the transfer of self-acquired property that belong to your father and as to your sister’s influence and coercion. According to Indian laws, since the property belongs to your father and it is self-acquired, he has every right to transfer it.However, if you think that your sister influenced this decision while your father was ill mentally, you can object to this transfer on the grounds of ‘undue influence’ or ‘fraud’ under Section 16 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Receipt of medical records that will further support this claim will be vital for this claim.In case your father was of unsound mind at the time of transfer you may approach the court to appoint a guardian under Mental Health Care Act, 2017 to nullify the transactions made during this period.If the property has been transferred, the process is slightly different: you can file civil trial on the grounds of transferring deed and provide such proofs as, for example, medical records or testimonies of witnesses. To deal with such a case, I would advise to consult with a lawyer, especially since legal action should be taken as soon as possible to defend your rights.I hope this response is in line with your expectations.

Despite the operating of theHindu Succession Actof 1956 an individual can in any way he wishes deal with the self-acquired property as he or she wants without reference to any legal heirs except where such actions would be prejudicial to the legal heirs. But to prevent any future complications, it is always safer to seek written consent of all the legal heirs before effecting any distribution or transfer of the property. It is wise to seek an attorney who is well versed in property laws in Gujarat to ensure that he or she provides specific advice on any complications that may be come up in the course of this process.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,I understand your concerns regarding your wife's request for a mutual divorce and the custody of your child. Let me address your queries in accordance to Indian laws.Your wife cannot approach the court and request a divorce on mere grounds of irresponsibility or immaturity without supporting evidence.Mutual consent divorcecan only take place if both the parties have consented to the divorce. If you do not agree, she would be required to file for specific causes like cruelty or adultery which are difficult without proof. If you try to fight any divorce proceedings being granted, the entire process could be drawn out over years. During this time, the court may order that the case goes to mediation and this may cause her to change her stand. Your contestation will defer the process of coming to a common agreement on the divorce but this should be done effectively. On the issue of child custody, Indian courts are particularly concerned with the welfare of the child and in most cases prefer joint custody. You are still a father and you have rights to see your child, your wife may have the kid most of the time at the beginning but you can fight for joint custody if you are shown as being involved in your child’s life. It would be impossible for your wife to admit your child to a hostel without your consent. You might be able to convince her that such a decision is not in the child’s best interests and could change the custody.It would be wise to talk to a family lawyer who can assist you in helping you understand these aspects as well as in defending your legal rights concerning the child custody and welfare.I hope this information brings clarity to your situation.

    "question": "How to get the token amount from builder after cancelling the purchase process",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I understand how annoying and demanding it is to get your token amount from the builder. Let meexplained a straightforward technique to address this issue pursuant to the Indian laws.First, as the builder has not returned your money and the cheque which you presented to him has been dishonoured this is considered a breach of contract.Nonetheless, you should first write a legal notice to the builder for due payment and interest towards the delayed amount.There is usually a response from the builder to this notice.On failure to grant the payment after receiving the said notice, the builder can be reported to the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum.Such messages of this forum can assist you to recover your lost money and in addition, claim for compensation for the inconvenience.Also, you can seek civil remedy under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, for the bounced cheque so as to claim the amount along with the criminal sections of the bounced cheque.Despite the fact that the project is not yet registered under RERA you can report the builder to RERA if he has deceived you or if he has not followed the proper channel.It is advisable that one should seek service of a property lawyer who may assist one in undertaking these steps and he or she protects you in the process.These are measures that should assist you to get your money back and reduce stress that you are undergoing.I hope this information brings clarity to your situation.

    "question": "How to get the token amount from builder after cancelling the purchase process",
    "answer": "-  There is no law to forfeit the booking amount for the cancellation, and the deduction is done at the builder’s discretion.- Hence, legally, the builder cannot deduct any money out of the advance payment you have made for the booking till the time; a builder-buyer agreement is made and registered with the sub-registrar.- Further, A builder-buyer agreement is not created until the buyer pays at least 10 per cent of the property value.- Further, as per RERA, home-buyers can cancel allotment of the apartment booked with a builder at any stage even if there is no default on the part of the developer. The builder is bound by law to return the money collected from buyers within 45 days.- Hence, if you have already paid 10 percent of the flat value, and the said agreement signed by you , is not registered in the office of the Registrar , then you are liable to get full amount refund paid by you ,even there is a clause present in the agreement for not refunding  , and if the said agreement is registered , then builder has right to deduct booking amount from the paid amount.- If, builder not refunding the same ,then you should lodge your complaint before the Consumer court , and thereby prayed for the refund of paid amount with interest.- However , before filing the complaint you can send a legal demand notice to the builder.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Contested Divorce",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I understand your concerns regarding your wife's request for a mutual divorce and the custody of your child. Let me address your queries in accordance to Indian laws.Your wife cannot approach the court and request a divorce on mere grounds of irresponsibility or immaturity without supporting evidence.Mutual consent divorcecan only take place if both the parties have consented to the divorce. If you do not agree, she would be required to file for specific causes like cruelty or adultery which are difficult without proof. If you try to fight any divorce proceedings being granted, the entire process could be drawn out over years. During this time, the court may order that the case goes to mediation and this may cause her to change her stand. Your contestation will defer the process of coming to a common agreement on the divorce but this should be done effectively. On the issue of child custody, Indian courts are particularly concerned with the welfare of the child and in most cases prefer joint custody. You are still a father and you have rights to see your child, your wife may have the kid most of the time at the beginning but you can fight for joint custody if you are shown as being involved in your child’s life. It would be impossible for your wife to admit your child to a hostel without your consent. You might be able to convince her that such a decision is not in the child’s best interests and could change the custody.It would be wise to talk to a family lawyer who can assist you in helping you understand these aspects as well as in defending your legal rights concerning the child custody and welfare.I hope this information brings clarity to your situation.

    "question": "Legal Remedies for Challenging CCPD Orders and Retaliation in Workplace for 90% Blind PwD",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Sorry to hear about your condition.According to the RPwD Act, 2016, while filing an appeal against any order passed by the Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities (CCPD), the act does not consist of an appellate provision to appeal against the CCPD’s order. Thus, the conventional legal treatment would be to move to the higher court by filing a writ petition under Article 226 of theConstitution of Indiaand praying for judicial review of the CCPD’s decision. This approach is taken when Challenging quasi-judicial orders that do not provide a statutory right of appeal.A writ petition would enable you to appeal the decision on the different grounds such as illegality, irrationality, or procedural impropriety. The High Court has jurisdiction to consider whether or not the CCPD complied with the law and whether the procedural fairness was complied with or not. CCPD orders are of administrative nature, thus, in case of extreme need you can apply for a writ of certiorari or mandamus depending on the kind of relief you want.In regards to workplace discrimination and retaliation your rights are protected under the RPwD act especially section 20 that deals with nondiscrimination in employment, However,with 90% blindness, finding employment is still a vital challenge. If the CCPD has not provided sufficient relief, the High Court can be contacted for enforcing your rights and for handling the punitive transfer, perhaps for requesting a stay with regard to the transfer in addition to discrimination and retaliation.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Partition with OS pending",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I appreciate your feelings about the Original Suit (OS) that is due to impact one part of the agricultural land that you co-own. Firstly, since there is no stay order as granted by the court, that in fact you are legally allowed to proceed with the partition of the land. You can subdivide the 5 acres equally and get separate pattas registered in both the plots. However, it must also be noted that the OS which is still pending before the courts concerning the remainder of 1 acre could at some alter the legal position of the portion in question. Hence any activities concerning the territorial claim should be done carefully. Secondly, While the move might not necessarily violate any specific law, other individuals in their right mind that intend to buy a property with the intention of donating it to a charity organization may be deterred by the existing litigation. Hence, it would be wiser not to make any sale or gift before the resolution of the OS to prevent future legal issues or controversies. It is recommended to refrain from the sale or giving of the subject item until the outcome of the OS to prevent any future legal issues or controversies. In brief, it can be said that both part and registration are allowable, but one needs to be very careful while separating one’s share during the litigation. However, for any more information regarding this process, it is advised that you consult a property lawyer to ensure that you do not encounter any problems in the procedure.I hope this explanation resolves your doubts effectively.

    "answer": "- Delhi High Court granted divorce to a man on the grounds of his in-laws' frequent interference in his marital life and noted that parents should \"draw a line\" and let their daughters lead a happy, married life.- Further, the Allahabad High Court in the matter of Kumar Devi & Anr. V. State of U.P. & Ors stated that, nobody including the parents of a man and woman can interfere in the couple's married life and their living together if the two individuals are of legal age.- Hence, they cannot interfere in your personal matter after visiting again and again- Your wife should object for the same , otherwise you can file a divorce petition before the court on this ground.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "How can I prevent my wife's troublesome parents/siblings from visiting my home?",
    "answer": "First of all, I'm assuming it's women's cell of police. See, the police hasn't lodged any complaint against you, nor are you summoned for questioning. You can refuse the counselling and refuse to go & I would advice you to refuse to go for any counselling at police station (women's cell). You' must go only if you are summoned for questioning.My advice is based on fact that the police isn't professional trained for counselling. What happens is they pressurize both parties not to complain whatsoever and settle the matter amongst themselves. So it's just a waste of time. You go to professional marriage counsellors for counselling.As to the legalities of the situation,  well you are well within your rights to prohibit disagreeable individuals, the threatening rowdy types from entering your home, be it your wife's relatives and/or parents. Be rest assured, it doesn't amount to any cruelty and hence, you can be defended before any court of law on this count.Rather it's you, who suffers from mental cruelty and harassment on the count of your wife allowing such elements to interfere in your sacrosanct matrimonial relationship. Hence,  I would suggest you encourage your wife to seek assistance of a professional marriage counsellor along with you so that both of you can enjoy matrimonial bliss.As to your wife not yielding to 4, and then your legal remedies,  there are quite a few options involving litigation. You could opt for judicial separation, or petition restraining your wife to entertain such elements at your home without your consent. Divorce would be last resort.Which remedy would best suit your purpose and handling that litigation ---- for that I require an exhaustive consultation session with you first. You need to visit me for that. I'm based in Mumbai /navimumbai just as you are, so it shouldn't be much of an issue for you to visit me.९८२०८९७८८४ (nine eight two zero eight nine seven eight eight four)Netra Mohanchandra PantAdvocate, Navi Mumbai1591 Answers5 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Netra Mohanchandra Pant"

    "question": "How can I prevent my wife's troublesome parents/siblings from visiting my home?",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I recognize the difficulties you are facing due to the repeated disruptive actions of your wife’s parents and siblings, and your intent to prevent them from entering your home. According to Indian laws, the following is a formal legal approach to address this matter.Since you are the owner or the lawful possessor of your residence, you have every right to control who should gain access to your home or not. The previous placement, providing your wife an option to visit her parents without the interference of relatives you consider as problematic, yet denying them access to your home, was logical. Since your wife is now going to complain that you are harassing her mentally by preventing her family from visiting, I want to reiterate to you that you have never locked her out of your house from seeing her family and the restrictions are placed to ensure that you are not disturbed in your home. When counseling, it should be illustrated why certain past incidents of harassment and misconduct had to occur from her family members, and how the previous agreement made by both families was an attempt of good will. Your wife has rights to visit her family members, that you as a husband cannot refuse, but that does not mean the people who have been causing disturbances are free to enter into your home. You may ask the women’s cell or court to allow you to not have disturbance in your home while at the same time still allow your wife to visit her family as she wishes.Thus, you should stick to your decision to let your wife visit her family without limitation while explaining the legitimate grounds for limiting access of those causing disturbances to your home. In the meantime, it is also recommended to consult a lawyer about filing an injunction or any other kind of protection from further harassment.I hope this response is helpful in addressing your challenges. If you have any further queries regarding this matter, do not hesitate to contact us again.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

TheHindu Marriage Actallows a husband to file for divorce for reasons such as mental cruelty, which courts accept if reasonably shown.

    "question": "Indian girl marrying Pakistani boy",
    "answer": "Dear Client,While it is legally possible for a Pakistani citizen to marry an Indian citizen under theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, while on a tourist visa, this is generally discouraged. Marrying on a tourist visa might create complications, including issues with visa extension and legal status in India. After marriage, your husband would need to apply for an extension of his stay in India. He can apply for an X Visa (Entry Visa) based on marriage to an Indian citizen. This visa is initially granted for a year but can be extended annually.The documents required for a continuous stay include valid passport and visa, marriage certificate, proof of residence in India, application for X visa, a letter of recommendation from the Indian spouse and so on. After marriage, apply for the X Visa. Each year, apply for an extension of the X Visa through the Foreigners Regional Registration Office. Maintain proper documentation of your husband's legal stay and marriage for each extension.Under Section 5(1)(c) of the Citizenship Act, 1955, your husband can apply for Indian citizenship by naturalization after residing in India for at least 7 years. The stay must be continuous and on a valid visa. The process involves proving good character, intent to reside in India, and fulfilling other criteria set by the Ministry of Home Affairs.An X Visa does not grant work rights. To work legally, your husband would need to obtain an Employment Visa, which can be difficult for Pakistani citizens due to stringent security checks. You may explore the possibility of converting the X Visa to an Employment Visa if your husband secures a job offer.Foreigners on an X Visa are not eligible for an Aadhar card. However, your husband can use his passport and visa documents to obtain a Permanent Account Number (PAN) card, which can help in opening a bank account. He can open an NRO (Non-Resident Ordinary) account in India using his visa and passport as identification, along with proof of address in India.During the 7- year period, your husband can visit Pakistan, but re-entry into India will require re-application for a visa. Each visit outside India could affect his eligibility for citizenship, as continuous residence is required. After 7- years, travel restrictions may still apply due to existing Indo- Pak relations.You and your husband can decide the religion of your children. There is no legal obligation for children to follow the religion of either parent. Children from interfaith marriages are typically free to choose their religion upon reaching adulthood.Your ownership of immovable property in India remains unchanged after marriage. Indian property laws do not discriminate based on the nationality or religion of the spouse. Your ownership of immovable property in India remains unchanged after marriage. Indian property laws do not discriminate based on the nationality or religion of the spouse.As a couple, you can adopt under the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 (if you choose to follow Hindu law) or the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. The adoption process will take into account the religious backgrounds of both parents. Adoption in India can take anywhere from 6 months to 2 years, depending on various factors, including availability of children and legal processes.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It may not be utilized for legally engaging in work activities since the visa doesn’t allow it. Since X cannot work legally he may look for employment through volunteering with NGOs of which some might have small wages to pay, engagement in skill development activities with the aim of getting better employment in future and participation in online freelancing provided he has specialized skills. Nevertheless, freelancing should be taken wisely so as not to violate the provisions of the visa laws. If X wishes to find lawful employment in India, he should consider applying for a work visa, which is granted upon presentation of a job offer and proof of possessing a more skilled position.

    "answer": "A HUF is considered as a separate legal entity in the eyes of law  and theKarta is the head of the Hindu Undivided Family (HUF)and is the senior-most male member. The Karta has the authority to manage the family and its property, including making decisions on property disposal if needed.Therefore the Karta can purchase the property on behalf of HUF as a representative of HUF, he can add his name to sale deed and mention himself as Karta to HUF in the sale deed.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "My name required explicitly in sale agreement even though I am karta of HUF?",
    "answer": "Dear Client,To purchase property in the name of your Hindu Undivided Family (HUF), the sale agreement/deed should be drafted as follows: \"ABC (HUF) that includes Mr. M as (Karta) together with Mrs. N as (Member).\" This decision unequivocally recognizes the HUF as the buyer, while noting the Karta along with a member, which truly reflects the HUF construct. Being the Karta, you manage the affairs of HUF, such as property acquisitions, yet all significant decisions involve the consultation of all adult members. Applicable statutes contain theHindu Succession Act, 1956, which defines rights pertaining to ancestral property, the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956  and the Income Tax Act, 1961, offering tax breaks for HUFs. You must seek the advice of a legal expert to remain in compliance with all the valid laws.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Being an Australian citizen means that your divorce decree issued by an Australian federal court must be valid in India. Yet, it is advisable to consult a legal expert in India to ensure there are no extra steps necessary to confirm the validity of the decree. The 90-day waiting period mandated by theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, typically applies after divorces. However, it is ambiguous whether this condition would be relevant for you since the divorce took place overseas. To legally remarry in India, it's important to observe the formalities, predominantly obtaining a marriage license and registering the marriage per the relevant laws.

The certificate could however only be received by registering the marriage with the local Registrar of Marriages.The pandit cannot issue this certificate. This is if the husband agrees, but if he does not, then you can apply for registration with proof of marriage and in some cases force can be used legally. Again in Australia, people’s marriage which is legal in India is mostly accepted but one must possess a certificate for legal purposes.It is suggested to go for marriage registration so that you are safe legally. To continue, bring documents such as the wedding photographs, invitation cards, statements from the witnesses who assisted in the marriage registration process among others.

    "question": "Partition with OS pending",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I appreciate your feelings about the Original Suit (OS) that is due to impact one part of the agricultural land that you co-own. Firstly, since there is no stay order as granted by the court, that in fact you are legally allowed to proceed with the partition of the land. You can subdivide the 5 acres equally and get separate pattas registered in both the plots. However, it must also be noted that the OS which is still pending before the courts concerning the remainder of 1 acre could at some alter the legal position of the portion in question. Hence any activities concerning the territorial claim should be done carefully. Secondly, While the move might not necessarily violate any specific law, other individuals in their right mind that intend to buy a property with the intention of donating it to a charity organization may be deterred by the existing litigation. Hence, it would be wiser not to make any sale or gift before the resolution of the OS to prevent future legal issues or controversies. It is recommended to refrain from the sale or giving of the subject item until the outcome of the OS to prevent any future legal issues or controversies. In brief, it can be said that both part and registration are allowable, but one needs to be very careful while separating one’s share during the litigation. However, for any more information regarding this process, it is advised that you consult a property lawyer to ensure that you do not encounter any problems in the procedure.I hope this explanation resolves your doubts effectively.

    "answer": "First of all, I'm assuming it's women's cell of police. See, the police hasn't lodged any complaint against you, nor are you summoned for questioning. You can refuse the counselling and refuse to go & I would advice you to refuse to go for any counselling at police station (women's cell). You' must go only if you are summoned for questioning.My advice is based on fact that the police isn't professional trained for counselling. What happens is they pressurize both parties not to complain whatsoever and settle the matter amongst themselves. So it's just a waste of time. You go to professional marriage counsellors for counselling.As to the legalities of the situation,  well you are well within your rights to prohibit disagreeable individuals, the threatening rowdy types from entering your home, be it your wife's relatives and/or parents. Be rest assured, it doesn't amount to any cruelty and hence, you can be defended before any court of law on this count.Rather it's you, who suffers from mental cruelty and harassment on the count of your wife allowing such elements to interfere in your sacrosanct matrimonial relationship. Hence,  I would suggest you encourage your wife to seek assistance of a professional marriage counsellor along with you so that both of you can enjoy matrimonial bliss.As to your wife not yielding to 4, and then your legal remedies,  there are quite a few options involving litigation. You could opt for judicial separation, or petition restraining your wife to entertain such elements at your home without your consent. Divorce would be last resort.Which remedy would best suit your purpose and handling that litigation ---- for that I require an exhaustive consultation session with you first. You need to visit me for that.

    "question": "How can I prevent my wife's troublesome parents/siblings from visiting my home?",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I recognize the difficulties you are facing due to the repeated disruptive actions of your wife’s parents and siblings, and your intent to prevent them from entering your home. According to Indian laws, the following is a formal legal approach to address this matter.Since you are the owner or the lawful possessor of your residence, you have every right to control who should gain access to your home or not. The previous placement, providing your wife an option to visit her parents without the interference of relatives you consider as problematic, yet denying them access to your home, was logical. Since your wife is now going to complain that you are harassing her mentally by preventing her family from visiting, I want to reiterate to you that you have never locked her out of your house from seeing her family and the restrictions are placed to ensure that you are not disturbed in your home. When counseling, it should be illustrated why certain past incidents of harassment and misconduct had to occur from her family members, and how the previous agreement made by both families was an attempt of good will. Your wife has rights to visit her family members, that you as a husband cannot refuse, but that does not mean the people who have been causing disturbances are free to enter into your home. You may ask the women’s cell or court to allow you to not have disturbance in your home while at the same time still allow your wife to visit her family as she wishes.Thus, you should stick to your decision to let your wife visit her family without limitation while explaining the legitimate grounds for limiting access of those causing disturbances to your home. In the meantime, it is also recommended to consult a lawyer about filing an injunction or any other kind of protection from further harassment.I hope this response is helpful in addressing your challenges.

    "answer": "Dear Client,As per your instructions, there is some legal issue you want me to provide you with information how to leave the partnership firm legally so that there is no legal issue in future. Here is the specific approach as prescribed by the Indian laws.First of all, you should prepare a dissolution deed which will state the terms for dissolution and division of assets and liabilities. Above deed should be made on the e-stamp paper and both partners should attach their signatures. It is important that the deed shows that you are releasing all rights in relation to the firm’s property and that the remaining partner shall take responsibility for all debts such as loans and insurance losses. The deed too should, be notarized to prove its legitimacy. Secondly, the registration of the above dissolution deed with the local registrar of firms is not compulsory, but is recommended. It also adds more legal credibility to the document and makes sure that the dissolution is lawful and recognized. Subsequently, inform all related parties of the dissolution of the firm including the bank and the Punjab Finance Corporation. This is useful in recording updates as well as clearing the air that the remaining partner is liable for any owed amounts. Furthermore, to further support the action of dissolving the co-operative, it will be wise to seek a no-objection certificate from the said financial institutions to affirm that they admit the dissolution and that all the outstanding dues have been realized or assigned in terms of the deed.In conclusion the following steps should taken when one wants to legalize the termination of the partnership; the termination should be in writing in a dissolution deed, the deed should be notarized and possibly registered, and all the necessary authorities should be notified. It is also recommended to seek a lawyer’s advice to determine whether all the right procedures are being taken.I hope this response provides the depth you're seeking.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Being an Australian citizen means that your divorce decree issued by an Australian federal court must be valid in India. Yet, it is advisable to consult a legal expert in India to ensure there are no extra steps necessary to confirm the validity of the decree. The 90-day waiting period mandated by theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, typically applies after divorces. However, it is ambiguous whether this condition would be relevant for you since the divorce took place overseas. To legally remarry in India, it's important to observe the formalities, predominantly obtaining a marriage license and registering the marriage per the relevant laws. If your spouse is from India, be sure they have received all needed authorizations to marry someone from outside the country.Hope you find this answer suitable for resolving you query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The certificate could however only be received by registering the marriage with the local Registrar of Marriages.The pandit cannot issue this certificate. This is if the husband agrees, but if he does not, then you can apply for registration with proof of marriage and in some cases force can be used legally. Again in Australia, people’s marriage which is legal in India is mostly accepted but one must possess a certificate for legal purposes.It is suggested to go for marriage registration so that you are safe legally. To continue, bring documents such as the wedding photographs, invitation cards, statements from the witnesses who assisted in the marriage registration process among others.

    "answer": "- Delhi High Court granted divorce to a man on the grounds of his in-laws' frequent interference in his marital life and noted that parents should \"draw a line\" and let their daughters lead a happy, married life.- Further, the Allahabad High Court in the matter of Kumar Devi & Anr. V. State of U.P. & Ors stated that, nobody including the parents of a man and woman can interfere in the couple's married life and their living together if the two individuals are of legal age.- Hence, they cannot interfere in your personal matter after visiting again and again- Your wife should object for the same , otherwise you can file a divorce petition before the court on this ground.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "First of all, I'm assuming it's women's cell of police. See, the police hasn't lodged any complaint against you, nor are you summoned for questioning. You can refuse the counselling and refuse to go & I would advice you to refuse to go for any counselling at police station (women's cell). You' must go only if you are summoned for questioning.My advice is based on fact that the police isn't professional trained for counselling. What happens is they pressurize both parties not to complain whatsoever and settle the matter amongst themselves. So it's just a waste of time. You go to professional marriage counsellors for counselling.As to the legalities of the situation,  well you are well within your rights to prohibit disagreeable individuals, the threatening rowdy types from entering your home, be it your wife's relatives and/or parents. Be rest assured, it doesn't amount to any cruelty and hence, you can be defended before any court of law on this count.Rather it's you, who suffers from mental cruelty and harassment on the count of your wife allowing such elements to interfere in your sacrosanct matrimonial relationship. Hence,  I would suggest you encourage your wife to seek assistance of a professional marriage counsellor along with you so that both of you can enjoy matrimonial bliss.As to your wife not yielding to 4, and then your legal remedies,  there are quite a few options involving litigation. You could opt for judicial separation, or petition restraining your wife to entertain such elements at your home without your consent. Divorce would be last resort.Which remedy would best suit your purpose and handling that litigation ---- for that I require an exhaustive consultation session with you first. You need to visit me for that. I'm based in Mumbai /navimumbai just as you are, so it shouldn't be much of an issue for you to visit me.९८२०८९७८८४ (nine eight two zero eight nine seven eight eight four)Netra Mohanchandra PantAdvocate, Navi Mumbai1591 Answers5 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Netra Mohanchandra Pant"

    "question": "How can I prevent my wife's troublesome parents/siblings from visiting my home?",
    "answer": "Dear Client,I recognize the difficulties you are facing due to the repeated disruptive actions of your wife’s parents and siblings, and your intent to prevent them from entering your home. According to Indian laws, the following is a formal legal approach to address this matter.Since you are the owner or the lawful possessor of your residence, you have every right to control who should gain access to your home or not. The previous placement, providing your wife an option to visit her parents without the interference of relatives you consider as problematic, yet denying them access to your home, was logical. Since your wife is now going to complain that you are harassing her mentally by preventing her family from visiting, I want to reiterate to you that you have never locked her out of your house from seeing her family and the restrictions are placed to ensure that you are not disturbed in your home. When counseling, it should be illustrated why certain past incidents of harassment and misconduct had to occur from her family members, and how the previous agreement made by both families was an attempt of good will. Your wife has rights to visit her family members, that you as a husband cannot refuse, but that does not mean the people who have been causing disturbances are free to enter into your home. You may ask the women’s cell or court to allow you to not have disturbance in your home while at the same time still allow your wife to visit her family as she wishes.Thus, you should stick to your decision to let your wife visit her family without limitation while explaining the legitimate grounds for limiting access of those causing disturbances to your home. In the meantime, it is also recommended to consult a lawyer about filing an injunction or any other kind of protection from further harassment.I hope this response is helpful in addressing your challenges. If you have any further queries regarding this matter, do not hesitate to contact us again.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

TheHindu Marriage Actallows a husband to file for divorce for reasons such as mental cruelty, which courts accept if reasonably shown. Consulting a divorce lawyer can raise your chances of a positive result by making sure your case is thoroughly organized and well managed. You should note that courts investigate the qualities of each case distinctly, and legal principles shape their decisions.

Firstly, the application is time-barred for the reason that it was filed in January 2024, whereas according to Section 115 CPC the statement of such reasons may be filed only within ninety days from the date of receiving the petition. Secondly, revisions against older orders are not normally sustainable. Thirdly, Person B has no standing to sue since the property was sold to Person C in July 2021 and therefore doesn’t have any legal interest in the property. Based on the above-discussed factors, Person B should avoid applying for revision and contact a legal attorney for other remedies depending on the case’s circumstances.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In response to your issue, your marriage performed under Hindu traditions is legally recognized in India according to theHindu Marriage Act, 1955. The certificate could however only be received by registering the marriage with the local Registrar of Marriages.The pandit cannot issue this certificate. This is if the husband agrees, but if he does not, then you can apply for registration with proof of marriage and in some cases force can be used legally. Again in Australia, people’s marriage which is legal in India is mostly accepted but one must possess a certificate for legal purposes.It is suggested to go for marriage registration so that you are safe legally. To continue, bring documents such as the wedding photographs, invitation cards, statements from the witnesses who assisted in the marriage registration process among others. This formalizes your marriage according to the laws of both India and Australia, and protects your rights such as the right to inheritance or spousal benefits.I hope this insight provides the direction you need.

    "answer": "Dear Client,According to Indian law, specifically theHindu Succession Act, of 1956, a property that is inherited from a common ancestor is considered as ancestral property. As your father received the property through a partition suit, it has its ancestral nature. This means the property is not his self-acquired property. Also, the Mitakehara school of Hindi law is applicable in ancestral property, as you and your sister being born before the partition  in 1997, are considered coparceners by birth. According to Hindu law, all coparceners have equal and automatic rights to their ancestral property, which cannot be taken away by a will or gift. Hence,Your father cannot dispose of the whole property without your permission. The property is subject to your equal rights, and any step to transfer it without your approval would be legally challengeable.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Based on the legal principles which is established in Rohit Chauhan vs Surinder Singh &Ors(2013),the property which your father received through the 1997 partition cannot be termed as his self-acquired property.At the time of partition,as you and your sister were already born,so the property assumed the nature of coparcenary property upon partition.In Hindu law, as affirmed by the Supreme Court in the Rohit Chauhan case if any property received by any father in a partition is termed as separate property only if no coparceners exist at the time of partition.However,when coparceners are already born,they automatically receive an interest in the property by birth.Therefore,as you and your sister both were born before the partition ,both of you hold equal rights in the property as coparceners.Your father cannot take it as self-acquired property, it means he cannot transfer the property to someone without your consent.Any such transfer would be subject to challenge before the court since you and your sister both are entitled to your shares by birth under Hindu law.Thank you.Hope this answers your query .Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,If your father got a portion of the ancestral property through a court division, then the that part of property is regarded as his self-acquired property and he can do whatever he wants with it. In the case of Uttam vs. Subagh Singh, it was held by the Supreme court that where the ancestral property has been divided, the share which has been allotted to each of the parties becomes his separate property. Hence, you and your sister cannot lay your hands on your father’s share of the property without his consent either by gifting or inheriting. TheHindu Succession Act, 1956 makes it clear that the children have rights in the ancestral property by birth but the rights are excluded for the joints which are partitioned. You and your sister do not have the authority to give your father consent in order for him to sell, transfer or manage the share. For any further actions that you may wish to take concerning your father’s decisions it is advisable to engage an advocate expert in property law so that he or she can clarify you more.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,As per your instructions, there is some legal issue you want me to provide you with information how to leave the partnership firm legally so that there is no legal issue in future. Here is the specific approach as prescribed by the Indian laws.First of all, you should prepare a dissolution deed which will state the terms for dissolution and division of assets and liabilities. Above deed should be made on the e-stamp paper and both partners should attach their signatures. It is important that the deed shows that you are releasing all rights in relation to the firm’s property and that the remaining partner shall take responsibility for all debts such as loans and insurance losses. The deed too should, be notarized to prove its legitimacy. Secondly, the registration of the above dissolution deed with the local registrar of firms is not compulsory, but is recommended. It also adds more legal credibility to the document and makes sure that the dissolution is lawful and recognized. Subsequently, inform all related parties of the dissolution of the firm including the bank and the Punjab Finance Corporation. This is useful in recording updates as well as clearing the air that the remaining partner is liable for any owed amounts. Furthermore, to further support the action of dissolving the co-operative, it will be wise to seek a no-objection certificate from the said financial institutions to affirm that they admit the dissolution and that all the outstanding dues have been realized or assigned in terms of the deed.In conclusion the following steps should taken when one wants to legalize the termination of the partnership; the termination should be in writing in a dissolution deed, the deed should be notarized and possibly registered, and all the necessary authorities should be notified. It is also recommended to seek a lawyer’s advice to determine whether all the right procedures are being taken.I hope this response provides the depth you're seeking.

    "question": "Can Right to Access through a land be revoked",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You have mentioned certain concerns that you have with regards to the pathway described in the 1989 registry and its potential impact to your intended land acquisition. Let me provide a specific response that will answer your questions as follows.First, people inhabiting the area behind your land may also have a right of way across your land, granted to them the pathway in the 1989 registry. Thus, despite the area development and availability of other roads that one can use, a legally required right of way can stay valid most of the times if not formally removed by legal means. It is possibly to stop this pathway; the audience that has benefited from this cycle may attempt to make a demand to be compensated or alternatively allowed to access the channel again.Secondly, the presence of the pathway in the original registry may be an impact on the density coefficient, that is, the permissible built-up area on your land. In case the pathway is either an easement or a designated right of way, then the right of way should be free from obstruction, and this may hamper your construction plans. Consulting with a legal expert along with the specific terms listed in the 1989 registry will explain how it will affect the development possibilities.Concerning the seller’s rights, if the pathway is already formally established, the seller will be in a functionally restricted position in terms of ability to block the stated pathway without considering the rights of the users or beneficiaries of this pathway. Trying to add a provision to the registry that states that the pathway has not been utilized for over twelve years may clear the picture somewhat, yet it may not necessarily eliminate the original historical rights that were created in the registry.Finally, the addition of such a clause may have implications on the possibility of using the land to secure a mortgage. The problem is that banks usually decide to accept the land as security for a loan provided that they are given a clear title and having an unrestricted use of the property and any further or other disputes concerning the right of way may influence the decision of the bank.In general, pathway issue must be solved legally and easements and the rights must be determined and cleared properly before going for the buying. Therefore, seeking the legal advice from a lawyer will be relevant in order to safeguard your interests as you pursue the transaction.I hope this advice will be a useful guide for you.

    "answer": "Dear Client,The case discussed here contains profound legal perspectives specifically concerning the ownership of land as well as legalities of transactions in the farming community of Karjat, Maharashtra. According to the Indian law particularly the Indian Stamp Act and Registration Act the sale and purchase of property are unenforceable unless it is registered and stamp duty is paid. The 7/12 extract also shows that the certificate of title shows that the land is owned by the society and not individual members without it being stated in the bylaws. Even in instances where share certificates are issued to shareholders, the shareholders do not own the land. Members should consult the lawyers on their rights and try to negotiate with the society’s managing committee to assist in registration of the plots. Besides, they may consider paying stamp duty later and if required also, can complain to the Registrar of Societies or even go to the court to claim their rights. There is a need to follow legal provisions in an effort to pursue the interests of the individuals that are involved in property transactions.Hope you find this answer suitable for resolving you query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Unregistered transactions do not convey the legal title therefore, notarized agreement to sell is invalid. The society has a responsibility in the enforcement of these laws and cannot set by-laws that negate legal provisions. As members, you can force the society to register documents by approaching the managing committee, or even report the society to the authorities in the event that the managing committee does not act as expected. Members who do not register may be subject to litigation and the possibility of the entire land being sold without consideration of their rights.

In order not to face wrongful expulsion remember your rights and the reasons for expulsion like- failure in payment of dues or engaging in detrimental activities. If expelled without such procedures, you can appeal it to the Registrar of Cooperative Societies or sue it in civil court. On compensation, you will probably be paid for the shares you have in the society within three months if expelled, but this will only happen if the society does not forfeit it.Hope you find this advice beneficial.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "When does ancestral property become self acquired?",
    "answer": "Dear Client,If your father got a portion of the ancestral property through a court division, then the that part of property is regarded as his self-acquired property and he can do whatever he wants with it. In the case of Uttam vs. Subagh Singh, it was held by the Supreme court that where the ancestral property has been divided, the share which has been allotted to each of the parties becomes his separate property. Hence, you and your sister cannot lay your hands on your father’s share of the property without his consent either by gifting or inheriting. TheHindu Succession Act, 1956 makes it clear that the children have rights in the ancestral property by birth but the rights are excluded for the joints which are partitioned. You and your sister do not have the authority to give your father consent in order for him to sell, transfer or manage the share. For any further actions that you may wish to take concerning your father’s decisions it is advisable to engage an advocate expert in property law so that he or she can clarify you more.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,As per your instructions, there is some legal issue you want me to provide you with information how to leave the partnership firm legally so that there is no legal issue in future. Here is the specific approach as prescribed by the Indian laws.First of all, you should prepare a dissolution deed which will state the terms for dissolution and division of assets and liabilities. Above deed should be made on the e-stamp paper and both partners should attach their signatures. It is important that the deed shows that you are releasing all rights in relation to the firm’s property and that the remaining partner shall take responsibility for all debts such as loans and insurance losses. The deed too should, be notarized to prove its legitimacy. Secondly, the registration of the above dissolution deed with the local registrar of firms is not compulsory, but is recommended. It also adds more legal credibility to the document and makes sure that the dissolution is lawful and recognized. Subsequently, inform all related parties of the dissolution of the firm including the bank and the Punjab Finance Corporation. This is useful in recording updates as well as clearing the air that the remaining partner is liable for any owed amounts. Furthermore, to further support the action of dissolving the co-operative, it will be wise to seek a no-objection certificate from the said financial institutions to affirm that they admit the dissolution and that all the outstanding dues have been realized or assigned in terms of the deed.In conclusion the following steps should taken when one wants to legalize the termination of the partnership; the termination should be in writing in a dissolution deed, the deed should be notarized and possibly registered, and all the necessary authorities should be notified. It is also recommended to seek a lawyer’s advice to determine whether all the right procedures are being taken.I hope this response provides the depth you're seeking.

    "question": "Can Right to Access through a land be revoked",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You have mentioned certain concerns that you have with regards to the pathway described in the 1989 registry and its potential impact to your intended land acquisition. Let me provide a specific response that will answer your questions as follows.First, people inhabiting the area behind your land may also have a right of way across your land, granted to them the pathway in the 1989 registry. Thus, despite the area development and availability of other roads that one can use, a legally required right of way can stay valid most of the times if not formally removed by legal means. It is possibly to stop this pathway; the audience that has benefited from this cycle may attempt to make a demand to be compensated or alternatively allowed to access the channel again.Secondly, the presence of the pathway in the original registry may be an impact on the density coefficient, that is, the permissible built-up area on your land. In case the pathway is either an easement or a designated right of way, then the right of way should be free from obstruction, and this may hamper your construction plans. Consulting with a legal expert along with the specific terms listed in the 1989 registry will explain how it will affect the development possibilities.Concerning the seller’s rights, if the pathway is already formally established, the seller will be in a functionally restricted position in terms of ability to block the stated pathway without considering the rights of the users or beneficiaries of this pathway. Trying to add a provision to the registry that states that the pathway has not been utilized for over twelve years may clear the picture somewhat, yet it may not necessarily eliminate the original historical rights that were created in the registry.Finally, the addition of such a clause may have implications on the possibility of using the land to secure a mortgage. The problem is that banks usually decide to accept the land as security for a loan provided that they are given a clear title and having an unrestricted use of the property and any further or other disputes concerning the right of way may influence the decision of the bank.In general, pathway issue must be solved legally and easements and the rights must be determined and cleared properly before going for the buying. Therefore, seeking the legal advice from a lawyer will be relevant in order to safeguard your interests as you pursue the transaction.I hope this advice will be a useful guide for you.

According to the Indian law particularly the Indian Stamp Act and Registration Act the sale and purchase of property are unenforceable unless it is registered and stamp duty is paid. The 7/12 extract also shows that the certificate of title shows that the land is owned by the society and not individual members without it being stated in the bylaws. Even in instances where share certificates are issued to shareholders, the shareholders do not own the land. Members should consult the lawyers on their rights and try to negotiate with the society’s managing committee to assist in registration of the plots. Besides, they may consider paying stamp duty later and if required also, can complain to the Registrar of Societies or even go to the court to claim their rights.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In case, you file a complaint against your cooperative housing society and if they try to evict you, than they have to go through the legal process explained in the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960, specifically Section 35 which entails-eviction by passing of a voicing resolution by three-fourth members in a General Body Meeting with prior notice and an opportunity for hearing. In order not to face wrongful expulsion remember your rights and the reasons for expulsion like- failure in payment of dues or engaging in detrimental activities. If expelled without such procedures, you can appeal it to the Registrar of Cooperative Societies or sue it in civil court. On compensation, you will probably be paid for the shares you have in the society within three months if expelled, but this will only happen if the society does not forfeit it.Hope you find this advice beneficial.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Being an Australian citizen means that your divorce decree issued by an Australian federal court must be valid in India. Yet, it is advisable to consult a legal expert in India to ensure there are no extra steps necessary to confirm the validity of the decree. The 90-day waiting period mandated by theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, typically applies after divorces. However, it is ambiguous whether this condition would be relevant for you since the divorce took place overseas. To legally remarry in India, it's important to observe the formalities, predominantly obtaining a marriage license and registering the marriage per the relevant laws. If your spouse is from India, be sure they have received all needed authorizations to marry someone from outside the country.Hope you find this answer suitable for resolving you query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,As for the problem you have with the stamp duty challan where the extra zeroes were overprinted and the consequent confusion, I understand it fully. Let me explain all these facets supported with laws in India.The wrong pincode in the stamp duty challan, as such, ought not to lead to huge legal complications if all other details on this document are correct and coherent. Although, there is such a thing as pincode related to stamp duty, the pincode is more administrative and does not normally determine the legitimacy of the payment of stamp duty. However, situations that would arise where the pincode filled in the challan differs from the pincode stated in the sale agreement might lead to some concerns during the subsequent selling or legal issues.In the case, where the pincodes filled in the sale agreement and that of the stamp duty challan are different, then either during the loan disbursal or property registration there may be some issues. Most of the times, bankers and the authorities want to have secure and authentic documents to serve the purpose of loan recovery and legal issues. Any chances of inaccuracy, for example, wrong pincodes, might slow the process or may have to be rectified in order to call it a sale agreement.In order to overcome this issue, it is recommended that one should try to rectify the pincode error as soon as possible. In this case, you should inform the particular authority or the office of stamp duty to do the changes on the challan details. Finally, make double-entry to the corrected details in any other documents related to the sale agreement and the loan application forms if the client applied for that.Overall, although the wrong pincode does not necessarily mean that the challan is null and void it is advisable to attend to the loophole in order to prevent future complications such as challenges in property registration or loan procedures.I hope this response is beneficial for your situation.

As your father received the property through a partition suit, it has its ancestral nature. This means the property is not his self-acquired property. Also, the Mitakehara school of Hindi law is applicable in ancestral property, as you and your sister being born before the partition  in 1997, are considered coparceners by birth. According to Hindu law, all coparceners have equal and automatic rights to their ancestral property, which cannot be taken away by a will or gift. Hence,Your father cannot dispose of the whole property without your permission. The property is subject to your equal rights, and any step to transfer it without your approval would be legally challengeable.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Hence, you and your sister cannot lay your hands on your father’s share of the property without his consent either by gifting or inheriting. TheHindu Succession Act, 1956 makes it clear that the children have rights in the ancestral property by birth but the rights are excluded for the joints which are partitioned. You and your sister do not have the authority to give your father consent in order for him to sell, transfer or manage the share.

As there is no rental agreement, you can still demand compensation based on the principle of unjust enrichment under section 70 of the Indian Contract Act,1872. This section will help you to get back what's owed to you when someone benefits from your property or service without a proper reason.

    "question": "Can Right to Access through a land be revoked",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You have mentioned certain concerns that you have with regards to the pathway described in the 1989 registry and its potential impact to your intended land acquisition. Let me provide a specific response that will answer your questions as follows.First, people inhabiting the area behind your land may also have a right of way across your land, granted to them the pathway in the 1989 registry. Thus, despite the area development and availability of other roads that one can use, a legally required right of way can stay valid most of the times if not formally removed by legal means. It is possibly to stop this pathway; the audience that has benefited from this cycle may attempt to make a demand to be compensated or alternatively allowed to access the channel again.Secondly, the presence of the pathway in the original registry may be an impact on the density coefficient, that is, the permissible built-up area on your land. In case the pathway is either an easement or a designated right of way, then the right of way should be free from obstruction, and this may hamper your construction plans. Consulting with a legal expert along with the specific terms listed in the 1989 registry will explain how it will affect the development possibilities.Concerning the seller’s rights, if the pathway is already formally established, the seller will be in a functionally restricted position in terms of ability to block the stated pathway without considering the rights of the users or beneficiaries of this pathway. Trying to add a provision to the registry that states that the pathway has not been utilized for over twelve years may clear the picture somewhat, yet it may not necessarily eliminate the original historical rights that were created in the registry.Finally, the addition of such a clause may have implications on the possibility of using the land to secure a mortgage. The problem is that banks usually decide to accept the land as security for a loan provided that they are given a clear title and having an unrestricted use of the property and any further or other disputes concerning the right of way may influence the decision of the bank.In general, pathway issue must be solved legally and easements and the rights must be determined and cleared properly before going for the buying. Therefore, seeking the legal advice from a lawyer will be relevant in order to safeguard your interests as you pursue the transaction.I hope this advice will be a useful guide for you.

    "answer": "Dear Client,The case discussed here contains profound legal perspectives specifically concerning the ownership of land as well as legalities of transactions in the farming community of Karjat, Maharashtra. According to the Indian law particularly the Indian Stamp Act and Registration Act the sale and purchase of property are unenforceable unless it is registered and stamp duty is paid. The 7/12 extract also shows that the certificate of title shows that the land is owned by the society and not individual members without it being stated in the bylaws. Even in instances where share certificates are issued to shareholders, the shareholders do not own the land. Members should consult the lawyers on their rights and try to negotiate with the society’s managing committee to assist in registration of the plots. Besides, they may consider paying stamp duty later and if required also, can complain to the Registrar of Societies or even go to the court to claim their rights. There is a need to follow legal provisions in an effort to pursue the interests of the individuals that are involved in property transactions.Hope you find this answer suitable for resolving you query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Unregistered transactions do not convey the legal title therefore, notarized agreement to sell is invalid. The society has a responsibility in the enforcement of these laws and cannot set by-laws that negate legal provisions. As members, you can force the society to register documents by approaching the managing committee, or even report the society to the authorities in the event that the managing committee does not act as expected.

In order not to face wrongful expulsion remember your rights and the reasons for expulsion like- failure in payment of dues or engaging in detrimental activities. If expelled without such procedures, you can appeal it to the Registrar of Cooperative Societies or sue it in civil court. On compensation, you will probably be paid for the shares you have in the society within three months if expelled, but this will only happen if the society does not forfeit it.Hope you find this advice beneficial.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "In stamp duty challan the pincode we entered is incorrect.",
    "answer": "Dear Client,As for the problem you have with the stamp duty challan where the extra zeroes were overprinted and the consequent confusion, I understand it fully. Let me explain all these facets supported with laws in India.The wrong pincode in the stamp duty challan, as such, ought not to lead to huge legal complications if all other details on this document are correct and coherent. Although, there is such a thing as pincode related to stamp duty, the pincode is more administrative and does not normally determine the legitimacy of the payment of stamp duty. However, situations that would arise where the pincode filled in the challan differs from the pincode stated in the sale agreement might lead to some concerns during the subsequent selling or legal issues.In the case, where the pincodes filled in the sale agreement and that of the stamp duty challan are different, then either during the loan disbursal or property registration there may be some issues. Most of the times, bankers and the authorities want to have secure and authentic documents to serve the purpose of loan recovery and legal issues. Any chances of inaccuracy, for example, wrong pincodes, might slow the process or may have to be rectified in order to call it a sale agreement.In order to overcome this issue, it is recommended that one should try to rectify the pincode error as soon as possible. In this case, you should inform the particular authority or the office of stamp duty to do the changes on the challan details. Finally, make double-entry to the corrected details in any other documents related to the sale agreement and the loan application forms if the client applied for that.Overall, although the wrong pincode does not necessarily mean that the challan is null and void it is advisable to attend to the loophole in order to prevent future complications such as challenges in property registration or loan procedures.I hope this response is beneficial for your situation.

    "question": "When does ancestral property become self acquired?",
    "answer": "Dear Client,According to Indian law, specifically theHindu Succession Act, of 1956, a property that is inherited from a common ancestor is considered as ancestral property. As your father received the property through a partition suit, it has its ancestral nature. This means the property is not his self-acquired property. Also, the Mitakehara school of Hindi law is applicable in ancestral property, as you and your sister being born before the partition  in 1997, are considered coparceners by birth. According to Hindu law, all coparceners have equal and automatic rights to their ancestral property, which cannot be taken away by a will or gift. Hence,Your father cannot dispose of the whole property without your permission. The property is subject to your equal rights, and any step to transfer it without your approval would be legally challengeable.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Based on the legal principles which is established in Rohit Chauhan vs Surinder Singh &Ors(2013),the property which your father received through the 1997 partition cannot be termed as his self-acquired property.At the time of partition,as you and your sister were already born,so the property assumed the nature of coparcenary property upon partition.In Hindu law, as affirmed by the Supreme Court in the Rohit Chauhan case if any property received by any father in a partition is termed as separate property only if no coparceners exist at the time of partition.However,when coparceners are already born,they automatically receive an interest in the property by birth.Therefore,as you and your sister both were born before the partition ,both of you hold equal rights in the property as coparceners.Your father cannot take it as self-acquired property, it means he cannot transfer the property to someone without your consent.Any such transfer would be subject to challenge before the court since you and your sister both are entitled to your shares by birth under Hindu law.Thank you.Hope this answers your query .Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,If your father got a portion of the ancestral property through a court division, then the that part of property is regarded as his self-acquired property and he can do whatever he wants with it. In the case of Uttam vs. Subagh Singh, it was held by the Supreme court that where the ancestral property has been divided, the share which has been allotted to each of the parties becomes his separate property. Hence, you and your sister cannot lay your hands on your father’s share of the property without his consent either by gifting or inheriting. TheHindu Succession Act, 1956 makes it clear that the children have rights in the ancestral property by birth but the rights are excluded for the joints which are partitioned. You and your sister do not have the authority to give your father consent in order for him to sell, transfer or manage the share. For any further actions that you may wish to take concerning your father’s decisions it is advisable to engage an advocate expert in property law so that he or she can clarify you more.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can Right to Access through a land be revoked",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You have mentioned certain concerns that you have with regards to the pathway described in the 1989 registry and its potential impact to your intended land acquisition. Let me provide a specific response that will answer your questions as follows.First, people inhabiting the area behind your land may also have a right of way across your land, granted to them the pathway in the 1989 registry. Thus, despite the area development and availability of other roads that one can use, a legally required right of way can stay valid most of the times if not formally removed by legal means. It is possibly to stop this pathway; the audience that has benefited from this cycle may attempt to make a demand to be compensated or alternatively allowed to access the channel again.Secondly, the presence of the pathway in the original registry may be an impact on the density coefficient, that is, the permissible built-up area on your land. In case the pathway is either an easement or a designated right of way, then the right of way should be free from obstruction, and this may hamper your construction plans. Consulting with a legal expert along with the specific terms listed in the 1989 registry will explain how it will affect the development possibilities.Concerning the seller’s rights, if the pathway is already formally established, the seller will be in a functionally restricted position in terms of ability to block the stated pathway without considering the rights of the users or beneficiaries of this pathway. Trying to add a provision to the registry that states that the pathway has not been utilized for over twelve years may clear the picture somewhat, yet it may not necessarily eliminate the original historical rights that were created in the registry.Finally, the addition of such a clause may have implications on the possibility of using the land to secure a mortgage. The problem is that banks usually decide to accept the land as security for a loan provided that they are given a clear title and having an unrestricted use of the property and any further or other disputes concerning the right of way may influence the decision of the bank.In general, pathway issue must be solved legally and easements and the rights must be determined and cleared properly before going for the buying. Therefore, seeking the legal advice from a lawyer will be relevant in order to safeguard your interests as you pursue the transaction.I hope this advice will be a useful guide for you.

    "answer": "Dear Client,As for the problem you have with the stamp duty challan where the extra zeroes were overprinted and the consequent confusion, I understand it fully. Let me explain all these facets supported with laws in India.The wrong pincode in the stamp duty challan, as such, ought not to lead to huge legal complications if all other details on this document are correct and coherent. Although, there is such a thing as pincode related to stamp duty, the pincode is more administrative and does not normally determine the legitimacy of the payment of stamp duty. However, situations that would arise where the pincode filled in the challan differs from the pincode stated in the sale agreement might lead to some concerns during the subsequent selling or legal issues.In the case, where the pincodes filled in the sale agreement and that of the stamp duty challan are different, then either during the loan disbursal or property registration there may be some issues. Most of the times, bankers and the authorities want to have secure and authentic documents to serve the purpose of loan recovery and legal issues. Any chances of inaccuracy, for example, wrong pincodes, might slow the process or may have to be rectified in order to call it a sale agreement.In order to overcome this issue, it is recommended that one should try to rectify the pincode error as soon as possible. In this case, you should inform the particular authority or the office of stamp duty to do the changes on the challan details. Finally, make double-entry to the corrected details in any other documents related to the sale agreement and the loan application forms if the client applied for that.Overall, although the wrong pincode does not necessarily mean that the challan is null and void it is advisable to attend to the loophole in order to prevent future complications such as challenges in property registration or loan procedures.I hope this response is beneficial for your situation.

    "answer": "Dear Client,The case discussed here contains profound legal perspectives specifically concerning the ownership of land as well as legalities of transactions in the farming community of Karjat, Maharashtra. According to the Indian law particularly the Indian Stamp Act and Registration Act the sale and purchase of property are unenforceable unless it is registered and stamp duty is paid. The 7/12 extract also shows that the certificate of title shows that the land is owned by the society and not individual members without it being stated in the bylaws. Even in instances where share certificates are issued to shareholders, the shareholders do not own the land. Members should consult the lawyers on their rights and try to negotiate with the society’s managing committee to assist in registration of the plots. Besides, they may consider paying stamp duty later and if required also, can complain to the Registrar of Societies or even go to the court to claim their rights. There is a need to follow legal provisions in an effort to pursue the interests of the individuals that are involved in property transactions.Hope you find this answer suitable for resolving you query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Unregistered transactions do not convey the legal title therefore, notarized agreement to sell is invalid. The society has a responsibility in the enforcement of these laws and cannot set by-laws that negate legal provisions. As members, you can force the society to register documents by approaching the managing committee, or even report the society to the authorities in the event that the managing committee does not act as expected. Members who do not register may be subject to litigation and the possibility of the entire land being sold without consideration of their rights.

In order not to face wrongful expulsion remember your rights and the reasons for expulsion like- failure in payment of dues or engaging in detrimental activities. If expelled without such procedures, you can appeal it to the Registrar of Cooperative Societies or sue it in civil court. On compensation, you will probably be paid for the shares you have in the society within three months if expelled, but this will only happen if the society does not forfeit it.Hope you find this advice beneficial.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Sorry to hear about your condition.According to the RPwD Act, 2016, while filing an appeal against any order passed by the Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities (CCPD), the act does not consist of an appellate provision to appeal against the CCPD’s order. Thus, the conventional legal treatment would be to move to the higher court by filing a writ petition under Article 226 of theConstitution of Indiaand praying for judicial review of the CCPD’s decision. This approach is taken when Challenging quasi-judicial orders that do not provide a statutory right of appeal.A writ petition would enable you to appeal the decision on the different grounds such as illegality, irrationality, or procedural impropriety. The High Court has jurisdiction to consider whether or not the CCPD complied with the law and whether the procedural fairness was complied with or not. CCPD orders are of administrative nature, thus, in case of extreme need you can apply for a writ of certiorari or mandamus depending on the kind of relief you want.In regards to workplace discrimination and retaliation your rights are protected under the RPwD act especially section 20 that deals with nondiscrimination in employment, However,with 90% blindness, finding employment is still a vital challenge. If the CCPD has not provided sufficient relief, the High Court can be contacted for enforcing your rights and for handling the punitive transfer, perhaps for requesting a stay with regard to the transfer in addition to discrimination and retaliation.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,According to Indian law, specifically theHindu Succession Act, of 1956, a property that is inherited from a common ancestor is considered as ancestral property. As your father received the property through a partition suit, it has its ancestral nature. This means the property is not his self-acquired property. Also, the Mitakehara school of Hindi law is applicable in ancestral property, as you and your sister being born before the partition  in 1997, are considered coparceners by birth. According to Hindu law, all coparceners have equal and automatic rights to their ancestral property, which cannot be taken away by a will or gift. Hence,Your father cannot dispose of the whole property without your permission. The property is subject to your equal rights, and any step to transfer it without your approval would be legally challengeable.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This implies that only that property which has flown undivided across four generations is called ancestral property.- Further, once an ancestral property is partitioned amongst the coparceners it loses the characteristic of ancestral property and become Self acquired property.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "When does ancestral property become self acquired?",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Based on the legal principles which is established in Rohit Chauhan vs Surinder Singh &Ors(2013),the property which your father received through the 1997 partition cannot be termed as his self-acquired property.At the time of partition,as you and your sister were already born,so the property assumed the nature of coparcenary property upon partition.In Hindu law, as affirmed by the Supreme Court in the Rohit Chauhan case if any property received by any father in a partition is termed as separate property only if no coparceners exist at the time of partition.However,when coparceners are already born,they automatically receive an interest in the property by birth.Therefore,as you and your sister both were born before the partition ,both of you hold equal rights in the property as coparceners.Your father cannot take it as self-acquired property, it means he cannot transfer the property to someone without your consent.Any such transfer would be subject to challenge before the court since you and your sister both are entitled to your shares by birth under Hindu law.Thank you.Hope this answers your query .Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "The Supreme Court of India has ruled that ancestral property loses its ancestral character and becomes self-acquired property after it's partitioned. This means that the property can be distributed through a will, but only in regard to the individual's share.To qualify as ancestral property, the property must have been acquired by a common ancestor and remained undivided, unsold, and unpartitioned throughout subsequent generations.This property already stands partitioned hence it is no more an ancestral property in nature.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "When does ancestral property become self acquired?",
    "answer": "Dear Client,If your father got a portion of the ancestral property through a court division, then the that part of property is regarded as his self-acquired property and he can do whatever he wants with it. In the case of Uttam vs. Subagh Singh, it was held by the Supreme court that where the ancestral property has been divided, the share which has been allotted to each of the parties becomes his separate property. Hence, you and your sister cannot lay your hands on your father’s share of the property without his consent either by gifting or inheriting. TheHindu Succession Act, 1956 makes it clear that the children have rights in the ancestral property by birth but the rights are excluded for the joints which are partitioned. You and your sister do not have the authority to give your father consent in order for him to sell, transfer or manage the share. For any further actions that you may wish to take concerning your father’s decisions it is advisable to engage an advocate expert in property law so that he or she can clarify you more.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Unregistered and unstamped forged MOU challenging",
    "answer": "Dear Client,There are several legal grounds that can be used to counter the MOU that your father-in-law’s siblings have formulated. First, the MOU is signed without stamp and registration hence cannot be invocated under the Indian Stamp Act. Thus the MOU may be held to come under Section 14(d) of the Specific Relief Act and therefore cannot be specifically enforced. If there were omission of consideration or if the MOU was prepared and signed with fraudulent intention (for example, using letterhead with prior consent) than such considerations would make the MOU legally void under the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Your lawyer should file an application to dismiss the suit based on these argument and further rebut the admissibility of the MOU as evidence. Similarly, relevant case laws like Royal Orchids vs. Kulbir Singh Kohli & Anr. where the court stated that the effect of such agreements cannot be achieved where the agreement fails to meet the basic legal formalities.Hope this answer solves your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Because the gift-deed and sale-deed expect the recipient to be a farmer and none of the heirs are farmers, other ways need to be used. Despite the operating of theHindu Succession Actof 1956 an individual can in any way he wishes deal with the self-acquired property as he or she wants without reference to any legal heirs except where such actions would be prejudicial to the legal heirs. But to prevent any future complications, it is always safer to seek written consent of all the legal heirs before effecting any distribution or transfer of the property. It is wise to seek an attorney who is well versed in property laws in Gujarat to ensure that he or she provides specific advice on any complications that may be come up in the course of this process.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

According to the Indian law particularly the Indian Stamp Act and Registration Act the sale and purchase of property are unenforceable unless it is registered and stamp duty is paid. The 7/12 extract also shows that the certificate of title shows that the land is owned by the society and not individual members without it being stated in the bylaws. Even in instances where share certificates are issued to shareholders, the shareholders do not own the land. Members should consult the lawyers on their rights and try to negotiate with the society’s managing committee to assist in registration of the plots.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In case, you file a complaint against your cooperative housing society and if they try to evict you, than they have to go through the legal process explained in the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960, specifically Section 35 which entails-eviction by passing of a voicing resolution by three-fourth members in a General Body Meeting with prior notice and an opportunity for hearing. In order not to face wrongful expulsion remember your rights and the reasons for expulsion like- failure in payment of dues or engaging in detrimental activities. If expelled without such procedures, you can appeal it to the Registrar of Cooperative Societies or sue it in civil court. On compensation, you will probably be paid for the shares you have in the society within three months if expelled, but this will only happen if the society does not forfeit it.Hope you find this advice beneficial.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Legal Remedies for Challenging CCPD Orders and Retaliation in Workplace for 90% Blind PwD",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Sorry to hear about your condition.According to the RPwD Act, 2016, while filing an appeal against any order passed by the Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities (CCPD), the act does not consist of an appellate provision to appeal against the CCPD’s order. Thus, the conventional legal treatment would be to move to the higher court by filing a writ petition under Article 226 of theConstitution of Indiaand praying for judicial review of the CCPD’s decision. This approach is taken when Challenging quasi-judicial orders that do not provide a statutory right of appeal.A writ petition would enable you to appeal the decision on the different grounds such as illegality, irrationality, or procedural impropriety. The High Court has jurisdiction to consider whether or not the CCPD complied with the law and whether the procedural fairness was complied with or not. CCPD orders are of administrative nature, thus, in case of extreme need you can apply for a writ of certiorari or mandamus depending on the kind of relief you want.In regards to workplace discrimination and retaliation your rights are protected under the RPwD act especially section 20 that deals with nondiscrimination in employment, However,with 90% blindness, finding employment is still a vital challenge. If the CCPD has not provided sufficient relief, the High Court can be contacted for enforcing your rights and for handling the punitive transfer, perhaps for requesting a stay with regard to the transfer in addition to discrimination and retaliation.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

As your father received the property through a partition suit, it has its ancestral nature. This means the property is not his self-acquired property. Also, the Mitakehara school of Hindi law is applicable in ancestral property, as you and your sister being born before the partition  in 1997, are considered coparceners by birth. According to Hindu law, all coparceners have equal and automatic rights to their ancestral property, which cannot be taken away by a will or gift. Hence,Your father cannot dispose of the whole property without your permission. The property is subject to your equal rights, and any step to transfer it without your approval would be legally challengeable.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,If your father got a portion of the ancestral property through a court division, then the that part of property is regarded as his self-acquired property and he can do whatever he wants with it. In the case of Uttam vs. Subagh Singh, it was held by the Supreme court that where the ancestral property has been divided, the share which has been allotted to each of the parties becomes his separate property. Hence, you and your sister cannot lay your hands on your father’s share of the property without his consent either by gifting or inheriting. TheHindu Succession Act, 1956 makes it clear that the children have rights in the ancestral property by birth but the rights are excluded for the joints which are partitioned. You and your sister do not have the authority to give your father consent in order for him to sell, transfer or manage the share. For any further actions that you may wish to take concerning your father’s decisions it is advisable to engage an advocate expert in property law so that he or she can clarify you more.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Unregistered and unstamped forged MOU challenging",
    "answer": "Dear Client,There are several legal grounds that can be used to counter the MOU that your father-in-law’s siblings have formulated. First, the MOU is signed without stamp and registration hence cannot be invocated under the Indian Stamp Act. Thus the MOU may be held to come under Section 14(d) of the Specific Relief Act and therefore cannot be specifically enforced. If there were omission of consideration or if the MOU was prepared and signed with fraudulent intention (for example, using letterhead with prior consent) than such considerations would make the MOU legally void under the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Your lawyer should file an application to dismiss the suit based on these argument and further rebut the admissibility of the MOU as evidence. Similarly, relevant case laws like Royal Orchids vs. Kulbir Singh Kohli & Anr. where the court stated that the effect of such agreements cannot be achieved where the agreement fails to meet the basic legal formalities.Hope this answer solves your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In the absence of legal paperwork, collect as much evidence as possible including bank statements, witnesses, or any other records that will show that wages were made on time and no dues outstanding.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Sorry to hear about your condition,To address this, as soon as you receive a summons from the Labour Court, you should go to the court and defend the case. Say very clearly that you are running a separate business from your father and both of you have different GST registration. Stress on the fact that the particular ex-employee was serving your business, not your father’s business, which seems to be a gray matter for him. In the absence of legal paperwork, collect as much evidence as possible including bank statements, witnesses, or any other records that will show that wages were made on time and no dues outstanding. Fight the wrongful termination claim by proving that you acted fairly in termination even if the agreements were in verbal form. Hire the services of a labor lawyer who will be of big help in defending your case and in making sure that your father being diagnosed with a health complication, will not be dragged in this case, unnecessarily. It is required of you to act fast if you are not to face any negative judgment.Thank you.Hope you get the satisfactory answer.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "When does ancestral property become self acquired?",
    "answer": "Dear Client,According to Indian law, specifically theHindu Succession Act, of 1956, a property that is inherited from a common ancestor is considered as ancestral property. As your father received the property through a partition suit, it has its ancestral nature. This means the property is not his self-acquired property. Also, the Mitakehara school of Hindi law is applicable in ancestral property, as you and your sister being born before the partition  in 1997, are considered coparceners by birth. According to Hindu law, all coparceners have equal and automatic rights to their ancestral property, which cannot be taken away by a will or gift. Hence,Your father cannot dispose of the whole property without your permission. The property is subject to your equal rights, and any step to transfer it without your approval would be legally challengeable.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "When does ancestral property become self acquired?",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Based on the legal principles which is established in Rohit Chauhan vs Surinder Singh &Ors(2013),the property which your father received through the 1997 partition cannot be termed as his self-acquired property.At the time of partition,as you and your sister were already born,so the property assumed the nature of coparcenary property upon partition.In Hindu law, as affirmed by the Supreme Court in the Rohit Chauhan case if any property received by any father in a partition is termed as separate property only if no coparceners exist at the time of partition.However,when coparceners are already born,they automatically receive an interest in the property by birth.Therefore,as you and your sister both were born before the partition ,both of you hold equal rights in the property as coparceners.Your father cannot take it as self-acquired property, it means he cannot transfer the property to someone without your consent.Any such transfer would be subject to challenge before the court since you and your sister both are entitled to your shares by birth under Hindu law.Thank you.Hope this answers your query .Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "When does ancestral property become self acquired?",
    "answer": "Dear Client,If your father got a portion of the ancestral property through a court division, then the that part of property is regarded as his self-acquired property and he can do whatever he wants with it. In the case of Uttam vs. Subagh Singh, it was held by the Supreme court that where the ancestral property has been divided, the share which has been allotted to each of the parties becomes his separate property. Hence, you and your sister cannot lay your hands on your father’s share of the property without his consent either by gifting or inheriting. TheHindu Succession Act, 1956 makes it clear that the children have rights in the ancestral property by birth but the rights are excluded for the joints which are partitioned. You and your sister do not have the authority to give your father consent in order for him to sell, transfer or manage the share. For any further actions that you may wish to take concerning your father’s decisions it is advisable to engage an advocate expert in property law so that he or she can clarify you more.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Before filing an Execution Petition (EP) to have a tenant evicted after the judge granted an ex-parte eviction order but the tenant was not present in the process, obtain a certified copy of the order. Prepare the EP under Order 21 of the CPC providing the details of the original suit and the ex-parte order made and file the same in the same court along with the court fee. The court shall notify the tenant on the intended execution proceedings to enable them to come with their remarks. If the court finds merit in your case it will order the landlord to evict you. If the tenant refuses to leave peacefully the landlords may seek the assistance of the police as provided under Order 21 Rule 35 CPC. Make sure that all the paperwork is correct and if in doubt, seek the service of a lawyer.

    "question": "Unregistered and unstamped forged MOU challenging",
    "answer": "Dear Client,There are several legal grounds that can be used to counter the MOU that your father-in-law’s siblings have formulated. First, the MOU is signed without stamp and registration hence cannot be invocated under the Indian Stamp Act. Thus the MOU may be held to come under Section 14(d) of the Specific Relief Act and therefore cannot be specifically enforced. If there were omission of consideration or if the MOU was prepared and signed with fraudulent intention (for example, using letterhead with prior consent) than such considerations would make the MOU legally void under the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Your lawyer should file an application to dismiss the suit based on these argument and further rebut the admissibility of the MOU as evidence. Similarly, relevant case laws like Royal Orchids vs. Kulbir Singh Kohli & Anr. where the court stated that the effect of such agreements cannot be achieved where the agreement fails to meet the basic legal formalities.Hope this answer solves your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Alleged misconduct with employers",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In Indian law, several aspects need to be considered in your situation:About the delayed stipend, the organisation affirmed that, according to the offer letter, you were supposed to be paid ₹10,000 per month. If they agreed to disburse the stipend at the end of the internship but decided to delay it this maybe a clear violation of the contract.You were entitled to follow up this payment and your attempts to get a reply is warranted in this case. It should also not be considered a violation whether your family member called the HR department demanding the delay in the stipend if he or she conducted such in a polite language without using abusive language.If in a communication the call was recorded or the content of the communication was not abusive the matter cannot be considered as harassment or misconduct unless it involved threatening or intimidating communication. It is unimaginable that you or your family member is involve in the misconduct that have been alleges. It is usually the duty of such companies to come up with substantial evidence and also investigate before coming up with such allegations.It has to be shown and cannot be done just by the company’s claims of the other party’s misconduct. If the company is making claims without a proper investigation, then their actions could be prevailed. As for the threats related to involvement of the police, of course, taking into consideration the fact that the HR representative was a woman, this could be considered as an overreaction.Harassment is behaviour that is not wanted and is likely to result to distress. If the threats where made for no reason and where of a much higher magnitude than the situation is warranted they where a clear attempt at trying to scare the other party into submission rather than legal action. When writing an apology letter, it should be done with a lot of professionalism done of course. It should seek to clear any misconception, and declare your intention to address the issue out of the court. First, the apology has to recognize possible misunderstanding that may exist but deny the wrongdoing if it did not happenIf you think the company’s actions are unjust or probably unlawful, calling a labor lawyer may well enlighten you and assist you on handling any wrongful claims or discharge against you.Thank you.I hope the answer is fruitful.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If the case is still pending, this must be stated in the PCC application, and this can lead to a non-clear PCC. But if a court order to quash the case is attained than very clean PCC can be acquired. As per Indian law, an application for passport cannot be rejected only on the grounds of a pending case Those have made certain legal decisions which states that the PCC should be issued, if there is no wrong record against the applicant as initiated in the two cases like B. V. V. Suryanarayana v Union of Andhra Pradesh and Shahul Hameed v Regional Passport Officer.

Since you have a pending case undersection 498A,the police charges will most probably be mentioned in the PCC.

    "answer": "Dear Client,A Gift deed will be the best option because it will enable you to transfer the title of the house to your son instantly, is cheaper as it attract lesser registration fees than a will and does not have some of the drawbacks of a will which transfers the ownership of the property after the death of the owner.However a Will helps transfer property only after your death and may require probate process which is a little formal and lengthyAnd the purpose of the gift deed is good to which your son’s presence is not necessary if he hands over the power of attorney to a third person and identity proof of your son. This ensures that this transfer can be effected without him and without any complications. Therefore, Gift Deed is a better option for the instant transfer with easy registration and free from most of the hassle issues in the future.Thank you.Hope you find this advice beneficial.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "False SC/ST Act",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case, Section 183 of BNSS (Previously, section 164 of the CrPC),  permits a witness to give statements against various parties despite its credibility being subject to questioning. The fact that no charge sheet has been filed by the I.O. does not in any way prejudices your application for anticipatory bail although a later charge sheet may alter the court’s view. If the fingerprints are yours, but you did not steal, it is better to provide the alibi to the I.O. to prove you are innocent. Because the accused is close to the ruling party, it is understandable to raise issues of bias investigation; you may consider asking a third party like the CBI to investigate the matter impartially. As a rule, it is invalid to file several charge sheets in connection with the same offence unless there are new facts therein. In the FIR, you stated that you did not know the accused and are not friends with him, which could greatly harm your case. Due to these complications, it is advisable to seek services from an expert criminal lawyer to ensure that you are well protected all the time.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Property division",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the case your parents set out a will to bequeath the property between you and your sister, it will give a legal channel to follow in the division of the property. However, if your elder brother declines to share, he also may try to take over the control. In order to avoid future conflict, the will should state which part of the property belongs to a particular heir and that no person is allowed to sell or transfer any part of the property without the consent of all the other parties. In case of dispute, you and your sister can take a legal action in accordance with the provisions of the Partition Act, 1893 and approach the Court to get the property divided in accordance with the proportionate share. Moreover, theHindu Succession Act, 1956, grants equal portion to all heirs disregarding your brother’s intention to have large pieces of the property. It is desirable to execute the will in such a manner that the management of the estate is not hampered after the death of parents; it is also possible to obtain the will probate, which will be legally valid. Seeking services of an advocate to draw the will with appropriate terms and conditions is crucial to safeguard the rights of the property owners against possible future legal battles.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can I get PCC certificate if I have pending divorce case and false 498a case in India",
    "answer": "Since a criminal case is pending against you, the police may furnish adverse report  which will affect the police clearance certificate for the purpose of visa.a pending criminal case will definitely affect your Police Clearance Certificate (PCC), as it indicates a potential criminal record, and most countries will mention the pending case on your PCC even if you haven't been convicted yet; this can impact your ability to travel or obtain visas depending on the destination country's policies.When applying for a PCC, you are required to disclose any pending criminal cases, and the authorities will include this information on the certificate.A pending case can raise concerns for immigration authorities and may lead to delays or rejection of visa applications, especially for countries with strict immigration policies.The exact impact of a pending case on your PCC can vary depending on the country you are applying to."

    "answer": "Dear Client,It is not impossible for a woman to get a PCC in India if one is involved in a 498A case and visa is pending. If the case is still pending, this must be stated in the PCC application, and this can lead to a non-clear PCC. But if a court order to quash the case is attained than very clean PCC can be acquired. As per Indian law, an application for passport cannot be rejected only on the grounds of a pending case Those have made certain legal decisions which states that the PCC should be issued, if there is no wrong record against the applicant as initiated in the two cases like B. V. V. Suryanarayana v Union of Andhra Pradesh and Shahul Hameed v Regional Passport Officer. In order to fasten the PCC process, get a certified copy of the quashing order and confirm that all relevant papers are well organized. In this case, it is recommended to consult a lawyer, so as not to get lost in legal matters and smooth the procedure for solving of the case. It is therefore necessary to be clear and provide all the documents needed for a successful application to be made.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In India police clearance certificate is obtained after  verifying the  record by the police officer for any criminal activity. Since you have a pending case undersection 498A,the police charges will most probably be mentioned in the PCC. As there is no such evidence in the case, the police may still mention any other criminal charges made in relation to a citizen. This can be an issue for your Canadian permanent residency application since Canada does conduct Criminality Checks during immigration. Technically, there is no legal method of accelerating the PCC if the specific case is still pending but you can consult with  a legal attorney to look for a legal solution to resolve the case in a short period  of time.Thank you.Hope you find the answer satisfactoryAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Alleged misconduct with employers",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In Indian law, several aspects need to be considered in your situation:About the delayed stipend, the organisation affirmed that, according to the offer letter, you were supposed to be paid ₹10,000 per month. If they agreed to disburse the stipend at the end of the internship but decided to delay it this maybe a clear violation of the contract.You were entitled to follow up this payment and your attempts to get a reply is warranted in this case. It should also not be considered a violation whether your family member called the HR department demanding the delay in the stipend if he or she conducted such in a polite language without using abusive language.If in a communication the call was recorded or the content of the communication was not abusive the matter cannot be considered as harassment or misconduct unless it involved threatening or intimidating communication. It is unimaginable that you or your family member is involve in the misconduct that have been alleges. It is usually the duty of such companies to come up with substantial evidence and also investigate before coming up with such allegations.It has to be shown and cannot be done just by the company’s claims of the other party’s misconduct. If the company is making claims without a proper investigation, then their actions could be prevailed. As for the threats related to involvement of the police, of course, taking into consideration the fact that the HR representative was a woman, this could be considered as an overreaction.Harassment is behaviour that is not wanted and is likely to result to distress. If the threats where made for no reason and where of a much higher magnitude than the situation is warranted they where a clear attempt at trying to scare the other party into submission rather than legal action. When writing an apology letter, it should be done with a lot of professionalism done of course. It should seek to clear any misconception, and declare your intention to address the issue out of the court. First, the apology has to recognize possible misunderstanding that may exist but deny the wrongdoing if it did not happenIf you think the company’s actions are unjust or probably unlawful, calling a labor lawyer may well enlighten you and assist you on handling any wrongful claims or discharge against you.Thank you.I hope the answer is fruitful.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Based on the information provided, I will try to guide you on the grounds for seeking divorce in India and the relevant legal provisions.Grounds for Divorce in India: Under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, which applies to Sikhs as well, the following grounds are available for seeking divorce:a) Adultery (Section 13(1)(i)): Although adultery has been decriminalized, it remains a valid ground for seeking divorce in India.b) Cruelty (Section 13(1)(ia)): The assault and harassment you faced from your wife can potentially be considered cruelty, which is a ground for divorce.c) Desertion (Section 13(1)(ib)): If your wife has deserted you for a continuous period of at least two years immediately preceding the presentation of the divorce petition, you can seek divorce on this ground.Evidence: You mentioned having call records from the telecom company and some recordings as evidence of your wife's adultery. These can be crucial pieces of evidence to support your divorce petition.Procedure: You can file a divorce petition in the appropriate Family Court or District Court in India, where your wife is currently residing or where the marriage was solemnized. The court will consider the evidence presented by both parties and decide on granting the divorce based on the merits of the case.Dowry Allegations: Regarding the false dowry allegations made by your wife, the closure of the case by the SSP office stating no dowry was demanded or given will work in your favor. You can present this order as evidence to counter any potential dowry-related claims made by your wife during the divorce proceedings.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighcourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "answer": "Contested Divorce on the Grounds of Mental Cruelty, Adultery, and Harassment: If you file for a contested divorce on the grounds of mental cruelty, adultery, and harassment of your parents, and you have substantial evidence to support your claims, your case can be quite strong. Mental cruelty and adultery are valid grounds for divorce under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955. However, the burden of proof lies on you to establish these grounds with clear and convincing evidence.The time frame for a contested divorce case can vary depending on the complexity of the case, the court's docket, and the cooperation of both parties. Generally, a contested divorce case in India can take anywhere from 24 months to 5 years or more, depending on the circumstances.Maintenance, Alimony, and Ancestral Property Rights: Yes, a contested divorce can lead to the court granting interim and permanent maintenance, as well as alimony, to the aggrieved spouse. The court considers various factors, such as the financial status of both parties, the standard of living during the marriage, and the ability of the spouse to support themselves.However, the right to ancestral property is governed by personal laws and may vary based on your religious affiliation. In general, a wife does not have an automatic right to her husband's ancestral property unless specified in a will or settlement.Making the Lover a Co-Respondent: For Hindu marriages governed by theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, there is no provision to implead a co-respondent.Validity of Police Report from Australia: Indian courts can consider crimes committed by Indian citizens in other countries as evidence in legal proceedings. However, the evidentiary value and admissibility of the police report from Australia will depend on factors such as the nature of the crime, the laws of the foreign country, and the court's discretion.Protection from Court upon Visiting India: If you are apprehensive about visiting India due to potential harassment or threats from your wife, you can seek protection from the court. You can file an application for an ex-parte order or an interim injunction restraining your wife from causing any harm or harassment to you during the pendency of the divorce proceedings.Risk of False Allegations or Cases: Even after filing for divorce in India, there is a risk that your wife may file false allegations or cases against you during the court proceedings. However, if you have substantial evidence to counter such allegations, the court is likely to dismiss them.For more legal assistance, you can contact me.Kindly give a 5 Star Rating if you are satisfied.Best Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighcourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

However, if you have children from the marriage, they may have a claim to ancestral property.Making Her Lover a Co-Respondent: You can make her alleged lover a co-respondent in the divorce petition, especially if you are claiming adultery as a ground for divorce.Validity of the Australian Police Report: The police report of her assault on you in Australia can be submitted as evidence in the Indian court.

Additionally, you can request the court to issue an order restraining your wife from filing any false complaints against you during your visit.Possibility of Fake Allegations After Filing for Divorce: Yes, even after filing for divorce, your wife can still file fake allegations or cases against you during the court proceedings.

This ensures that this transfer can be effected without him and without any complications.

    "question": "What can I do to prove my possession in my parental house",
    "answer": "If there is only one witness attesting the Will, then the Will cannot be said to be a validity executed Will in terms of Section 63 of Indian Succession Act and it cannot be proved in court. Nonetheless, if there is no valid WILL executed by your father, then you, your mother and brother will have equal share i.e. 1/3rd share each in your father's property. After your mother's demise, the share will become 1/2 each. As far as your possession in the property is concerned, it will be represented by your brother being a co-sharer.Notarized Affidavit is equally good and has the same effect as the Affidavit sworn before Oath Commissioner. No need to redo them.Divye PuriAdvocate, Delhi17 AnswersTalk to Advocate Divye Puri"

    "question": "What can I do to prove my possession in my parental house",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In order to counter your brother’s will which you realize has several loopholes and is not original, unregistered, and only one of the witnesses to the will having died you should seek legal advice to have a caveat to be placed in court in order to prevent the will from being probated without your knowledge. Collect documents and witnesses who demonstrate that the property was purchased solely by your now-deceased father. As long as your mother is alive, your mother has right to stay in that property and your brother cannot lock you out legally, make sure that her name is also mentioned in your property papers. If he tries to remove you from the house, you can approach a court of law for an order of ejectment. As for certificates, the word ‘Attested’ does not mean ‘sworn before’ and it is recommended to redo notarized affidavits with the correct stamp. It is wise to engage the services of a lawyer who has expertise in property and inheritance law in order to avoid complications.Hope you find this answer suitable for resolving you problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Alleged misconduct with employers",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In Indian law, several aspects need to be considered in your situation:About the delayed stipend, the organisation affirmed that, according to the offer letter, you were supposed to be paid ₹10,000 per month. If they agreed to disburse the stipend at the end of the internship but decided to delay it this maybe a clear violation of the contract.You were entitled to follow up this payment and your attempts to get a reply is warranted in this case. It should also not be considered a violation whether your family member called the HR department demanding the delay in the stipend if he or she conducted such in a polite language without using abusive language.If in a communication the call was recorded or the content of the communication was not abusive the matter cannot be considered as harassment or misconduct unless it involved threatening or intimidating communication. It is unimaginable that you or your family member is involve in the misconduct that have been alleges. It is usually the duty of such companies to come up with substantial evidence and also investigate before coming up with such allegations.It has to be shown and cannot be done just by the company’s claims of the other party’s misconduct. If the company is making claims without a proper investigation, then their actions could be prevailed. As for the threats related to involvement of the police, of course, taking into consideration the fact that the HR representative was a woman, this could be considered as an overreaction.Harassment is behaviour that is not wanted and is likely to result to distress. If the threats where made for no reason and where of a much higher magnitude than the situation is warranted they where a clear attempt at trying to scare the other party into submission rather than legal action. When writing an apology letter, it should be done with a lot of professionalism done of course. It should seek to clear any misconception, and declare your intention to address the issue out of the court. First, the apology has to recognize possible misunderstanding that may exist but deny the wrongdoing if it did not happenIf you think the company’s actions are unjust or probably unlawful, calling a labor lawyer may well enlighten you and assist you on handling any wrongful claims or discharge against you.Thank you.I hope the answer is fruitful.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The case discussed here contains profound legal perspectives specifically concerning the ownership of land as well as legalities of transactions in the farming community of Karjat, Maharashtra. According to the Indian law particularly the Indian Stamp Act and Registration Act the sale and purchase of property are unenforceable unless it is registered and stamp duty is paid. The 7/12 extract also shows that the certificate of title shows that the land is owned by the society and not individual members without it being stated in the bylaws. Even in instances where share certificates are issued to shareholders, the shareholders do not own the land. Members should consult the lawyers on their rights and try to negotiate with the society’s managing committee to assist in registration of the plots. Besides, they may consider paying stamp duty later and if required also, can complain to the Registrar of Societies or even go to the court to claim their rights. There is a need to follow legal provisions in an effort to pursue the interests of the individuals that are involved in property transactions.Hope you find this answer suitable for resolving you query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Unregistered transactions do not convey the legal title therefore, notarized agreement to sell is invalid. The society has a responsibility in the enforcement of these laws and cannot set by-laws that negate legal provisions. As members, you can force the society to register documents by approaching the managing committee, or even report the society to the authorities in the event that the managing committee does not act as expected. Members who do not register may be subject to litigation and the possibility of the entire land being sold without consideration of their rights.

    "answer": "Dear Client,From the facts stated in the case, it would appear that Person B’s application for the civil revision of the March 2022 order of the District Court has significant chance of being dismissed for several reasons. Firstly, the application is time-barred for the reason that it was filed in January 2024, whereas according to Section 115 CPC the statement of such reasons may be filed only within ninety days from the date of receiving the petition. Secondly, revisions against older orders are not normally sustainable. Thirdly, Person B has no standing to sue since the property was sold to Person C in July 2021 and therefore doesn’t have any legal interest in the property. Based on the above-discussed factors, Person B should avoid applying for revision and contact a legal attorney for other remedies depending on the case’s circumstances.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Sir,I understand your situation and the difficulties you are facing. Based on the information provided, I will try to guide you on the grounds for seeking divorce in India and the relevant legal provisions.Grounds for Divorce in India: Under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, which applies to Sikhs as well, the following grounds are available for seeking divorce:a) Adultery (Section 13(1)(i)): Although adultery has been decriminalized, it remains a valid ground for seeking divorce in India.b) Cruelty (Section 13(1)(ia)): The assault and harassment you faced from your wife can potentially be considered cruelty, which is a ground for divorce.c) Desertion (Section 13(1)(ib)): If your wife has deserted you for a continuous period of at least two years immediately preceding the presentation of the divorce petition, you can seek divorce on this ground.Evidence: You mentioned having call records from the telecom company and some recordings as evidence of your wife's adultery. These can be crucial pieces of evidence to support your divorce petition.Procedure: You can file a divorce petition in the appropriate Family Court or District Court in India, where your wife is currently residing or where the marriage was solemnized. The court will consider the evidence presented by both parties and decide on granting the divorce based on the merits of the case.Dowry Allegations: Regarding the false dowry allegations made by your wife, the closure of the case by the SSP office stating no dowry was demanded or given will work in your favor. You can present this order as evidence to counter any potential dowry-related claims made by your wife during the divorce proceedings.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighcourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "answer": "Contested Divorce on the Grounds of Mental Cruelty, Adultery, and Harassment: If you file for a contested divorce on the grounds of mental cruelty, adultery, and harassment of your parents, and you have substantial evidence to support your claims, your case can be quite strong. Mental cruelty and adultery are valid grounds for divorce under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955. However, the burden of proof lies on you to establish these grounds with clear and convincing evidence.The time frame for a contested divorce case can vary depending on the complexity of the case, the court's docket, and the cooperation of both parties. Generally, a contested divorce case in India can take anywhere from 24 months to 5 years or more, depending on the circumstances.Maintenance, Alimony, and Ancestral Property Rights: Yes, a contested divorce can lead to the court granting interim and permanent maintenance, as well as alimony, to the aggrieved spouse. The court considers various factors, such as the financial status of both parties, the standard of living during the marriage, and the ability of the spouse to support themselves.However, the right to ancestral property is governed by personal laws and may vary based on your religious affiliation. In general, a wife does not have an automatic right to her husband's ancestral property unless specified in a will or settlement.Making the Lover a Co-Respondent: For Hindu marriages governed by theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, there is no provision to implead a co-respondent.Validity of Police Report from Australia: Indian courts can consider crimes committed by Indian citizens in other countries as evidence in legal proceedings. However, the evidentiary value and admissibility of the police report from Australia will depend on factors such as the nature of the crime, the laws of the foreign country, and the court's discretion.Protection from Court upon Visiting India: If you are apprehensive about visiting India due to potential harassment or threats from your wife, you can seek protection from the court. You can file an application for an ex-parte order or an interim injunction restraining your wife from causing any harm or harassment to you during the pendency of the divorce proceedings.Risk of False Allegations or Cases: Even after filing for divorce in India, there is a risk that your wife may file false allegations or cases against you during the court proceedings. However, if you have substantial evidence to counter such allegations, the court is likely to dismiss them.For more legal assistance, you can contact me.Kindly give a 5 Star Rating if you are satisfied.Best Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighcourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

However, if you have children from the marriage, they may have a claim to ancestral property.Making Her Lover a Co-Respondent: You can make her alleged lover a co-respondent in the divorce petition, especially if you are claiming adultery as a ground for divorce.Validity of the Australian Police Report: The police report of her assault on you in Australia can be submitted as evidence in the Indian court.

Additionally, you can request the court to issue an order restraining your wife from filing any false complaints against you during your visit.Possibility of Fake Allegations After Filing for Divorce: Yes, even after filing for divorce, your wife can still file fake allegations or cases against you during the court proceedings.

    "question": "Gift deed or settlement of plot to my son",
    "answer": "Dear Client,A Gift deed will be the best option because it will enable you to transfer the title of the house to your son instantly, is cheaper as it attract lesser registration fees than a will and does not have some of the drawbacks of a will which transfers the ownership of the property after the death of the owner.However a Will helps transfer property only after your death and may require probate process which is a little formal and lengthyAnd the purpose of the gift deed is good to which your son’s presence is not necessary if he hands over the power of attorney to a third person and identity proof of your son. This ensures that this transfer can be effected without him and without any complications. Therefore, Gift Deed is a better option for the instant transfer with easy registration and free from most of the hassle issues in the future.Thank you.Hope you find this advice beneficial.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In order to counter your brother’s will which you realize has several loopholes and is not original, unregistered, and only one of the witnesses to the will having died you should seek legal advice to have a caveat to be placed in court in order to prevent the will from being probated without your knowledge. Collect documents and witnesses who demonstrate that the property was purchased solely by your now-deceased father. As long as your mother is alive, your mother has right to stay in that property and your brother cannot lock you out legally, make sure that her name is also mentioned in your property papers. If he tries to remove you from the house, you can approach a court of law for an order of ejectment. As for certificates, the word ‘Attested’ does not mean ‘sworn before’ and it is recommended to redo notarized affidavits with the correct stamp.

    "question": "Alleged misconduct with employers",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In Indian law, several aspects need to be considered in your situation:About the delayed stipend, the organisation affirmed that, according to the offer letter, you were supposed to be paid ₹10,000 per month. If they agreed to disburse the stipend at the end of the internship but decided to delay it this maybe a clear violation of the contract.You were entitled to follow up this payment and your attempts to get a reply is warranted in this case. It should also not be considered a violation whether your family member called the HR department demanding the delay in the stipend if he or she conducted such in a polite language without using abusive language.If in a communication the call was recorded or the content of the communication was not abusive the matter cannot be considered as harassment or misconduct unless it involved threatening or intimidating communication. It is unimaginable that you or your family member is involve in the misconduct that have been alleges. It is usually the duty of such companies to come up with substantial evidence and also investigate before coming up with such allegations.It has to be shown and cannot be done just by the company’s claims of the other party’s misconduct. If the company is making claims without a proper investigation, then their actions could be prevailed. As for the threats related to involvement of the police, of course, taking into consideration the fact that the HR representative was a woman, this could be considered as an overreaction.Harassment is behaviour that is not wanted and is likely to result to distress. If the threats where made for no reason and where of a much higher magnitude than the situation is warranted they where a clear attempt at trying to scare the other party into submission rather than legal action. When writing an apology letter, it should be done with a lot of professionalism done of course. It should seek to clear any misconception, and declare your intention to address the issue out of the court. First, the apology has to recognize possible misunderstanding that may exist but deny the wrongdoing if it did not happenIf you think the company’s actions are unjust or probably unlawful, calling a labor lawyer may well enlighten you and assist you on handling any wrongful claims or discharge against you.Thank you.I hope the answer is fruitful.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Sale deed and 7/12",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The case discussed here contains profound legal perspectives specifically concerning the ownership of land as well as legalities of transactions in the farming community of Karjat, Maharashtra. According to the Indian law particularly the Indian Stamp Act and Registration Act the sale and purchase of property are unenforceable unless it is registered and stamp duty is paid. The 7/12 extract also shows that the certificate of title shows that the land is owned by the society and not individual members without it being stated in the bylaws. Even in instances where share certificates are issued to shareholders, the shareholders do not own the land. Members should consult the lawyers on their rights and try to negotiate with the society’s managing committee to assist in registration of the plots. Besides, they may consider paying stamp duty later and if required also, can complain to the Registrar of Societies or even go to the court to claim their rights. There is a need to follow legal provisions in an effort to pursue the interests of the individuals that are involved in property transactions.Hope you find this answer suitable for resolving you query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The action taken by the housing society wherein the plots have been auctioned and the payments collected without proper registration and payment of stamp duty is unlawful as per the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 as well as the Registration Act, 1908. Unregistered transactions do not convey the legal title therefore, notarized agreement to sell is invalid. The society has a responsibility in the enforcement of these laws and cannot set by-laws that negate legal provisions. As members, you can force the society to register documents by approaching the managing committee, or even report the society to the authorities in the event that the managing committee does not act as expected. Members who do not register may be subject to litigation and the possibility of the entire land being sold without consideration of their rights.

In order not to face wrongful expulsion remember your rights and the reasons for expulsion like- failure in payment of dues or engaging in detrimental activities. If expelled without such procedures, you can appeal it to the Registrar of Cooperative Societies or sue it in civil court. On compensation, you will probably be paid for the shares you have in the society within three months if expelled, but this will only happen if the society does not forfeit it.Hope you find this advice beneficial.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,From the facts stated in the case, it would appear that Person B’s application for the civil revision of the March 2022 order of the District Court has significant chance of being dismissed for several reasons. Firstly, the application is time-barred for the reason that it was filed in January 2024, whereas according to Section 115 CPC the statement of such reasons may be filed only within ninety days from the date of receiving the petition. Secondly, revisions against older orders are not normally sustainable. Thirdly, Person B has no standing to sue since the property was sold to Person C in July 2021 and therefore doesn’t have any legal interest in the property. Based on the above-discussed factors, Person B should avoid applying for revision and contact a legal attorney for other remedies depending on the case’s circumstances.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Property division",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In the case your parents set out a will to bequeath the property between you and your sister, it will give a legal channel to follow in the division of the property. However, if your elder brother declines to share, he also may try to take over the control. In order to avoid future conflict, the will should state which part of the property belongs to a particular heir and that no person is allowed to sell or transfer any part of the property without the consent of all the other parties. In case of dispute, you and your sister can take a legal action in accordance with the provisions of the Partition Act, 1893 and approach the Court to get the property divided in accordance with the proportionate share. Moreover, theHindu Succession Act, 1956, grants equal portion to all heirs disregarding your brother’s intention to have large pieces of the property. It is desirable to execute the will in such a manner that the management of the estate is not hampered after the death of parents; it is also possible to obtain the will probate, which will be legally valid. Seeking services of an advocate to draw the will with appropriate terms and conditions is crucial to safeguard the rights of the property owners against possible future legal battles.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This ensures that this transfer can be effected without him and without any complications. Therefore, Gift Deed is a better option for the instant transfer with easy registration and free from most of the hassle issues in the future.Thank you.Hope you find this advice beneficial.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Collect documents and witnesses who demonstrate that the property was purchased solely by your now-deceased father. As long as your mother is alive, your mother has right to stay in that property and your brother cannot lock you out legally, make sure that her name is also mentioned in your property papers. If he tries to remove you from the house, you can approach a court of law for an order of ejectment. As for certificates, the word ‘Attested’ does not mean ‘sworn before’ and it is recommended to redo notarized affidavits with the correct stamp.

Now, it will not be beneficial to give terraces and yiu will notice that terraces are not planned in new upcoming buildings.it may not work economically viable to give built up area same as terrace area in the proposed new building. All of you have to sit together and work out a compromise formula by coming couple of steps closer to each other.3. The redevelopment committee of the association will take care of it.4.

    "question": "Redevelopment of society based on floor plan or physical existence",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Terrace Entitlement: If the terrace is part of the approved floor plan and you have paid stamp duty and registration fees for it, you have a legal claim to it. If the builder asserts that the terrace was illegally constructed, it is crucial to verify this claim with municipal records. However, since you have been paying stamp duty and registration, you may argue that you have legal possession. Obtain the approved building plan from the local municipal authority. This will clarify whether the terrace was legally constructed.Physical Existence vs. Floor Plan: During redevelopment, the original approved floor plan is usually the determining factor for entitlements, not just the physical existence of features.Measuring Apartment Square Footage: While it's not mandatory to appoint an architect specifically for measurement, accurate measurement of the property is essential to ensure you are being fairly compensated in the redevelopment process. You have the right to be fully informed about the redevelopment process, including the accurate size of your property.Transparency and Communication: Under the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960, the managing committee has a duty to keep members informed. There is no specific law mandating the maintenance of a website, but effective communication is a legal expectation. You can lodge a complaint with the Registrar of Societies if the society fails to maintain transparency or adequately inform members.Lack of Response to Legal Notice: If the society fails to respond to a legal notice, you can consider escalating the matter legally. You can file a complaint with the Registrar of Societies or approach the cooperative court. You may consider filing a civil suit for declaratory relief and/or damages, particularly if the builder or society refuses to honour your legal rights.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "As the members have already vacated the building and are without homes, it is but obvious that the builder will try to take advantage of that situationOrdinarily even if there are violations to the sanctioned building plans,  the builder usually agrees to accommodate since the society has an upper hand. If majority members have violated the building plans then in order to get majority consent for redevelopment,  the builder even goes to the extent of offering extra area over and above the eligibility of the members, from his free sale component. However that happens only when the members have not yet vacated their premisesIn your case the society and its members do not have that upper hand in the negotiations with the builderThough the builder is legally right that he is liable to give area in the new building considering the sanctioned building plans of old building , but this is always a matter of contract and agreement between the society and the builderJust by paying property tax and maintenance for the premises (which have been unauthorizedly expanded and extended) the extra areas do not get legitimized.Even slum dwellers pay property tax...so would it mean that their hutments are legal structures ?So in your case I would suggest to negotiate hard with the builder to make him provide also for the extra areas constructed or put up by the membersOfcourse all this is subject to project feasibilityIf due to giving area from the builder's sale component,  the project becomes inviable for him, then he would not show interestSo the interest of both the builder and society need to be balancedYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Dear Client,If the society is not adhering to proper procedures or failing in its duties, you can file a complaint with the Registrar of Cooperative Societies under the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960. The Registrar can investigate the complaint and direct the society to act in accordance with the law. You can take legal action against the society and its managing committee if they are not performing their duties. This may include filing a suit for specific performance, injunction, or damages if the society or its officials are acting in bad faith or violating the rules. If you believe that the balcony or terrace was legally constructed and the seller did not disclose any illegalities, you can pursue a claim for misrepresentation or fraud against the seller. This would involve filing a suit for breach of contract or misrepresentation in a civil court. If it is proven that the balcony or terrace was illegally constructed, you may face legal challenges including potential fines or the need to remove the illegal structure. Gather all relevant documents including the sale deed, previous correspondence, and any evidence supporting the legality of the balcony or terrace.

As you have recently provided the tenant with a final notice to quit the rented premises because of the current rental court case is close to being determined you have the authority to carry out the renovation work. But make sure that you do not infringe any court order regarding the status of the tenant during the eviction process to avert any legal hurt. If rental arrears cross ₹2 lakh, you can get a vacate order in your favour. If the court has granted you an ex parte order then you can enforce it to regain possession of the property.

The OC is not a document which is required mandatorily for property registration as its not a document of title evidencing the ownership of the seller instead it is required only if the stamp duty benefit is being claimed on account of old construction. Sometimes, the purchaser takes the benefit/depreciation of the stamp duty in the event of sale of flat of an old building, in such case the Sub-registrar in order to check the veracity of the construction insist on the copy of occupancy certificate or municipal assessment bills.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "it is highly unfortunate what has happened to youi think the builder has been fooling youif his rera registration had expired then under the law he could NOT accept any further payments from you unless and until he got his rera registration renewedso the builder could not have collected any payments from you after 30.7.24secondly the builder telling you that the sub-registrar is not registering the agreement for sale because there is no rera registration or that the registration has expired, is complete rubbish. The sub-registrar has under the registration act no such jurisdiction to refuse registration of the agreement due to rera registration having been expired. I would really like to know and I am quite curious under which provision of law did the sub-registrar refuse the registration as there was no rera registrationthirdly the builder is obligated under RERA to compulsorily register an agreement for sale upon receiving 10% of the total sale considerationin your case i believe the builder has illegally accepted more than 10% from you without valid rera registration, and did not bother to enter into and register an agreement for sale with you. Because now he is trapped he has come up with the bogey that the sub-registrar is refusing to register the agreementalso if the agreement for sale is already signed by you then it has to be stamped and registered max within 4 months from the date of signing. The registration of the signed document can be done beyond 4 months also, but subject to max another 4 months, with payment of penalty. I do not know whether or not you have already signed the agreement for sale.your builder telling you that in order to register the agreement within 4 months you should have paid the stamp duty before rera expiry is again complete nonsense. As per the stamp act stamp duty has to be paid before signing or on the date of signing or on the day immediately after the day of signing. I dont know where this payment of duty before rera registration expiry, comes from. It seems the builder has been making his own rules and conning youi do not believe that just on applying for OC your agreement for sale can be registered. In my view your agreement for sale if it is duly signed and stamped, can be registered right away. It has got nothing to do with expiry of rera registration since the sub-registrar has got no power to require renewal of rera registration for registering the agreement for sale. I think if your agreement for sale is registered, then the builder will be exposed that he accepted payments from the flat buyer even after expiry of the rera registration and also he did not bother to register an agreement for sale after having accepted 10% of the total sale price. Both of these are offences under Rera. To cover his faults and guilt, he is cooking up any story before you. Highly unfortunate.Please have a legal notice issued to the builder and then consider filing a RERA complaint [I believe, on a prima facie view, that even if the rera registration has expired, a rera complaint can still be filed, because the project was rera registered. Its just the builder did not bother to renew his registration to save some charges]Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Property registration after RERA expired",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Based on your situation regarding the purchase of a flat and the implications of the RERA expiration, It can be considered that, the builder is right on the mark where he says that you can apply for registration based on the initial down-payment of ₹5 lakhs paid before the RERA is expired, but the expired RERA registration makes things a little tough. Although, you are free to register the property within four months from the agreement, it highly depends with the provisions of RERA because every project must be in compliance with the RERA rules and regulation at the point of registration. The builder’s argument that in order to avail the four months window one has to pay stamp duty is partially correct as while it has to be paid; it does not necessarily have to be paid before the RERA expiration. You can pay the stamp duty after RERA has expired but this may have an implication on the registration. Further, the builder claimed that applying for an Occupancy Certificate (OC) can open the doors for registration, however, the OC has to be approved for registration to take place. Therefore, it would be wise to keep all the communication records with the builder,  consult from an expert lawyer dealing with real estate and RERA and, if needed, you can approach to the RERA authority if the builder does not act to correct the mistake made in the registration process.I hope this advice is fruitful.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Alleged misconduct with employers",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In Indian law, several aspects need to be considered in your situation:About the delayed stipend, the organisation affirmed that, according to the offer letter, you were supposed to be paid ₹10,000 per month. If they agreed to disburse the stipend at the end of the internship but decided to delay it this maybe a clear violation of the contract.You were entitled to follow up this payment and your attempts to get a reply is warranted in this case. It should also not be considered a violation whether your family member called the HR department demanding the delay in the stipend if he or she conducted such in a polite language without using abusive language.If in a communication the call was recorded or the content of the communication was not abusive the matter cannot be considered as harassment or misconduct unless it involved threatening or intimidating communication. It is unimaginable that you or your family member is involve in the misconduct that have been alleges. It is usually the duty of such companies to come up with substantial evidence and also investigate before coming up with such allegations.It has to be shown and cannot be done just by the company’s claims of the other party’s misconduct. If the company is making claims without a proper investigation, then their actions could be prevailed. As for the threats related to involvement of the police, of course, taking into consideration the fact that the HR representative was a woman, this could be considered as an overreaction.Harassment is behaviour that is not wanted and is likely to result to distress. If the threats where made for no reason and where of a much higher magnitude than the situation is warranted they where a clear attempt at trying to scare the other party into submission rather than legal action. When writing an apology letter, it should be done with a lot of professionalism done of course. It should seek to clear any misconception, and declare your intention to address the issue out of the court. First, the apology has to recognize possible misunderstanding that may exist but deny the wrongdoing if it did not happenIf you think the company’s actions are unjust or probably unlawful, calling a labor lawyer may well enlighten you and assist you on handling any wrongful claims or discharge against you.Thank you.I hope the answer is fruitful.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The case discussed here contains profound legal perspectives specifically concerning the ownership of land as well as legalities of transactions in the farming community of Karjat, Maharashtra. According to the Indian law particularly the Indian Stamp Act and Registration Act the sale and purchase of property are unenforceable unless it is registered and stamp duty is paid. The 7/12 extract also shows that the certificate of title shows that the land is owned by the society and not individual members without it being stated in the bylaws. Even in instances where share certificates are issued to shareholders, the shareholders do not own the land. Members should consult the lawyers on their rights and try to negotiate with the society’s managing committee to assist in registration of the plots. Besides, they may consider paying stamp duty later and if required also, can complain to the Registrar of Societies or even go to the court to claim their rights. There is a need to follow legal provisions in an effort to pursue the interests of the individuals that are involved in property transactions.Hope you find this answer suitable for resolving you query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The action taken by the housing society wherein the plots have been auctioned and the payments collected without proper registration and payment of stamp duty is unlawful as per the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 as well as the Registration Act, 1908. Unregistered transactions do not convey the legal title therefore, notarized agreement to sell is invalid. The society has a responsibility in the enforcement of these laws and cannot set by-laws that negate legal provisions. As members, you can force the society to register documents by approaching the managing committee, or even report the society to the authorities in the event that the managing committee does not act as expected. Members who do not register may be subject to litigation and the possibility of the entire land being sold without consideration of their rights.

In order not to face wrongful expulsion remember your rights and the reasons for expulsion like- failure in payment of dues or engaging in detrimental activities. If expelled without such procedures, you can appeal it to the Registrar of Cooperative Societies or sue it in civil court. On compensation, you will probably be paid for the shares you have in the society within three months if expelled, but this will only happen if the society does not forfeit it.Hope you find this advice beneficial.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Based on the information provided, I will try to guide you on the grounds for seeking divorce in India and the relevant legal provisions.Grounds for Divorce in India: Under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, which applies to Sikhs as well, the following grounds are available for seeking divorce:a) Adultery (Section 13(1)(i)): Although adultery has been decriminalized, it remains a valid ground for seeking divorce in India.b) Cruelty (Section 13(1)(ia)): The assault and harassment you faced from your wife can potentially be considered cruelty, which is a ground for divorce.c) Desertion (Section 13(1)(ib)): If your wife has deserted you for a continuous period of at least two years immediately preceding the presentation of the divorce petition, you can seek divorce on this ground.Evidence: You mentioned having call records from the telecom company and some recordings as evidence of your wife's adultery. These can be crucial pieces of evidence to support your divorce petition.Procedure: You can file a divorce petition in the appropriate Family Court or District Court in India, where your wife is currently residing or where the marriage was solemnized. The court will consider the evidence presented by both parties and decide on granting the divorce based on the merits of the case.Dowry Allegations: Regarding the false dowry allegations made by your wife, the closure of the case by the SSP office stating no dowry was demanded or given will work in your favor. You can present this order as evidence to counter any potential dowry-related claims made by your wife during the divorce proceedings.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighcourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "answer": "Contested Divorce on the Grounds of Mental Cruelty, Adultery, and Harassment: If you file for a contested divorce on the grounds of mental cruelty, adultery, and harassment of your parents, and you have substantial evidence to support your claims, your case can be quite strong. Mental cruelty and adultery are valid grounds for divorce under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955. However, the burden of proof lies on you to establish these grounds with clear and convincing evidence.The time frame for a contested divorce case can vary depending on the complexity of the case, the court's docket, and the cooperation of both parties. Generally, a contested divorce case in India can take anywhere from 24 months to 5 years or more, depending on the circumstances.Maintenance, Alimony, and Ancestral Property Rights: Yes, a contested divorce can lead to the court granting interim and permanent maintenance, as well as alimony, to the aggrieved spouse. The court considers various factors, such as the financial status of both parties, the standard of living during the marriage, and the ability of the spouse to support themselves.However, the right to ancestral property is governed by personal laws and may vary based on your religious affiliation. In general, a wife does not have an automatic right to her husband's ancestral property unless specified in a will or settlement.Making the Lover a Co-Respondent: For Hindu marriages governed by theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, there is no provision to implead a co-respondent.Validity of Police Report from Australia: Indian courts can consider crimes committed by Indian citizens in other countries as evidence in legal proceedings. However, the evidentiary value and admissibility of the police report from Australia will depend on factors such as the nature of the crime, the laws of the foreign country, and the court's discretion.Protection from Court upon Visiting India: If you are apprehensive about visiting India due to potential harassment or threats from your wife, you can seek protection from the court. You can file an application for an ex-parte order or an interim injunction restraining your wife from causing any harm or harassment to you during the pendency of the divorce proceedings.Risk of False Allegations or Cases: Even after filing for divorce in India, there is a risk that your wife may file false allegations or cases against you during the court proceedings. However, if you have substantial evidence to counter such allegations, the court is likely to dismiss them.For more legal assistance, you can contact me.Kindly give a 5 Star Rating if you are satisfied.Best Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighcourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

Additionally, you can request the court to issue an order restraining your wife from filing any false complaints against you during your visit.Possibility of Fake Allegations After Filing for Divorce: Yes, even after filing for divorce, your wife can still file fake allegations or cases against you during the court proceedings. However, if such allegations arise, you can defend yourself legally by challenging the credibility of the claims. You can also file a petition for anticipatory bail to protect yourself from arrest in case of any false criminal cases being filed against you.It's crucial to work with a skilled family law attorney in India who can guide you through the legal procedures and help protect your rights.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The Catholic Church can declare their marriage null and void because of the bride’s failure to disclose that she has epilepsy, nevertheless, under the Indian civil laws epilepsy cannot be considered as a ground for annulling a marriage or for divorce. An affidavit executed and in writing between the two in a bid to state that the marriage was never a valid one may work internally within the church setting but it is legally inadmissible in the civil law. If the couple wants to dissolve the marriage, the legal processes under the Indian Divorce Act of 1869 orSpecial Marriage Actof 1954 must be followed.

    "answer": "Dear Client,If you want to recover the rental arrears of ₹1,16,000, you need to file a separate civil suit for recovery of the unpaid rent under the Code of Civil Procedure,1908. As there is no rental agreement, you can still demand compensation based on the principle of unjust enrichment under section 70 of the Indian Contract Act,1872. This section will help you to get back what's owed to you when someone benefits from your property or service without a proper reason. The civil suit should be filed in the appropriate court having jurisdiction based on the amount of arrears and the location of the property.Thank you.Hope this answers your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In order to counter your brother’s will which you realize has several loopholes and is not original, unregistered, and only one of the witnesses to the will having died you should seek legal advice to have a caveat to be placed in court in order to prevent the will from being probated without your knowledge. Collect documents and witnesses who demonstrate that the property was purchased solely by your now-deceased father. As long as your mother is alive, your mother has right to stay in that property and your brother cannot lock you out legally, make sure that her name is also mentioned in your property papers. If he tries to remove you from the house, you can approach a court of law for an order of ejectment. As for certificates, the word ‘Attested’ does not mean ‘sworn before’ and it is recommended to redo notarized affidavits with the correct stamp.

    "question": "False SC/ST Act",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case, Section 183 of BNSS (Previously, section 164 of the CrPC),  permits a witness to give statements against various parties despite its credibility being subject to questioning. The fact that no charge sheet has been filed by the I.O. does not in any way prejudices your application for anticipatory bail although a later charge sheet may alter the court’s view. If the fingerprints are yours, but you did not steal, it is better to provide the alibi to the I.O. to prove you are innocent. Because the accused is close to the ruling party, it is understandable to raise issues of bias investigation; you may consider asking a third party like the CBI to investigate the matter impartially. As a rule, it is invalid to file several charge sheets in connection with the same offence unless there are new facts therein. In the FIR, you stated that you did not know the accused and are not friends with him, which could greatly harm your case. Due to these complications, it is advisable to seek services from an expert criminal lawyer to ensure that you are well protected all the time.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "- The said allotment on a 500 rupees stamp paper is not valid and the transfer has not taken place in the absence of a valid registered document, and that is the reason 7/12 is showing the name of the society and not the purchaser.- The electricity connection is not a proof of ownership- You can issue a notice to the society to execute registered sale deed in the name of purchaser and if no positive result then file a case before the Court-  Further after getting a registered transfer document in your name , you can directly apply for entering your name in the 7/12.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Sale deed and 7/12",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The case discussed here contains profound legal perspectives specifically concerning the ownership of land as well as legalities of transactions in the farming community of Karjat, Maharashtra. According to the Indian law particularly the Indian Stamp Act and Registration Act the sale and purchase of property are unenforceable unless it is registered and stamp duty is paid. The 7/12 extract also shows that the certificate of title shows that the land is owned by the society and not individual members without it being stated in the bylaws. Even in instances where share certificates are issued to shareholders, the shareholders do not own the land. Members should consult the lawyers on their rights and try to negotiate with the society’s managing committee to assist in registration of the plots. Besides, they may consider paying stamp duty later and if required also, can complain to the Registrar of Societies or even go to the court to claim their rights. There is a need to follow legal provisions in an effort to pursue the interests of the individuals that are involved in property transactions.Hope you find this answer suitable for resolving you query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The action taken by the housing society wherein the plots have been auctioned and the payments collected without proper registration and payment of stamp duty is unlawful as per the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 as well as the Registration Act, 1908. Unregistered transactions do not convey the legal title therefore, notarized agreement to sell is invalid. The society has a responsibility in the enforcement of these laws and cannot set by-laws that negate legal provisions. As members, you can force the society to register documents by approaching the managing committee, or even report the society to the authorities in the event that the managing committee does not act as expected. Members who do not register may be subject to litigation and the possibility of the entire land being sold without consideration of their rights. It is recommended to seek consultation from a real estate lawyer to safeguard your own interests and to make sure that the society complies with the legal requirements.Hope you find this answer suitable for resolving you query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In order not to face wrongful expulsion remember your rights and the reasons for expulsion like- failure in payment of dues or engaging in detrimental activities. If expelled without such procedures, you can appeal it to the Registrar of Cooperative Societies or sue it in civil court. On compensation, you will probably be paid for the shares you have in the society within three months if expelled, but this will only happen if the society does not forfeit it.Hope you find this advice beneficial.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "1. a private limited company can trade and invest in shares of any public company in India if its Memorandum of Association allows such investing. The Memorandum of Association contains a clause called “Object Clause” which set out the object for which the company has been framed.a partnership firm can invest in the stock market. However, the partnership firm cannot hold shares in its name. No partnership firm may own shares of any corporation.2.A company that is incorporated for the purpose of trading in capital markets may need to obtain a Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) license from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). This is because the company would be deriving more than 50% of its revenue from financial assets.3. It should be noted that the holding periods of shares and securities are different for different classes of capital assets.

    "question": "Is it legal to incorporate Pvt Limited company which gets 100% profits from stock trading",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the answers of your questions regarding the incorporation of private limited company or LLP for stock trading;1) Yes, one is allowed to incorporate a private limited company or LLP and generate 100% of revenue from stock trading. But there are some conditions which one has to follow or avoid while using it.2) If the company has 50% or more total assets in the form of shares, securities, bonds, etc. and has 50% or more gross income from these financial assets, then it will come under the category of NBFC i.e., Non-Banking Financial Company and it is compulsory to obtain NBFC license from RBI. To get this NBFC license however it is not very easy as there are a lot of regulatory standards that have to be met.3) It is not always beneficial for you from a tax point of view to incorporate a private limited company or LLP. The company, its profits, will be subjected to the corporate tax rate, the current being 25% for small companies while any dividend paid to shareholders will further be charged for taxes. While it is true that some of these may be applicable to an individual and not to a company or corporation.4)Yes, it is allowed to deduct the director’s salary while operating a private limited company. However, the salary should be reasonable and should be equivalent to the salary paid in other similar organizations. From the salary income, taxes will be deducted from the side of the director.5) It is also possible to form an LLP and make profit from stock investing. For tax purposes, LLPs are classified as pass-through entities, and the income is taxed in the hands of the partners. If an LLP does not fall into the above criteria it does not need to hold an NBFC license.6) If the overall profits from stock investment are less then 50%, NBFC license may not be necessary to be obtained. However, it is proper to keep records/documentation in order to support the recognition of income as business income as opposed to being capital gains.It is better to turn to a tax consultant or an attorney who would be familiar with rules and provisions of the finance legislation. The decision to incorporate a company or LLP for trading in stocks depends with the kind of stocks one intends to invest in, and level of risk tolerance that one has.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Is it legal to incorporate Pvt Limited company which gets 100% profits from stock trading",
    "answer": "1. Legality of Owning a Pvt Ltd or LLP for Stock TradingYes, it is legal to own a Pvt Ltd or LLP that derives 100% of its profits from stock trading. However, the company’s Memorandum of Association (MOA) must include stock trading as one of its objectives.2. Requirement for NBFC LicenseIf the primary business of the Pvt Ltd or LLP is stock trading and it involves managing funds from multiple investors, it may be classified as a Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC), which requires an NBFC license from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). However, if you are only using your own and your brother’s money, it might not require an NBFC license.3. Tax Efficiency: Pvt Ltd or LLP vs. Individual AccountPvt Ltd Company: The corporate tax rate for Pvt Ltd companies is generally lower than the highest individual tax rate. For companies with a turnover of up to INR 400 crore, the tax rate is 25%, and for others, it is 30%. Additionally, companies can claim various business expenses, which can reduce taxable income.LLP: LLPs are taxed at a flat rate of 30% plus surcharge and cess as applicable. LLPs also allow for the distribution of profits without additional dividend distribution tax, which can be beneficial.Individual Account: Individuals are taxed based on income slabs, which can go up to 42.7% including surcharge. However, individuals can also claim expenses related to trading under ITR-3.4. Claiming Director’s Salary as ExpenseYes, a Pvt Ltd company can claim the director’s salary as an expense, provided it is reasonable and in line with the company’s financial performance. There are no specific limits on director remuneration for private companies, but it must be approved by the board of directors and comply with the Companies Act, 2013.5. If the profits from stock investments fall under 50% of the total profit, your company may not require an NBFC license. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) generally mandates an NBFC license for companies where financial activities constitute more than 50% of the total assets and income. This is known as the 50-50 test.In your case, if stock trading profits are less than 50% of the total profits, and the financial assets are also less than 50% of the total assets, a Private Limited Company (Pvt Ltd) should be sufficient without needing an NBFC license.Gagandeep Singh ThandiAdvocate, Pathankot68 AnswersTalk to Advocate Gagandeep Singh Thandi"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Section 45(I) of the RBI Act notes that private limited companies can do financial business without an NBFC license provided the company is doing more than 50% of its business in the financial line. But if the company is involved in stock broking and does not involve in lending business or any other financial service then, it could not be categorized as NBFC. Under the Companies Act, 2013 it is legal for the private limited companies to invest in share market with certain regulations such as record-keeping, audit, and following corporate regulations. A tax on the gains made in stock trading may be charged in form capital gains tax. To ensure it is followed we suggest that activities should be well documented and open a corporate Demat account to go through a registered broker.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "False SC/ST Act",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case, Section 183 of BNSS (Previously, section 164 of the CrPC),  permits a witness to give statements against various parties despite its credibility being subject to questioning. The fact that no charge sheet has been filed by the I.O. does not in any way prejudices your application for anticipatory bail although a later charge sheet may alter the court’s view. If the fingerprints are yours, but you did not steal, it is better to provide the alibi to the I.O. to prove you are innocent. Because the accused is close to the ruling party, it is understandable to raise issues of bias investigation; you may consider asking a third party like the CBI to investigate the matter impartially. As a rule, it is invalid to file several charge sheets in connection with the same offence unless there are new facts therein. In the FIR, you stated that you did not know the accused and are not friends with him, which could greatly harm your case. Due to these complications, it is advisable to seek services from an expert criminal lawyer to ensure that you are well protected all the time.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

According to the Indian law particularly the Indian Stamp Act and Registration Act the sale and purchase of property are unenforceable unless it is registered and stamp duty is paid. The 7/12 extract also shows that the certificate of title shows that the land is owned by the society and not individual members without it being stated in the bylaws. Even in instances where share certificates are issued to shareholders, the shareholders do not own the land. Members should consult the lawyers on their rights and try to negotiate with the society’s managing committee to assist in registration of the plots. Besides, they may consider paying stamp duty later and if required also, can complain to the Registrar of Societies or even go to the court to claim their rights.

The society has a responsibility in the enforcement of these laws and cannot set by-laws that negate legal provisions. As members, you can force the society to register documents by approaching the managing committee, or even report the society to the authorities in the event that the managing committee does not act as expected.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In case, you file a complaint against your cooperative housing society and if they try to evict you, than they have to go through the legal process explained in the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960, specifically Section 35 which entails-eviction by passing of a voicing resolution by three-fourth members in a General Body Meeting with prior notice and an opportunity for hearing. In order not to face wrongful expulsion remember your rights and the reasons for expulsion like- failure in payment of dues or engaging in detrimental activities. If expelled without such procedures, you can appeal it to the Registrar of Cooperative Societies or sue it in civil court. On compensation, you will probably be paid for the shares you have in the society within three months if expelled, but this will only happen if the society does not forfeit it.Hope you find this advice beneficial.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Thus, all of you own part of the land in the proportion of FSI consumed/used. Unless all of you agree and sign the agreement, redevelopment can not happen.2. As per earlier DCR, terraces were allowed free of FSI. In unified DCR that are implemented in entire Maharashtra except Mumbai, they have proposed ancillary FSI and terrace too is counted. Now, it will not be beneficial to give terraces and yiu will notice that terraces are not planned in new upcoming buildings.it may not work economically viable to give built up area same as terrace area in the proposed new building. All of you have to sit together and work out a compromise formula by coming couple of steps closer to each other.3. The redevelopment committee of the association will take care of it.4. It is not mandatory for the society create a website for such activities, besides the communication sent through whatsapp is also a voluntary service and cannot be claimed as a right, it is you who have to regularly follow up with the society to know the updates.5.

    "question": "Redevelopment of society based on floor plan or physical existence",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Terrace Entitlement: If the terrace is part of the approved floor plan and you have paid stamp duty and registration fees for it, you have a legal claim to it. If the builder asserts that the terrace was illegally constructed, it is crucial to verify this claim with municipal records. However, since you have been paying stamp duty and registration, you may argue that you have legal possession. Obtain the approved building plan from the local municipal authority. This will clarify whether the terrace was legally constructed.Physical Existence vs. Floor Plan: During redevelopment, the original approved floor plan is usually the determining factor for entitlements, not just the physical existence of features.Measuring Apartment Square Footage: While it's not mandatory to appoint an architect specifically for measurement, accurate measurement of the property is essential to ensure you are being fairly compensated in the redevelopment process. You have the right to be fully informed about the redevelopment process, including the accurate size of your property.Transparency and Communication: Under the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960, the managing committee has a duty to keep members informed. There is no specific law mandating the maintenance of a website, but effective communication is a legal expectation. You can lodge a complaint with the Registrar of Societies if the society fails to maintain transparency or adequately inform members.Lack of Response to Legal Notice: If the society fails to respond to a legal notice, you can consider escalating the matter legally. You can file a complaint with the Registrar of Societies or approach the cooperative court. You may consider filing a civil suit for declaratory relief and/or damages, particularly if the builder or society refuses to honour your legal rights.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Redevelopment of society based on floor plan or physical existence",
    "answer": "As the members have already vacated the building and are without homes, it is but obvious that the builder will try to take advantage of that situationOrdinarily even if there are violations to the sanctioned building plans,  the builder usually agrees to accommodate since the society has an upper hand. If majority members have violated the building plans then in order to get majority consent for redevelopment,  the builder even goes to the extent of offering extra area over and above the eligibility of the members, from his free sale component. However that happens only when the members have not yet vacated their premisesIn your case the society and its members do not have that upper hand in the negotiations with the builderThough the builder is legally right that he is liable to give area in the new building considering the sanctioned building plans of old building , but this is always a matter of contract and agreement between the society and the builderJust by paying property tax and maintenance for the premises (which have been unauthorizedly expanded and extended) the extra areas do not get legitimized.Even slum dwellers pay property tax...so would it mean that their hutments are legal structures ?So in your case I would suggest to negotiate hard with the builder to make him provide also for the extra areas constructed or put up by the membersOfcourse all this is subject to project feasibilityIf due to giving area from the builder's sale component,  the project becomes inviable for him, then he would not show interestSo the interest of both the builder and society need to be balancedYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

The Registrar can investigate the complaint and direct the society to act in accordance with the law.

This may include filing a suit for specific performance, injunction, or damages if the society or its officials are acting in bad faith or violating the rules. If you believe that the balcony or terrace was legally constructed and the seller did not disclose any illegalities, you can pursue a claim for misrepresentation or fraud against the seller. This would involve filing a suit for breach of contract or misrepresentation in a civil court. If it is proven that the balcony or terrace was illegally constructed, you may face legal challenges including potential fines or the need to remove the illegal structure.

    "question": "False SC/ST Act",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In your case, Section 183 of BNSS (Previously, section 164 of the CrPC),  permits a witness to give statements against various parties despite its credibility being subject to questioning. The fact that no charge sheet has been filed by the I.O. does not in any way prejudices your application for anticipatory bail although a later charge sheet may alter the court’s view. If the fingerprints are yours, but you did not steal, it is better to provide the alibi to the I.O. to prove you are innocent. Because the accused is close to the ruling party, it is understandable to raise issues of bias investigation; you may consider asking a third party like the CBI to investigate the matter impartially. As a rule, it is invalid to file several charge sheets in connection with the same offence unless there are new facts therein. In the FIR, you stated that you did not know the accused and are not friends with him, which could greatly harm your case. Due to these complications, it is advisable to seek services from an expert criminal lawyer to ensure that you are well protected all the time.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Sale deed and 7/12",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The case discussed here contains profound legal perspectives specifically concerning the ownership of land as well as legalities of transactions in the farming community of Karjat, Maharashtra. According to the Indian law particularly the Indian Stamp Act and Registration Act the sale and purchase of property are unenforceable unless it is registered and stamp duty is paid. The 7/12 extract also shows that the certificate of title shows that the land is owned by the society and not individual members without it being stated in the bylaws. Even in instances where share certificates are issued to shareholders, the shareholders do not own the land. Members should consult the lawyers on their rights and try to negotiate with the society’s managing committee to assist in registration of the plots. Besides, they may consider paying stamp duty later and if required also, can complain to the Registrar of Societies or even go to the court to claim their rights. There is a need to follow legal provisions in an effort to pursue the interests of the individuals that are involved in property transactions.Hope you find this answer suitable for resolving you query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The action taken by the housing society wherein the plots have been auctioned and the payments collected without proper registration and payment of stamp duty is unlawful as per the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 as well as the Registration Act, 1908. Unregistered transactions do not convey the legal title therefore, notarized agreement to sell is invalid. The society has a responsibility in the enforcement of these laws and cannot set by-laws that negate legal provisions. As members, you can force the society to register documents by approaching the managing committee, or even report the society to the authorities in the event that the managing committee does not act as expected. Members who do not register may be subject to litigation and the possibility of the entire land being sold without consideration of their rights.

In order not to face wrongful expulsion remember your rights and the reasons for expulsion like- failure in payment of dues or engaging in detrimental activities. If expelled without such procedures, you can appeal it to the Registrar of Cooperative Societies or sue it in civil court. On compensation, you will probably be paid for the shares you have in the society within three months if expelled, but this will only happen if the society does not forfeit it.Hope you find this advice beneficial.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Property files lost DDA",
    "answer": "Dear Client,To go further with the change on the property due to the research on untraceable files from the DDA and a favourable high court judgment, start by compiling all the documentations in relation to the judgment, a proof of possession of the property and the communications made to the DDA. The formal mutation application has to be filed to the local municipal authority or revenue department and it is mandatory to enclose the High Court Judgment and other documents like proof of identity and tax receipts etc. Support your case on mutation based on a court decree using the Cooperative Societies Act. Ensure you follow up your application periodically and if it is rejected or stuck, approach the court by filing a complaint with a higher authority with jurisdiction or proceed to court. You can also seek legal representation from a property lawyer when going through the process of mutation so as not to compromise their ownership rights.Hope you find this advice beneficial.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,If, Mr. B, sold a portion or share of his 3 katthas to Mr. X then you may be able to file a pre-emption case under section 8 of the West Bengal Land Reforms Act, 1955 because section 8 allows pre-emption to co-sharer or a contiguous tenant. I disagree with your lawyer’s argument that pre-emption is only applicable if a portion is sold and not the entire 3 katthas. A wider interpretation could consider the entire 3 katthas as a “portion or share of the mother plot No. 502” The provision of Section 5(5) imposes a legal duty on Mr. B to notify the adjoining owners, including yourself before selling to a third party. If Mr. B failed to notify you, then he might have breached this section therefore making your case for pre-emption even stronger.Hope you find this answer helpful in resolving your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,You can file a petition under Section 482 of theCriminal Procedure Code(CrPC) in the High Court to quash the FIR filed under the SC/ST Act. The key argument would be that the FIR is an afterthought and has been filed with malafide intentions, as the accused had already pleaded guilty in a prior case for the same incident. You can argue that the accused is attempting to misuse the provisions of the SC/ST Act to harass you, a public servant, and to seek vengeance after pleading guilty to the earlier charges. Gather all relevant evidence, including the prosecution report, the accused’s guilty plea, and any communications or RTI replies related to the initial incident. This evidence can support your claim that the SC/ST FIR is frivolous and meant to obstruct justice. Engage a lawyer who specializes in criminal law and has experience dealing with SC/ST Act cases. They can effectively argue for the quashing of the FIR and protect your rights as a public servant.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The Court was deciding an appeal preferred by the accused challenging the Allahabad High Court judgment that had upheld rejection of the application for discharge filed by the accused. The two-Judge Bench of Justice P.S. Narasimha and Justice Sandeep Mehta observed, “From a bare perusal of the provision, it is crystal clear that for the above offence to be constituted, there must be an allegation that the accused not being a member of Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe committed an offence under the IPC punishable for a term of 10 years or more against a member of the Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe knowing that such person belongs to such ‘community’.”There as definite chances of getting acquitted as the allegation made, and the case filed under SC ST act was done with ulterior motive.

    "answer": "Dear Client,You can file an application under Section 156(3) of the CrPC, requesting the magistrate to monitor the investigation if you believe the police are not conducting a fair investigation. Alternatively, you can file a writ petition in the High Court under Article 226 of theConstitution of India, seeking directions for a fair investigation.You can file a defamation case against the accused under Section 499 and Section 500 of theIndian Penal Code(IPC) if you believe that the retaliatory FIR and the statements made therein have damaged your reputation. Since the accused has already pleaded guilty in the previous case, and if the SC certificate was not obtained at the time of the incident, you may argue that the FIR was filed with malicious intent to defame and harass you. The fact that the accused did not possess an SC certificate at the time of the incident can strengthen your case in quashing the FIR under the SC/ST Act. When filing a petition under Section482 CrPCto quash the FIR, you should highlight the timing of the SC certificate, the guilty plea, and the lack of acquaintance between you and the accused to demonstrate the mala fide intent behind the retaliatory FIR.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In India police clearance certificate is obtained after  verifying the  record by the police officer for any criminal activity. Since you have a pending case undersection 498A,the police charges will most probably be mentioned in the PCC. As there is no such evidence in the case, the police may still mention any other criminal charges made in relation to a citizen. This can be an issue for your Canadian permanent residency application since Canada does conduct Criminality Checks during immigration. Technically, there is no legal method of accelerating the PCC if the specific case is still pending but you can consult with  a legal attorney to look for a legal solution to resolve the case in a short period  of time.Thank you.Hope you find the answer satisfactoryAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,If, Mr. B, sold a portion or share of his 3 katthas to Mr. X then you may be able to file a pre-emption case under section 8 of the West Bengal Land Reforms Act, 1955 because section 8 allows pre-emption to co-sharer or a contiguous tenant. I disagree with your lawyer’s argument that pre-emption is only applicable if a portion is sold and not the entire 3 katthas. A wider interpretation could consider the entire 3 katthas as a “portion or share of the mother plot No. 502” The provision of Section 5(5) imposes a legal duty on Mr. B to notify the adjoining owners, including yourself before selling to a third party. If Mr. B failed to notify you, then he might have breached this section therefore making your case for pre-emption even stronger.Hope you find this answer helpful in resolving your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,If you get your marriage certified under the Foreign Marriage Act in Malaysia in front of the Consulate of India, you don’t have to register it again in India as it is considered legal in India. Though, it is wise to visit the Indian High Commission in Malaysia to get your marriage certificate legalized for India or any other Indian official purposes or visa. If the parties have to marry underSpecial Marriage Act1954 you require to file a notice to the Marriage Officer of the area in India along with certain documents which include passport size photographs, proofs of identity and residence as well as marriage certificate. This notice will be published, and if there are no complaints within a 30-day period then the marriage can be registered. In visa conversion, they normally ask for your marriage status which needs the presentation of a marriage certificate from the Indian consul. Some of the important legislations are Foreign Marriage Act, 1969 andSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, concerning with the registration of marriage in India.I hope this advice is fruitful.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In your particular case where you were assaulted by a public servant and he has  filed a case against you under the SC/ST Act, it is imperative to evaluate this counterclaim. This is because the public servant has already admitted guilt to charges under sections 323 and 506 of theIndian Penal Code(IPC) so any subsequent accusations against you may lack merit. However, if a chargesheet has been filed against you, your interim bail may be in jeopardy but you can challenge the charges in court. If you feel that the case registered under SC/ST Act is frivolous, you should move the High Court to discharge the FIR and get a lawyer to represent you. However, all documentation related to the incident as well as its subsequent legal process should be preserved best as the evidence will be of invaluable value in defending the case.Hope you find this answer suitable for resolving you query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Is it legal to incorporate Pvt Limited company which gets 100% profits from stock trading",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the answers of your questions regarding the incorporation of private limited company or LLP for stock trading;1) Yes, one is allowed to incorporate a private limited company or LLP and generate 100% of revenue from stock trading. But there are some conditions which one has to follow or avoid while using it.2) If the company has 50% or more total assets in the form of shares, securities, bonds, etc. and has 50% or more gross income from these financial assets, then it will come under the category of NBFC i.e., Non-Banking Financial Company and it is compulsory to obtain NBFC license from RBI. To get this NBFC license however it is not very easy as there are a lot of regulatory standards that have to be met.3) It is not always beneficial for you from a tax point of view to incorporate a private limited company or LLP. The company, its profits, will be subjected to the corporate tax rate, the current being 25% for small companies while any dividend paid to shareholders will further be charged for taxes. While it is true that some of these may be applicable to an individual and not to a company or corporation.4)Yes, it is allowed to deduct the director’s salary while operating a private limited company. However, the salary should be reasonable and should be equivalent to the salary paid in other similar organizations. From the salary income, taxes will be deducted from the side of the director.5) It is also possible to form an LLP and make profit from stock investing. For tax purposes, LLPs are classified as pass-through entities, and the income is taxed in the hands of the partners. If an LLP does not fall into the above criteria it does not need to hold an NBFC license.6) If the overall profits from stock investment are less then 50%, NBFC license may not be necessary to be obtained. However, it is proper to keep records/documentation in order to support the recognition of income as business income as opposed to being capital gains.It is better to turn to a tax consultant or an attorney who would be familiar with rules and provisions of the finance legislation. The decision to incorporate a company or LLP for trading in stocks depends with the kind of stocks one intends to invest in, and level of risk tolerance that one has.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Is it legal to incorporate Pvt Limited company which gets 100% profits from stock trading",
    "answer": "1. Legality of Owning a Pvt Ltd or LLP for Stock TradingYes, it is legal to own a Pvt Ltd or LLP that derives 100% of its profits from stock trading. However, the company’s Memorandum of Association (MOA) must include stock trading as one of its objectives.2. Requirement for NBFC LicenseIf the primary business of the Pvt Ltd or LLP is stock trading and it involves managing funds from multiple investors, it may be classified as a Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC), which requires an NBFC license from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). However, if you are only using your own and your brother’s money, it might not require an NBFC license.3. Tax Efficiency: Pvt Ltd or LLP vs. Individual AccountPvt Ltd Company: The corporate tax rate for Pvt Ltd companies is generally lower than the highest individual tax rate. For companies with a turnover of up to INR 400 crore, the tax rate is 25%, and for others, it is 30%. Additionally, companies can claim various business expenses, which can reduce taxable income.LLP: LLPs are taxed at a flat rate of 30% plus surcharge and cess as applicable. LLPs also allow for the distribution of profits without additional dividend distribution tax, which can be beneficial.Individual Account: Individuals are taxed based on income slabs, which can go up to 42.7% including surcharge. However, individuals can also claim expenses related to trading under ITR-3.4. Claiming Director’s Salary as ExpenseYes, a Pvt Ltd company can claim the director’s salary as an expense, provided it is reasonable and in line with the company’s financial performance. There are no specific limits on director remuneration for private companies, but it must be approved by the board of directors and comply with the Companies Act, 2013.5. If the profits from stock investments fall under 50% of the total profit, your company may not require an NBFC license. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) generally mandates an NBFC license for companies where financial activities constitute more than 50% of the total assets and income. This is known as the 50-50 test.In your case, if stock trading profits are less than 50% of the total profits, and the financial assets are also less than 50% of the total assets, a Private Limited Company (Pvt Ltd) should be sufficient without needing an NBFC license.Gagandeep Singh ThandiAdvocate, Pathankot68 AnswersTalk to Advocate Gagandeep Singh Thandi"

In addition the change in structure can also require your approval of the Karnataka Municipal Corporation Act.

It could be noted that the embedded shoe rack construction work can hardly be a subject to obtain formal permissions, however, for safety concerns it has become still advisable to consult a structural engineer as well as to follow the local bylaws and regulations.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Alimony",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You have the legal right to be granted alimony after your second marriage. your current living status, lack of employment, and your child’s necessity require support. Under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 both husband and wife can claim maintenance and it is determined by factors like the duration of marriage, financial position of both the parties and the standard of living which had been enjoyed by the couple during the marriage. Although the fact that your husband earns a lot of money can help you get a low alimony, your current complete financial reliance on your husband will work in your favour. The best approach to solve this problem is to explain your need for maintenance to your husband and sue for a reasonable amount. In the case of a deadlock, you can always seek for alimony through a court, this is based on the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 this entitles a claim for maintenance in cases of desertion or appropriate cause of separation. It is also  advisable to hire a family law attorney to help with approaching the legal matters.Hope this advice helps in solving your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Inquiry regarding preemption rights under Section 8 of West Bengal Land Reforms Act, 1955",
    "answer": "Dear Client,If, Mr. B, sold a portion or share of his 3 katthas to Mr. X then you may be able to file a pre-emption case under section 8 of the West Bengal Land Reforms Act, 1955 because section 8 allows pre-emption to co-sharer or a contiguous tenant. I disagree with your lawyer’s argument that pre-emption is only applicable if a portion is sold and not the entire 3 katthas. A wider interpretation could consider the entire 3 katthas as a “portion or share of the mother plot No. 502” The provision of Section 5(5) imposes a legal duty on Mr. B to notify the adjoining owners, including yourself before selling to a third party. If Mr. B failed to notify you, then he might have breached this section therefore making your case for pre-emption even stronger.Hope you find this answer helpful in resolving your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,If you get your marriage certified under the Foreign Marriage Act in Malaysia in front of the Consulate of India, you don’t have to register it again in India as it is considered legal in India. Though, it is wise to visit the Indian High Commission in Malaysia to get your marriage certificate legalized for India or any other Indian official purposes or visa. If the parties have to marry underSpecial Marriage Act1954 you require to file a notice to the Marriage Officer of the area in India along with certain documents which include passport size photographs, proofs of identity and residence as well as marriage certificate. This notice will be published, and if there are no complaints within a 30-day period then the marriage can be registered. In visa conversion, they normally ask for your marriage status which needs the presentation of a marriage certificate from the Indian consul. Some of the important legislations are Foreign Marriage Act, 1969 andSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, concerning with the registration of marriage in India.I hope this advice is fruitful.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In your particular case where you were assaulted by a public servant and he has  filed a case against you under the SC/ST Act, it is imperative to evaluate this counterclaim. This is because the public servant has already admitted guilt to charges under sections 323 and 506 of theIndian Penal Code(IPC) so any subsequent accusations against you may lack merit. However, if a chargesheet has been filed against you, your interim bail may be in jeopardy but you can challenge the charges in court. If you feel that the case registered under SC/ST Act is frivolous, you should move the High Court to discharge the FIR and get a lawyer to represent you. However, all documentation related to the incident as well as its subsequent legal process should be preserved best as the evidence will be of invaluable value in defending the case.Hope you find this answer suitable for resolving you query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In terms of the Maharashtra Ownership Flats Act 1963 or the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960, any alterations to a structure of a flat need the permission of the society. In response to the problem, study the bye-laws of the society and give a legal notice where the neighbour has to stop the unauthorized activity. If the neighbour persists in opposing the societies decision, seek a complain to the municipal authorities or the Registrar of Cooperative Societies.

Except if the agreement deed permits selling open parking spaces, which ordinarily is not allowed. Builders cannot also sell the parking spaces independently. When the society is created, it also takes charge of maintaining common spaces which includes parking lots as well. If it has free parking space, the society needs to allot on first come and own basis which is either through a lottery system or as passed in AGM. Failure to issue available parking spaces in this circumstance may be seen as arbitrarily or discriminatory. If the society's actions seem arbitrary, you can file a complaint against the builder for their failure to fulfil obligations before Gujarat RERA Authority as well as approach Registrar of Societies. You can also think of filling a civil suit or complaint with the Consumer Forum for deficiency in service.

    "question": "Landlord trying to evict me forcefully, making false accusations and trying to file false cases",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Since you have a lease agreement valid until April 15, 2025, the police cannot charge you with criminal trespassing. According to the Section 327 of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (previously,   IPC Section 447) speaks about criminal trespass that when someone enters or remains on another’s property without permission or right. The notice from the owner is invalid because your lease gives you lawful possession therefore, your rights remains that of a tenant. The owner allows you to occupy the property through the lease agreement, therefore cannot unilaterally eject you out of the property without following the right legal processes of evicting you before the agreed time of the lease agreement. Hence you have a right to be in the property and cannot therefore be accused of criminal trespass. A legal practitioner should be consulted to review the lease agreement and facilitate the preparation of the response to the owner’s notice while protecting your tenancy rights.Hope you find this advice beneficial.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Alimony",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You have the legal right to be granted alimony after your second marriage. your current living status, lack of employment, and your child’s necessity require support. Under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 both husband and wife can claim maintenance and it is determined by factors like the duration of marriage, financial position of both the parties and the standard of living which had been enjoyed by the couple during the marriage. Although the fact that your husband earns a lot of money can help you get a low alimony, your current complete financial reliance on your husband will work in your favour. The best approach to solve this problem is to explain your need for maintenance to your husband and sue for a reasonable amount. In the case of a deadlock, you can always seek for alimony through a court, this is based on the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 this entitles a claim for maintenance in cases of desertion or appropriate cause of separation. It is also  advisable to hire a family law attorney to help with approaching the legal matters.Hope this advice helps in solving your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Parents are deceased and NRI sister does not want to sell the properties",
    "answer": "A) Sending a Legal Notice Before Requesting Court PartitionYes, it is generally acceptable to send a legal notice informing your sister of the potential issues of taking the matter to court and suggesting that the properties be sold. If she agrees to sell the property through her own lawyer, this can be done before requesting the court to partition the property. This step can help avoid lengthy legal proceedings and reach an amicable solution.B) Subsequent Legal Notice for PartitionIf your sister ignores the initial legal notice, you can have a lawyer send a subsequent legal notice for partition. Here are the details for this process:(1) If She Does Not Contest the Partition:Response Time: Once your sister receives the legal notice, she typically has30 daysto respond.Court Appointment of Property Expert: If she does not respond, the court may take2-3 monthsto appoint a property expert and proceed with the partition.Partition by Property Experts: Property experts will evaluate the properties and suggest a fair division based on factors such as property value, location, and usage.(2) If She Contests the Partition:Step-by-Step Legal Process:Filing a Partition Suit: You will need to file a partition suit in the appropriate court.Service of Summons: The court will serve a summons to your sister.Discovery Phase: Both parties will exchange relevant documents and information.Trial: If no settlement is reached, the case will go to trial.Judgment: The court will issue a judgment on the partition.Duration: The entire process can take anywhere from6 months to several years, depending on the complexity of the case and court backlog.Basis for Contesting: Your sister may contest the partition based on claims of unfair division, sentimental value, or other personal reasons.(3) Selling Shares Without PartitionYou can sell your shares of the property without a formal partition, but this may lead to legal complications if your sister contests the sale.(4) Probating Your Mother’s WillProbating your mother’s will can help avoid disputes and ensure that her wishes are legally recognized. This process can provide a clear legal framework for the distribution of her assets.(5) Inheritance CertificateThere is no concept of an inheritance certificate in India.

However, this is not inevitable. The court typically prefers to explore all possible options for an equitable partition before resorting to an auction sale. If the property can be divided in a way that satisfies all parties, the court will usually opt for that solution.2. Yes, providing a legal heir certificate is generally compulsory in partition cases.

    "question": "Parents are deceased and NRI sister does not want to sell the properties",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Considering the issues related to the  inheritance and properties among the siblings which raise  several legal issues, the answer to your queries are as;A] Legal Notice for Property Sale AgreementYou should write a legal notice to your sister stating the legal questions that may arise in the event that the matter is taken to the court and ask her to agree to the sale of the said properties. It would be better that she answer in writing through her legal counsel, which is allowed up to the time of filing a partition. This approach may aid in coming up with a friendly solution to legal problems and minimize an extended trial process.B) Second Legal notice for partitionIn case your sister does not respond positively to the first notice you may go on to a legal notice for partition. Generally your sister should reply to the legal notice in 15 days of its receipt. In the event that she will not answer the complaint, the court can order an assessment of a property regarding division of the land. This process can take some time and normally takes several months to appoint an expert and finalize the partition according to the court’s attendance and the complexity of the case. Property experts will subdivide the residential properties in accordance with the legal papers, ownership ratios, as well as nature of the properties. They will also have to take into account the fair market value as well as the best interest of all the stakeholders.If She Will Challenge the PartitionIn the case where your sister disagrees on the partition, the steps normally followed is to present a suit In the civil court for the partition. The court will then issue the notices and the two parties will present their case to the court. The process may last from one to three years, depending on the case load of the court and the nature of the conflict. There can be possible reason that why your sister is likely resist the partition, she may say the partition should not be done or that she deserves a larger share due to her efforts or the properties do not have to be sold.If you sell property shares without a proper partition then it may turn legal trouble like a conflict with your sister. In this case it is recommended to either get her permission or a court order so as not to encounter any problems. You should take the initiative and probate your mother’s will to avoid further complications and disagreements in case she will challenge the will. It may be necessary to produce an inheritance certificate to prove his/her right to the ownership of the properties especially where there is a dispute over the will or shares of the property.Hope this advice helps in solving your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Parents are deceased and NRI sister does not want to sell the properties",
    "answer": "you need to calm down. when you complain of being insulted, have a look at your comment to me as well. I do not care about your ratings. I answered what was required to be answered. Despite that, I will again respond to some of your irrelevant queries. I cannot see what other lawyers have responded to your query and I am not even concerned. It is highly inappropriate of you of having make a generalised statement about lawyers. If you want respect, be respectful. Don't degrade lawyers in the manner you have sought to do in your remark left in my comment box. :Questions:A). Send a legal notice informing the potential issues of taking it to court and to have her agree that properties can be sold. She agrees that the property can be sold via her own lawyer. Is it ok to do this before we request the court to partition?As before stated you cannot compel your sister to sell her share. If she does not wish to sell her share, nobody can put a gun on her head. So this notice would not be appropriate. However you can have a letter addressed to her that it would be better if the properties are sold amicably, else the matter will have to go to the court, in a partition suit, which will take years to resolve. So try and convince her by saying that it would be in the fitness of things if the properties are sold mutually rather than lock the properties in legal dispute.B) Have a lawyer send a subsequent legal notice for partition, if she ignores option (A).Yes if she does not respond positively to the above letter, then you will have no option but to take legal steps by having a legal notice issued demanding partition of the properties.(1) If she does not contest it, the court will partition based on the advice of property experts.(1 i) Once my sister receives the legal notice how many days should she respond to it?there is no fixed time within which the notice has to be responded. Your lawyer will mention the notice period. Say 2 weeks or 4 weeks. Your sister is not even obligated to reply within that period. If she does not, then you will have to file a partition suit.(1 ii) If she does not respond, how many days does it take for the court to appoint a property expert and partition the land accordingly?this is very difficult to say. You will first file the suit. Then summons will be issued to the defendant sister. Then she will enter appearance and file her defense or written statement. Then the Court will frame issues [points of differences between the parties]. Then the parties will have to lead evidence /testimony. Then there will be final hearing followed by a preliminary decree and then a final decree. After passing of a preliminary decree the court will appoint a court commissioner who will visit the subject properties and file a report in court whether or not the properties are partible. So it is extremely difficult to certainly say how much time all of this will take. And the Indian Courts are slow. I can even say that the entire thing will get done in 1 year. Will you then hold me to my words if there is any delay. That is why I said that such a query is akin to asking a query to some astrologer. Despite that to give you a ballpark estimate, you can consider a minimum of 5 years.(1 iii) How will the property experts partition the residential properties?such properties are generally not partible. That is one cannot physically divide such properties to partition it. So generally such properties are sold in public auction and the sale proceeds are then divided among the parties according to their shares.(2) If she does contest the partition:(2 i) What is the step by step legal process?if your sister contests the partition suit then she will have to file her written statement and then all the steps i described above will happen(2 ii) How long will it take?difficult to answer(2 iii) What is the basis for her to contest the partition?this question does not make any sense. How can it be even predicted? she may come up with the case that the properties are not partible or that they are her own properties and the Plaintiff does not have any right in them. She can come up with any defense under the roof to contest the suit. So it is really not possible to precisely answer as to what will be her basis to contest the suit.(3) Can we sell our shares of the property without a partition & is there a legal ramifications?you can sell your undivided share but the question is, would there be willing buyers? If all the sharers are consenting for the sale then there is no question of any partition.(4) Do we need to probate my mother’s will to avoid my sister contesting the will?probate is not compulsory [ i say this on the strength of section 57 read with section 213 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925. However for all practical purposes if the Will is being set up then it should ideally be probated. If your sister contests the Will then she will have to forego any right that have been given to her under the Will. It would not make sense to contest a Will in which a person has been bequeathed something, unless the person claims that he or she is entitled to the entire thing and not a part of such thing that has been bequeathed under the Will.(5) Do we need an inheritance certificate?if you follow the testamentary succession and have the Will probated then an inheritance or heirship certificate would not be required. An heirship certificate is generally applied for when there is intestate succession i.e. when the person dies without leaving any Will behind.If a Will is set up and it has been acted upon then intestate succession [case in which there is no Will] cannot be then set up.Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Lower / restore society boundary wall",
    "answer": "Dear client,The housing society case is about the neighbour who tried to change a wall in the premises without permission. In terms of the Maharashtra Ownership Flats Act 1963 or the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960, any alterations to a structure of a flat need the permission of the society. In response to the problem, study the bye-laws of the society and give a legal notice where the neighbour has to stop the unauthorized activity. If the neighbour persists in opposing the societies decision, seek a complain to the municipal authorities or the Registrar of Cooperative Societies. If needed, go for a temporary injunction to stop the unauthorized acts of modifications. To avoid or grant permission to change common areas give the society a fair play to deal with internal encroachment within societies’ legal framework.Hope you find this answer suitable for resolving you query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The father is entitled to some rights in regard to the child, according to the divorce determination and the custody of the mother. The restraining order that prevented the petitioner from having any contact with the children was made without a full blown hearing, thereby cannot replace the existing decree. He can claim he has a right to access the child at her house probably owing to the fact that the mother is failing in providing proper care as evidenced by her leaving the child at the grandparent’s house. The father should file an application in the High Court stating that he should visit his child because it is unjust for a child not to have contact with a caring parent. The laws like the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 and the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 says that child’s best interest which supports the father to access his child.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

But it is always best to file the SLP as soon as possible to not complicate the legal proceedings. In case the order is appealable under the Civil Procedure Code (CPC), you can consider an appeal under Order 43. The Limitation Act of 1963 can also set specific time limits, they are normally a maximum of 90 days. Seeking the services of a lawyer is highly recommended before filing the SLP to determine the strength of the case and to prepare the grounds for the challenge.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In your particular case where you were assaulted by a public servant and he has  filed a case against you under the SC/ST Act, it is imperative to evaluate this counterclaim. This is because the public servant has already admitted guilt to charges under sections 323 and 506 of theIndian Penal Code(IPC) so any subsequent accusations against you may lack merit. However, if a chargesheet has been filed against you, your interim bail may be in jeopardy but you can challenge the charges in court. If you feel that the case registered under SC/ST Act is frivolous, you should move the High Court to discharge the FIR and get a lawyer to represent you. However, all documentation related to the incident as well as its subsequent legal process should be preserved best as the evidence will be of invaluable value in defending the case.Hope you find this answer suitable for resolving you query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Except if the agreement deed permits selling open parking spaces, which ordinarily is not allowed. Builders cannot also sell the parking spaces independently.

According to Section 6 of theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, in the event of a lease, no rights are assigned over common areas like parking, unless the lease document states otherwise. Further, the RERA clearly states that builders need to specify in terms of sale of properties that if you have paid for parking and parking space was promised to you then it is your right. If the society continues to bar you, then it advised to seek the help of a lawyer for complaining to RERA or sue the society executives. Your rights should also receive protection from the tenancy laws and the rules set by RERA.I hope this advice is fruitful.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Since you have a lease agreement valid until April 15, 2025, the police cannot charge you with criminal trespassing. According to the Section 327 of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (previously,   IPC Section 447) speaks about criminal trespass that when someone enters or remains on another’s property without permission or right. The notice from the owner is invalid because your lease gives you lawful possession therefore, your rights remains that of a tenant. The owner allows you to occupy the property through the lease agreement, therefore cannot unilaterally eject you out of the property without following the right legal processes of evicting you before the agreed time of the lease agreement. Hence you have a right to be in the property and cannot therefore be accused of criminal trespass. A legal practitioner should be consulted to review the lease agreement and facilitate the preparation of the response to the owner’s notice while protecting your tenancy rights.Hope you find this advice beneficial.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Except if the agreement deed permits selling open parking spaces, which ordinarily is not allowed. Builders cannot also sell the parking spaces independently. When the society is created, it also takes charge of maintaining common spaces which includes parking lots as well. If it has free parking space, the society needs to allot on first come and own basis which is either through a lottery system or as passed in AGM. Failure to issue available parking spaces in this circumstance may be seen as arbitrarily or discriminatory. If the society's actions seem arbitrary, you can file a complaint against the builder for their failure to fulfil obligations before Gujarat RERA Authority as well as approach Registrar of Societies. You can also think of filling a civil suit or complaint with the Consumer Forum for deficiency in service.

Marriages in Germany have to take place at the local Registry Office and some of the necessary documents include passports, birth certificates and proof of residence. The Indian partner must submit a ‘No Objection Certificate’ from the Indian authorities to the FDI. In case they prefer to get married in Denmark they have to adhere to different marriage laws. TheSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 provides for the duties of civil marriage everywhere in India without any religion bar. Under this Act, a marriage can only be solemnized after giving thirty days’ notice to the Marriage Registrar in India, or giving a home address in India, during this period. Relating to Hindu or Muslim marriages, theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 and the Muslim Marriage Act, 1961 whereas for the Christian marriages there is the Christian Marriage Act, 1872. To register at the Indian Embassy, valid passports, original birth certificates, and a recent Marriageability Certificate) from German authorities is required. In order to apply for marriage registration, an appointment should be taken at the Indian Embassy.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Regarding non-payment of cost",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You have the right to seek the costs the court met out to your wife for the delay in the proceedings which the court is entitled to impose under Section 35 of the CPC so as to minimize delays and avoid hinderance of judicial processes. To my understanding, the oral submission made by your wife’s advocate suggesting that payment of costs is not compulsory is wrong; once the costs have been ordered the parties are legally entitled to pay. The court cannot punish the refusing party for their refusal to proceed with the cross-examination until the costs awarded by the court are paid, as you have the right to demand payment first. Imposing costs are done for compliance with the court orders and non-payment affects the authority of the court. The expected outcome of a reserved Order should be in your favour because the court will order your wife to honour the Order and pay the outstanding costs before the continuation of the proceedings. In general, you have solid grounds for insisting on following the court order concerning costs.Hope this answer solves your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Alimony",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You have the legal right to be granted alimony after your second marriage. your current living status, lack of employment, and your child’s necessity require support. Under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 both husband and wife can claim maintenance and it is determined by factors like the duration of marriage, financial position of both the parties and the standard of living which had been enjoyed by the couple during the marriage. Although the fact that your husband earns a lot of money can help you get a low alimony, your current complete financial reliance on your husband will work in your favour. The best approach to solve this problem is to explain your need for maintenance to your husband and sue for a reasonable amount. In the case of a deadlock, you can always seek for alimony through a court, this is based on the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 this entitles a claim for maintenance in cases of desertion or appropriate cause of separation. It is also  advisable to hire a family law attorney to help with approaching the legal matters.Hope this advice helps in solving your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Property registration after RERA expired",
    "answer": "1. real estate regulatory authorities (RERA) do not allow extensions for project registration beyond one year. There are further restrictions of not transferring the project to the allottees/association till the promoter obtains the completion/occupancy certificate. The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA) of 2016 allows for a project's registration to be extended in certain circumstances, but not beyond one year.2. Your question is based on some rumors spread by people who do not know the law properly, there is no such thing. Property registration must be completed within four months of executing the sale deed and not from the date of executing the sale agreement.3. Your builder may give some lame excuses which are not maintainable in law4.Without paying the stamp duty the property cannot be registered5. The OC is not a document which is required mandatorily for property registration as its not a document of title evidencing the ownership of the seller instead it is required only if the stamp duty benefit is being claimed on account of old construction. Sometimes, the purchaser takes the benefit/depreciation of the stamp duty in the event of sale of flat of an old building, in such case the Sub-registrar in order to check the veracity of the construction insist on the copy of occupancy certificate or municipal assessment bills.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Property registration after RERA expired",
    "answer": "it is highly unfortunate what has happened to youi think the builder has been fooling youif his rera registration had expired then under the law he could NOT accept any further payments from you unless and until he got his rera registration renewedso the builder could not have collected any payments from you after 30.7.24secondly the builder telling you that the sub-registrar is not registering the agreement for sale because there is no rera registration or that the registration has expired, is complete rubbish. The sub-registrar has under the registration act no such jurisdiction to refuse registration of the agreement due to rera registration having been expired. I would really like to know and I am quite curious under which provision of law did the sub-registrar refuse the registration as there was no rera registrationthirdly the builder is obligated under RERA to compulsorily register an agreement for sale upon receiving 10% of the total sale considerationin your case i believe the builder has illegally accepted more than 10% from you without valid rera registration, and did not bother to enter into and register an agreement for sale with you. Because now he is trapped he has come up with the bogey that the sub-registrar is refusing to register the agreementalso if the agreement for sale is already signed by you then it has to be stamped and registered max within 4 months from the date of signing. The registration of the signed document can be done beyond 4 months also, but subject to max another 4 months, with payment of penalty. I do not know whether or not you have already signed the agreement for sale.your builder telling you that in order to register the agreement within 4 months you should have paid the stamp duty before rera expiry is again complete nonsense. As per the stamp act stamp duty has to be paid before signing or on the date of signing or on the day immediately after the day of signing. I dont know where this payment of duty before rera registration expiry, comes from. It seems the builder has been making his own rules and conning youi do not believe that just on applying for OC your agreement for sale can be registered. In my view your agreement for sale if it is duly signed and stamped, can be registered right away. It has got nothing to do with expiry of rera registration since the sub-registrar has got no power to require renewal of rera registration for registering the agreement for sale. I think if your agreement for sale is registered, then the builder will be exposed that he accepted payments from the flat buyer even after expiry of the rera registration and also he did not bother to register an agreement for sale after having accepted 10% of the total sale price. Both of these are offences under Rera. To cover his faults and guilt, he is cooking up any story before you. Highly unfortunate.Please have a legal notice issued to the builder and then consider filing a RERA complaint [I believe, on a prima facie view, that even if the rera registration has expired, a rera complaint can still be filed, because the project was rera registered. Its just the builder did not bother to renew his registration to save some charges]Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Property registration after RERA expired",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Based on your situation regarding the purchase of a flat and the implications of the RERA expiration, It can be considered that, the builder is right on the mark where he says that you can apply for registration based on the initial down-payment of ₹5 lakhs paid before the RERA is expired, but the expired RERA registration makes things a little tough. Although, you are free to register the property within four months from the agreement, it highly depends with the provisions of RERA because every project must be in compliance with the RERA rules and regulation at the point of registration. The builder’s argument that in order to avail the four months window one has to pay stamp duty is partially correct as while it has to be paid; it does not necessarily have to be paid before the RERA expiration. You can pay the stamp duty after RERA has expired but this may have an implication on the registration. Further, the builder claimed that applying for an Occupancy Certificate (OC) can open the doors for registration, however, the OC has to be approved for registration to take place. Therefore, it would be wise to keep all the communication records with the builder,  consult from an expert lawyer dealing with real estate and RERA and, if needed, you can approach to the RERA authority if the builder does not act to correct the mistake made in the registration process.I hope this advice is fruitful.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Property registration after RERA expired",
    "answer": "1. As per law, if the RERA expired , then the builder cannot sell and transfer the property , and hence there is lease chances of registration on the ground that the deal was finalized before the expiry.2. As per Section 23 of the Registration Act, the time limit for registration of documents before a Sub-Registrar is four months from the date of execution of the deed.- However, as the builder was registered earlier under the RERA , then in the absence of a valid registration with the RERA , he cannot registered the property in the name of buyer.- Further, in the absence of a RERA registration, you may trouble in future, as builder will not mention in your registration document that he has RERA registration at the time of execution of the deed.3. Not valid4. Payment of stamp duty is mandatory for the registration , however if the stamp duty is already paid within the period of 4 months then it can be registered.- However, the main problem is expiration of RERA Registration at the time of execution of the deed.5.  Not true.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Since your father owns an apartment along with your mother, both of them share the ownership as well as responsibilities of the property. In order to ensure you have adequate protection of the ₹ 50 lakhs invested in furniture and interior work, it is advisable to draw the co-ownership agreement regulating rights and use of property, as well as the methods and procedures of solving the arising disputes. If you have reasons to believe that your father’s affair may lead to property claims, then the best thing to do is to ensure you file a partition suit in the civil court. It is also advised to consult a lawyer who has expertise in Property law. The statutes that can be applied in this case are theHindu Succession Actof 1956 the Indian Contract Act of 1872 and theTransfer of Property Actof 1882.

    "question": "Alimony",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You have the legal right to be granted alimony after your second marriage. your current living status, lack of employment, and your child’s necessity require support. Under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 both husband and wife can claim maintenance and it is determined by factors like the duration of marriage, financial position of both the parties and the standard of living which had been enjoyed by the couple during the marriage. Although the fact that your husband earns a lot of money can help you get a low alimony, your current complete financial reliance on your husband will work in your favour. The best approach to solve this problem is to explain your need for maintenance to your husband and sue for a reasonable amount. In the case of a deadlock, you can always seek for alimony through a court, this is based on the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 this entitles a claim for maintenance in cases of desertion or appropriate cause of separation. It is also  advisable to hire a family law attorney to help with approaching the legal matters.Hope this advice helps in solving your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Since your father owns an apartment along with your mother, both of them share the ownership as well as responsibilities of the property. In order to ensure you have adequate protection of the ₹ 50 lakhs invested in furniture and interior work, it is advisable to draw the co-ownership agreement regulating rights and use of property, as well as the methods and procedures of solving the arising disputes. If you have reasons to believe that your father’s affair may lead to property claims, then the best thing to do is to ensure you file a partition suit in the civil court. It is also advised to consult a lawyer who has expertise in Property law. The statutes that can be applied in this case are theHindu Succession Actof 1956 the Indian Contract Act of 1872 and theTransfer of Property Actof 1882. Such precautionary measures have been explained above and will coordinate to safeguard your interest in the property.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

As it is probable that the wall in question is part of the common structure supporting the stairs, their change may adversely affect the stability of the building. As per the regulation of Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 residents cannot do anything that may lead to the deterioration of the infrastructural structure of the building. In addition the change in structure can also require your approval of the Karnataka Municipal Corporation Act. If you are thinking of performing alteration works on the wall, consult a structural engineer to ascertain whether the wall is load bearing or non-load bearing and talk to your neighbours and housing society along with the local municipal authority so as to avert any legal problems.

    "answer": "Dear Client,You have the legal right to be granted alimony after your second marriage. your current living status, lack of employment, and your child’s necessity require support. Under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 both husband and wife can claim maintenance and it is determined by factors like the duration of marriage, financial position of both the parties and the standard of living which had been enjoyed by the couple during the marriage. Although the fact that your husband earns a lot of money can help you get a low alimony, your current complete financial reliance on your husband will work in your favour. The best approach to solve this problem is to explain your need for maintenance to your husband and sue for a reasonable amount. In the case of a deadlock, you can always seek for alimony through a court, this is based on the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 this entitles a claim for maintenance in cases of desertion or appropriate cause of separation.

    "question": "Parents are deceased and NRI sister does not want to sell the properties",
    "answer": "A) Sending a Legal Notice Before Requesting Court PartitionYes, it is generally acceptable to send a legal notice informing your sister of the potential issues of taking the matter to court and suggesting that the properties be sold. If she agrees to sell the property through her own lawyer, this can be done before requesting the court to partition the property. This step can help avoid lengthy legal proceedings and reach an amicable solution.B) Subsequent Legal Notice for PartitionIf your sister ignores the initial legal notice, you can have a lawyer send a subsequent legal notice for partition. Here are the details for this process:(1) If She Does Not Contest the Partition:Response Time: Once your sister receives the legal notice, she typically has30 daysto respond.Court Appointment of Property Expert: If she does not respond, the court may take2-3 monthsto appoint a property expert and proceed with the partition.Partition by Property Experts: Property experts will evaluate the properties and suggest a fair division based on factors such as property value, location, and usage.(2) If She Contests the Partition:Step-by-Step Legal Process:Filing a Partition Suit: You will need to file a partition suit in the appropriate court.Service of Summons: The court will serve a summons to your sister.Discovery Phase: Both parties will exchange relevant documents and information.Trial: If no settlement is reached, the case will go to trial.Judgment: The court will issue a judgment on the partition.Duration: The entire process can take anywhere from6 months to several years, depending on the complexity of the case and court backlog.Basis for Contesting: Your sister may contest the partition based on claims of unfair division, sentimental value, or other personal reasons.(3) Selling Shares Without PartitionYou can sell your shares of the property without a formal partition, but this may lead to legal complications if your sister contests the sale.(4) Probating Your Mother’s WillProbating your mother’s will can help avoid disputes and ensure that her wishes are legally recognized. This process can provide a clear legal framework for the distribution of her assets.(5) Inheritance CertificateThere is no concept of an inheritance certificate in India. You can get a Legal Heir certificate which establish a relation with the deceased.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if you need any clarification."

    "question": "Parents are deceased and NRI sister does not want to sell the properties",
    "answer": "1. In Kerala, if residential properties cannot be partitioned amicably among the heirs, the court may order an auction sale as a last resort. However, this is not inevitable. The court typically prefers to explore all possible options for an equitable partition before resorting to an auction sale. If the property can be divided in a way that satisfies all parties, the court will usually opt for that solution.2. Yes, providing a legal heir certificate is generally compulsory in partition cases. The legal heir certificate is used to establish the rightful heirs of the deceased and their respective shares in the property. You can get this certificate at your jurisdictional Tehsildar or revenue office.Gagandeep Singh ThandiAdvocate, Pathankot68 AnswersTalk to Advocate Gagandeep Singh Thandi"

    "question": "Parents are deceased and NRI sister does not want to sell the properties",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Considering the issues related to the  inheritance and properties among the siblings which raise  several legal issues, the answer to your queries are as;A] Legal Notice for Property Sale AgreementYou should write a legal notice to your sister stating the legal questions that may arise in the event that the matter is taken to the court and ask her to agree to the sale of the said properties. It would be better that she answer in writing through her legal counsel, which is allowed up to the time of filing a partition. This approach may aid in coming up with a friendly solution to legal problems and minimize an extended trial process.B) Second Legal notice for partitionIn case your sister does not respond positively to the first notice you may go on to a legal notice for partition. Generally your sister should reply to the legal notice in 15 days of its receipt. In the event that she will not answer the complaint, the court can order an assessment of a property regarding division of the land. This process can take some time and normally takes several months to appoint an expert and finalize the partition according to the court’s attendance and the complexity of the case. Property experts will subdivide the residential properties in accordance with the legal papers, ownership ratios, as well as nature of the properties. They will also have to take into account the fair market value as well as the best interest of all the stakeholders.If She Will Challenge the PartitionIn the case where your sister disagrees on the partition, the steps normally followed is to present a suit In the civil court for the partition. The court will then issue the notices and the two parties will present their case to the court. The process may last from one to three years, depending on the case load of the court and the nature of the conflict. There can be possible reason that why your sister is likely resist the partition, she may say the partition should not be done or that she deserves a larger share due to her efforts or the properties do not have to be sold.If you sell property shares without a proper partition then it may turn legal trouble like a conflict with your sister. In this case it is recommended to either get her permission or a court order so as not to encounter any problems. You should take the initiative and probate your mother’s will to avoid further complications and disagreements in case she will challenge the will. It may be necessary to produce an inheritance certificate to prove his/her right to the ownership of the properties especially where there is a dispute over the will or shares of the property.Hope this advice helps in solving your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Parents are deceased and NRI sister does not want to sell the properties",
    "answer": "you need to calm down. when you complain of being insulted, have a look at your comment to me as well. I do not care about your ratings. I answered what was required to be answered. Despite that, I will again respond to some of your irrelevant queries. I cannot see what other lawyers have responded to your query and I am not even concerned. It is highly inappropriate of you of having make a generalised statement about lawyers. If you want respect, be respectful. Don't degrade lawyers in the manner you have sought to do in your remark left in my comment box. :Questions:A). Send a legal notice informing the potential issues of taking it to court and to have her agree that properties can be sold. She agrees that the property can be sold via her own lawyer. Is it ok to do this before we request the court to partition?As before stated you cannot compel your sister to sell her share. If she does not wish to sell her share, nobody can put a gun on her head. So this notice would not be appropriate. However you can have a letter addressed to her that it would be better if the properties are sold amicably, else the matter will have to go to the court, in a partition suit, which will take years to resolve. So try and convince her by saying that it would be in the fitness of things if the properties are sold mutually rather than lock the properties in legal dispute.B) Have a lawyer send a subsequent legal notice for partition, if she ignores option (A).Yes if she does not respond positively to the above letter, then you will have no option but to take legal steps by having a legal notice issued demanding partition of the properties.(1) If she does not contest it, the court will partition based on the advice of property experts.(1 i) Once my sister receives the legal notice how many days should she respond to it?there is no fixed time within which the notice has to be responded. Your lawyer will mention the notice period. Say 2 weeks or 4 weeks. Your sister is not even obligated to reply within that period. If she does not, then you will have to file a partition suit.(1 ii) If she does not respond, how many days does it take for the court to appoint a property expert and partition the land accordingly?this is very difficult to say. You will first file the suit. Then summons will be issued to the defendant sister. Then she will enter appearance and file her defense or written statement. Then the Court will frame issues [points of differences between the parties]. Then the parties will have to lead evidence /testimony. Then there will be final hearing followed by a preliminary decree and then a final decree. After passing of a preliminary decree the court will appoint a court commissioner who will visit the subject properties and file a report in court whether or not the properties are partible. So it is extremely difficult to certainly say how much time all of this will take. And the Indian Courts are slow. I can even say that the entire thing will get done in 1 year. Will you then hold me to my words if there is any delay. That is why I said that such a query is akin to asking a query to some astrologer. Despite that to give you a ballpark estimate, you can consider a minimum of 5 years.(1 iii) How will the property experts partition the residential properties?such properties are generally not partible. That is one cannot physically divide such properties to partition it. So generally such properties are sold in public auction and the sale proceeds are then divided among the parties according to their shares.(2) If she does contest the partition:(2 i) What is the step by step legal process?if your sister contests the partition suit then she will have to file her written statement and then all the steps i described above will happen(2 ii) How long will it take?difficult to answer(2 iii) What is the basis for her to contest the partition?this question does not make any sense. How can it be even predicted? she may come up with the case that the properties are not partible or that they are her own properties and the Plaintiff does not have any right in them. She can come up with any defense under the roof to contest the suit. So it is really not possible to precisely answer as to what will be her basis to contest the suit.(3) Can we sell our shares of the property without a partition & is there a legal ramifications?you can sell your undivided share but the question is, would there be willing buyers? If all the sharers are consenting for the sale then there is no question of any partition.(4) Do we need to probate my mother’s will to avoid my sister contesting the will?probate is not compulsory [ i say this on the strength of section 57 read with section 213 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925. However for all practical purposes if the Will is being set up then it should ideally be probated. If your sister contests the Will then she will have to forego any right that have been given to her under the Will. It would not make sense to contest a Will in which a person has been bequeathed something, unless the person claims that he or she is entitled to the entire thing and not a part of such thing that has been bequeathed under the Will.(5) Do we need an inheritance certificate?if you follow the testamentary succession and have the Will probated then an inheritance or heirship certificate would not be required. An heirship certificate is generally applied for when there is intestate succession i.e. when the person dies without leaving any Will behind.If a Will is set up and it has been acted upon then intestate succession [case in which there is no Will] cannot be then set up.Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

In order to ensure you have adequate protection of the ₹ 50 lakhs invested in furniture and interior work, it is advisable to draw the co-ownership agreement regulating rights and use of property, as well as the methods and procedures of solving the arising disputes. If you have reasons to believe that your father’s affair may lead to property claims, then the best thing to do is to ensure you file a partition suit in the civil court. It is also advised to consult a lawyer who has expertise in Property law. The statutes that can be applied in this case are theHindu Succession Actof 1956 the Indian Contract Act of 1872 and theTransfer of Property Actof 1882.

    "answer": "1. real estate regulatory authorities (RERA) do not allow extensions for project registration beyond one year. There are further restrictions of not transferring the project to the allottees/association till the promoter obtains the completion/occupancy certificate. The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA) of 2016 allows for a project's registration to be extended in certain circumstances, but not beyond one year.2. Your question is based on some rumors spread by people who do not know the law properly, there is no such thing. Property registration must be completed within four months of executing the sale deed and not from the date of executing the sale agreement.3. Your builder may give some lame excuses which are not maintainable in law4.Without paying the stamp duty the property cannot be registered5. The OC is not a document which is required mandatorily for property registration as its not a document of title evidencing the ownership of the seller instead it is required only if the stamp duty benefit is being claimed on account of old construction. Sometimes, the purchaser takes the benefit/depreciation of the stamp duty in the event of sale of flat of an old building, in such case the Sub-registrar in order to check the veracity of the construction insist on the copy of occupancy certificate or municipal assessment bills.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Property registration after RERA expired",
    "answer": "it is highly unfortunate what has happened to youi think the builder has been fooling youif his rera registration had expired then under the law he could NOT accept any further payments from you unless and until he got his rera registration renewedso the builder could not have collected any payments from you after 30.7.24secondly the builder telling you that the sub-registrar is not registering the agreement for sale because there is no rera registration or that the registration has expired, is complete rubbish. The sub-registrar has under the registration act no such jurisdiction to refuse registration of the agreement due to rera registration having been expired. I would really like to know and I am quite curious under which provision of law did the sub-registrar refuse the registration as there was no rera registrationthirdly the builder is obligated under RERA to compulsorily register an agreement for sale upon receiving 10% of the total sale considerationin your case i believe the builder has illegally accepted more than 10% from you without valid rera registration, and did not bother to enter into and register an agreement for sale with you. Because now he is trapped he has come up with the bogey that the sub-registrar is refusing to register the agreementalso if the agreement for sale is already signed by you then it has to be stamped and registered max within 4 months from the date of signing. The registration of the signed document can be done beyond 4 months also, but subject to max another 4 months, with payment of penalty. I do not know whether or not you have already signed the agreement for sale.your builder telling you that in order to register the agreement within 4 months you should have paid the stamp duty before rera expiry is again complete nonsense. As per the stamp act stamp duty has to be paid before signing or on the date of signing or on the day immediately after the day of signing. I dont know where this payment of duty before rera registration expiry, comes from. It seems the builder has been making his own rules and conning youi do not believe that just on applying for OC your agreement for sale can be registered. In my view your agreement for sale if it is duly signed and stamped, can be registered right away. It has got nothing to do with expiry of rera registration since the sub-registrar has got no power to require renewal of rera registration for registering the agreement for sale. I think if your agreement for sale is registered, then the builder will be exposed that he accepted payments from the flat buyer even after expiry of the rera registration and also he did not bother to register an agreement for sale after having accepted 10% of the total sale price. Both of these are offences under Rera. To cover his faults and guilt, he is cooking up any story before you. Highly unfortunate.Please have a legal notice issued to the builder and then consider filing a RERA complaint [I believe, on a prima facie view, that even if the rera registration has expired, a rera complaint can still be filed, because the project was rera registered. Its just the builder did not bother to renew his registration to save some charges]Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Property registration after RERA expired",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Based on your situation regarding the purchase of a flat and the implications of the RERA expiration, It can be considered that, the builder is right on the mark where he says that you can apply for registration based on the initial down-payment of ₹5 lakhs paid before the RERA is expired, but the expired RERA registration makes things a little tough. Although, you are free to register the property within four months from the agreement, it highly depends with the provisions of RERA because every project must be in compliance with the RERA rules and regulation at the point of registration. The builder’s argument that in order to avail the four months window one has to pay stamp duty is partially correct as while it has to be paid; it does not necessarily have to be paid before the RERA expiration. You can pay the stamp duty after RERA has expired but this may have an implication on the registration. Further, the builder claimed that applying for an Occupancy Certificate (OC) can open the doors for registration, however, the OC has to be approved for registration to take place. Therefore, it would be wise to keep all the communication records with the builder,  consult from an expert lawyer dealing with real estate and RERA and, if needed, you can approach to the RERA authority if the builder does not act to correct the mistake made in the registration process.I hope this advice is fruitful.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Alimony",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You have the legal right to be granted alimony after your second marriage. your current living status, lack of employment, and your child’s necessity require support. Under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 both husband and wife can claim maintenance and it is determined by factors like the duration of marriage, financial position of both the parties and the standard of living which had been enjoyed by the couple during the marriage. Although the fact that your husband earns a lot of money can help you get a low alimony, your current complete financial reliance on your husband will work in your favour. The best approach to solve this problem is to explain your need for maintenance to your husband and sue for a reasonable amount. In the case of a deadlock, you can always seek for alimony through a court, this is based on the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 this entitles a claim for maintenance in cases of desertion or appropriate cause of separation. It is also  advisable to hire a family law attorney to help with approaching the legal matters.Hope this advice helps in solving your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Parents are deceased and NRI sister does not want to sell the properties",
    "answer": "A) Sending a Legal Notice Before Requesting Court PartitionYes, it is generally acceptable to send a legal notice informing your sister of the potential issues of taking the matter to court and suggesting that the properties be sold. If she agrees to sell the property through her own lawyer, this can be done before requesting the court to partition the property. This step can help avoid lengthy legal proceedings and reach an amicable solution.B) Subsequent Legal Notice for PartitionIf your sister ignores the initial legal notice, you can have a lawyer send a subsequent legal notice for partition. Here are the details for this process:(1) If She Does Not Contest the Partition:Response Time: Once your sister receives the legal notice, she typically has30 daysto respond.Court Appointment of Property Expert: If she does not respond, the court may take2-3 monthsto appoint a property expert and proceed with the partition.Partition by Property Experts: Property experts will evaluate the properties and suggest a fair division based on factors such as property value, location, and usage.(2) If She Contests the Partition:Step-by-Step Legal Process:Filing a Partition Suit: You will need to file a partition suit in the appropriate court.Service of Summons: The court will serve a summons to your sister.Discovery Phase: Both parties will exchange relevant documents and information.Trial: If no settlement is reached, the case will go to trial.Judgment: The court will issue a judgment on the partition.Duration: The entire process can take anywhere from6 months to several years, depending on the complexity of the case and court backlog.Basis for Contesting: Your sister may contest the partition based on claims of unfair division, sentimental value, or other personal reasons.(3) Selling Shares Without PartitionYou can sell your shares of the property without a formal partition, but this may lead to legal complications if your sister contests the sale.(4) Probating Your Mother’s WillProbating your mother’s will can help avoid disputes and ensure that her wishes are legally recognized. This process can provide a clear legal framework for the distribution of her assets.(5) Inheritance CertificateThere is no concept of an inheritance certificate in India. You can get a Legal Heir certificate which establish a relation with the deceased.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if you need any clarification."

    "question": "Parents are deceased and NRI sister does not want to sell the properties",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Considering the issues related to the  inheritance and properties among the siblings which raise  several legal issues, the answer to your queries are as;A] Legal Notice for Property Sale AgreementYou should write a legal notice to your sister stating the legal questions that may arise in the event that the matter is taken to the court and ask her to agree to the sale of the said properties. It would be better that she answer in writing through her legal counsel, which is allowed up to the time of filing a partition. This approach may aid in coming up with a friendly solution to legal problems and minimize an extended trial process.B) Second Legal notice for partitionIn case your sister does not respond positively to the first notice you may go on to a legal notice for partition. Generally your sister should reply to the legal notice in 15 days of its receipt. In the event that she will not answer the complaint, the court can order an assessment of a property regarding division of the land. This process can take some time and normally takes several months to appoint an expert and finalize the partition according to the court’s attendance and the complexity of the case. Property experts will subdivide the residential properties in accordance with the legal papers, ownership ratios, as well as nature of the properties. They will also have to take into account the fair market value as well as the best interest of all the stakeholders.If She Will Challenge the PartitionIn the case where your sister disagrees on the partition, the steps normally followed is to present a suit In the civil court for the partition. The court will then issue the notices and the two parties will present their case to the court. The process may last from one to three years, depending on the case load of the court and the nature of the conflict. There can be possible reason that why your sister is likely resist the partition, she may say the partition should not be done or that she deserves a larger share due to her efforts or the properties do not have to be sold.If you sell property shares without a proper partition then it may turn legal trouble like a conflict with your sister. In this case it is recommended to either get her permission or a court order so as not to encounter any problems. You should take the initiative and probate your mother’s will to avoid further complications and disagreements in case she will challenge the will. It may be necessary to produce an inheritance certificate to prove his/her right to the ownership of the properties especially where there is a dispute over the will or shares of the property.Hope this advice helps in solving your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Parents are deceased and NRI sister does not want to sell the properties",
    "answer": "you need to calm down. when you complain of being insulted, have a look at your comment to me as well. I do not care about your ratings. I answered what was required to be answered. Despite that, I will again respond to some of your irrelevant queries. I cannot see what other lawyers have responded to your query and I am not even concerned. It is highly inappropriate of you of having make a generalised statement about lawyers. If you want respect, be respectful. Don't degrade lawyers in the manner you have sought to do in your remark left in my comment box. :Questions:A). Send a legal notice informing the potential issues of taking it to court and to have her agree that properties can be sold. She agrees that the property can be sold via her own lawyer. Is it ok to do this before we request the court to partition?As before stated you cannot compel your sister to sell her share. If she does not wish to sell her share, nobody can put a gun on her head. So this notice would not be appropriate. However you can have a letter addressed to her that it would be better if the properties are sold amicably, else the matter will have to go to the court, in a partition suit, which will take years to resolve. So try and convince her by saying that it would be in the fitness of things if the properties are sold mutually rather than lock the properties in legal dispute.B) Have a lawyer send a subsequent legal notice for partition, if she ignores option (A).Yes if she does not respond positively to the above letter, then you will have no option but to take legal steps by having a legal notice issued demanding partition of the properties.(1) If she does not contest it, the court will partition based on the advice of property experts.(1 i) Once my sister receives the legal notice how many days should she respond to it?there is no fixed time within which the notice has to be responded. Your lawyer will mention the notice period. Say 2 weeks or 4 weeks. Your sister is not even obligated to reply within that period. If she does not, then you will have to file a partition suit.(1 ii) If she does not respond, how many days does it take for the court to appoint a property expert and partition the land accordingly?this is very difficult to say. You will first file the suit. Then summons will be issued to the defendant sister. Then she will enter appearance and file her defense or written statement. Then the Court will frame issues [points of differences between the parties]. Then the parties will have to lead evidence /testimony. Then there will be final hearing followed by a preliminary decree and then a final decree. After passing of a preliminary decree the court will appoint a court commissioner who will visit the subject properties and file a report in court whether or not the properties are partible. So it is extremely difficult to certainly say how much time all of this will take. And the Indian Courts are slow. I can even say that the entire thing will get done in 1 year. Will you then hold me to my words if there is any delay. That is why I said that such a query is akin to asking a query to some astrologer. Despite that to give you a ballpark estimate, you can consider a minimum of 5 years.(1 iii) How will the property experts partition the residential properties?such properties are generally not partible. That is one cannot physically divide such properties to partition it. So generally such properties are sold in public auction and the sale proceeds are then divided among the parties according to their shares.(2) If she does contest the partition:(2 i) What is the step by step legal process?if your sister contests the partition suit then she will have to file her written statement and then all the steps i described above will happen(2 ii) How long will it take?difficult to answer(2 iii) What is the basis for her to contest the partition?this question does not make any sense. How can it be even predicted? she may come up with the case that the properties are not partible or that they are her own properties and the Plaintiff does not have any right in them. She can come up with any defense under the roof to contest the suit. So it is really not possible to precisely answer as to what will be her basis to contest the suit.(3) Can we sell our shares of the property without a partition & is there a legal ramifications?you can sell your undivided share but the question is, would there be willing buyers? If all the sharers are consenting for the sale then there is no question of any partition.(4) Do we need to probate my mother’s will to avoid my sister contesting the will?probate is not compulsory [ i say this on the strength of section 57 read with section 213 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925. However for all practical purposes if the Will is being set up then it should ideally be probated. If your sister contests the Will then she will have to forego any right that have been given to her under the Will. It would not make sense to contest a Will in which a person has been bequeathed something, unless the person claims that he or she is entitled to the entire thing and not a part of such thing that has been bequeathed under the Will.(5) Do we need an inheritance certificate?if you follow the testamentary succession and have the Will probated then an inheritance or heirship certificate would not be required. An heirship certificate is generally applied for when there is intestate succession i.e. when the person dies without leaving any Will behind.If a Will is set up and it has been acted upon then intestate succession [case in which there is no Will] cannot be then set up.Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Property registration after RERA expired",
    "answer": "1. real estate regulatory authorities (RERA) do not allow extensions for project registration beyond one year. There are further restrictions of not transferring the project to the allottees/association till the promoter obtains the completion/occupancy certificate. The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA) of 2016 allows for a project's registration to be extended in certain circumstances, but not beyond one year.2. Your question is based on some rumors spread by people who do not know the law properly, there is no such thing. Property registration must be completed within four months of executing the sale deed and not from the date of executing the sale agreement.3. Your builder may give some lame excuses which are not maintainable in law4.Without paying the stamp duty the property cannot be registered5. The OC is not a document which is required mandatorily for property registration as its not a document of title evidencing the ownership of the seller instead it is required only if the stamp duty benefit is being claimed on account of old construction. Sometimes, the purchaser takes the benefit/depreciation of the stamp duty in the event of sale of flat of an old building, in such case the Sub-registrar in order to check the veracity of the construction insist on the copy of occupancy certificate or municipal assessment bills.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Property registration after RERA expired",
    "answer": "it is highly unfortunate what has happened to youi think the builder has been fooling youif his rera registration had expired then under the law he could NOT accept any further payments from you unless and until he got his rera registration renewedso the builder could not have collected any payments from you after 30.7.24secondly the builder telling you that the sub-registrar is not registering the agreement for sale because there is no rera registration or that the registration has expired, is complete rubbish. The sub-registrar has under the registration act no such jurisdiction to refuse registration of the agreement due to rera registration having been expired. I would really like to know and I am quite curious under which provision of law did the sub-registrar refuse the registration as there was no rera registrationthirdly the builder is obligated under RERA to compulsorily register an agreement for sale upon receiving 10% of the total sale considerationin your case i believe the builder has illegally accepted more than 10% from you without valid rera registration, and did not bother to enter into and register an agreement for sale with you. Because now he is trapped he has come up with the bogey that the sub-registrar is refusing to register the agreementalso if the agreement for sale is already signed by you then it has to be stamped and registered max within 4 months from the date of signing. The registration of the signed document can be done beyond 4 months also, but subject to max another 4 months, with payment of penalty. I do not know whether or not you have already signed the agreement for sale.your builder telling you that in order to register the agreement within 4 months you should have paid the stamp duty before rera expiry is again complete nonsense. As per the stamp act stamp duty has to be paid before signing or on the date of signing or on the day immediately after the day of signing. I dont know where this payment of duty before rera registration expiry, comes from. It seems the builder has been making his own rules and conning youi do not believe that just on applying for OC your agreement for sale can be registered. In my view your agreement for sale if it is duly signed and stamped, can be registered right away. It has got nothing to do with expiry of rera registration since the sub-registrar has got no power to require renewal of rera registration for registering the agreement for sale. I think if your agreement for sale is registered, then the builder will be exposed that he accepted payments from the flat buyer even after expiry of the rera registration and also he did not bother to register an agreement for sale after having accepted 10% of the total sale price. Both of these are offences under Rera. To cover his faults and guilt, he is cooking up any story before you. Highly unfortunate.Please have a legal notice issued to the builder and then consider filing a RERA complaint [I believe, on a prima facie view, that even if the rera registration has expired, a rera complaint can still be filed, because the project was rera registered. Its just the builder did not bother to renew his registration to save some charges]Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Property registration after RERA expired",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Based on your situation regarding the purchase of a flat and the implications of the RERA expiration, It can be considered that, the builder is right on the mark where he says that you can apply for registration based on the initial down-payment of ₹5 lakhs paid before the RERA is expired, but the expired RERA registration makes things a little tough. Although, you are free to register the property within four months from the agreement, it highly depends with the provisions of RERA because every project must be in compliance with the RERA rules and regulation at the point of registration. The builder’s argument that in order to avail the four months window one has to pay stamp duty is partially correct as while it has to be paid; it does not necessarily have to be paid before the RERA expiration. You can pay the stamp duty after RERA has expired but this may have an implication on the registration. Further, the builder claimed that applying for an Occupancy Certificate (OC) can open the doors for registration, however, the OC has to be approved for registration to take place. Therefore, it would be wise to keep all the communication records with the builder,  consult from an expert lawyer dealing with real estate and RERA and, if needed, you can approach to the RERA authority if the builder does not act to correct the mistake made in the registration process.I hope this advice is fruitful.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "1. As per law, if the RERA expired , then the builder cannot sell and transfer the property , and hence there is lease chances of registration on the ground that the deal was finalized before the expiry.2. As per Section 23 of the Registration Act, the time limit for registration of documents before a Sub-Registrar is four months from the date of execution of the deed.- However, as the builder was registered earlier under the RERA , then in the absence of a valid registration with the RERA , he cannot registered the property in the name of buyer.- Further, in the absence of a RERA registration, you may trouble in future, as builder will not mention in your registration document that he has RERA registration at the time of execution of the deed.3.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Since your father owns an apartment along with your mother, both of them share the ownership as well as responsibilities of the property. In order to ensure you have adequate protection of the ₹ 50 lakhs invested in furniture and interior work, it is advisable to draw the co-ownership agreement regulating rights and use of property, as well as the methods and procedures of solving the arising disputes. If you have reasons to believe that your father’s affair may lead to property claims, then the best thing to do is to ensure you file a partition suit in the civil court. It is also advised to consult a lawyer who has expertise in Property law. The statutes that can be applied in this case are theHindu Succession Actof 1956 the Indian Contract Act of 1872 and theTransfer of Property Actof 1882.

As it is probable that the wall in question is part of the common structure supporting the stairs, their change may adversely affect the stability of the building. As per the regulation of Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 residents cannot do anything that may lead to the deterioration of the infrastructural structure of the building. In addition the change in structure can also require your approval of the Karnataka Municipal Corporation Act. If you are thinking of performing alteration works on the wall, consult a structural engineer to ascertain whether the wall is load bearing or non-load bearing and talk to your neighbours and housing society along with the local municipal authority so as to avert any legal problems.

    "question": "Alimony",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You have the legal right to be granted alimony after your second marriage. your current living status, lack of employment, and your child’s necessity require support. Under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 both husband and wife can claim maintenance and it is determined by factors like the duration of marriage, financial position of both the parties and the standard of living which had been enjoyed by the couple during the marriage. Although the fact that your husband earns a lot of money can help you get a low alimony, your current complete financial reliance on your husband will work in your favour. The best approach to solve this problem is to explain your need for maintenance to your husband and sue for a reasonable amount. In the case of a deadlock, you can always seek for alimony through a court, this is based on the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 this entitles a claim for maintenance in cases of desertion or appropriate cause of separation. It is also  advisable to hire a family law attorney to help with approaching the legal matters.Hope this advice helps in solving your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In Bangalore when a couple wants a contested divorce it normally lasts anywhere between 6 months and 1.5 years provided there are adequate court sessions for the hearings and the case is not complicated. The process includes a filing of a petition for divorce, further hearings and trial if reconciliation does not happen. An average expense for hiring a lawyer when filing for a contested divorce and the case may easily cost between INR 15,000 to INR 50,000 and above.

Ancestral property, under Hindu law, is typically property that has been passed down undivided through four generations of male lineage.

    "question": "Parents are deceased and NRI sister does not want to sell the properties",
    "answer": "A) Sending a Legal Notice Before Requesting Court PartitionYes, it is generally acceptable to send a legal notice informing your sister of the potential issues of taking the matter to court and suggesting that the properties be sold. If she agrees to sell the property through her own lawyer, this can be done before requesting the court to partition the property. This step can help avoid lengthy legal proceedings and reach an amicable solution.B) Subsequent Legal Notice for PartitionIf your sister ignores the initial legal notice, you can have a lawyer send a subsequent legal notice for partition. Here are the details for this process:(1) If She Does Not Contest the Partition:Response Time: Once your sister receives the legal notice, she typically has30 daysto respond.Court Appointment of Property Expert: If she does not respond, the court may take2-3 monthsto appoint a property expert and proceed with the partition.Partition by Property Experts: Property experts will evaluate the properties and suggest a fair division based on factors such as property value, location, and usage.(2) If She Contests the Partition:Step-by-Step Legal Process:Filing a Partition Suit: You will need to file a partition suit in the appropriate court.Service of Summons: The court will serve a summons to your sister.Discovery Phase: Both parties will exchange relevant documents and information.Trial: If no settlement is reached, the case will go to trial.Judgment: The court will issue a judgment on the partition.Duration: The entire process can take anywhere from6 months to several years, depending on the complexity of the case and court backlog.Basis for Contesting: Your sister may contest the partition based on claims of unfair division, sentimental value, or other personal reasons.(3) Selling Shares Without PartitionYou can sell your shares of the property without a formal partition, but this may lead to legal complications if your sister contests the sale.(4) Probating Your Mother’s WillProbating your mother’s will can help avoid disputes and ensure that her wishes are legally recognized. This process can provide a clear legal framework for the distribution of her assets.(5) Inheritance CertificateThere is no concept of an inheritance certificate in India. You can get a Legal Heir certificate which establish a relation with the deceased.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if you need any clarification."

However, this is not inevitable. The court typically prefers to explore all possible options for an equitable partition before resorting to an auction sale. If the property can be divided in a way that satisfies all parties, the court will usually opt for that solution.2. Yes, providing a legal heir certificate is generally compulsory in partition cases.

    "question": "Parents are deceased and NRI sister does not want to sell the properties",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Considering the issues related to the  inheritance and properties among the siblings which raise  several legal issues, the answer to your queries are as;A] Legal Notice for Property Sale AgreementYou should write a legal notice to your sister stating the legal questions that may arise in the event that the matter is taken to the court and ask her to agree to the sale of the said properties. It would be better that she answer in writing through her legal counsel, which is allowed up to the time of filing a partition. This approach may aid in coming up with a friendly solution to legal problems and minimize an extended trial process.B) Second Legal notice for partitionIn case your sister does not respond positively to the first notice you may go on to a legal notice for partition. Generally your sister should reply to the legal notice in 15 days of its receipt. In the event that she will not answer the complaint, the court can order an assessment of a property regarding division of the land. This process can take some time and normally takes several months to appoint an expert and finalize the partition according to the court’s attendance and the complexity of the case. Property experts will subdivide the residential properties in accordance with the legal papers, ownership ratios, as well as nature of the properties. They will also have to take into account the fair market value as well as the best interest of all the stakeholders.If She Will Challenge the PartitionIn the case where your sister disagrees on the partition, the steps normally followed is to present a suit In the civil court for the partition. The court will then issue the notices and the two parties will present their case to the court. The process may last from one to three years, depending on the case load of the court and the nature of the conflict. There can be possible reason that why your sister is likely resist the partition, she may say the partition should not be done or that she deserves a larger share due to her efforts or the properties do not have to be sold.If you sell property shares without a proper partition then it may turn legal trouble like a conflict with your sister. In this case it is recommended to either get her permission or a court order so as not to encounter any problems. You should take the initiative and probate your mother’s will to avoid further complications and disagreements in case she will challenge the will. It may be necessary to produce an inheritance certificate to prove his/her right to the ownership of the properties especially where there is a dispute over the will or shares of the property.Hope this advice helps in solving your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Parents are deceased and NRI sister does not want to sell the properties",
    "answer": "you need to calm down. when you complain of being insulted, have a look at your comment to me as well. I do not care about your ratings. I answered what was required to be answered. Despite that, I will again respond to some of your irrelevant queries. I cannot see what other lawyers have responded to your query and I am not even concerned. It is highly inappropriate of you of having make a generalised statement about lawyers. If you want respect, be respectful. Don't degrade lawyers in the manner you have sought to do in your remark left in my comment box. :Questions:A). Send a legal notice informing the potential issues of taking it to court and to have her agree that properties can be sold. She agrees that the property can be sold via her own lawyer. Is it ok to do this before we request the court to partition?As before stated you cannot compel your sister to sell her share. If she does not wish to sell her share, nobody can put a gun on her head. So this notice would not be appropriate. However you can have a letter addressed to her that it would be better if the properties are sold amicably, else the matter will have to go to the court, in a partition suit, which will take years to resolve. So try and convince her by saying that it would be in the fitness of things if the properties are sold mutually rather than lock the properties in legal dispute.B) Have a lawyer send a subsequent legal notice for partition, if she ignores option (A).Yes if she does not respond positively to the above letter, then you will have no option but to take legal steps by having a legal notice issued demanding partition of the properties.(1) If she does not contest it, the court will partition based on the advice of property experts.(1 i) Once my sister receives the legal notice how many days should she respond to it?there is no fixed time within which the notice has to be responded. Your lawyer will mention the notice period. Say 2 weeks or 4 weeks. Your sister is not even obligated to reply within that period. If she does not, then you will have to file a partition suit.(1 ii) If she does not respond, how many days does it take for the court to appoint a property expert and partition the land accordingly?this is very difficult to say. You will first file the suit. Then summons will be issued to the defendant sister. Then she will enter appearance and file her defense or written statement. Then the Court will frame issues [points of differences between the parties]. Then the parties will have to lead evidence /testimony. Then there will be final hearing followed by a preliminary decree and then a final decree. After passing of a preliminary decree the court will appoint a court commissioner who will visit the subject properties and file a report in court whether or not the properties are partible. So it is extremely difficult to certainly say how much time all of this will take. And the Indian Courts are slow. I can even say that the entire thing will get done in 1 year. Will you then hold me to my words if there is any delay. That is why I said that such a query is akin to asking a query to some astrologer. Despite that to give you a ballpark estimate, you can consider a minimum of 5 years.(1 iii) How will the property experts partition the residential properties?such properties are generally not partible. That is one cannot physically divide such properties to partition it. So generally such properties are sold in public auction and the sale proceeds are then divided among the parties according to their shares.(2) If she does contest the partition:(2 i) What is the step by step legal process?if your sister contests the partition suit then she will have to file her written statement and then all the steps i described above will happen(2 ii) How long will it take?difficult to answer(2 iii) What is the basis for her to contest the partition?this question does not make any sense. How can it be even predicted? she may come up with the case that the properties are not partible or that they are her own properties and the Plaintiff does not have any right in them. She can come up with any defense under the roof to contest the suit. So it is really not possible to precisely answer as to what will be her basis to contest the suit.(3) Can we sell our shares of the property without a partition & is there a legal ramifications?you can sell your undivided share but the question is, would there be willing buyers? If all the sharers are consenting for the sale then there is no question of any partition.(4) Do we need to probate my mother’s will to avoid my sister contesting the will?probate is not compulsory [ i say this on the strength of section 57 read with section 213 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925. However for all practical purposes if the Will is being set up then it should ideally be probated. If your sister contests the Will then she will have to forego any right that have been given to her under the Will. It would not make sense to contest a Will in which a person has been bequeathed something, unless the person claims that he or she is entitled to the entire thing and not a part of such thing that has been bequeathed under the Will.(5) Do we need an inheritance certificate?if you follow the testamentary succession and have the Will probated then an inheritance or heirship certificate would not be required. An heirship certificate is generally applied for when there is intestate succession i.e. when the person dies without leaving any Will behind.If a Will is set up and it has been acted upon then intestate succession [case in which there is no Will] cannot be then set up.Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Property registration after RERA expired",
    "answer": "1. real estate regulatory authorities (RERA) do not allow extensions for project registration beyond one year. There are further restrictions of not transferring the project to the allottees/association till the promoter obtains the completion/occupancy certificate. The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA) of 2016 allows for a project's registration to be extended in certain circumstances, but not beyond one year.2. Your question is based on some rumors spread by people who do not know the law properly, there is no such thing. Property registration must be completed within four months of executing the sale deed and not from the date of executing the sale agreement.3. Your builder may give some lame excuses which are not maintainable in law4.Without paying the stamp duty the property cannot be registered5. The OC is not a document which is required mandatorily for property registration as its not a document of title evidencing the ownership of the seller instead it is required only if the stamp duty benefit is being claimed on account of old construction. Sometimes, the purchaser takes the benefit/depreciation of the stamp duty in the event of sale of flat of an old building, in such case the Sub-registrar in order to check the veracity of the construction insist on the copy of occupancy certificate or municipal assessment bills.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Property registration after RERA expired",
    "answer": "it is highly unfortunate what has happened to youi think the builder has been fooling youif his rera registration had expired then under the law he could NOT accept any further payments from you unless and until he got his rera registration renewedso the builder could not have collected any payments from you after 30.7.24secondly the builder telling you that the sub-registrar is not registering the agreement for sale because there is no rera registration or that the registration has expired, is complete rubbish. The sub-registrar has under the registration act no such jurisdiction to refuse registration of the agreement due to rera registration having been expired. I would really like to know and I am quite curious under which provision of law did the sub-registrar refuse the registration as there was no rera registrationthirdly the builder is obligated under RERA to compulsorily register an agreement for sale upon receiving 10% of the total sale considerationin your case i believe the builder has illegally accepted more than 10% from you without valid rera registration, and did not bother to enter into and register an agreement for sale with you. Because now he is trapped he has come up with the bogey that the sub-registrar is refusing to register the agreementalso if the agreement for sale is already signed by you then it has to be stamped and registered max within 4 months from the date of signing. The registration of the signed document can be done beyond 4 months also, but subject to max another 4 months, with payment of penalty. I do not know whether or not you have already signed the agreement for sale.your builder telling you that in order to register the agreement within 4 months you should have paid the stamp duty before rera expiry is again complete nonsense. As per the stamp act stamp duty has to be paid before signing or on the date of signing or on the day immediately after the day of signing. I dont know where this payment of duty before rera registration expiry, comes from. It seems the builder has been making his own rules and conning youi do not believe that just on applying for OC your agreement for sale can be registered. In my view your agreement for sale if it is duly signed and stamped, can be registered right away. It has got nothing to do with expiry of rera registration since the sub-registrar has got no power to require renewal of rera registration for registering the agreement for sale. I think if your agreement for sale is registered, then the builder will be exposed that he accepted payments from the flat buyer even after expiry of the rera registration and also he did not bother to register an agreement for sale after having accepted 10% of the total sale price. Both of these are offences under Rera. To cover his faults and guilt, he is cooking up any story before you. Highly unfortunate.Please have a legal notice issued to the builder and then consider filing a RERA complaint [I believe, on a prima facie view, that even if the rera registration has expired, a rera complaint can still be filed, because the project was rera registered. Its just the builder did not bother to renew his registration to save some charges]Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Property registration after RERA expired",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Based on your situation regarding the purchase of a flat and the implications of the RERA expiration, It can be considered that, the builder is right on the mark where he says that you can apply for registration based on the initial down-payment of ₹5 lakhs paid before the RERA is expired, but the expired RERA registration makes things a little tough. Although, you are free to register the property within four months from the agreement, it highly depends with the provisions of RERA because every project must be in compliance with the RERA rules and regulation at the point of registration. The builder’s argument that in order to avail the four months window one has to pay stamp duty is partially correct as while it has to be paid; it does not necessarily have to be paid before the RERA expiration. You can pay the stamp duty after RERA has expired but this may have an implication on the registration. Further, the builder claimed that applying for an Occupancy Certificate (OC) can open the doors for registration, however, the OC has to be approved for registration to take place. Therefore, it would be wise to keep all the communication records with the builder,  consult from an expert lawyer dealing with real estate and RERA and, if needed, you can approach to the RERA authority if the builder does not act to correct the mistake made in the registration process.I hope this advice is fruitful.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "1. As per law, if the RERA expired , then the builder cannot sell and transfer the property , and hence there is lease chances of registration on the ground that the deal was finalized before the expiry.2. As per Section 23 of the Registration Act, the time limit for registration of documents before a Sub-Registrar is four months from the date of execution of the deed.- However, as the builder was registered earlier under the RERA , then in the absence of a valid registration with the RERA , he cannot registered the property in the name of buyer.- Further, in the absence of a RERA registration, you may trouble in future, as builder will not mention in your registration document that he has RERA registration at the time of execution of the deed.3.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Since your father owns an apartment along with your mother, both of them share the ownership as well as responsibilities of the property. In order to ensure you have adequate protection of the ₹ 50 lakhs invested in furniture and interior work, it is advisable to draw the co-ownership agreement regulating rights and use of property, as well as the methods and procedures of solving the arising disputes. If you have reasons to believe that your father’s affair may lead to property claims, then the best thing to do is to ensure you file a partition suit in the civil court. It is also advised to consult a lawyer who has expertise in Property law. The statutes that can be applied in this case are theHindu Succession Actof 1956 the Indian Contract Act of 1872 and theTransfer of Property Actof 1882.

As it is probable that the wall in question is part of the common structure supporting the stairs, their change may adversely affect the stability of the building. As per the regulation of Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 residents cannot do anything that may lead to the deterioration of the infrastructural structure of the building. In addition the change in structure can also require your approval of the Karnataka Municipal Corporation Act. If you are thinking of performing alteration works on the wall, consult a structural engineer to ascertain whether the wall is load bearing or non-load bearing and talk to your neighbours and housing society along with the local municipal authority so as to avert any legal problems.

    "question": "Alimony",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You have the legal right to be granted alimony after your second marriage. your current living status, lack of employment, and your child’s necessity require support. Under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955 both husband and wife can claim maintenance and it is determined by factors like the duration of marriage, financial position of both the parties and the standard of living which had been enjoyed by the couple during the marriage. Although the fact that your husband earns a lot of money can help you get a low alimony, your current complete financial reliance on your husband will work in your favour. The best approach to solve this problem is to explain your need for maintenance to your husband and sue for a reasonable amount. In the case of a deadlock, you can always seek for alimony through a court, this is based on the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 this entitles a claim for maintenance in cases of desertion or appropriate cause of separation. It is also  advisable to hire a family law attorney to help with approaching the legal matters.Hope this advice helps in solving your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,If you want the marriage to be dissolved only a week into the marriage, you can request for an annulment, which basically invalidates the marriage. Annulment is governed by TheHindu Marriage Act, 1955 and can be claimed on reasons of fraud, lack of consent, mental incapacitation or non-performance of marital duty by the other spouse. To begin the process you should seek the services of a divorce lawyer who will help you to file a petition at the right family court. You will need to gather documents which would substantiate your grounds for annulment. The consideration for annulment can be fraud, mental illness, misrepresentation, underage marriage, failure to consummate, impotency, cruelty, polygamy, mental and physical agony. If you choose for annulment, your marriage will considered as it never happened and you can start your new life without any stigma of divorce. It is also advisable to seek the annulment as early as possible as there is certain time limit for filing the petition.Hope you find this advice beneficial.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The sale deed could be valid even with only the seller’s (vendor’s) signature, provided that the document was properly registered. However, the buyer’s signature is now considered an essential part of the process to avoid disputes and ensure that the buyer has explicitly agreed to the terms. A mismatch of signatures is a red flag and could indicate potential forgery or fraud. It’s essential to verify the authenticity of the sale deed by obtaining certified copies from the Sub-Registrar’s office and compare them with the original documents. Ensure that the person who signed the sale deed as the vendor is indeed the authorized representative of the developer. Check for any pending litigation, encumbrances, or other issues related to the property. A title search at the Sub-Registrar’s office is essential.

Karnataka follows the rule of stamp duty of 5% on sale deed value along with a nominal one per cent registration charges for properties.

    "question": "Parents are deceased and NRI sister does not want to sell the properties",
    "answer": "A) Sending a Legal Notice Before Requesting Court PartitionYes, it is generally acceptable to send a legal notice informing your sister of the potential issues of taking the matter to court and suggesting that the properties be sold. If she agrees to sell the property through her own lawyer, this can be done before requesting the court to partition the property. This step can help avoid lengthy legal proceedings and reach an amicable solution.B) Subsequent Legal Notice for PartitionIf your sister ignores the initial legal notice, you can have a lawyer send a subsequent legal notice for partition. Here are the details for this process:(1) If She Does Not Contest the Partition:Response Time: Once your sister receives the legal notice, she typically has30 daysto respond.Court Appointment of Property Expert: If she does not respond, the court may take2-3 monthsto appoint a property expert and proceed with the partition.Partition by Property Experts: Property experts will evaluate the properties and suggest a fair division based on factors such as property value, location, and usage.(2) If She Contests the Partition:Step-by-Step Legal Process:Filing a Partition Suit: You will need to file a partition suit in the appropriate court.Service of Summons: The court will serve a summons to your sister.Discovery Phase: Both parties will exchange relevant documents and information.Trial: If no settlement is reached, the case will go to trial.Judgment: The court will issue a judgment on the partition.Duration: The entire process can take anywhere from6 months to several years, depending on the complexity of the case and court backlog.Basis for Contesting: Your sister may contest the partition based on claims of unfair division, sentimental value, or other personal reasons.(3) Selling Shares Without PartitionYou can sell your shares of the property without a formal partition, but this may lead to legal complications if your sister contests the sale.(4) Probating Your Mother’s WillProbating your mother’s will can help avoid disputes and ensure that her wishes are legally recognized. This process can provide a clear legal framework for the distribution of her assets.(5) Inheritance CertificateThere is no concept of an inheritance certificate in India. You can get a Legal Heir certificate which establish a relation with the deceased.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if you need any clarification."

However, this is not inevitable. The court typically prefers to explore all possible options for an equitable partition before resorting to an auction sale.

    "question": "Parents are deceased and NRI sister does not want to sell the properties",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Considering the issues related to the  inheritance and properties among the siblings which raise  several legal issues, the answer to your queries are as;A] Legal Notice for Property Sale AgreementYou should write a legal notice to your sister stating the legal questions that may arise in the event that the matter is taken to the court and ask her to agree to the sale of the said properties. It would be better that she answer in writing through her legal counsel, which is allowed up to the time of filing a partition. This approach may aid in coming up with a friendly solution to legal problems and minimize an extended trial process.B) Second Legal notice for partitionIn case your sister does not respond positively to the first notice you may go on to a legal notice for partition. Generally your sister should reply to the legal notice in 15 days of its receipt. In the event that she will not answer the complaint, the court can order an assessment of a property regarding division of the land. This process can take some time and normally takes several months to appoint an expert and finalize the partition according to the court’s attendance and the complexity of the case. Property experts will subdivide the residential properties in accordance with the legal papers, ownership ratios, as well as nature of the properties. They will also have to take into account the fair market value as well as the best interest of all the stakeholders.If She Will Challenge the PartitionIn the case where your sister disagrees on the partition, the steps normally followed is to present a suit In the civil court for the partition. The court will then issue the notices and the two parties will present their case to the court. The process may last from one to three years, depending on the case load of the court and the nature of the conflict. There can be possible reason that why your sister is likely resist the partition, she may say the partition should not be done or that she deserves a larger share due to her efforts or the properties do not have to be sold.If you sell property shares without a proper partition then it may turn legal trouble like a conflict with your sister. In this case it is recommended to either get her permission or a court order so as not to encounter any problems. You should take the initiative and probate your mother’s will to avoid further complications and disagreements in case she will challenge the will. It may be necessary to produce an inheritance certificate to prove his/her right to the ownership of the properties especially where there is a dispute over the will or shares of the property.Hope this advice helps in solving your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Parents are deceased and NRI sister does not want to sell the properties",
    "answer": "you need to calm down. when you complain of being insulted, have a look at your comment to me as well. I do not care about your ratings. I answered what was required to be answered. Despite that, I will again respond to some of your irrelevant queries. I cannot see what other lawyers have responded to your query and I am not even concerned. It is highly inappropriate of you of having make a generalised statement about lawyers. If you want respect, be respectful. Don't degrade lawyers in the manner you have sought to do in your remark left in my comment box. :Questions:A). Send a legal notice informing the potential issues of taking it to court and to have her agree that properties can be sold. She agrees that the property can be sold via her own lawyer. Is it ok to do this before we request the court to partition?As before stated you cannot compel your sister to sell her share. If she does not wish to sell her share, nobody can put a gun on her head. So this notice would not be appropriate. However you can have a letter addressed to her that it would be better if the properties are sold amicably, else the matter will have to go to the court, in a partition suit, which will take years to resolve. So try and convince her by saying that it would be in the fitness of things if the properties are sold mutually rather than lock the properties in legal dispute.B) Have a lawyer send a subsequent legal notice for partition, if she ignores option (A).Yes if she does not respond positively to the above letter, then you will have no option but to take legal steps by having a legal notice issued demanding partition of the properties.(1) If she does not contest it, the court will partition based on the advice of property experts.(1 i) Once my sister receives the legal notice how many days should she respond to it?there is no fixed time within which the notice has to be responded. Your lawyer will mention the notice period. Say 2 weeks or 4 weeks. Your sister is not even obligated to reply within that period. If she does not, then you will have to file a partition suit.(1 ii) If she does not respond, how many days does it take for the court to appoint a property expert and partition the land accordingly?this is very difficult to say. You will first file the suit. Then summons will be issued to the defendant sister. Then she will enter appearance and file her defense or written statement. Then the Court will frame issues [points of differences between the parties]. Then the parties will have to lead evidence /testimony. Then there will be final hearing followed by a preliminary decree and then a final decree. After passing of a preliminary decree the court will appoint a court commissioner who will visit the subject properties and file a report in court whether or not the properties are partible. So it is extremely difficult to certainly say how much time all of this will take. And the Indian Courts are slow. I can even say that the entire thing will get done in 1 year. Will you then hold me to my words if there is any delay. That is why I said that such a query is akin to asking a query to some astrologer. Despite that to give you a ballpark estimate, you can consider a minimum of 5 years.(1 iii) How will the property experts partition the residential properties?such properties are generally not partible. That is one cannot physically divide such properties to partition it. So generally such properties are sold in public auction and the sale proceeds are then divided among the parties according to their shares.(2) If she does contest the partition:(2 i) What is the step by step legal process?if your sister contests the partition suit then she will have to file her written statement and then all the steps i described above will happen(2 ii) How long will it take?difficult to answer(2 iii) What is the basis for her to contest the partition?this question does not make any sense. How can it be even predicted? she may come up with the case that the properties are not partible or that they are her own properties and the Plaintiff does not have any right in them. She can come up with any defense under the roof to contest the suit. So it is really not possible to precisely answer as to what will be her basis to contest the suit.(3) Can we sell our shares of the property without a partition & is there a legal ramifications?you can sell your undivided share but the question is, would there be willing buyers? If all the sharers are consenting for the sale then there is no question of any partition.(4) Do we need to probate my mother’s will to avoid my sister contesting the will?probate is not compulsory [ i say this on the strength of section 57 read with section 213 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925. However for all practical purposes if the Will is being set up then it should ideally be probated. If your sister contests the Will then she will have to forego any right that have been given to her under the Will. It would not make sense to contest a Will in which a person has been bequeathed something, unless the person claims that he or she is entitled to the entire thing and not a part of such thing that has been bequeathed under the Will.(5) Do we need an inheritance certificate?if you follow the testamentary succession and have the Will probated then an inheritance or heirship certificate would not be required. An heirship certificate is generally applied for when there is intestate succession i.e. when the person dies without leaving any Will behind.If a Will is set up and it has been acted upon then intestate succession [case in which there is no Will] cannot be then set up.Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Since you have a lease agreement valid until April 15, 2025, the police cannot charge you with criminal trespassing. According to the Section 327 of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (previously,   IPC Section 447) speaks about criminal trespass that when someone enters or remains on another’s property without permission or right. The notice from the owner is invalid because your lease gives you lawful possession therefore, your rights remains that of a tenant. The owner allows you to occupy the property through the lease agreement, therefore cannot unilaterally eject you out of the property without following the right legal processes of evicting you before the agreed time of the lease agreement. Hence you have a right to be in the property and cannot therefore be accused of criminal trespass. A legal practitioner should be consulted to review the lease agreement and facilitate the preparation of the response to the owner’s notice while protecting your tenancy rights.Hope you find this advice beneficial.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Is it legal to incorporate Pvt Limited company which gets 100% profits from stock trading",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the answers of your questions regarding the incorporation of private limited company or LLP for stock trading;1) Yes, one is allowed to incorporate a private limited company or LLP and generate 100% of revenue from stock trading. But there are some conditions which one has to follow or avoid while using it.2) If the company has 50% or more total assets in the form of shares, securities, bonds, etc. and has 50% or more gross income from these financial assets, then it will come under the category of NBFC i.e., Non-Banking Financial Company and it is compulsory to obtain NBFC license from RBI. To get this NBFC license however it is not very easy as there are a lot of regulatory standards that have to be met.3) It is not always beneficial for you from a tax point of view to incorporate a private limited company or LLP. The company, its profits, will be subjected to the corporate tax rate, the current being 25% for small companies while any dividend paid to shareholders will further be charged for taxes. While it is true that some of these may be applicable to an individual and not to a company or corporation.4)Yes, it is allowed to deduct the director’s salary while operating a private limited company. However, the salary should be reasonable and should be equivalent to the salary paid in other similar organizations. From the salary income, taxes will be deducted from the side of the director.5) It is also possible to form an LLP and make profit from stock investing. For tax purposes, LLPs are classified as pass-through entities, and the income is taxed in the hands of the partners. If an LLP does not fall into the above criteria it does not need to hold an NBFC license.6) If the overall profits from stock investment are less then 50%, NBFC license may not be necessary to be obtained. However, it is proper to keep records/documentation in order to support the recognition of income as business income as opposed to being capital gains.It is better to turn to a tax consultant or an attorney who would be familiar with rules and provisions of the finance legislation. The decision to incorporate a company or LLP for trading in stocks depends with the kind of stocks one intends to invest in, and level of risk tolerance that one has.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Is it legal to incorporate Pvt Limited company which gets 100% profits from stock trading",
    "answer": "1. Legality of Owning a Pvt Ltd or LLP for Stock TradingYes, it is legal to own a Pvt Ltd or LLP that derives 100% of its profits from stock trading. However, the company’s Memorandum of Association (MOA) must include stock trading as one of its objectives.2. Requirement for NBFC LicenseIf the primary business of the Pvt Ltd or LLP is stock trading and it involves managing funds from multiple investors, it may be classified as a Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC), which requires an NBFC license from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). However, if you are only using your own and your brother’s money, it might not require an NBFC license.3. Tax Efficiency: Pvt Ltd or LLP vs. Individual AccountPvt Ltd Company: The corporate tax rate for Pvt Ltd companies is generally lower than the highest individual tax rate. For companies with a turnover of up to INR 400 crore, the tax rate is 25%, and for others, it is 30%. Additionally, companies can claim various business expenses, which can reduce taxable income.LLP: LLPs are taxed at a flat rate of 30% plus surcharge and cess as applicable. LLPs also allow for the distribution of profits without additional dividend distribution tax, which can be beneficial.Individual Account: Individuals are taxed based on income slabs, which can go up to 42.7% including surcharge. However, individuals can also claim expenses related to trading under ITR-3.4. Claiming Director’s Salary as ExpenseYes, a Pvt Ltd company can claim the director’s salary as an expense, provided it is reasonable and in line with the company’s financial performance. There are no specific limits on director remuneration for private companies, but it must be approved by the board of directors and comply with the Companies Act, 2013.5. If the profits from stock investments fall under 50% of the total profit, your company may not require an NBFC license. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) generally mandates an NBFC license for companies where financial activities constitute more than 50% of the total assets and income. This is known as the 50-50 test.In your case, if stock trading profits are less than 50% of the total profits, and the financial assets are also less than 50% of the total assets, a Private Limited Company (Pvt Ltd) should be sufficient without needing an NBFC license.Gagandeep Singh ThandiAdvocate, Pathankot68 AnswersTalk to Advocate Gagandeep Singh Thandi"

    "question": "BBMP, BESCOM & BWSSB Officials are refusing to share requested documents when asked via RTI",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The assertion that the owners cannot claim delay period interest since possession was handed over before the RERA Completion date is baseless. The builder got only 25% flats registered in February 2021 and delivered the possessions without basic amenities like lift, electricity, and water supply, respectively. Possession was taken in December 2020 and the Occupancy Certificate (OC) was received only in December 2021 suggesting that the project was not fully ready at the time of delivery. According to section 12 of the RERA Act 2016, the promoter is expected to provide necessities until the maintenance of the premises is taken over by the association of the allottees. The owners should approach the RERA Authority and lodge a complaint with supporting facts of the partially constructed property and delay in getting the OC. In the case of Imperia Structures Ltd. v. Anil Patni the Supreme Court has ruled in favour of the delay period interest as well as the compensation.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,If you want the marriage to be dissolved only a week into the marriage, you can request for an annulment, which basically invalidates the marriage. Annulment is governed by TheHindu Marriage Act, 1955 and can be claimed on reasons of fraud, lack of consent, mental incapacitation or non-performance of marital duty by the other spouse. To begin the process you should seek the services of a divorce lawyer who will help you to file a petition at the right family court. You will need to gather documents which would substantiate your grounds for annulment. The consideration for annulment can be fraud, mental illness, misrepresentation, underage marriage, failure to consummate, impotency, cruelty, polygamy, mental and physical agony. If you choose for annulment, your marriage will considered as it never happened and you can start your new life without any stigma of divorce. It is also advisable to seek the annulment as early as possible as there is certain time limit for filing the petition.Hope you find this advice beneficial.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Parents are deceased and NRI sister does not want to sell the properties",
    "answer": "A) Sending a Legal Notice Before Requesting Court PartitionYes, it is generally acceptable to send a legal notice informing your sister of the potential issues of taking the matter to court and suggesting that the properties be sold. If she agrees to sell the property through her own lawyer, this can be done before requesting the court to partition the property. This step can help avoid lengthy legal proceedings and reach an amicable solution.B) Subsequent Legal Notice for PartitionIf your sister ignores the initial legal notice, you can have a lawyer send a subsequent legal notice for partition. Here are the details for this process:(1) If She Does Not Contest the Partition:Response Time: Once your sister receives the legal notice, she typically has30 daysto respond.Court Appointment of Property Expert: If she does not respond, the court may take2-3 monthsto appoint a property expert and proceed with the partition.Partition by Property Experts: Property experts will evaluate the properties and suggest a fair division based on factors such as property value, location, and usage.(2) If She Contests the Partition:Step-by-Step Legal Process:Filing a Partition Suit: You will need to file a partition suit in the appropriate court.Service of Summons: The court will serve a summons to your sister.Discovery Phase: Both parties will exchange relevant documents and information.Trial: If no settlement is reached, the case will go to trial.Judgment: The court will issue a judgment on the partition.Duration: The entire process can take anywhere from6 months to several years, depending on the complexity of the case and court backlog.Basis for Contesting: Your sister may contest the partition based on claims of unfair division, sentimental value, or other personal reasons.(3) Selling Shares Without PartitionYou can sell your shares of the property without a formal partition, but this may lead to legal complications if your sister contests the sale.(4) Probating Your Mother’s WillProbating your mother’s will can help avoid disputes and ensure that her wishes are legally recognized. This process can provide a clear legal framework for the distribution of her assets.(5) Inheritance CertificateThere is no concept of an inheritance certificate in India.

However, this is not inevitable. The court typically prefers to explore all possible options for an equitable partition before resorting to an auction sale. If the property can be divided in a way that satisfies all parties, the court will usually opt for that solution.2. Yes, providing a legal heir certificate is generally compulsory in partition cases.

    "question": "Parents are deceased and NRI sister does not want to sell the properties",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Considering the issues related to the  inheritance and properties among the siblings which raise  several legal issues, the answer to your queries are as;A] Legal Notice for Property Sale AgreementYou should write a legal notice to your sister stating the legal questions that may arise in the event that the matter is taken to the court and ask her to agree to the sale of the said properties. It would be better that she answer in writing through her legal counsel, which is allowed up to the time of filing a partition. This approach may aid in coming up with a friendly solution to legal problems and minimize an extended trial process.B) Second Legal notice for partitionIn case your sister does not respond positively to the first notice you may go on to a legal notice for partition. Generally your sister should reply to the legal notice in 15 days of its receipt. In the event that she will not answer the complaint, the court can order an assessment of a property regarding division of the land. This process can take some time and normally takes several months to appoint an expert and finalize the partition according to the court’s attendance and the complexity of the case. Property experts will subdivide the residential properties in accordance with the legal papers, ownership ratios, as well as nature of the properties. They will also have to take into account the fair market value as well as the best interest of all the stakeholders.If She Will Challenge the PartitionIn the case where your sister disagrees on the partition, the steps normally followed is to present a suit In the civil court for the partition. The court will then issue the notices and the two parties will present their case to the court. The process may last from one to three years, depending on the case load of the court and the nature of the conflict. There can be possible reason that why your sister is likely resist the partition, she may say the partition should not be done or that she deserves a larger share due to her efforts or the properties do not have to be sold.If you sell property shares without a proper partition then it may turn legal trouble like a conflict with your sister. In this case it is recommended to either get her permission or a court order so as not to encounter any problems. You should take the initiative and probate your mother’s will to avoid further complications and disagreements in case she will challenge the will. It may be necessary to produce an inheritance certificate to prove his/her right to the ownership of the properties especially where there is a dispute over the will or shares of the property.Hope this advice helps in solving your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "you need to calm down. when you complain of being insulted, have a look at your comment to me as well. I do not care about your ratings. I answered what was required to be answered. Despite that, I will again respond to some of your irrelevant queries. I cannot see what other lawyers have responded to your query and I am not even concerned. It is highly inappropriate of you of having make a generalised statement about lawyers. If you want respect, be respectful. Don't degrade lawyers in the manner you have sought to do in your remark left in my comment box. :Questions:A). Send a legal notice informing the potential issues of taking it to court and to have her agree that properties can be sold. She agrees that the property can be sold via her own lawyer. Is it ok to do this before we request the court to partition?As before stated you cannot compel your sister to sell her share. If she does not wish to sell her share, nobody can put a gun on her head. So this notice would not be appropriate. However you can have a letter addressed to her that it would be better if the properties are sold amicably, else the matter will have to go to the court, in a partition suit, which will take years to resolve. So try and convince her by saying that it would be in the fitness of things if the properties are sold mutually rather than lock the properties in legal dispute.B) Have a lawyer send a subsequent legal notice for partition, if she ignores option (A).Yes if she does not respond positively to the above letter, then you will have no option but to take legal steps by having a legal notice issued demanding partition of the properties.(1) If she does not contest it, the court will partition based on the advice of property experts.(1 i) Once my sister receives the legal notice how many days should she respond to it?there is no fixed time within which the notice has to be responded. Your lawyer will mention the notice period. Say 2 weeks or 4 weeks. Your sister is not even obligated to reply within that period. If she does not, then you will have to file a partition suit.(1 ii) If she does not respond, how many days does it take for the court to appoint a property expert and partition the land accordingly?this is very difficult to say. You will first file the suit. Then summons will be issued to the defendant sister. Then she will enter appearance and file her defense or written statement. Then the Court will frame issues [points of differences between the parties]. Then the parties will have to lead evidence /testimony. Then there will be final hearing followed by a preliminary decree and then a final decree. After passing of a preliminary decree the court will appoint a court commissioner who will visit the subject properties and file a report in court whether or not the properties are partible. So it is extremely difficult to certainly say how much time all of this will take. And the Indian Courts are slow. I can even say that the entire thing will get done in 1 year. Will you then hold me to my words if there is any delay. That is why I said that such a query is akin to asking a query to some astrologer. Despite that to give you a ballpark estimate, you can consider a minimum of 5 years.(1 iii) How will the property experts partition the residential properties?such properties are generally not partible. That is one cannot physically divide such properties to partition it. So generally such properties are sold in public auction and the sale proceeds are then divided among the parties according to their shares.(2) If she does contest the partition:(2 i) What is the step by step legal process?if your sister contests the partition suit then she will have to file her written statement and then all the steps i described above will happen(2 ii) How long will it take?difficult to answer(2 iii) What is the basis for her to contest the partition?this question does not make any sense. How can it be even predicted? she may come up with the case that the properties are not partible or that they are her own properties and the Plaintiff does not have any right in them. She can come up with any defense under the roof to contest the suit. So it is really not possible to precisely answer as to what will be her basis to contest the suit.(3) Can we sell our shares of the property without a partition & is there a legal ramifications?you can sell your undivided share but the question is, would there be willing buyers? If all the sharers are consenting for the sale then there is no question of any partition.(4) Do we need to probate my mother’s will to avoid my sister contesting the will?probate is not compulsory [ i say this on the strength of section 57 read with section 213 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925. However for all practical purposes if the Will is being set up then it should ideally be probated. If your sister contests the Will then she will have to forego any right that have been given to her under the Will. It would not make sense to contest a Will in which a person has been bequeathed something, unless the person claims that he or she is entitled to the entire thing and not a part of such thing that has been bequeathed under the Will.(5) Do we need an inheritance certificate?if you follow the testamentary succession and have the Will probated then an inheritance or heirship certificate would not be required. An heirship certificate is generally applied for when there is intestate succession i.e. when the person dies without leaving any Will behind.If a Will is set up and it has been acted upon then intestate succession [case in which there is no Will] cannot be then set up.Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The father is entitled to some rights in regard to the child, according to the divorce determination and the custody of the mother. The restraining order that prevented the petitioner from having any contact with the children was made without a full blown hearing, thereby cannot replace the existing decree. He can claim he has a right to access the child at her house probably owing to the fact that the mother is failing in providing proper care as evidenced by her leaving the child at the grandparent’s house. The father should file an application in the High Court stating that he should visit his child because it is unjust for a child not to have contact with a caring parent. The laws like the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 and the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 says that child’s best interest which supports the father to access his child.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Since you have a lease agreement valid until April 15, 2025, the police cannot charge you with criminal trespassing. According to the Section 327 of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (previously,   IPC Section 447) speaks about criminal trespass that when someone enters or remains on another’s property without permission or right. The notice from the owner is invalid because your lease gives you lawful possession therefore, your rights remains that of a tenant. The owner allows you to occupy the property through the lease agreement, therefore cannot unilaterally eject you out of the property without following the right legal processes of evicting you before the agreed time of the lease agreement. Hence you have a right to be in the property and cannot therefore be accused of criminal trespass. A legal practitioner should be consulted to review the lease agreement and facilitate the preparation of the response to the owner’s notice while protecting your tenancy rights.Hope you find this advice beneficial.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Ancestral  property: Maternal grandfather's property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The property you fully own is not considered ancestral property and is not liable to be partitioned by your grandchildren. Ancestral property, under Hindu law, is typically property that has been passed down undivided through four generations of male lineage. However, the property in question was originally owned by your maternal grandfather, transferred to your maternal grandmother, and then passed down through wills to your mother and eventually to you. Since the property was distributed through wills and a gift deed, it is treated as self-acquired property in your hands. Therefore, your grandchildren cannot claim a right to partition it as ancestral property under theHindu Succession Act, 1956.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,You have the right to seek the costs the court met out to your wife for the delay in the proceedings which the court is entitled to impose under Section 35 of the CPC so as to minimize delays and avoid hinderance of judicial processes. To my understanding, the oral submission made by your wife’s advocate suggesting that payment of costs is not compulsory is wrong; once the costs have been ordered the parties are legally entitled to pay. The court cannot punish the refusing party for their refusal to proceed with the cross-examination until the costs awarded by the court are paid, as you have the right to demand payment first. Imposing costs are done for compliance with the court orders and non-payment affects the authority of the court. The expected outcome of a reserved Order should be in your favour because the court will order your wife to honour the Order and pay the outstanding costs before the continuation of the proceedings. In general, you have solid grounds for insisting on following the court order concerning costs.Hope this answer solves your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

According to the Section 327 of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (previously,   IPC Section 447) speaks about criminal trespass that when someone enters or remains on another’s property without permission or right. The notice from the owner is invalid because your lease gives you lawful possession therefore, your rights remains that of a tenant. The owner allows you to occupy the property through the lease agreement, therefore cannot unilaterally eject you out of the property without following the right legal processes of evicting you before the agreed time of the lease agreement. Hence you have a right to be in the property and cannot therefore be accused of criminal trespass. A legal practitioner should be consulted to review the lease agreement and facilitate the preparation of the response to the owner’s notice while protecting your tenancy rights.Hope you find this advice beneficial.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In addition the change in structure can also require your approval of the Karnataka Municipal Corporation Act.

    "answer": "Dear Client,It will be interesting to note that installation of an embedded shoe rack within a kitchen wall and without frames for holding it together does not necessarily involve the need for formal permits under RERA or under the Act of KMC. This is categorized as non-structural alteration. The law does not compel changes without a housing society, if interior changes do not extend to the common areas or the structure of the building. It could be noted that the embedded shoe rack construction work can hardly be a subject to obtain formal permissions, however, for safety concerns it has become still advisable to consult a structural engineer as well as to follow the local bylaws and regulations.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "I want to cancel my marriage - it’s been 15 days only",
    "answer": "Dear Client,If you want the marriage to be dissolved only a week into the marriage, you can request for an annulment, which basically invalidates the marriage. Annulment is governed by TheHindu Marriage Act, 1955 and can be claimed on reasons of fraud, lack of consent, mental incapacitation or non-performance of marital duty by the other spouse. To begin the process you should seek the services of a divorce lawyer who will help you to file a petition at the right family court. You will need to gather documents which would substantiate your grounds for annulment. The consideration for annulment can be fraud, mental illness, misrepresentation, underage marriage, failure to consummate, impotency, cruelty, polygamy, mental and physical agony. If you choose for annulment, your marriage will considered as it never happened and you can start your new life without any stigma of divorce. It is also advisable to seek the annulment as early as possible as there is certain time limit for filing the petition.Hope you find this advice beneficial.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The father is entitled to some rights in regard to the child, according to the divorce determination and the custody of the mother. The restraining order that prevented the petitioner from having any contact with the children was made without a full blown hearing, thereby cannot replace the existing decree. He can claim he has a right to access the child at her house probably owing to the fact that the mother is failing in providing proper care as evidenced by her leaving the child at the grandparent’s house. The father should file an application in the High Court stating that he should visit his child because it is unjust for a child not to have contact with a caring parent. The laws like the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 and the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 says that child’s best interest which supports the father to access his child.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,You have the right to seek the costs the court met out to your wife for the delay in the proceedings which the court is entitled to impose under Section 35 of the CPC so as to minimize delays and avoid hinderance of judicial processes. To my understanding, the oral submission made by your wife’s advocate suggesting that payment of costs is not compulsory is wrong; once the costs have been ordered the parties are legally entitled to pay. The court cannot punish the refusing party for their refusal to proceed with the cross-examination until the costs awarded by the court are paid, as you have the right to demand payment first. Imposing costs are done for compliance with the court orders and non-payment affects the authority of the court. The expected outcome of a reserved Order should be in your favour because the court will order your wife to honour the Order and pay the outstanding costs before the continuation of the proceedings. In general, you have solid grounds for insisting on following the court order concerning costs.Hope this answer solves your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It could be noted that the embedded shoe rack construction work can hardly be a subject to obtain formal permissions, however, for safety concerns it has become still advisable to consult a structural engineer as well as to follow the local bylaws and regulations.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If you choose for annulment, your marriage will considered as it never happened and you can start your new life without any stigma of divorce. It is also advisable to seek the annulment as early as possible as there is certain time limit for filing the petition.Hope you find this advice beneficial.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Parents are deceased and NRI sister does not want to sell the properties",
    "answer": "A) Sending a Legal Notice Before Requesting Court PartitionYes, it is generally acceptable to send a legal notice informing your sister of the potential issues of taking the matter to court and suggesting that the properties be sold. If she agrees to sell the property through her own lawyer, this can be done before requesting the court to partition the property. This step can help avoid lengthy legal proceedings and reach an amicable solution.B) Subsequent Legal Notice for PartitionIf your sister ignores the initial legal notice, you can have a lawyer send a subsequent legal notice for partition. Here are the details for this process:(1) If She Does Not Contest the Partition:Response Time: Once your sister receives the legal notice, she typically has30 daysto respond.Court Appointment of Property Expert: If she does not respond, the court may take2-3 monthsto appoint a property expert and proceed with the partition.Partition by Property Experts: Property experts will evaluate the properties and suggest a fair division based on factors such as property value, location, and usage.(2) If She Contests the Partition:Step-by-Step Legal Process:Filing a Partition Suit: You will need to file a partition suit in the appropriate court.Service of Summons: The court will serve a summons to your sister.Discovery Phase: Both parties will exchange relevant documents and information.Trial: If no settlement is reached, the case will go to trial.Judgment: The court will issue a judgment on the partition.Duration: The entire process can take anywhere from6 months to several years, depending on the complexity of the case and court backlog.Basis for Contesting: Your sister may contest the partition based on claims of unfair division, sentimental value, or other personal reasons.(3) Selling Shares Without PartitionYou can sell your shares of the property without a formal partition, but this may lead to legal complications if your sister contests the sale.(4) Probating Your Mother’s WillProbating your mother’s will can help avoid disputes and ensure that her wishes are legally recognized. This process can provide a clear legal framework for the distribution of her assets.(5) Inheritance CertificateThere is no concept of an inheritance certificate in India. You can get a Legal Heir certificate which establish a relation with the deceased.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if you need any clarification."

However, this is not inevitable. The court typically prefers to explore all possible options for an equitable partition before resorting to an auction sale. If the property can be divided in a way that satisfies all parties, the court will usually opt for that solution.2. Yes, providing a legal heir certificate is generally compulsory in partition cases. The legal heir certificate is used to establish the rightful heirs of the deceased and their respective shares in the property.

    "question": "Parents are deceased and NRI sister does not want to sell the properties",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Considering the issues related to the  inheritance and properties among the siblings which raise  several legal issues, the answer to your queries are as;A] Legal Notice for Property Sale AgreementYou should write a legal notice to your sister stating the legal questions that may arise in the event that the matter is taken to the court and ask her to agree to the sale of the said properties. It would be better that she answer in writing through her legal counsel, which is allowed up to the time of filing a partition. This approach may aid in coming up with a friendly solution to legal problems and minimize an extended trial process.B) Second Legal notice for partitionIn case your sister does not respond positively to the first notice you may go on to a legal notice for partition. Generally your sister should reply to the legal notice in 15 days of its receipt. In the event that she will not answer the complaint, the court can order an assessment of a property regarding division of the land. This process can take some time and normally takes several months to appoint an expert and finalize the partition according to the court’s attendance and the complexity of the case. Property experts will subdivide the residential properties in accordance with the legal papers, ownership ratios, as well as nature of the properties. They will also have to take into account the fair market value as well as the best interest of all the stakeholders.If She Will Challenge the PartitionIn the case where your sister disagrees on the partition, the steps normally followed is to present a suit In the civil court for the partition. The court will then issue the notices and the two parties will present their case to the court. The process may last from one to three years, depending on the case load of the court and the nature of the conflict. There can be possible reason that why your sister is likely resist the partition, she may say the partition should not be done or that she deserves a larger share due to her efforts or the properties do not have to be sold.If you sell property shares without a proper partition then it may turn legal trouble like a conflict with your sister. In this case it is recommended to either get her permission or a court order so as not to encounter any problems. You should take the initiative and probate your mother’s will to avoid further complications and disagreements in case she will challenge the will. It may be necessary to produce an inheritance certificate to prove his/her right to the ownership of the properties especially where there is a dispute over the will or shares of the property.Hope this advice helps in solving your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Parents are deceased and NRI sister does not want to sell the properties",
    "answer": "you need to calm down. when you complain of being insulted, have a look at your comment to me as well. I do not care about your ratings. I answered what was required to be answered. Despite that, I will again respond to some of your irrelevant queries. I cannot see what other lawyers have responded to your query and I am not even concerned. It is highly inappropriate of you of having make a generalised statement about lawyers. If you want respect, be respectful. Don't degrade lawyers in the manner you have sought to do in your remark left in my comment box. :Questions:A). Send a legal notice informing the potential issues of taking it to court and to have her agree that properties can be sold. She agrees that the property can be sold via her own lawyer. Is it ok to do this before we request the court to partition?As before stated you cannot compel your sister to sell her share. If she does not wish to sell her share, nobody can put a gun on her head. So this notice would not be appropriate. However you can have a letter addressed to her that it would be better if the properties are sold amicably, else the matter will have to go to the court, in a partition suit, which will take years to resolve. So try and convince her by saying that it would be in the fitness of things if the properties are sold mutually rather than lock the properties in legal dispute.B) Have a lawyer send a subsequent legal notice for partition, if she ignores option (A).Yes if she does not respond positively to the above letter, then you will have no option but to take legal steps by having a legal notice issued demanding partition of the properties.(1) If she does not contest it, the court will partition based on the advice of property experts.(1 i) Once my sister receives the legal notice how many days should she respond to it?there is no fixed time within which the notice has to be responded. Your lawyer will mention the notice period. Say 2 weeks or 4 weeks. Your sister is not even obligated to reply within that period. If she does not, then you will have to file a partition suit.(1 ii) If she does not respond, how many days does it take for the court to appoint a property expert and partition the land accordingly?this is very difficult to say. You will first file the suit. Then summons will be issued to the defendant sister. Then she will enter appearance and file her defense or written statement. Then the Court will frame issues [points of differences between the parties]. Then the parties will have to lead evidence /testimony. Then there will be final hearing followed by a preliminary decree and then a final decree. After passing of a preliminary decree the court will appoint a court commissioner who will visit the subject properties and file a report in court whether or not the properties are partible. So it is extremely difficult to certainly say how much time all of this will take. And the Indian Courts are slow. I can even say that the entire thing will get done in 1 year. Will you then hold me to my words if there is any delay. That is why I said that such a query is akin to asking a query to some astrologer. Despite that to give you a ballpark estimate, you can consider a minimum of 5 years.(1 iii) How will the property experts partition the residential properties?such properties are generally not partible. That is one cannot physically divide such properties to partition it. So generally such properties are sold in public auction and the sale proceeds are then divided among the parties according to their shares.(2) If she does contest the partition:(2 i) What is the step by step legal process?if your sister contests the partition suit then she will have to file her written statement and then all the steps i described above will happen(2 ii) How long will it take?difficult to answer(2 iii) What is the basis for her to contest the partition?this question does not make any sense. How can it be even predicted? she may come up with the case that the properties are not partible or that they are her own properties and the Plaintiff does not have any right in them. She can come up with any defense under the roof to contest the suit. So it is really not possible to precisely answer as to what will be her basis to contest the suit.(3) Can we sell our shares of the property without a partition & is there a legal ramifications?you can sell your undivided share but the question is, would there be willing buyers? If all the sharers are consenting for the sale then there is no question of any partition.(4) Do we need to probate my mother’s will to avoid my sister contesting the will?probate is not compulsory [ i say this on the strength of section 57 read with section 213 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925. However for all practical purposes if the Will is being set up then it should ideally be probated. If your sister contests the Will then she will have to forego any right that have been given to her under the Will. It would not make sense to contest a Will in which a person has been bequeathed something, unless the person claims that he or she is entitled to the entire thing and not a part of such thing that has been bequeathed under the Will.(5) Do we need an inheritance certificate?if you follow the testamentary succession and have the Will probated then an inheritance or heirship certificate would not be required. An heirship certificate is generally applied for when there is intestate succession i.e. when the person dies without leaving any Will behind.If a Will is set up and it has been acted upon then intestate succession [case in which there is no Will] cannot be then set up.Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The father is entitled to some rights in regard to the child, according to the divorce determination and the custody of the mother. The restraining order that prevented the petitioner from having any contact with the children was made without a full blown hearing, thereby cannot replace the existing decree. He can claim he has a right to access the child at her house probably owing to the fact that the mother is failing in providing proper care as evidenced by her leaving the child at the grandparent’s house. The father should file an application in the High Court stating that he should visit his child because it is unjust for a child not to have contact with a caring parent. The laws like the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 and the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 says that child’s best interest which supports the father to access his child.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,There is no limitation period prescribed by the Supreme Court of India in case, where an individual wants to file an appeal against a High Court order which was passed in December 2023. But it is always best to file the SLP as soon as possible to not complicate the legal proceedings. In case the order is appealable under the Civil Procedure Code (CPC), you can consider an appeal under Order 43.

    "question": "Regarding non-payment of cost",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You have the right to seek the costs the court met out to your wife for the delay in the proceedings which the court is entitled to impose under Section 35 of the CPC so as to minimize delays and avoid hinderance of judicial processes. To my understanding, the oral submission made by your wife’s advocate suggesting that payment of costs is not compulsory is wrong; once the costs have been ordered the parties are legally entitled to pay. The court cannot punish the refusing party for their refusal to proceed with the cross-examination until the costs awarded by the court are paid, as you have the right to demand payment first. Imposing costs are done for compliance with the court orders and non-payment affects the authority of the court. The expected outcome of a reserved Order should be in your favour because the court will order your wife to honour the Order and pay the outstanding costs before the continuation of the proceedings. In general, you have solid grounds for insisting on following the court order concerning costs.Hope this answer solves your problem.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

As per the regulation of Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 residents cannot do anything that may lead to the deterioration of the infrastructural structure of the building. In addition the change in structure can also require your approval of the Karnataka Municipal Corporation Act. If you are thinking of performing alteration works on the wall, consult a structural engineer to ascertain whether the wall is load bearing or non-load bearing and talk to your neighbours and housing society along with the local municipal authority so as to avert any legal problems.

    "answer": "A) Sending a Legal Notice Before Requesting Court PartitionYes, it is generally acceptable to send a legal notice informing your sister of the potential issues of taking the matter to court and suggesting that the properties be sold. If she agrees to sell the property through her own lawyer, this can be done before requesting the court to partition the property. This step can help avoid lengthy legal proceedings and reach an amicable solution.B) Subsequent Legal Notice for PartitionIf your sister ignores the initial legal notice, you can have a lawyer send a subsequent legal notice for partition. Here are the details for this process:(1) If She Does Not Contest the Partition:Response Time: Once your sister receives the legal notice, she typically has30 daysto respond.Court Appointment of Property Expert: If she does not respond, the court may take2-3 monthsto appoint a property expert and proceed with the partition.Partition by Property Experts: Property experts will evaluate the properties and suggest a fair division based on factors such as property value, location, and usage.(2) If She Contests the Partition:Step-by-Step Legal Process:Filing a Partition Suit: You will need to file a partition suit in the appropriate court.Service of Summons: The court will serve a summons to your sister.Discovery Phase: Both parties will exchange relevant documents and information.Trial: If no settlement is reached, the case will go to trial.Judgment: The court will issue a judgment on the partition.Duration: The entire process can take anywhere from6 months to several years, depending on the complexity of the case and court backlog.Basis for Contesting: Your sister may contest the partition based on claims of unfair division, sentimental value, or other personal reasons.(3) Selling Shares Without PartitionYou can sell your shares of the property without a formal partition, but this may lead to legal complications if your sister contests the sale.(4) Probating Your Mother’s WillProbating your mother’s will can help avoid disputes and ensure that her wishes are legally recognized.

However, this is not inevitable. The court typically prefers to explore all possible options for an equitable partition before resorting to an auction sale. If the property can be divided in a way that satisfies all parties, the court will usually opt for that solution.2. Yes, providing a legal heir certificate is generally compulsory in partition cases.

    "question": "Parents are deceased and NRI sister does not want to sell the properties",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Considering the issues related to the  inheritance and properties among the siblings which raise  several legal issues, the answer to your queries are as;A] Legal Notice for Property Sale AgreementYou should write a legal notice to your sister stating the legal questions that may arise in the event that the matter is taken to the court and ask her to agree to the sale of the said properties. It would be better that she answer in writing through her legal counsel, which is allowed up to the time of filing a partition. This approach may aid in coming up with a friendly solution to legal problems and minimize an extended trial process.B) Second Legal notice for partitionIn case your sister does not respond positively to the first notice you may go on to a legal notice for partition. Generally your sister should reply to the legal notice in 15 days of its receipt. In the event that she will not answer the complaint, the court can order an assessment of a property regarding division of the land. This process can take some time and normally takes several months to appoint an expert and finalize the partition according to the court’s attendance and the complexity of the case. Property experts will subdivide the residential properties in accordance with the legal papers, ownership ratios, as well as nature of the properties. They will also have to take into account the fair market value as well as the best interest of all the stakeholders.If She Will Challenge the PartitionIn the case where your sister disagrees on the partition, the steps normally followed is to present a suit In the civil court for the partition. The court will then issue the notices and the two parties will present their case to the court. The process may last from one to three years, depending on the case load of the court and the nature of the conflict. There can be possible reason that why your sister is likely resist the partition, she may say the partition should not be done or that she deserves a larger share due to her efforts or the properties do not have to be sold.If you sell property shares without a proper partition then it may turn legal trouble like a conflict with your sister. In this case it is recommended to either get her permission or a court order so as not to encounter any problems. You should take the initiative and probate your mother’s will to avoid further complications and disagreements in case she will challenge the will. It may be necessary to produce an inheritance certificate to prove his/her right to the ownership of the properties especially where there is a dispute over the will or shares of the property.Hope this advice helps in solving your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "you need to calm down. when you complain of being insulted, have a look at your comment to me as well. I do not care about your ratings. I answered what was required to be answered. Despite that, I will again respond to some of your irrelevant queries. I cannot see what other lawyers have responded to your query and I am not even concerned. It is highly inappropriate of you of having make a generalised statement about lawyers. If you want respect, be respectful. Don't degrade lawyers in the manner you have sought to do in your remark left in my comment box. :Questions:A). Send a legal notice informing the potential issues of taking it to court and to have her agree that properties can be sold. She agrees that the property can be sold via her own lawyer. Is it ok to do this before we request the court to partition?As before stated you cannot compel your sister to sell her share. If she does not wish to sell her share, nobody can put a gun on her head. So this notice would not be appropriate. However you can have a letter addressed to her that it would be better if the properties are sold amicably, else the matter will have to go to the court, in a partition suit, which will take years to resolve. So try and convince her by saying that it would be in the fitness of things if the properties are sold mutually rather than lock the properties in legal dispute.B) Have a lawyer send a subsequent legal notice for partition, if she ignores option (A).Yes if she does not respond positively to the above letter, then you will have no option but to take legal steps by having a legal notice issued demanding partition of the properties.(1) If she does not contest it, the court will partition based on the advice of property experts.(1 i) Once my sister receives the legal notice how many days should she respond to it?there is no fixed time within which the notice has to be responded. Your lawyer will mention the notice period. Say 2 weeks or 4 weeks. Your sister is not even obligated to reply within that period. If she does not, then you will have to file a partition suit.(1 ii) If she does not respond, how many days does it take for the court to appoint a property expert and partition the land accordingly?this is very difficult to say. You will first file the suit. Then summons will be issued to the defendant sister. Then she will enter appearance and file her defense or written statement. Then the Court will frame issues [points of differences between the parties]. Then the parties will have to lead evidence /testimony. Then there will be final hearing followed by a preliminary decree and then a final decree. After passing of a preliminary decree the court will appoint a court commissioner who will visit the subject properties and file a report in court whether or not the properties are partible. So it is extremely difficult to certainly say how much time all of this will take. And the Indian Courts are slow. I can even say that the entire thing will get done in 1 year. Will you then hold me to my words if there is any delay. That is why I said that such a query is akin to asking a query to some astrologer. Despite that to give you a ballpark estimate, you can consider a minimum of 5 years.(1 iii) How will the property experts partition the residential properties?such properties are generally not partible. That is one cannot physically divide such properties to partition it. So generally such properties are sold in public auction and the sale proceeds are then divided among the parties according to their shares.(2) If she does contest the partition:(2 i) What is the step by step legal process?if your sister contests the partition suit then she will have to file her written statement and then all the steps i described above will happen(2 ii) How long will it take?difficult to answer(2 iii) What is the basis for her to contest the partition?this question does not make any sense. How can it be even predicted? she may come up with the case that the properties are not partible or that they are her own properties and the Plaintiff does not have any right in them. She can come up with any defense under the roof to contest the suit. So it is really not possible to precisely answer as to what will be her basis to contest the suit.(3) Can we sell our shares of the property without a partition & is there a legal ramifications?you can sell your undivided share but the question is, would there be willing buyers? If all the sharers are consenting for the sale then there is no question of any partition.(4) Do we need to probate my mother’s will to avoid my sister contesting the will?probate is not compulsory [ i say this on the strength of section 57 read with section 213 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925. However for all practical purposes if the Will is being set up then it should ideally be probated. If your sister contests the Will then she will have to forego any right that have been given to her under the Will. It would not make sense to contest a Will in which a person has been bequeathed something, unless the person claims that he or she is entitled to the entire thing and not a part of such thing that has been bequeathed under the Will.(5) Do we need an inheritance certificate?if you follow the testamentary succession and have the Will probated then an inheritance or heirship certificate would not be required. An heirship certificate is generally applied for when there is intestate succession i.e. when the person dies without leaving any Will behind.If a Will is set up and it has been acted upon then intestate succession [case in which there is no Will] cannot be then set up.Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The father is entitled to some rights in regard to the child, according to the divorce determination and the custody of the mother. The restraining order that prevented the petitioner from having any contact with the children was made without a full blown hearing, thereby cannot replace the existing decree. He can claim he has a right to access the child at her house probably owing to the fact that the mother is failing in providing proper care as evidenced by her leaving the child at the grandparent’s house. The father should file an application in the High Court stating that he should visit his child because it is unjust for a child not to have contact with a caring parent. The laws like the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 and the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 says that child’s best interest which supports the father to access his child.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

They also cannot make you sign the DA without offering some crucial information like the plans for your new apartment. In the approval process of the redevelopment, the specific rules are stated in the Government Resolution dated January 3, 2009, that require active involvement of members in the decision-making process. For the implementation of the tender points you can demand a Special General Meeting (SGM) to talk about the changes and share the concern with every member. If the committee has not stopped ignoring your contributions, it may be advisable that you sent a legal notice explaining your problems and demanding compliance with the initial provision of the tender offer. It is also advisable that you consult a lawyer who deals in cooperative housing societies matters and who can help you in the filing of a complaint with the Registrar of Cooperative Societies may be taken.Hope this advice helps in solving your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This meeting can be called by a certain percentage of members as per your society’s bylaws.File a Complaint with the Registrar: If the managing committee is not adhering to the directives and is making changes that are not in the members’ best interests, you can file a complaint with the Registrar of Co-operative Societies. The Registrar has the authority to intervene and ensure compliance with the directives.Mediation: Sometimes, mediation can be a less confrontational way to resolve disputes.

    "question": "Is it legal to incorporate Pvt Limited company which gets 100% profits from stock trading",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the answers of your questions regarding the incorporation of private limited company or LLP for stock trading;1) Yes, one is allowed to incorporate a private limited company or LLP and generate 100% of revenue from stock trading. But there are some conditions which one has to follow or avoid while using it.2) If the company has 50% or more total assets in the form of shares, securities, bonds, etc. and has 50% or more gross income from these financial assets, then it will come under the category of NBFC i.e., Non-Banking Financial Company and it is compulsory to obtain NBFC license from RBI. To get this NBFC license however it is not very easy as there are a lot of regulatory standards that have to be met.3) It is not always beneficial for you from a tax point of view to incorporate a private limited company or LLP. The company, its profits, will be subjected to the corporate tax rate, the current being 25% for small companies while any dividend paid to shareholders will further be charged for taxes. While it is true that some of these may be applicable to an individual and not to a company or corporation.4)Yes, it is allowed to deduct the director’s salary while operating a private limited company. However, the salary should be reasonable and should be equivalent to the salary paid in other similar organizations. From the salary income, taxes will be deducted from the side of the director.5) It is also possible to form an LLP and make profit from stock investing. For tax purposes, LLPs are classified as pass-through entities, and the income is taxed in the hands of the partners. If an LLP does not fall into the above criteria it does not need to hold an NBFC license.6) If the overall profits from stock investment are less then 50%, NBFC license may not be necessary to be obtained. However, it is proper to keep records/documentation in order to support the recognition of income as business income as opposed to being capital gains.It is better to turn to a tax consultant or an attorney who would be familiar with rules and provisions of the finance legislation. The decision to incorporate a company or LLP for trading in stocks depends with the kind of stocks one intends to invest in, and level of risk tolerance that one has.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Is it legal to incorporate Pvt Limited company which gets 100% profits from stock trading",
    "answer": "1. Legality of Owning a Pvt Ltd or LLP for Stock TradingYes, it is legal to own a Pvt Ltd or LLP that derives 100% of its profits from stock trading. However, the company’s Memorandum of Association (MOA) must include stock trading as one of its objectives.2. Requirement for NBFC LicenseIf the primary business of the Pvt Ltd or LLP is stock trading and it involves managing funds from multiple investors, it may be classified as a Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC), which requires an NBFC license from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). However, if you are only using your own and your brother’s money, it might not require an NBFC license.3. Tax Efficiency: Pvt Ltd or LLP vs. Individual AccountPvt Ltd Company: The corporate tax rate for Pvt Ltd companies is generally lower than the highest individual tax rate. For companies with a turnover of up to INR 400 crore, the tax rate is 25%, and for others, it is 30%. Additionally, companies can claim various business expenses, which can reduce taxable income.LLP: LLPs are taxed at a flat rate of 30% plus surcharge and cess as applicable. LLPs also allow for the distribution of profits without additional dividend distribution tax, which can be beneficial.Individual Account: Individuals are taxed based on income slabs, which can go up to 42.7% including surcharge. However, individuals can also claim expenses related to trading under ITR-3.4. Claiming Director’s Salary as ExpenseYes, a Pvt Ltd company can claim the director’s salary as an expense, provided it is reasonable and in line with the company’s financial performance. There are no specific limits on director remuneration for private companies, but it must be approved by the board of directors and comply with the Companies Act, 2013.5. If the profits from stock investments fall under 50% of the total profit, your company may not require an NBFC license. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) generally mandates an NBFC license for companies where financial activities constitute more than 50% of the total assets and income. This is known as the 50-50 test.In your case, if stock trading profits are less than 50% of the total profits, and the financial assets are also less than 50% of the total assets, a Private Limited Company (Pvt Ltd) should be sufficient without needing an NBFC license.Gagandeep Singh ThandiAdvocate, Pathankot68 AnswersTalk to Advocate Gagandeep Singh Thandi"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Section 45(I) of the RBI Act notes that private limited companies can do financial business without an NBFC license provided the company is doing more than 50% of its business in the financial line. But if the company is involved in stock broking and does not involve in lending business or any other financial service then, it could not be categorized as NBFC. Under the Companies Act, 2013 it is legal for the private limited companies to invest in share market with certain regulations such as record-keeping, audit, and following corporate regulations. A tax on the gains made in stock trading may be charged in form capital gains tax. To ensure it is followed we suggest that activities should be well documented and open a corporate Demat account to go through a registered broker.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The sale deed could be valid even with only the seller’s (vendor’s) signature, provided that the document was properly registered. However, the buyer’s signature is now considered an essential part of the process to avoid disputes and ensure that the buyer has explicitly agreed to the terms. A mismatch of signatures is a red flag and could indicate potential forgery or fraud. It’s essential to verify the authenticity of the sale deed by obtaining certified copies from the Sub-Registrar’s office and compare them with the original documents. Ensure that the person who signed the sale deed as the vendor is indeed the authorized representative of the developer. Check for any pending litigation, encumbrances, or other issues related to the property. A title search at the Sub-Registrar’s office is essential.

    "question": "Parents are deceased and NRI sister does not want to sell the properties",
    "answer": "A) Sending a Legal Notice Before Requesting Court PartitionYes, it is generally acceptable to send a legal notice informing your sister of the potential issues of taking the matter to court and suggesting that the properties be sold. If she agrees to sell the property through her own lawyer, this can be done before requesting the court to partition the property. This step can help avoid lengthy legal proceedings and reach an amicable solution.B) Subsequent Legal Notice for PartitionIf your sister ignores the initial legal notice, you can have a lawyer send a subsequent legal notice for partition. Here are the details for this process:(1) If She Does Not Contest the Partition:Response Time: Once your sister receives the legal notice, she typically has30 daysto respond.Court Appointment of Property Expert: If she does not respond, the court may take2-3 monthsto appoint a property expert and proceed with the partition.Partition by Property Experts: Property experts will evaluate the properties and suggest a fair division based on factors such as property value, location, and usage.(2) If She Contests the Partition:Step-by-Step Legal Process:Filing a Partition Suit: You will need to file a partition suit in the appropriate court.Service of Summons: The court will serve a summons to your sister.Discovery Phase: Both parties will exchange relevant documents and information.Trial: If no settlement is reached, the case will go to trial.Judgment: The court will issue a judgment on the partition.Duration: The entire process can take anywhere from6 months to several years, depending on the complexity of the case and court backlog.Basis for Contesting: Your sister may contest the partition based on claims of unfair division, sentimental value, or other personal reasons.(3) Selling Shares Without PartitionYou can sell your shares of the property without a formal partition, but this may lead to legal complications if your sister contests the sale.(4) Probating Your Mother’s WillProbating your mother’s will can help avoid disputes and ensure that her wishes are legally recognized. This process can provide a clear legal framework for the distribution of her assets.(5) Inheritance CertificateThere is no concept of an inheritance certificate in India. You can get a Legal Heir certificate which establish a relation with the deceased.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if you need any clarification."

However, this is not inevitable. The court typically prefers to explore all possible options for an equitable partition before resorting to an auction sale. If the property can be divided in a way that satisfies all parties, the court will usually opt for that solution.2. Yes, providing a legal heir certificate is generally compulsory in partition cases.

    "question": "Parents are deceased and NRI sister does not want to sell the properties",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Considering the issues related to the  inheritance and properties among the siblings which raise  several legal issues, the answer to your queries are as;A] Legal Notice for Property Sale AgreementYou should write a legal notice to your sister stating the legal questions that may arise in the event that the matter is taken to the court and ask her to agree to the sale of the said properties. It would be better that she answer in writing through her legal counsel, which is allowed up to the time of filing a partition. This approach may aid in coming up with a friendly solution to legal problems and minimize an extended trial process.B) Second Legal notice for partitionIn case your sister does not respond positively to the first notice you may go on to a legal notice for partition. Generally your sister should reply to the legal notice in 15 days of its receipt. In the event that she will not answer the complaint, the court can order an assessment of a property regarding division of the land. This process can take some time and normally takes several months to appoint an expert and finalize the partition according to the court’s attendance and the complexity of the case. Property experts will subdivide the residential properties in accordance with the legal papers, ownership ratios, as well as nature of the properties. They will also have to take into account the fair market value as well as the best interest of all the stakeholders.If She Will Challenge the PartitionIn the case where your sister disagrees on the partition, the steps normally followed is to present a suit In the civil court for the partition. The court will then issue the notices and the two parties will present their case to the court. The process may last from one to three years, depending on the case load of the court and the nature of the conflict. There can be possible reason that why your sister is likely resist the partition, she may say the partition should not be done or that she deserves a larger share due to her efforts or the properties do not have to be sold.If you sell property shares without a proper partition then it may turn legal trouble like a conflict with your sister. In this case it is recommended to either get her permission or a court order so as not to encounter any problems. You should take the initiative and probate your mother’s will to avoid further complications and disagreements in case she will challenge the will. It may be necessary to produce an inheritance certificate to prove his/her right to the ownership of the properties especially where there is a dispute over the will or shares of the property.Hope this advice helps in solving your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Parents are deceased and NRI sister does not want to sell the properties",
    "answer": "you need to calm down. when you complain of being insulted, have a look at your comment to me as well. I do not care about your ratings. I answered what was required to be answered. Despite that, I will again respond to some of your irrelevant queries. I cannot see what other lawyers have responded to your query and I am not even concerned. It is highly inappropriate of you of having make a generalised statement about lawyers. If you want respect, be respectful. Don't degrade lawyers in the manner you have sought to do in your remark left in my comment box. :Questions:A). Send a legal notice informing the potential issues of taking it to court and to have her agree that properties can be sold. She agrees that the property can be sold via her own lawyer. Is it ok to do this before we request the court to partition?As before stated you cannot compel your sister to sell her share. If she does not wish to sell her share, nobody can put a gun on her head. So this notice would not be appropriate. However you can have a letter addressed to her that it would be better if the properties are sold amicably, else the matter will have to go to the court, in a partition suit, which will take years to resolve. So try and convince her by saying that it would be in the fitness of things if the properties are sold mutually rather than lock the properties in legal dispute.B) Have a lawyer send a subsequent legal notice for partition, if she ignores option (A).Yes if she does not respond positively to the above letter, then you will have no option but to take legal steps by having a legal notice issued demanding partition of the properties.(1) If she does not contest it, the court will partition based on the advice of property experts.(1 i) Once my sister receives the legal notice how many days should she respond to it?there is no fixed time within which the notice has to be responded. Your lawyer will mention the notice period. Say 2 weeks or 4 weeks. Your sister is not even obligated to reply within that period. If she does not, then you will have to file a partition suit.(1 ii) If she does not respond, how many days does it take for the court to appoint a property expert and partition the land accordingly?this is very difficult to say. You will first file the suit. Then summons will be issued to the defendant sister. Then she will enter appearance and file her defense or written statement. Then the Court will frame issues [points of differences between the parties]. Then the parties will have to lead evidence /testimony. Then there will be final hearing followed by a preliminary decree and then a final decree. After passing of a preliminary decree the court will appoint a court commissioner who will visit the subject properties and file a report in court whether or not the properties are partible. So it is extremely difficult to certainly say how much time all of this will take. And the Indian Courts are slow. I can even say that the entire thing will get done in 1 year. Will you then hold me to my words if there is any delay. That is why I said that such a query is akin to asking a query to some astrologer. Despite that to give you a ballpark estimate, you can consider a minimum of 5 years.(1 iii) How will the property experts partition the residential properties?such properties are generally not partible. That is one cannot physically divide such properties to partition it. So generally such properties are sold in public auction and the sale proceeds are then divided among the parties according to their shares.(2) If she does contest the partition:(2 i) What is the step by step legal process?if your sister contests the partition suit then she will have to file her written statement and then all the steps i described above will happen(2 ii) How long will it take?difficult to answer(2 iii) What is the basis for her to contest the partition?this question does not make any sense. How can it be even predicted? she may come up with the case that the properties are not partible or that they are her own properties and the Plaintiff does not have any right in them. She can come up with any defense under the roof to contest the suit. So it is really not possible to precisely answer as to what will be her basis to contest the suit.(3) Can we sell our shares of the property without a partition & is there a legal ramifications?you can sell your undivided share but the question is, would there be willing buyers? If all the sharers are consenting for the sale then there is no question of any partition.(4) Do we need to probate my mother’s will to avoid my sister contesting the will?probate is not compulsory [ i say this on the strength of section 57 read with section 213 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925. However for all practical purposes if the Will is being set up then it should ideally be probated. If your sister contests the Will then she will have to forego any right that have been given to her under the Will. It would not make sense to contest a Will in which a person has been bequeathed something, unless the person claims that he or she is entitled to the entire thing and not a part of such thing that has been bequeathed under the Will.(5) Do we need an inheritance certificate?if you follow the testamentary succession and have the Will probated then an inheritance or heirship certificate would not be required. An heirship certificate is generally applied for when there is intestate succession i.e. when the person dies without leaving any Will behind.If a Will is set up and it has been acted upon then intestate succession [case in which there is no Will] cannot be then set up.Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The builder has not provided the permanent parking allotment and instead offering a mechanized parking which is a violation to the original sale agreement. This action can be considered as breach of contract and the owner legally can file a dispute against the builder in the court. According to Indian Contract Act, 1872, contract means a promise which forms the consideration for the agreement and if it is violated or broken then it makes it legally enforceable. In this case it was agreed with the previous owner on the sale and which contained a provision by the builder to offer a long term parking space. The fact that the builder has engaged in such conduct in issuing such letters to many other residents may be helpful. In order to continue with the legal case, you need to find a real estate attorney, who would help you with the process and assist in presenting it before the court.Hope you find this advice beneficial.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Redevelopment - Compliance of Tender",
    "answer": "Dear Client,With reference to the redevelopment process under Section 79A of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, it is crucial to highlight that the managing committee does not have the right to adjust the points in the Development Agreement (DA) that go against the tender provided by the society members. They also cannot make you sign the DA without offering some crucial information like the plans for your new apartment. In the approval process of the redevelopment, the specific rules are stated in the Government Resolution dated January 3, 2009, that require active involvement of members in the decision-making process. For the implementation of the tender points you can demand a Special General Meeting (SGM) to talk about the changes and share the concern with every member. If the committee has not stopped ignoring your contributions, it may be advisable that you sent a legal notice explaining your problems and demanding compliance with the initial provision of the tender offer. It is also advisable that you consult a lawyer who deals in cooperative housing societies matters and who can help you in the filing of a complaint with the Registrar of Cooperative Societies may be taken.Hope this advice helps in solving your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Changes to the Development Agreement (DA)The managing committee should not change the points in the DA that are contrary to the original Tender without the consent of the society members. The Tender is a binding document, and any significant changes should be approved by the general body of the society. The directives under Section 79A emphasize transparency and collective decision-making.2. Signing the Development Agreement Without Detailed PlansThe managing committee cannot force you to sign the DA without providing the detailed plans of your new apartment, amenities, and parking. Transparency is crucial in the redevelopment process, and members have the right to know what they are agreeing to before signing any legal documents.Legal Actions You Can TakeRequest a Special General Body Meeting (SGBM): You can request an SGBM to discuss the changes in the DA and ensure that all members are informed and can voice their concerns. This meeting can be called by a certain percentage of members as per your society’s bylaws.File a Complaint with the Registrar: If the managing committee is not adhering to the directives and is making changes that are not in the members’ best interests, you can file a complaint with the Registrar of Co-operative Societies. The Registrar has the authority to intervene and ensure compliance with the directives.Mediation: Sometimes, mediation can be a less confrontational way to resolve disputes. A mediator can help facilitate discussions between the managing committee and the members to reach a mutually agreeable solution.Gagandeep Singh ThandiAdvocate, Pathankot68 AnswersTalk to Advocate Gagandeep Singh Thandi"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The assertion that the owners cannot claim delay period interest since possession was handed over before the RERA Completion date is baseless. The builder got only 25% flats registered in February 2021 and delivered the possessions without basic amenities like lift, electricity, and water supply, respectively. Possession was taken in December 2020 and the Occupancy Certificate (OC) was received only in December 2021 suggesting that the project was not fully ready at the time of delivery. According to section 12 of the RERA Act 2016, the promoter is expected to provide necessities until the maintenance of the premises is taken over by the association of the allottees. The owners should approach the RERA Authority and lodge a complaint with supporting facts of the partially constructed property and delay in getting the OC. In the case of Imperia Structures Ltd. v. Anil Patni the Supreme Court has ruled in favour of the delay period interest as well as the compensation.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, the buyer’s signature is now considered an essential part of the process to avoid disputes and ensure that the buyer has explicitly agreed to the terms. A mismatch of signatures is a red flag and could indicate potential forgery or fraud. It’s essential to verify the authenticity of the sale deed by obtaining certified copies from the Sub-Registrar’s office and compare them with the original documents. Ensure that the person who signed the sale deed as the vendor is indeed the authorized representative of the developer.

Karnataka follows the rule of stamp duty of 5% on sale deed value along with a nominal one per cent registration charges for properties.

    "answer": "Dear Client,In the case of adding your wife's name to the Share Certificate following a registered Gift Deed transferring 50% rights of your flat to her, typically, societies do charge a nominal transfer fee. However, since this is a transfer between family members, some societies may waive the fee or charge a reduced amount. According to the model bye-laws of cooperative housing societies in Maharashtra, the maximum transfer fee that can be levied is usually around ₹500, though it can vary based on the specific rules of your society. It is advisable to check with your society's managing committee or refer to the society's bye-laws to get the exact amount and any possible exemptions for transfers within the family.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Society transfer charges for gift deed (husband to wife)",
    "answer": "Dear Client,As you have made a registered Gift Deed to transfer 50% rights of your flat to your wife’s self, you should not be liable to pay transfer fees under the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act. As per By-law No. 38, transfer fees cannot go beyond ₹25,000 and many societies cannot demand extra charges as ‘voluntary donations.’ Since the society has received legal opinion stating no objection to the transfer, you may wish to refer to relevant legal provisions that prove that the society’s resolution to charge for transfer fees is unlawful. The third step is to make a formal appeal to the managing committee of the society through a legal notice stating the laws under which you want to get a waiver of the fee. If they do not, you can go through the Registrar of Cooperative Societies or the legal avenues available through the Bombay High Court. Collect all documents such as the Gift Deed document, the societies standing rules, and requirements needed for the transfer without charges. In the event that the society makes any unreasonable demands, it is wise to engage an attorney to represent you in the case.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Possession was taken in December 2020 and the Occupancy Certificate (OC) was received only in December 2021 suggesting that the project was not fully ready at the time of delivery. According to section 12 of the RERA Act 2016, the promoter is expected to provide necessities until the maintenance of the premises is taken over by the association of the allottees.

    "answer": "In 2010, the Supreme Court of India ruled in the case Nahalchand Laloochand Pvt Ltd vs. Panchali Cooperative Housing Society that parking spaces in flats are common facilities and cannot be sold separately. The court rejected the argument of a real estate company that they could sell parking spaces to owners who wanted to use them as private parking. The court also upheld a 2011 Bombay High Court verdict that made it illegal for builders to sell parking units to non-society buyers or residents as separate real estate units."

    "answer": "Dear Client,As per RERA, it is now the duty of the builder to disclose and provide parking areas within common spaces. Except if the agreement deed permits selling open parking spaces, which ordinarily is not allowed. Builders cannot also sell the parking spaces independently. When the society is created, it also takes charge of maintaining common spaces which includes parking lots as well. If it has free parking space, the society needs to allot on first come and own basis which is either through a lottery system or as passed in AGM. Failure to issue available parking spaces in this circumstance may be seen as arbitrarily or discriminatory. If the society's actions seem arbitrary, you can file a complaint against the builder for their failure to fulfil obligations before Gujarat RERA Authority as well as approach Registrar of Societies. You can also think of filling a civil suit or complaint with the Consumer Forum for deficiency in service. Before seeking redress via the law, it might also be worth compiling evidence or trying to mediate with your society. You should also consult with a local property lawyer expert in RERA to society law who may guide you.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,If you as a resident member of the society do not have a parking allotment letter from the builder whereas other members of the society have, you may still have a legal right to park your car on the common ground. According to Section 6 of theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, in the event of a lease, no rights are assigned over common areas like parking, unless the lease document states otherwise. Further, the RERA clearly states that builders need to specify in terms of sale of properties that if you have paid for parking and parking space was promised to you then it is your right. If the society continues to bar you, then it advised to seek the help of a lawyer for complaining to RERA or sue the society executives. Your rights should also receive protection from the tenancy laws and the rules set by RERA.I hope this advice is fruitful.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Yes, home buyers can claim interest for delayed possession even after taking possession of a property from a builder. The RERA Act of 2016 entitles home buyers to interest or a refund if a builder delays possession, hence builder's claim is not maintainable in law.Here are some other legal remedies available to home buyers in case of a delay in possession:Home buyers can file a complaint with consumer forums, such as the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) or State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commissions."

    "answer": "Dear Client,The assertion that the owners cannot claim delay period interest since possession was handed over before the RERA Completion date is baseless. The builder got only 25% flats registered in February 2021 and delivered the possessions without basic amenities like lift, electricity, and water supply, respectively. Possession was taken in December 2020 and the Occupancy Certificate (OC) was received only in December 2021 suggesting that the project was not fully ready at the time of delivery. According to section 12 of the RERA Act 2016, the promoter is expected to provide necessities until the maintenance of the premises is taken over by the association of the allottees. The owners should approach the RERA Authority and lodge a complaint with supporting facts of the partially constructed property and delay in getting the OC. In the case of Imperia Structures Ltd. v. Anil Patni the Supreme Court has ruled in favour of the delay period interest as well as the compensation.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This action can be considered as breach of contract and the owner legally can file a dispute against the builder in the court. According to Indian Contract Act, 1872, contract means a promise which forms the consideration for the agreement and if it is violated or broken then it makes it legally enforceable. In this case it was agreed with the previous owner on the sale and which contained a provision by the builder to offer a long term parking space. The fact that the builder has engaged in such conduct in issuing such letters to many other residents may be helpful.

They also cannot make you sign the DA without offering some crucial information like the plans for your new apartment. In the approval process of the redevelopment, the specific rules are stated in the Government Resolution dated January 3, 2009, that require active involvement of members in the decision-making process. For the implementation of the tender points you can demand a Special General Meeting (SGM) to talk about the changes and share the concern with every member. If the committee has not stopped ignoring your contributions, it may be advisable that you sent a legal notice explaining your problems and demanding compliance with the initial provision of the tender offer. It is also advisable that you consult a lawyer who deals in cooperative housing societies matters and who can help you in the filing of a complaint with the Registrar of Cooperative Societies may be taken.Hope this advice helps in solving your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This meeting can be called by a certain percentage of members as per your society’s bylaws.File a Complaint with the Registrar: If the managing committee is not adhering to the directives and is making changes that are not in the members’ best interests, you can file a complaint with the Registrar of Co-operative Societies. The Registrar has the authority to intervene and ensure compliance with the directives.Mediation: Sometimes, mediation can be a less confrontational way to resolve disputes.

    "question": "Is it legal to incorporate Pvt Limited company which gets 100% profits from stock trading",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the answers of your questions regarding the incorporation of private limited company or LLP for stock trading;1) Yes, one is allowed to incorporate a private limited company or LLP and generate 100% of revenue from stock trading. But there are some conditions which one has to follow or avoid while using it.2) If the company has 50% or more total assets in the form of shares, securities, bonds, etc. and has 50% or more gross income from these financial assets, then it will come under the category of NBFC i.e., Non-Banking Financial Company and it is compulsory to obtain NBFC license from RBI. To get this NBFC license however it is not very easy as there are a lot of regulatory standards that have to be met.3) It is not always beneficial for you from a tax point of view to incorporate a private limited company or LLP. The company, its profits, will be subjected to the corporate tax rate, the current being 25% for small companies while any dividend paid to shareholders will further be charged for taxes. While it is true that some of these may be applicable to an individual and not to a company or corporation.4)Yes, it is allowed to deduct the director’s salary while operating a private limited company. However, the salary should be reasonable and should be equivalent to the salary paid in other similar organizations. From the salary income, taxes will be deducted from the side of the director.5) It is also possible to form an LLP and make profit from stock investing. For tax purposes, LLPs are classified as pass-through entities, and the income is taxed in the hands of the partners. If an LLP does not fall into the above criteria it does not need to hold an NBFC license.6) If the overall profits from stock investment are less then 50%, NBFC license may not be necessary to be obtained. However, it is proper to keep records/documentation in order to support the recognition of income as business income as opposed to being capital gains.It is better to turn to a tax consultant or an attorney who would be familiar with rules and provisions of the finance legislation. The decision to incorporate a company or LLP for trading in stocks depends with the kind of stocks one intends to invest in, and level of risk tolerance that one has.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Is it legal to incorporate Pvt Limited company which gets 100% profits from stock trading",
    "answer": "1. Legality of Owning a Pvt Ltd or LLP for Stock TradingYes, it is legal to own a Pvt Ltd or LLP that derives 100% of its profits from stock trading. However, the company’s Memorandum of Association (MOA) must include stock trading as one of its objectives.2. Requirement for NBFC LicenseIf the primary business of the Pvt Ltd or LLP is stock trading and it involves managing funds from multiple investors, it may be classified as a Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC), which requires an NBFC license from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). However, if you are only using your own and your brother’s money, it might not require an NBFC license.3. Tax Efficiency: Pvt Ltd or LLP vs. Individual AccountPvt Ltd Company: The corporate tax rate for Pvt Ltd companies is generally lower than the highest individual tax rate. For companies with a turnover of up to INR 400 crore, the tax rate is 25%, and for others, it is 30%. Additionally, companies can claim various business expenses, which can reduce taxable income.LLP: LLPs are taxed at a flat rate of 30% plus surcharge and cess as applicable. LLPs also allow for the distribution of profits without additional dividend distribution tax, which can be beneficial.Individual Account: Individuals are taxed based on income slabs, which can go up to 42.7% including surcharge. However, individuals can also claim expenses related to trading under ITR-3.4. Claiming Director’s Salary as ExpenseYes, a Pvt Ltd company can claim the director’s salary as an expense, provided it is reasonable and in line with the company’s financial performance. There are no specific limits on director remuneration for private companies, but it must be approved by the board of directors and comply with the Companies Act, 2013.5. If the profits from stock investments fall under 50% of the total profit, your company may not require an NBFC license. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) generally mandates an NBFC license for companies where financial activities constitute more than 50% of the total assets and income. This is known as the 50-50 test.In your case, if stock trading profits are less than 50% of the total profits, and the financial assets are also less than 50% of the total assets, a Private Limited Company (Pvt Ltd) should be sufficient without needing an NBFC license.Gagandeep Singh ThandiAdvocate, Pathankot68 AnswersTalk to Advocate Gagandeep Singh Thandi"

    "answer": "Builder cannot deliver possession of flat before issue of OC2) The Bombay High Court has reiterated the legal position that a flat buyer who has taken possession may raise a claim in the form of interest for delay in handing over the flat. The court ruled that there is no bar under section 18 of RERA for the flat buyer to make such a claim3) Bombay high court held  If he was to file complaint before possession and keep litigating with the promoter, the same would have put the buyer to further losses as the interest liability of the promoter would have been frozen on the date of procurement of Occupancy Certificate, and the money paid by the buyer to promoter would have remained blocked. It was in the interest of the buyer to first take possession of the flat.”Ajay SethiAdvocate, Mumbai98567 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi"

    "answer": "In my opinion, the delay caused in obtaining the copies of the documents will be inordinate, hence you gather the substantial documents to prove that the builder has not complied with the statutory requirements but has somehow managed to obtain OC without properly completing the construction work with the connivance of the authorities concerned, you can drag the authorities also a party to the case and seek relief, let them provide the documents they rely upon for issuing clearance, which can be proved to be wrong in the trial proceedings.However if you are not getting the desired information you are always at your liberty to file an appeal against the rejection.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Yes, home buyers can claim interest for delayed possession even after taking possession of a property from a builder. The RERA Act of 2016 entitles home buyers to interest or a refund if a builder delays possession, hence builder's claim is not maintainable in law.Here are some other legal remedies available to home buyers in case of a delay in possession:Home buyers can file a complaint with consumer forums, such as the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) or State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commissions."

    "answer": "1. if the authority does not give you any answer or a satisfactory answer you can file an appeal within 30 days at the appellate information officer.2. no the builder's argument does not hold as mere possession is not the essence of the sale agreement. all the amenities mentioned should be provided as per the concerned/promised timeline.Let me know if any clarification is required.Gagandeep Singh ThandiAdvocate, Pathankot68 AnswersTalk to Advocate Gagandeep Singh Thandi"

    "answer": "Dear Client,The assertion that the owners cannot claim delay period interest since possession was handed over before the RERA Completion date is baseless. The builder got only 25% flats registered in February 2021 and delivered the possessions without basic amenities like lift, electricity, and water supply, respectively. Possession was taken in December 2020 and the Occupancy Certificate (OC) was received only in December 2021 suggesting that the project was not fully ready at the time of delivery. According to section 12 of the RERA Act 2016, the promoter is expected to provide necessities until the maintenance of the premises is taken over by the association of the allottees. The owners should approach the RERA Authority and lodge a complaint with supporting facts of the partially constructed property and delay in getting the OC. In the case of Imperia Structures Ltd. v. Anil Patni the Supreme Court has ruled in favour of the delay period interest as well as the compensation.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"
