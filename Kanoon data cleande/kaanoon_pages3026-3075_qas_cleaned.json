    "question": "Divorce filed in USA, is 50-50 law applicable in India?",
    "answer": "Is 50-50 law which is standard in divorce proceedings in USA applicable in India ?No.Is the judgement given in USA valid in India as the property is in India ?No.Can husband file a separate divorce case in India ?Yes .As per the latest Supreme Court judgment which had held that a decree of divorce granted by a foreign court is not valid in India if the ground is not recognized by Indian law. Who wish to take benefit of Indian laws and legal system to avoid facing up to any foreign judicial system. Indian Marriage solemnized in India according to Indian Matrimonial laws then the Indian courts will have territorial jurisdiction to hear & decide matter relating to this marriage & the foreign court's decision may or may not be acceptable in India hence best course is to get this marriage dissolved according to India court's decree of divorce.Please read the detailed answer .In India, there's nosuch law that gives the wife the right to claim a 50% stake. There are many laws in India which deal with settlement of spousal property.  Indian legal system follows equity distribution during property settlements at the time of divorce. The partners receive their share according to equity/contribution. The courts of equity exercise jurisdiction in personam. (A court within personam jurisdiction in a particular case has enough power over the defendant and his or her property to grant a judgment affecting the defendant in almost any way).In the eyes of the Indian judicial system, the property belongs to the person in whose name it's registered.  If the property is in the name of the husband then the wife has no right on that property.USAFamily Courts may make orders in relation to property in an overseas jurisdiction. However, property settlement orders made by theUSAFamily Courts may not be automatically recognised and enforceable in the overseas jurisdiction. Consequently, problems may be experienced in enforcing the property settlement orders internationally.USA is a Non-reciprocatory territory of India and the Indian court exercises jurisdiction in personam so the property situated in India has divided only under Indian law. When the court grants a divorce, the property will be divided equitably (not always equally) between the two spouses. This is decided under Equitable Distribution Law. During the divorce, both spouses have to tell the court about their income and any debts they owe.  If the lawsuit is to determine title to property (in rem) then the action must be filed where the property exists and is only enforceable there.Under Hindu law, a woman gets a right on her husband’s property only after his death. Since marital bonds are considered sacrosanct and eternal in Hindu belief, there are no strong provisions in the existing law as far as property goes if a couple decides to call it quits. They are only eligible for maintenance, so to speak.A wife has the right to claim maintenance for her livelihood equivalent to husband’s lifestyle, till the time she enters into a second marriage. In India marital bonds are considered sacrosanct and eternal, so a married woman gets a right on her husband’s property only after his death. A woman’s husband’s ancestral property, which he is expected to inherit in the future, remains out of the settlement, and so does his self-acquired property. It is only in the case of a joint property that a woman could claim at the time of divorce.If a property is purchased and paid for by one person and the title is held by another, the person in whose name the property is held will be deemed to be its legal owner. Before we proceed further, it is important to note that this law accepts the property on which his/her name is registered. Contributions made during the purchase of any other party, cash or in-kind, are not recognized, legally speaking, unless you have sufficient evidence to prove otherwise.There are two different types of property for the purposes of divorce. The property that the couple purchased during marriage is called “marital property”. Property that you had before marriage or was just a gift to you from someone other than your spouse is called a “separate property”.Marital property can be divided between two spouses.Separate propertyis an asset that is owned by the premarital spouses. Any inheritance a spouse receives, even during marriage, is separate property. So are personal gifts (unless they came from another spouse or partner) and payments for personal injuries.When the court grants a divorce, the property will be divided equitably (not always equally) between the two spouses. This is decided under Equitable Distribution Law.Ajay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

    "question": "Divorce filed in USA, is 50-50 law applicable in India?",
    "answer": "Is 50-50 law which is standard in divorce proceedings in USA applicable in India ?No.Is the judgement given in USA valid in India as the property is in India ?No.Can husband file a separate divorce case in India ?Yes .As per the latest Supreme Court judgment which had held that a decree of divorce granted by a foreign court is not valid in India if the ground is not recognized by Indian law. Who wish to take benefit of Indian laws and legal system to avoid facing up to any foreign judicial system. Indian Marriage solemnized in India according to Indian Matrimonial laws then the Indian courts will have territorial jurisdiction to hear & decide matter relating to this marriage & the foreign court's decision may or may not be acceptable in India hence best course is to get this marriage dissolved according to India court's decree of divorce.Please read the detailed answer .In India, there's nosuch law that gives the wife the right to claim a 50% stake. There are many laws in India which deal with settlement of spousal property.  Indian legal system follows equity distribution during property settlements at the time of divorce. The partners receive their share according to equity/contribution. The courts of equity exercise jurisdiction in personam. (A court within personam jurisdiction in a particular case has enough power over the defendant and his or her property to grant a judgment affecting the defendant in almost any way).In the eyes of the Indian judicial system, the property belongs to the person in whose name it's registered.  If the property is in the name of the husband then the wife has no right on that property.USAFamily Courts may make orders in relation to property in an overseas jurisdiction. However, property settlement orders made by theUSAFamily Courts may not be automatically recognised and enforceable in the overseas jurisdiction. Consequently, problems may be experienced in enforcing the property settlement orders internationally.USA is a Non-reciprocatory territory of India and the Indian court exercises jurisdiction in personam so the property situated in India has divided only under Indian law. When the court grants a divorce, the property will be divided equitably (not always equally) between the two spouses. This is decided under Equitable Distribution Law. During the divorce, both spouses have to tell the court about their income and any debts they owe.  If the lawsuit is to determine title to property (in rem) then the action must be filed where the property exists and is only enforceable there.Under Hindu law, a woman gets a right on her husband’s property only after his death. Since marital bonds are considered sacrosanct and eternal in Hindu belief, there are no strong provisions in the existing law as far as property goes if a couple decides to call it quits. They are only eligible for maintenance, so to speak.A wife has the right to claim maintenance for her livelihood equivalent to husband’s lifestyle, till the time she enters into a second marriage. In India marital bonds are considered sacrosanct and eternal, so a married woman gets a right on her husband’s property only after his death. A woman’s husband’s ancestral property, which he is expected to inherit in the future, remains out of the settlement, and so does his self-acquired property. It is only in the case of a joint property that a woman could claim at the time of divorce.If a property is purchased and paid for by one person and the title is held by another, the person in whose name the property is held will be deemed to be its legal owner. Before we proceed further, it is important to note that this law accepts the property on which his/her name is registered. Contributions made during the purchase of any other party, cash or in-kind, are not recognized, legally speaking, unless you have sufficient evidence to prove otherwise.There are two different types of property for the purposes of divorce. The property that the couple purchased during marriage is called “marital property”. Property that you had before marriage or was just a gift to you from someone other than your spouse is called a “separate property”.Marital property can be divided between two spouses.Separate propertyis an asset that is owned by the premarital spouses. Any inheritance a spouse receives, even during marriage, is separate property. So are personal gifts (unless they came from another spouse or partner) and payments for personal injuries.When the court grants a divorce, the property will be divided equitably (not always equally) between the two spouses. This is decided under Equitable Distribution Law.Ajay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

You have the option to call the police by just dialing the police number 100 and police will come to the place mentioned by you in the phone call. They will come to the spot and ask you the problem and then will take the action against them. And, when they will reach the spot you should be having sufficient proof to prove the harassment by neighbors.Harassment Through NuisanceYou may be living in an apartment or in a duplex, often it happens, when you hear loud music sound from the neighbor’s house, you try to ignore that sound for as long as possible but sometimes, such noise may make life difficult. This type of nuisance is defined inSection 268 of the Indian Penal Act.Section 268 of theIndian Penal Codedefines nuisance when the person is guilty of a public nuisance when he does any act which causes injury, danger or annoyance to the public or the people in general who live or occupy the property in the neighborhood.A common nuisance is not excused on the ground that it causes some convenience or advantage.If this type of harassment is faced by you from your neighbor then, you can file an application under Section 268 of IPC in the court of magistrate.Punishment of nuisance is defined in Section 290 of IPC, which is mere Rs. 200 but the court can do much more.As a matter of fact, calling 100 is most effective as, after a visit or two from the police, such nuisance is likely to stop. In extreme cases, police may even confiscate the instruments that are used to cause nuisance like – loudspeakers or sound boxes, or drones, cameras or such other tools.Sometimes, police does not intervene despite laws being there as they do not like extra work on their plate or because the other party is very influential. In such cases, you may need to take help of legal experts. We recommend you get in touch with ClikLawyer.com.Harassment Through MischiefWhen you live in a duplex, you are sharing a common wall. If your neighbor starts construction in that common wall you do not have the right to stop him from constructing because it is his legal right but if during the construction work your property gets damaged, you can ask him to compensate for the loss suffered by youbut if your neighbor refuses to pay you the amount then you can file a case under–Section 425 of IPC which statesthat whoever with intent to cause, or knowing that he is likely to cause, wrongful loss or damage to the public or to any person, causes the destruction of any property, or any such change in any property or in the situation thereof as destroys or diminishes its value or utility, or affects it injuriously, commits mischief.You can file suit for declaration and mandatory injunction in a civil court as well.You can claim damages in the same suit.THE KARNATAKA POLICE ACT,(similar State Police Act also existing in each State)Punishment of certain street offences and nuisance.—(1) In any local area to which the Government by notification in the official Gazette from time to time extends this sub-section or any clause thereof, whoever, contrary thereto,— (a) without lawful excuse drives along, or keeps standing in, any street a vehicle of any description or drags or pushes in any street, a vehicle of any description other than a bicycle at any time between half an hour after sunset and one hour before sunrise without a sufficient light or lights;

If any legal heir has not given a consent affidavit then the court will issue him a notice using his details provided in the petition. Upon receipt of notice the legal heir has to file a caveat with an affidavit in support stating his grounds of objections against the grant of the petition. If the brother does not disclose the details of all heirs then he will be liable for suppression of material facts and any grant obtained by him from the court by concealing facts from the court, will be liable to be revoked. So there are adequate safeguards against any tricks sought to be played by the Petitioner2. Yes even if the bequeathed property is not mutated in her name, she can still make a Will for that property. If the Will under which the property was bequeathed is not proved as per law then the second Will to the extent of that property will lapse and will be of no effect.3. Not required. Police is useless. It will say that it's a civil matter. Even if you want to place something on record, I would not suggest as it wont serve any purpose. However its your choice if you wish to write any letter to the police4. Yes the heir of the legatee will succeed to the bequest5.

But here you dont even know who are the beneficiaries named in the WillAll the property tax etc are being paid by my mothers brother(not the executors of the will) Is this ok?He is paying it in his capacity of a co owner on behalf of all legal heirs. So that does not clothe him with the attributes of the owner. On death of testator the property vests in the executor. So he has to ideally take care of all outgoings of the property. But how is all this going to help you? Without seeing the Will how are you saying that the testator had appointed an executor in the Will?The will does not state anything about me(sole legal heir of my mother staying on the property), only talks my mother, how does the law look at that?Again this is like shooting blind shots in the air without even looking at the WillIf a Probate gets converted into a testamentary suit what time frame are we looking for resolution?takes many years which cannot be predicted. Minimum 5 years is a given unless settled amicably sooneryou can get my contact details from kanoon and fix an appointment with me for a paid consultation ORyou can book a paid phone consultation on kanoon to talk to meYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Asking to sign Consent Affidavit without showing the WIll",
    "answer": "There is no material to file a nuisance or pestering case against your mother's brother.The executor of the Will need to keep the beneficiaries informed about the benefits named in the Will.The executor of the Will is the administrator of the estates of the properties bequeathed in the Will hence there is nothing strange that the executor paying the taxes  and updating the records periodically.There is no necessity for the Will to mention everything elaborately.Your mother is the beneficiary and not you. You can become the legal heir to your mother only after her lifetime and not before that. Therefore you have no rights in the Will bequeathed property at least not during the lifetime of your mother.The probate of Will is different to that of what you mention about the testamentary suit .The time taken for disposal of probate petition cannot be predicted owing to various factors involved in it.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Divorce filed in USA, is 50-50 law applicable in India?",
    "answer": "Is 50-50 law which is standard in divorce proceedings in USA applicable in India ?No.Is the judgement given in USA valid in India as the property is in India ?No.Can husband file a separate divorce case in India ?Yes .As per the latest Supreme Court judgment which had held that a decree of divorce granted by a foreign court is not valid in India if the ground is not recognized by Indian law. Who wish to take benefit of Indian laws and legal system to avoid facing up to any foreign judicial system. Indian Marriage solemnized in India according to Indian Matrimonial laws then the Indian courts will have territorial jurisdiction to hear & decide matter relating to this marriage & the foreign court's decision may or may not be acceptable in India hence best course is to get this marriage dissolved according to India court's decree of divorce.Please read the detailed answer .In India, there's nosuch law that gives the wife the right to claim a 50% stake. There are many laws in India which deal with settlement of spousal property.  Indian legal system follows equity distribution during property settlements at the time of divorce. The partners receive their share according to equity/contribution. The courts of equity exercise jurisdiction in personam. (A court within personam jurisdiction in a particular case has enough power over the defendant and his or her property to grant a judgment affecting the defendant in almost any way).In the eyes of the Indian judicial system, the property belongs to the person in whose name it's registered.  If the property is in the name of the husband then the wife has no right on that property.USAFamily Courts may make orders in relation to property in an overseas jurisdiction. However, property settlement orders made by theUSAFamily Courts may not be automatically recognised and enforceable in the overseas jurisdiction. Consequently, problems may be experienced in enforcing the property settlement orders internationally.USA is a Non-reciprocatory territory of India and the Indian court exercises jurisdiction in personam so the property situated in India has divided only under Indian law. When the court grants a divorce, the property will be divided equitably (not always equally) between the two spouses. This is decided under Equitable Distribution Law. During the divorce, both spouses have to tell the court about their income and any debts they owe.  If the lawsuit is to determine title to property (in rem) then the action must be filed where the property exists and is only enforceable there.Under Hindu law, a woman gets a right on her husband’s property only after his death. Since marital bonds are considered sacrosanct and eternal in Hindu belief, there are no strong provisions in the existing law as far as property goes if a couple decides to call it quits. They are only eligible for maintenance, so to speak.A wife has the right to claim maintenance for her livelihood equivalent to husband’s lifestyle, till the time she enters into a second marriage. In India marital bonds are considered sacrosanct and eternal, so a married woman gets a right on her husband’s property only after his death. A woman’s husband’s ancestral property, which he is expected to inherit in the future, remains out of the settlement, and so does his self-acquired property. It is only in the case of a joint property that a woman could claim at the time of divorce.If a property is purchased and paid for by one person and the title is held by another, the person in whose name the property is held will be deemed to be its legal owner. Before we proceed further, it is important to note that this law accepts the property on which his/her name is registered. Contributions made during the purchase of any other party, cash or in-kind, are not recognized, legally speaking, unless you have sufficient evidence to prove otherwise.There are two different types of property for the purposes of divorce. The property that the couple purchased during marriage is called “marital property”. Property that you had before marriage or was just a gift to you from someone other than your spouse is called a “separate property”.Marital property can be divided between two spouses.Separate propertyis an asset that is owned by the premarital spouses. Any inheritance a spouse receives, even during marriage, is separate property. So are personal gifts (unless they came from another spouse or partner) and payments for personal injuries.When the court grants a divorce, the property will be divided equitably (not always equally) between the two spouses. This is decided under Equitable Distribution Law.Ajay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

Police complaint can be registered  legally but you can give written information of the attempts made by him.As a sole legal heir they do need your consent.it is for administrator to take all decision and actions, he has no power to act in place of administrator.Don’t give any consent without perusing original will.Ravi ShindeAdvocate, Hyderabad4923 Answers42 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ravi Shinde"

    "question": "Asking to sign Consent Affidavit without showing the WIll",
    "answer": "1. In the petition he has to disclose the names of all legal heirs. If any legal heir has not given a consent affidavit then the court will issue him a notice using his details provided in the petition. Upon receipt of notice the legal heir has to file a caveat with an affidavit in support stating his grounds of objections against the grant of the petition. If the brother does not disclose the details of all heirs then he will be liable for suppression of material facts and any grant obtained by him from the court by concealing facts from the court, will be liable to be revoked. So there are adequate safeguards against any tricks sought to be played by the Petitioner2. Yes even if the bequeathed property is not mutated in her name, she can still make a Will for that property. If the Will under which the property was bequeathed is not proved as per law then the second Will to the extent of that property will lapse and will be of no effect.3. Not required. Police is useless. It will say that it's a civil matter. Even if you want to place something on record, I would not suggest as it wont serve any purpose. However its your choice if you wish to write any letter to the police4. Yes the heir of the legatee will succeed to the bequest5. It's clear that the brother is having some personal interest and is using his sister as a front6.

    "answer": "Dear client,  I am sorry to hear that but in this case you must not let your mother sign the documents with going through its contents.Also, According to the laws of the country, it is not necessary to go through probate if there is no dispute regarding will. However, going through a probate is preferable as it gives court certification to the validity of the will in question. Even though your grandmother is entitled to make a will but since the title has not been transfered to her name it will create some issue.Also, you may file a police complaint in order to be on safer side.Yes, your concent will be of paramount importance in case your mother dies.An executor appointed under a Will, in effect, stands in the testator's place after death. Similarly, an administrator stands in the place of the deceased even though he or she is appointed by the court. An executor is usually appointed by name in the Will. However,  in this case since no major role is taken by your uncle it is totally admissible.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Asking to sign Consent Affidavit without showing the WIll",
    "answer": "There is no consent affidavit required to get a Will probated. The person coming up with this, has some ulterior motives to make your mother sign something which is not required. There's no provision at all for a consent affidavit to get a Will probated.Your mother's brother, under no circumstances, can lawfully get the Will probated. Only the administrator of the Will is the lawful person, and the administrator is your mother's sister.Considering 1 & 2, your mother should refuse to sign any document. In the eventuality of her passing away, you too aren't obliged to sign any document to get the Will in question probated.Wills are in the domain of civil law, so there's no scope for police complaint. Your mother should file a police complaint only if there's a threat of violence.Your mother can and should sue her brother for nuisance for repeated pesterings to sign.९८२०८९७८८४ (Nine eight two zero eight nine seven eight eight four.)Netra Mohanchandra PantAdvocate, Navi Mumbai1591 Answers5 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Netra Mohanchandra Pant"

    "answer": "Is there sufficient material here to file a case of pestering/ nuisance/ misinformation?Its contentious and involves disputed questions of facts. Unless you know the contents of the Will, its difficult to say. If the Will bequeaths the property to the brother and that is being concealed from your mother and she is being asked to file a consent affidavit then a case can be made out. Without seeing the Will not possible to sayAre the executors of the will required to show a copy of the will to the beneficiaries by law?Not as such. The duty of the executor is to protect the interest of the beneficiary. But here you dont even know who are the beneficiaries named in the WillAll the property tax etc are being paid by my mothers brother(not the executors of the will) Is this ok?He is paying it in his capacity of a co owner on behalf of all legal heirs. So that does not clothe him with the attributes of the owner. On death of testator the property vests in the executor. So he has to ideally take care of all outgoings of the property. But how is all this going to help you? Without seeing the Will how are you saying that the testator had appointed an executor in the Will?The will does not state anything about me(sole legal heir of my mother staying on the property), only talks my mother, how does the law look at that?Again this is like shooting blind shots in the air without even looking at the WillIf a Probate gets converted into a testamentary suit what time frame are we looking for resolution?takes many years which cannot be predicted.

You can become the legal heir to your mother only after her lifetime and not before that. Therefore you have no rights in the Will bequeathed property at least not during the lifetime of your mother.The probate of Will is different to that of what you mention about the testamentary suit .The time taken for disposal of probate petition cannot be predicted owing to various factors involved in it.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "1. In the given situation, you may ask your mother not to sign any paper, especially the so called consent letter without seeing the contents of the Will and confirming her benefits made in the Will.If you apprehend your maternal uncle to play any fraud on this, you may better file a suit for partition asking your mother's legitimate share out of her deceased father's property. Let she not whisper anything about the Will or even the knowledge of an existing Will in her suit for partition.She can also seek an interim injunction restraining them from alienating or encumbering the property in any manner till the disposal of of the main suit.2. Your mother can very well make a Will for the properties to which she is commanding clear and marketable title..No probate is necessary for Christian and Muslim Wills.3. No t necessary, because it is a civil matter, instead you may better file  a suit for partition.4. Yes, you are entitled to inherit your mother's share along with yor father, if living.5. The administrator of the Will alone has the rights to administer the proeprty bequeathed in the Will, hence your uncle's intervention in this regard would be considered as contrary to law/rule.6. You can take action as suggested in the first answer above.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Asking to sign Consent Affidavit without showing the WIll",
    "answer": "1. In the petition he has to disclose the names of all legal heirs. If any legal heir has not given a consent affidavit then the court will issue him a notice using his details provided in the petition. Upon receipt of notice the legal heir has to file a caveat with an affidavit in support stating his grounds of objections against the grant of the petition. If the brother does not disclose the details of all heirs then he will be liable for suppression of material facts and any grant obtained by him from the court by concealing facts from the court, will be liable to be revoked. So there are adequate safeguards against any tricks sought to be played by the Petitioner2. Yes even if the bequeathed property is not mutated in her name, she can still make a Will for that property. If the Will under which the property was bequeathed is not proved as per law then the second Will to the extent of that property will lapse and will be of no effect.3. Not required. Police is useless. It will say that it's a civil matter. Even if you want to place something on record, I would not suggest as it wont serve any purpose. However its your choice if you wish to write any letter to the police4. Yes the heir of the legatee will succeed to the bequest5. It's clear that the brother is having some personal interest and is using his sister as a front6.

    "answer": "Dear client,  I am sorry to hear that but in this case you must not let your mother sign the documents with going through its contents.Also, According to the laws of the country, it is not necessary to go through probate if there is no dispute regarding will. However, going through a probate is preferable as it gives court certification to the validity of the will in question. Even though your grandmother is entitled to make a will but since the title has not been transfered to her name it will create some issue.Also, you may file a police complaint in order to be on safer side.Yes, your concent will be of paramount importance in case your mother dies.An executor appointed under a Will, in effect, stands in the testator's place after death. Similarly, an administrator stands in the place of the deceased even though he or she is appointed by the court. An executor is usually appointed by name in the Will. However,  in this case since no major role is taken by your uncle it is totally admissible.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Asking to sign Consent Affidavit without showing the WIll",
    "answer": "There is no consent affidavit required to get a Will probated. The person coming up with this, has some ulterior motives to make your mother sign something which is not required. There's no provision at all for a consent affidavit to get a Will probated.Your mother's brother, under no circumstances, can lawfully get the Will probated. Only the administrator of the Will is the lawful person, and the administrator is your mother's sister.Considering 1 & 2, your mother should refuse to sign any document. In the eventuality of her passing away, you too aren't obliged to sign any document to get the Will in question probated.Wills are in the domain of civil law, so there's no scope for police complaint. Your mother should file a police complaint only if there's a threat of violence.Your mother can and should sue her brother for nuisance for repeated pesterings to sign.९८२०८९७८८४ (Nine eight two zero eight nine seven eight eight four.)Netra Mohanchandra PantAdvocate, Navi Mumbai1591 Answers5 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Netra Mohanchandra Pant"

    "answer": "Is there sufficient material here to file a case of pestering/ nuisance/ misinformation?Its contentious and involves disputed questions of facts. Unless you know the contents of the Will, its difficult to say. If the Will bequeaths the property to the brother and that is being concealed from your mother and she is being asked to file a consent affidavit then a case can be made out. Without seeing the Will not possible to sayAre the executors of the will required to show a copy of the will to the beneficiaries by law?Not as such. The duty of the executor is to protect the interest of the beneficiary. But here you dont even know who are the beneficiaries named in the WillAll the property tax etc are being paid by my mothers brother(not the executors of the will) Is this ok?He is paying it in his capacity of a co owner on behalf of all legal heirs. So that does not clothe him with the attributes of the owner. On death of testator the property vests in the executor. So he has to ideally take care of all outgoings of the property. But how is all this going to help you? Without seeing the Will how are you saying that the testator had appointed an executor in the Will?The will does not state anything about me(sole legal heir of my mother staying on the property), only talks my mother, how does the law look at that?Again this is like shooting blind shots in the air without even looking at the WillIf a Probate gets converted into a testamentary suit what time frame are we looking for resolution?takes many years which cannot be predicted.

    "answer": "There is no material to file a nuisance or pestering case against your mother's brother.The executor of the Will need to keep the beneficiaries informed about the benefits named in the Will.The executor of the Will is the administrator of the estates of the properties bequeathed in the Will hence there is nothing strange that the executor paying the taxes  and updating the records periodically.There is no necessity for the Will to mention everything elaborately.Your mother is the beneficiary and not you. You can become the legal heir to your mother only after her lifetime and not before that. Therefore you have no rights in the Will bequeathed property at least not during the lifetime of your mother.The probate of Will is different to that of what you mention about the testamentary suit .The time taken for disposal of probate petition cannot be predicted owing to various factors involved in it.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

You have the option to call the police by just dialing the police number 100 and police will come to the place mentioned by you in the phone call. They will come to the spot and ask you the problem and then will take the action against them. And, when they will reach the spot you should be having sufficient proof to prove the harassment by neighbors.Harassment Through NuisanceYou may be living in an apartment or in a duplex, often it happens, when you hear loud music sound from the neighbor’s house, you try to ignore that sound for as long as possible but sometimes, such noise may make life difficult. This type of nuisance is defined inSection 268 of the Indian Penal Act.Section 268 of theIndian Penal Codedefines nuisance when the person is guilty of a public nuisance when he does any act which causes injury, danger or annoyance to the public or the people in general who live or occupy the property in the neighborhood.A common nuisance is not excused on the ground that it causes some convenience or advantage.If this type of harassment is faced by you from your neighbor then, you can file an application under Section 268 of IPC in the court of magistrate.Punishment of nuisance is defined in Section 290 of IPC, which is mere Rs. 200 but the court can do much more.As a matter of fact, calling 100 is most effective as, after a visit or two from the police, such nuisance is likely to stop. In extreme cases, police may even confiscate the instruments that are used to cause nuisance like – loudspeakers or sound boxes, or drones, cameras or such other tools.Sometimes, police does not intervene despite laws being there as they do not like extra work on their plate or because the other party is very influential. In such cases, you may need to take help of legal experts. We recommend you get in touch with ClikLawyer.com.Harassment Through MischiefWhen you live in a duplex, you are sharing a common wall. If your neighbor starts construction in that common wall you do not have the right to stop him from constructing because it is his legal right but if during the construction work your property gets damaged, you can ask him to compensate for the loss suffered by youbut if your neighbor refuses to pay you the amount then you can file a case under–Section 425 of IPC which statesthat whoever with intent to cause, or knowing that he is likely to cause, wrongful loss or damage to the public or to any person, causes the destruction of any property, or any such change in any property or in the situation thereof as destroys or diminishes its value or utility, or affects it injuriously, commits mischief.You can file suit for declaration and mandatory injunction in a civil court as well.You can claim damages in the same suit.THE KARNATAKA POLICE ACT,(similar State Police Act also existing in each State)Punishment of certain street offences and nuisance.—(1) In any local area to which the Government by notification in the official Gazette from time to time extends this sub-section or any clause thereof, whoever, contrary thereto,— (a) without lawful excuse drives along, or keeps standing in, any street a vehicle of any description or drags or pushes in any street, a vehicle of any description other than a bicycle at any time between half an hour after sunset and one hour before sunrise without a sufficient light or lights;

It is the fundamental of a person to move anywhere he likes including foreign countries. One's such personal freedom and liberty cannot be abridged.In the case ofRahul Surana vs. The Serious Fraud Investigation Office & Ors., W.P. No. 2477 of 2020, MANU/TN/1605/2022, the Hon'ble Madras High Court after considering that even after the elapse of three years no concrete evidences have been found to implicate the Petitioner; there have been no instances when the Petitioner has evaded summons/notices calling for his attendance/appearance; and also no material is placed in support of the bald assertion that the Petitioner is a flight risk and there is no tangible material available to deny the Petitioner of his Fundamental Right, set-asides the LOC.From the above it is clear that you have to appraoch either the officer opened the LOC against you or the court.  Therefore it would be better you appraoch high court with a writ petition to cancel the LOC for the reasons you rely upon, get the certified copy of the court order and then travel to any country, you will not be stopped by airport immigration authorities even if they don't get the confirmation of cancelling the LOC against you."

If any legal heir has not given a consent affidavit then the court will issue him a notice using his details provided in the petition. Upon receipt of notice the legal heir has to file a caveat with an affidavit in support stating his grounds of objections against the grant of the petition. If the brother does not disclose the details of all heirs then he will be liable for suppression of material facts and any grant obtained by him from the court by concealing facts from the court, will be liable to be revoked. So there are adequate safeguards against any tricks sought to be played by the Petitioner2. Yes even if the bequeathed property is not mutated in her name, she can still make a Will for that property. If the Will under which the property was bequeathed is not proved as per law then the second Will to the extent of that property will lapse and will be of no effect.3. Not required. Police is useless. It will say that it's a civil matter. Even if you want to place something on record, I would not suggest as it wont serve any purpose. However its your choice if you wish to write any letter to the police4. Yes the heir of the legatee will succeed to the bequest5.

There's no provision at all for a consent affidavit to get a Will probated.Your mother's brother, under no circumstances, can lawfully get the Will probated. Only the administrator of the Will is the lawful person, and the administrator is your mother's sister.Considering 1 & 2, your mother should refuse to sign any document. In the eventuality of her passing away, you too aren't obliged to sign any document to get the Will in question probated.Wills are in the domain of civil law, so there's no scope for police complaint. Your mother should file a police complaint only if there's a threat of violence.Your mother can and should sue her brother for nuisance for repeated pesterings to sign.९८२०८९७८८४ (Nine eight two zero eight nine seven eight eight four.)Netra Mohanchandra PantAdvocate, Navi Mumbai1591 Answers5 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Netra Mohanchandra Pant"

Perumal Samy Reddy v. State, 2013 SCC OnLine Mad 4092, the Madras High Court while setting aside an LOC, held as under:It is basic that merely because a person is involved in a criminal case, he is not denude of his Fundamental Rights. It is the fundamental of a person to move anywhere he likes including foreign countries. One's such personal freedom and liberty cannot be abridged.In the case ofRahul Surana vs. The Serious Fraud Investigation Office & Ors., W.P. No. 2477 of 2020, MANU/TN/1605/2022, the Hon'ble Madras High Court after considering that even after the elapse of three years no concrete evidences have been found to implicate the Petitioner; there have been no instances when the Petitioner has evaded summons/notices calling for his attendance/appearance; and also no material is placed in support of the bald assertion that the Petitioner is a flight risk and there is no tangible material available to deny the Petitioner of his Fundamental Right, set-asides the LOC.From the above it is clear that you have to appraoch either the officer opened the LOC against you or the court.  Therefore it would be better you appraoch high court with a writ petition to cancel the LOC for the reasons you rely upon, get the certified copy of the court order and then travel to any country, you will not be stopped by airport immigration authorities even if they don't get the confirmation of cancelling the LOC against you."

    "answer": "Dear client,  I am sorry to hear that.1. The simple answer to your 1st query is yes you can live with another woman, untill you get divorce, you can enter into any such relationship. However,  in your case it might go against you if your wife proves that you are living with another woman and everything was your fault.2. Moreover, an appeal can be made only when the judgement is passed and not otherwise.3.A minor cannot sue by himself nor can he be sued without being represented by someone else. This someone else is called a \"next friend\" when the minor is the plaintiff in an action, and is called a \"guardian ad litem\" when the minor is a defendant.4.yes, you can ask to transfer your case.5.if she is not earning then she can ask for alimony or maintenance.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Wrong property measurement mentioned in title deed",
    "answer": "Without any base you cannot confirm the measurement you believe to be the correct one and the one mentioned in the registered deed is wrong.What is the proof you have to prove that the measurement made in the 1953 registered deed is incorrect and why the person who purchased the property had not taken any action to correct the same immediately or at least anytime during his lifetime.He is reported to have died in the year 2006, whereas the legal heirs who succeed the estate also did not bother to rectify the measurement if it was true.Therefore the claim made as wrong measurement at this stage may not be entertained even by court if you intend to take up the matter through court.You say that the property was purchased through an auction sale made by court, hence you have to approach court alone to execute a rectification deed based on the original document containing the correct measurement as what you say now.If you propose to sell the property now, you cannot add the measurement at your whims, you have to mention the measurements what is found in the registered sale deed held in your possession.You cannot add or delete any item that is found in the sale deed which you rely to be the base document to execute the sale deed in favor of the prospective buyer.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "The term \"joint tenancy\" refers to a legal arrangement in which two or more people own a property together, each with equal rights and obligations. Joint tenancies can be created by married and non-married couples, friends, relatives, and business associates.Joint tenants must obtain equal shares of the property with the same deed, at the same time. The terms of either a joint tenancy or tenancy in common are spelt out in the deed, title, or other legally binding property ownership document. The default ownership characterization for married couples is a joint tenancy in some states and tenancy in common in others.Tenancy in common refers to ownership over a certain property by two individuals without any right of survivorshipwhen a property is owned jointly, and it is a 'tenancy-in-common' arrangement, in such a case a co owner dies, his or her share of property DOES NOT go to the co owners automatically.The share of the property is transferred to the legal heirs of the deceased co owner.When a property is owned by joint tenants, the interest of a deceased owner gets transferred to the remaining surviving owners.Tenants in common have no rights of survivorship. Unless the deceased owner's will or other instrument specifies that their interest in the property is to be divided among the surviving owners, a deceased person's interest belongs to the estate.If the deed specifically mentions about the joint tenancy then she can acquire the sharfe of the other owner on the basis of survivorshipT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "From your subsequent post it can be seen that you have not read the recital so the GPA deed properly or perhaps you have misinterpreted them as per your understanding and are3 standing confused over the issue.If there is a mention about the schedule of property to be sold or alienated either by gift deed or sale deed, and if it has been stated that the power agent can transfer/alienate the property in any manner as prescribed in the deed and to whomsoever he or she may decide to, then this deed can be considered as a valid deed empowering the power agent to proceed with the proposed transaction by a registered deed in favor of the prospective purchaser.Hence you were advised to obtain a proper legal opinion from a local lawyer by producing the relevant property papers including the GPAdeed and proceed only if recommended.If you hesitate to spend money on legal opinion at this stage then you may be subjected to suffer heavy loss at a later stage if the title is defective or disputed in the court of law by way of litigation expenses.Choice is yours becasue any expert lawyer of this forum can render opinion to your issue limiting himself/herself to0 the extent of the information furnished by you without knowing whether the information furnished by you is true or fabricated to your convenience.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Joint Ownership 1 Survivor, Tenancy: Joint, Common, or Entirety",
    "answer": "The term \"joint tenancy\" refers to a legal arrangement in which two or more people own a property together, each with equal rights and obligations. Joint tenancies can be created by married and non-married couples, friends, relatives, and business associates.Joint tenants must obtain equal shares of the property with the same deed, at the same time. The terms of either a joint tenancy or tenancy in common are spelt out in the deed, title, or other legally binding property ownership document. The default ownership characterization for married couples is a joint tenancy in some states and tenancy in common in others.Tenancy in common refers to ownership over a certain property by two individuals without any right of survivorshipwhen a property is owned jointly, and it is a 'tenancy-in-common' arrangement, in such a case a co owner dies, his or her share of property DOES NOT go to the co owners automatically.The share of the property is transferred to the legal heirs of the deceased co owner.When a property is owned by joint tenants, the interest of a deceased owner gets transferred to the remaining surviving owners.Tenants in common have no rights of survivorship. Unless the deceased owner's will or other instrument specifies that their interest in the property is to be divided among the surviving owners, a deceased person's interest belongs to the estate.If the deed specifically mentions about the joint tenancy then she can acquire the sharfe of the other owner on the basis of survivorshipT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Joint Ownership 1 Survivor, Tenancy: Joint, Common, or Entirety",
    "answer": "The term \"joint tenancy\" refers to a legal arrangement in which two or more people own a property together, each with equal rights and obligations. Joint tenancies can be created by married and non-married couples, friends, relatives, and business associates.Joint tenants must obtain equal shares of the property with the same deed, at the same time. The terms of either a joint tenancy or tenancy in common are spelt out in the deed, title, or other legally binding property ownership document. The default ownership characterization for married couples is a joint tenancy in some states and tenancy in common in others.Tenancy in common refers to ownership over a certain property by two individuals without any right of survivorshipwhen a property is owned jointly, and it is a 'tenancy-in-common' arrangement, in such a case a co owner dies, his or her share of property DOES NOT go to the co owners automatically.The share of the property is transferred to the legal heirs of the deceased co owner.When a property is owned by joint tenants, the interest of a deceased owner gets transferred to the remaining surviving owners.Tenants in common have no rights of survivorship. Unless the deceased owner's will or other instrument specifies that their interest in the property is to be divided among the surviving owners, a deceased person's interest belongs to the estate.If the deed specifically mentions about the joint tenancy then she can acquire the sharfe of the other owner on the basis of survivorshipT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

Such an agreement will be valid for three years from the execution date.An unregistered sale agreement validity period is of 3 years from the date mentioned to execute. Any shortage of stamp charges is paid through the Court's order.

    "question": "Wrong property measurement mentioned in title deed",
    "answer": "Without any base you cannot confirm the measurement you believe to be the correct one and the one mentioned in the registered deed is wrong.What is the proof you have to prove that the measurement made in the 1953 registered deed is incorrect and why the person who purchased the property had not taken any action to correct the same immediately or at least anytime during his lifetime.He is reported to have died in the year 2006, whereas the legal heirs who succeed the estate also did not bother to rectify the measurement if it was true.Therefore the claim made as wrong measurement at this stage may not be entertained even by court if you intend to take up the matter through court.You say that the property was purchased through an auction sale made by court, hence you have to approach court alone to execute a rectification deed based on the original document containing the correct measurement as what you say now.If you propose to sell the property now, you cannot add the measurement at your whims, you have to mention the measurements what is found in the registered sale deed held in your possession.You cannot add or delete any item that is found in the sale deed which you rely to be the base document to execute the sale deed in favor of the prospective buyer.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

In the circumstances, execute a fresh PoA and get it either 'attested' by the Indian Dy. High Commission OR 'notarized' in the UK, and send it to your mother.

Secondly there is a common problem with these builders that they exercise immense delay. In both the situations if agreement is registered you will gain an additional weight in the court of law.

How is consideration value calculated?Rs. 100 Bond will go and registration fee can be found in registration office where your property is situated.4.

    "question": "Transfer of a part of ancestral property surreptitiously by one of the heirs",
    "answer": "1. In the given burden of workload, the sub registrar has no time to go very deep into the title confirmation of the seller, especially if this is an inherited property. Besides, such works are carried out by the crooked brokers corrupting the sub registrar, hence such  grave mistakes may tend to happen. The solution for the aggrieved is that he can submit an application to the District registrar venting out his grievances with the support of documentary evidences and request for cancellation of the registration or he can file a suit  before civil  court for remedy.2. The remedy for this has been explained in the above answer. The so called void transaction cannot be cancelled  by the sub registrar.3. Since the property devolves on all the legal heirs/successors in interest, the sale of entire property by only one of the legal heir or few legal haiers without taking consent from other legal heirs is not valid in law, the aggrieved shareholders can file a suit for partition and also seek for declaration of the sale as null and void in the same suit.4. There are plenty of case laws in this regard.5. If you file a suit for partition you can seek the reliefs of declaration of the sale deed as null and void as well as an order of injunction against the purchasers as additional reliefs.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Transfer of a part of ancestral property surreptitiously by one of the heirs",
    "answer": "1. It is an error on the part of Sub registrar to not do the due-diligence before the transfer of title. It is his/ her duty to verify the title and after due verification of title only, he can execute the transfer.2. According to a Latin maxim, Nemo dat quod non-habet which means that no one can transfer a better title than he himself has, only the owner of the goods can pass the lawful ownership or title of goods to the buyer. So, such sale is void is the seller doesn't have rights to sell more than her undivided share in the property. Sut sale can be challenged in the court of law and can be sat aside.3. Having mere possessiom of the property in case of an ancestral property does not transfer any title on the person more than what they already posess. Also, they also claim adverse possession against family members.5. You can file a suit for injunction and cancellation of sale deed on the abovementioned grounds, along with an application seeking interim stay on creation of any third party interest or alienation of the property.Siddharth JainAdvocate, New Delhi6464 Answers102 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Siddharth Jain"

    "answer": "Sub-Registrar is not bound to delve deep in to the title of executant of sale deed. He only prima facie ascertains the title to executant.Such transaction is absolutely void and can be set aside only if other legal heirs seeks cancellation of it.Possession of any portion or whole of the property does not confer any right to sell the property of determines his/her share. A legal heir can valid sale his share only after due partition of property.All the law of succession to property of Hindu revolves around such cases. There are hundreds of such cases.File a suit for partition and separate possession ancestral Add all the coparceners and purchasers of property as defendants to the suit.

    "question": "Transfer of a part of ancestral property surreptitiously by one of the heirs",
    "answer": "1. In the given burden of workload, the sub registrar has no time to go very deep into the title confirmation of the seller, especially if this is an inherited property. Besides, such works are carried out by the crooked brokers corrupting the sub registrar, hence such  grave mistakes may tend to happen. The solution for the aggrieved is that he can submit an application to the District registrar venting out his grievances with the support of documentary evidences and request for cancellation of the registration or he can file a suit  before civil  court for remedy.2. The remedy for this has been explained in the above answer. The so called void transaction cannot be cancelled  by the sub registrar.3. Since the property devolves on all the legal heirs/successors in interest, the sale of entire property by only one of the legal heir or few legal haiers without taking consent from other legal heirs is not valid in law, the aggrieved shareholders can file a suit for partition and also seek for declaration of the sale as null and void in the same suit.4. There are plenty of case laws in this regard.5. If you file a suit for partition you can seek the reliefs of declaration of the sale deed as null and void as well as an order of injunction against the purchasers as additional reliefs.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Transfer of a part of ancestral property surreptitiously by one of the heirs",
    "answer": "1. It is an error on the part of Sub registrar to not do the due-diligence before the transfer of title. It is his/ her duty to verify the title and after due verification of title only, he can execute the transfer.2. According to a Latin maxim, Nemo dat quod non-habet which means that no one can transfer a better title than he himself has, only the owner of the goods can pass the lawful ownership or title of goods to the buyer. So, such sale is void is the seller doesn't have rights to sell more than her undivided share in the property. Sut sale can be challenged in the court of law and can be sat aside.3. Having mere possessiom of the property in case of an ancestral property does not transfer any title on the person more than what they already posess. Also, they also claim adverse possession against family members.5. You can file a suit for injunction and cancellation of sale deed on the abovementioned grounds, along with an application seeking interim stay on creation of any third party interest or alienation of the property.Siddharth JainAdvocate, New Delhi6464 Answers102 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Siddharth Jain"

    "answer": "Sub-Registrar is not bound to delve deep in to the title of executant of sale deed. He only prima facie ascertains the title to executant.Such transaction is absolutely void and can be set aside only if other legal heirs seeks cancellation of it.Possession of any portion or whole of the property does not confer any right to sell the property of determines his/her share. A legal heir can valid sale his share only after due partition of property.All the law of succession to property of Hindu revolves around such cases. There are hundreds of such cases.File a suit for partition and separate possession ancestral Add all the coparceners and purchasers of property as defendants to the suit. Seek cancelation of sale deed executed in favour of third parties. Produce the certified copies of sale deeds in Court. Obtain injunction against further transfer of property by legal heirs.

    "question": "Transfer of a part of ancestral property surreptitiously by one of the heirs",
    "answer": "1. In the given burden of workload, the sub registrar has no time to go very deep into the title confirmation of the seller, especially if this is an inherited property. Besides, such works are carried out by the crooked brokers corrupting the sub registrar, hence such  grave mistakes may tend to happen. The solution for the aggrieved is that he can submit an application to the District registrar venting out his grievances with the support of documentary evidences and request for cancellation of the registration or he can file a suit  before civil  court for remedy.2. The remedy for this has been explained in the above answer. The so called void transaction cannot be cancelled  by the sub registrar.3. Since the property devolves on all the legal heirs/successors in interest, the sale of entire property by only one of the legal heir or few legal haiers without taking consent from other legal heirs is not valid in law, the aggrieved shareholders can file a suit for partition and also seek for declaration of the sale as null and void in the same suit.4. There are plenty of case laws in this regard.5. If you file a suit for partition you can seek the reliefs of declaration of the sale deed as null and void as well as an order of injunction against the purchasers as additional reliefs.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Transfer of a part of ancestral property surreptitiously by one of the heirs",
    "answer": "1. It is an error on the part of Sub registrar to not do the due-diligence before the transfer of title. It is his/ her duty to verify the title and after due verification of title only, he can execute the transfer.2. According to a Latin maxim, Nemo dat quod non-habet which means that no one can transfer a better title than he himself has, only the owner of the goods can pass the lawful ownership or title of goods to the buyer. So, such sale is void is the seller doesn't have rights to sell more than her undivided share in the property. Sut sale can be challenged in the court of law and can be sat aside.3. Having mere possessiom of the property in case of an ancestral property does not transfer any title on the person more than what they already posess. Also, they also claim adverse possession against family members.5. You can file a suit for injunction and cancellation of sale deed on the abovementioned grounds, along with an application seeking interim stay on creation of any third party interest or alienation of the property.Siddharth JainAdvocate, New Delhi6464 Answers102 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Siddharth Jain"

    "question": "Transfer of a part of ancestral property surreptitiously by one of the heirs",
    "answer": "1. In the given burden of workload, the sub registrar has no time to go very deep into the title confirmation of the seller, especially if this is an inherited property. Besides, such works are carried out by the crooked brokers corrupting the sub registrar, hence such  grave mistakes may tend to happen. The solution for the aggrieved is that he can submit an application to the District registrar venting out his grievances with the support of documentary evidences and request for cancellation of the registration or he can file a suit  before civil  court for remedy.2. The remedy for this has been explained in the above answer. The so called void transaction cannot be cancelled  by the sub registrar.3. Since the property devolves on all the legal heirs/successors in interest, the sale of entire property by only one of the legal heir or few legal haiers without taking consent from other legal heirs is not valid in law, the aggrieved shareholders can file a suit for partition and also seek for declaration of the sale as null and void in the same suit.4. There are plenty of case laws in this regard.5. If you file a suit for partition you can seek the reliefs of declaration of the sale deed as null and void as well as an order of injunction against the purchasers as additional reliefs.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Transfer of a part of ancestral property surreptitiously by one of the heirs",
    "answer": "1. It is an error on the part of Sub registrar to not do the due-diligence before the transfer of title. It is his/ her duty to verify the title and after due verification of title only, he can execute the transfer.2. According to a Latin maxim, Nemo dat quod non-habet which means that no one can transfer a better title than he himself has, only the owner of the goods can pass the lawful ownership or title of goods to the buyer. So, such sale is void is the seller doesn't have rights to sell more than her undivided share in the property. Sut sale can be challenged in the court of law and can be sat aside.3. Having mere possessiom of the property in case of an ancestral property does not transfer any title on the person more than what they already posess. Also, they also claim adverse possession against family members.5. You can file a suit for injunction and cancellation of sale deed on the abovementioned grounds, along with an application seeking interim stay on creation of any third party interest or alienation of the property.Siddharth JainAdvocate, New Delhi6464 Answers102 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Siddharth Jain"

    "answer": "Sir different lawyers will have different viewsNo 2 lawyers would think alikeSome may have replied on basis of the legal provision and some just like thatAs regards articulation of the law, the law is clearly stated in s. 33(1)(c) which you have reproduced aboveNow if the registrar is overlooking that then what can the lawyers do ??!!So please chill !If the registrar is acting funny then for that you need to ask him the law under which he claims that the poa has to be 'registered'. Tell him to give proper reasons for not accepting the poa, in writingFrom what I can gather I think the poa contains a power to sell clauseNow in Maharashtra state if a poa contains a power to sell and such poa is granted to a specified relative then it attracts nominal duty without need for registrationWhereas if the poa containing power to sell clause is granted to a non relative then it attracts full stamp duty and also has to be registeredWhat is the applicable state law in UP that only a local lawyer will be able to tell youBut the central law applicable to all Indian states is very clear that if the principal is outside India then he can sign the poa before the consulate/embassyYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "1.  There's no need for you to travel to India for adjudicating/registering the already attested POA in U.K. and subsequently Notarised. The same POA has to be adjudicated in the jurisdictional District/Sub-Registrar's Office in U.P. After this procedure , your mother can deal with your property in U.P. armed with the POA.2.  Registrar is asking for adjudicated/registered POA and not accepting the U.K. attested, Notarised POA, as per the Hon'ble Supreme Court 's judgement of 2011, which has superceded Section 33 of Registration Act 1908, which you have quoted.3.  NO NEED FOR YOU TO TRAVEL TO INDIA, the same POA can be adjudicated/registered in U.P., without your physical presence.Shashidhar S.

    "question": "NRI POA for sale transaction",
    "answer": "You have not followed the correct procedures that was suggested in this regard.If any transaction in respect of an immovable property is to be carried out through a power of attorney agent in India, the principal should get the deed registered before the sub registrar where he resides.If a power deed was executed in a foreign country with attestation by the embassy official of that country, then that deed should be sent through a sealed cover to the power agent in India, who will then present it before the sub registrar where he resides.The sub registrar will open the cover and after verification of the correct compliance of the procedures followed therein, he will sign and put his seal endorsing adjudication of the power deed.Once the registrar has completed the adjudication process, the power agent can proceed with the transactions related to the immovable property.Please note that in order to get the job easily done at India, you approached a notary public for attestation of the deed which was already attested by embassy official at Edinburgh.Thus it's your fault of avoiding the registrar or following the proper procedure in India in this regard.There's no point in expressing your grievances if you are at wrong, instead you still can regularise it by adopting the proper procedures now.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "It is true that POA attested by Indian consulate and then notarised back in India is good enough to be valid for all matters in India under Section .33(1)(c) of the Registration Act, 1908. The  officials  in U.P. might have put off by notification of POA in Thane overlooking the  attestation by Indian Embassy. Submit your document for Registrar with attested POA and ask them to reject the  registration as POA is notarized in Thane. They cannot do that as there is lengthy procedure for rejection of registration giving legal and valid causes for rejection.

    "answer": "Since the JVA clauses have restricted the builder to mortgage the property in any manner either now or in future, you may better not agree or accede to trhe request made by the builder in this regard.He has to honor the conditions of the agreement already entered with you.it is not your problem that he is facing financial constraints, let him look for finances through his own sources.What if the builder after taking mortgage loan is vanishing from the spot leaving the construction incomplete and also without making any arrangement for repaying the mortgage loan, then your property may be brought to auction for default in repayment done by the builder.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "For any builder to take a loan for construction of flats, the underlying land has to be mortgaged, it being the primary security. As and when flats are constructed and sold, the builder has to repay the loan and get the proportionate share of land released by the lender. This is the actual practice. The loan agreement needs to be perused for proper advice.

In the circumstances, execute a fresh PoA and get it either 'attested' by the Indian Dy. High Commission OR 'notarized' in the UK, and send it to your mother.

    "answer": "Respect Sir, Greetings !!!Having learnt your situation meticulously, Kindly observe my recommendations :1. Does this construction agreement have to be registered or is notarisation sufficient?It is not mandatory for registration but do register it because there is highest possibility for misunderstanding between dialogues exchanged pertaining to financial and other terms. Secondly there is a common problem with these builders that they exercise immense delay. In both the situations if agreement is registered you will gain an additional weight in the court of law. Note that you take service of expert real estate lawyer.2. If registration needs to be done, is that in addition to notarisation or can it be done on non-notarised document?As mentioned above, registry will surely gain weight over notary. I highly recommend for registry.3. What is the stamp paper value to be used and does a consideration value need to be added to it? How is consideration value calculated?Rs. 100 Bond will go and registration fee can be found in registration office where your property is situated.4. Do I have to pay any stamp duty if registering the construction agreement?Absolutely Yes, there will be a stamp duty which will vary upon jurisdiction.The fee that you will pay is nothing when campare of additional head aces you suffer on an account of disputes hereinafter.Because I have dealt with several cases pertaining to your situation.

    "answer": "If the name of the vendor do not match with the previous related document to that of his identity proof, then you can insist him to produce the correct identity proof which is matching with the name mentioned in the sale deed that he relies upon to sell this property.If the sale deed has already been executed then you can issue a legal notice to him to either produce substantial documentary proofs to prove that he is the same person who  is mentioned in the sale deed or else to rectify the same by executing a registered rectification deed.If he fails to do so or do not want to cooperate after selling the property then you can take legal action through civil court besides lodging a criminal complaint against him for cheating by fraudulently selling the property belonging to someone else.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Vendor name misspelled during registration",
    "answer": "- As per law, if a deed contains mistakes like mis-spellings in names, description of property, these mistakes can later be corrected through rectification deeds.- A deed can be rectified at any time since there is no limitation for rectification. Whenever an error found out in a deed, the parties can proceed with rectification of the error at any time.- Since, there is an error in the vendor name in your registered Sale deed; hence it comes under the typographical error and it can be rectified after executing a Rectification deed.- The registration charges and stamp duty for typographical errors are usually around Rs. 100.- Further, the presence of vendor and vendee is necessary before the Registrar for the said rectification, hence even the last deed can be rectified if both the parties are in existence.- Otherwise ,if the last deed not rectified then the latest may create trouble at the time of selling the property.- However, the said vendor can execute an affidavit and can publish in two newspapers after mentioning that both the names are same and of one person.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

You have not followed up the demands properly.You should have made a demand for settlement of your salary arrears, PF and gratuity payments  by sending a legal demand notice after your resignation if the employer had not entertained your personal letter.The emails sent by you would not be recognised as correspondence, hence it is always better to have the correspondences in writing and sent by registered post so that this can be produced as evidence at the time of the dispute referred before concerned authorities or court.2. You can  give a maximum period of 15 days for settlement of the due to you, but make sure you send the demand notice by registered post instead of adopting the fancy email correspondence alone.3. Without any evidence for the accident or medical certificate for the illness due to the accident you cannot claim any compensation, your email communication in this regard is not a substantial evidence for getting your claim settled.4. Bering a doctor by profession, you may not be covered under labor laws, hence you may have to either file a recovery suit in  the civil court or file a writ petition before high court.As per section 8 of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972:If the amount of gratuity payable under this Act is not paid by the employer,within the prescribed time, to the person entitled thereto, the controllingauthority shall, on an application made to it in this behalf by the aggrievedperson, issue a certificate for that amount to the Collector, who shall recoverthe same, together with compound interest thereon at such rate as the CentralGovernment may, by notification, specify,] from the date of expiry of theprescribed time, as arrears of land revenue and pay the same to the personentitled thereto :Provided that the controlling authority shall, before issuing a certificateunder this section, give the employer a reasonable opportunity of showingcause against the issue of such certificate:Provided further that the amount of interest payable under this section shall,in no case exceed the amount of gratuity payable under this Act.6. The calculation for this is:Gratuity = Average salary (basic + DA) * ½ * Number of service years7. The Gratuity calculation formula is:Gratuity = (15 × last drawn salary × working tenure)/30.8.

Does this construction agreement have to be registered or is notarisation sufficient?It is not mandatory for registration but do register it because there is highest possibility for misunderstanding between dialogues exchanged pertaining to financial and other terms. Secondly there is a common problem with these builders that they exercise immense delay. In both the situations if agreement is registered you will gain an additional weight in the court of law. Note that you take service of expert real estate lawyer.2. If registration needs to be done, is that in addition to notarisation or can it be done on non-notarised document?As mentioned above, registry will surely gain weight over notary. I highly recommend for registry.3. What is the stamp paper value to be used and does a consideration value need to be added to it? How is consideration value calculated?Rs. 100 Bond will go and registration fee can be found in registration office where your property is situated.4. Do I have to pay any stamp duty if registering the construction agreement?Absolutely Yes, there will be a stamp duty which will vary upon jurisdiction.The fee that you will pay is nothing when campare of additional head aces you suffer on an account of disputes hereinafter.Because I have dealt with several cases pertaining to your situation.

    "answer": "1.  Even if you are the highest bidder and have paid the entire bid amount, since there is a stay granted by high court, the bank will not be able to furnish the sal certificate nor it will be able to take physical possession of the property until the stay is vacated.If you are not willing to continue with this then you may issue a legal notice to the bank to either handover the possession of the property along with the sale certificate or refund the entire amount with interest within a time period that may be stipulated in the legal notice addressed to the bank.2. Until and unless proper and prompt follow up action is taken by the bank, the stay cannot be vacated so soon, hence you may decide.3. The borrower has already approached high court with some reason, and the court also has accepted the same, so the best option before you is to implead yourself in the pending case as necessary  party to the case and vent your grievances and objections to the case filed by the borrower against the bank in this regardT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "To inquire if the Deed of Compromise exists and if so, can it be executed",
    "answer": "i am assuming that the subject flat was an ownership flat and not a tenanted propertythe building was demolished because it had become dilapidated and dangerous. so the demolition was done by a human act and not by an act of Godif the demolition is not due to act of God [like earthquake, flood, etc.] then the rights of the flat owners would continue to subsist. they would not vanish in thin air as told to you by your lawyer. i disagree with your lawyer on that. i think what your lawyer meant was that the flat owners will have right over the land on which the old building stood. If he meant that then it is correct, because using the FSI of the land, a new building will be constructed in which rehab flats would be allotted to the occupants of the old buildingnow since your right in the old flat [which does not exist anymore] continues and subsist even despite the demolition of the building, you are entitled to a new rehab flat in the new building to be constructed by the builder on the land on which the old building was standingsince you do no wish to claim that new rehab flat as you have to bear certain cost of construction, you can very well give up your rights in favour of the builder for that rehab flat against payment of a lump sum consideration by the builder to youthis agreement can very well be recorded in the Deed of Compromise to be executed and signed with the builderyou can book a paid phone consultation with me. kanoon will provide you my details like mobile and email ID. Plz fix an appointment with me after paying the phone consultation charges. Any thing required to be done pursuant to the document to be signed between you and the builder, that will be charged extrahowever i would advise you to pay the construction cost to the builder rather than surrendering your rights in the new rehab flat because the cost of the new flat would be much higher than the cost of construction that would have to pay to the builder for this project. so think on those lines and then take an informed decision.Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "1. You have not followed up the demands properly.You should have made a demand for settlement of your salary arrears, PF and gratuity payments  by sending a legal demand notice after your resignation if the employer had not entertained your personal letter.The emails sent by you would not be recognised as correspondence, hence it is always better to have the correspondences in writing and sent by registered post so that this can be produced as evidence at the time of the dispute referred before concerned authorities or court.2. You can  give a maximum period of 15 days for settlement of the due to you, but make sure you send the demand notice by registered post instead of adopting the fancy email correspondence alone.3. Without any evidence for the accident or medical certificate for the illness due to the accident you cannot claim any compensation, your email communication in this regard is not a substantial evidence for getting your claim settled.4. Bering a doctor by profession, you may not be covered under labor laws, hence you may have to either file a recovery suit in  the civil court or file a writ petition before high court.As per section 8 of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972:If the amount of gratuity payable under this Act is not paid by the employer,within the prescribed time, to the person entitled thereto, the controllingauthority shall, on an application made to it in this behalf by the aggrievedperson, issue a certificate for that amount to the Collector, who shall recoverthe same, together with compound interest thereon at such rate as the CentralGovernment may, by notification, specify,] from the date of expiry of theprescribed time, as arrears of land revenue and pay the same to the personentitled thereto :Provided that the controlling authority shall, before issuing a certificateunder this section, give the employer a reasonable opportunity of showingcause against the issue of such certificate:Provided further that the amount of interest payable under this section shall,in no case exceed the amount of gratuity payable under this Act.6. The calculation for this is:Gratuity = Average salary (basic + DA) * ½ * Number of service years7. The Gratuity calculation formula is:Gratuity = (15 × last drawn salary × working tenure)/30.8.

    "answer": "If the name of the vendor do not match with the previous related document to that of his identity proof, then you can insist him to produce the correct identity proof which is matching with the name mentioned in the sale deed that he relies upon to sell this property.If the sale deed has already been executed then you can issue a legal notice to him to either produce substantial documentary proofs to prove that he is the same person who  is mentioned in the sale deed or else to rectify the same by executing a registered rectification deed.If he fails to do so or do not want to cooperate after selling the property then you can take legal action through civil court besides lodging a criminal complaint against him for cheating by fraudulently selling the property belonging to someone else.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Vendor name misspelled during registration",
    "answer": "- As per law, if a deed contains mistakes like mis-spellings in names, description of property, these mistakes can later be corrected through rectification deeds.- A deed can be rectified at any time since there is no limitation for rectification. Whenever an error found out in a deed, the parties can proceed with rectification of the error at any time.- Since, there is an error in the vendor name in your registered Sale deed; hence it comes under the typographical error and it can be rectified after executing a Rectification deed.- The registration charges and stamp duty for typographical errors are usually around Rs. 100.- Further, the presence of vendor and vendee is necessary before the Registrar for the said rectification, hence even the last deed can be rectified if both the parties are in existence.- Otherwise ,if the last deed not rectified then the latest may create trouble at the time of selling the property.- However, the said vendor can execute an affidavit and can publish in two newspapers after mentioning that both the names are same and of one person.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

Until and unless proper and prompt follow up action is taken by the bank, the stay cannot be vacated so soon, hence you may decide.3.
