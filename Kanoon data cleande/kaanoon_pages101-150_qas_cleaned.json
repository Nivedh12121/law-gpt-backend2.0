    "answer": "I understand this is a deeply personal and emotionally draining phase, and I appreciate your courage in taking the first step toward clarity and resolution.Here’s a structured legal insight into your rights and options underHindu Marriage Lawandchild custody principles, tailored to your concerns:🔹1. Can You File for Divorce – Despite Your Husband’s Refusal?Yes.Under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, you can initiate divorce proceedingseven if your husband is unwilling, on valid legal grounds such as:Mental cruelty and incompatibility(Section 13(1)(ia))Breakdown of marriagewith no chance of reconciliationEven though there is a past extra-marital involvement, the court will not prevent you fromseeking divorce, especially if the marriage is irretrievably broken and you have suffered emotionally.🔹2. Will the Alleged Adultery Impact Your Child Custody Rights?In family courts,child custody is NOT about punishing either parent. The focus is always:🔸 “What is in the best interest of the child?”Unless it is proven that you arean unfit or abusive parent, yourpast personal relationshipwillnot automatically disqualify youfrom having custody or visitation rights.Also:Merephotos, chats, and hotel bookingsmay suggest a relationship, butmay not be enough to conclusively prove adulteryin court unless there's concrete evidence like eyewitness accounts or admissions.⚖️Indian courts are moving toward a progressive, child-centric view, and do not take away parenting rights purely due to a consensual adult relationship that didn’t harm the child.🔹3. Types of Custody You Can SeekYou can claim any of the following:Full physical custody, especially if the child is attached to you or still a minorJoint custody, with child residing primarily with you and periodic access to the fatherVisitation rights, if shared parenting is possibleThe court also looks into:Child’s age and preference (if over 9–10 years)Stability and emotional comfort of the homeEducation and upbringing environment✅ You can also seekinterim custodyduring the case andmaintenance for the childunder Section125 CrPCor Guardians and Wards Act.🔹4. Practical Legal Steps You Can Take NowHere’s what I recommend as your next move:✅1. Start with Consultation & Case StrategyWe’ll draft your divorce petition based onmental crueltyand irretrievable breakdown. You need not file on adultery grounds.✅2. File for Custody SimultaneouslyIn the same family court, you can requestinterim custody and permanent custodyof your child.✅3. Keep All Evidence Ready – Yours and HisWe’ll organize your records ofhis mental tortureand prepare a defense if he uses your past affair against you out of vengeance.✅4. Mediation OptionYou can also explore court-sponsored mediation, where terms of custody, separation, and maintenance can be discussed—without heavy courtroom trauma.📌 Final WordYou have thefull right to exit a toxic marriage, andcourts will not ignore your role as a motherbased on personal mistakes if you’ve otherwise acted in good faith and responsibly. Your strength lies in preparing early, legally, and emotionally.Would you like me to assist you with:Drafting yourdivorce and custody petitionHandling anticipatory moves from your husband (including mental harassment or misuse of legal process)Setting up aconfidential legal strategyto protect your child’s future and your peace of mind?Feel free to message or WhatsApp me directly atNine Five Nine Two Five Zero Zero Zero Six Eightfor a completely private consultation.

Even if your husband has evidence of an extra-marital affair, child custody is decided based on thewelfare and best interest of the child, not just the character of the parent.As the mother, especially of a 5-year-old, you generally have a strong case for custody under Hindu law, unless proven unfit as a parent. Your husband may use the adultery evidence in court, but itdoes not automatically disqualifyyou from getting custody.You should consult a family lawyer in Bengaluru to file a divorce petition and seek interim custody of your daughter.Shubham GoyalAdvocate, Delhi1186 Answers7 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shubham Goyal"

    "question": "Can I get custody of my 5 year old daughter if I file for divorce",
    "answer": "Divorce in Your CaseMental cruelty on the part of the husband is a good ground for divorce under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955. As you have suffered mental torture for 8 years, you can seek divorce on this ground. Your extramarital affair, though mentioned by your husband, is not a criminal act (adultery was legalized in India in 2018) but can be used as a reason for divorce. It will not exclude you from divorce.2. Child Custody IssuesAs your daughter is 5 years old, courts always like to give custody to the mother unless there are serious circumstances impairing the well-being of the child. Significantly, adultery or marital infidelity by a parent alone does not bar them from obtaining custody. Courts are most concerned with the child's well-being and whether or not the parent can ensure the child a secure and loving home. The court will take into account factors such as your capability to take care of the child, the child's ease and overall well-being and not your moral evaluation of your own personal life.3. Regarding the Evidence of AdulteryChats, pictures, and hotel bookings can be used as circumstantial evidence of adultery, but adultery is no longer a criminal act. It can be considered as a reason for divorce but won't necessarily impact the custody rights unless it damages the welfare of the child. Your husband can attempt to bring this evidence before the court, but the court will distinguish between the issues of adultery and custody.4. Removing the Child from the Home of the Marital CoupleIf you are being mentally tortured and your husband is not permitting you to go out, you can take refuge under the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005 (PWDVA), where you can obtain protection orders and residence orders so that you remain safe. You can go to the police or a women's helpline for instant help and protection. Legally speaking, you can't simply go out of the house with the child without a court order or informing her or him because the two parents equally have rights to the child. But your daughter being less than 7, courts would predominantly give the mother custody. To prevent legal issues, approach the family court and file a petition for custody and protection orders prior to moving out. In case you move out without notice, your husband may accuse you of kidnapping, which will create problems.5. Practically How to ProceedFile a divorce petition on the grounds of cruelty in the family court. At the same time, file a custody petition for your daughter, highlighting her well-being and your capability to take care of her. File a case under the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct to obtain protection orders for harassment and mental torture by your husband. Approach local women's helplines or NGOs for immediate protection and legal assistance. Do not confront or leave the house suddenly without legal protection to avoid charges of kidnapping or contempt of court.Dealing with Your Fear That Husband Will Contact the Other ManYour husband will attempt to get the other man into court for proving adultery, but this will not impact your rights to custody except that it has been proven that your relationship is detrimental to the welfare of the child. Emphasize your case on your mental torture and your capacity to provide a secure environment to your daughter.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Breaking of engagement",
    "answer": "The Legal Status of Engagement in IndiaEngagement is a religious and social understanding, but not a legally binding agreement in Indian law. Either party can terminate the engagement at any moment prior to marriage without any form of liability. There is no breach of promise to marry law or damages exclusively for wrongful termination of engagement.2. How to Legally Break the EngagementYou can advise the girl and her family in writing (preferably by way of a legal notice) that you do not want to continue with the marriage. Return the gifts or costs incurred on account of the engagement to avoid future quarrels. It is recommended that there be a written mutual settlement or admission that neither party has any claims against the other to avoid future harassment or legal proceedings.3. Issue Regarding Caste and Social BarrierThough caste is a social consideration, as per law it is not an aspect to force or nullify an engagement or marriage. It is your right to call off the engagement owing to caste issues, but stand ready for anticipated social or familial retribution.4. Physical Relationship and Concerns of Government JobHaving had a physical relationship on agreed terms, it does not amount to legal obligations to get married. There is no legal requirement to marry because of physical encounters. Being a government worker, there is no immediate legal penalty for calling off the engagement, but be watchful for any social or work-related repercussions.5. Threats of Suicide and WhatsApp MessagesSave and store all WhatsApp messages and any other proof of threats or abuse. Suicide threats are serious; you might want to report to local authorities or apply for protection orders if you are threatened. You can also further choose to register a police complaint for criminal harassment or intimidation if the threats persist. It is best to see a lawyer right away to shield yourself from any form of false accusations or coercion.6. Potential Legal Risks and How to Avoid ThemThe family of the girl or the girl herself may attempt to lodge complaints like dowry harassment or defamation. If you have not harassed her or demanded dowry, these complaints can be rebutted. Document all communication and keep away from using abusive or threatening language. If false cases are lodged, you can approach court for quashing of FIRs and apply for anticipatory bail if required.7. Practical Steps to Take NowIssue a notice through a lawyer to legally call off the engagement and make your stand clear. Save all records of threats or harassment. Avoid face-to-face confrontation; allow your lawyer to deal with correspondence. If threatened or harassed, register a police complaint and avail yourself of legal protection.

    "answer": "You are referring to garnishee proceedings, i.e., recovery of the debit amount from the salary through the employer.With regard to the recovery of debt determined by the DRT, after the issuance of the Certificate of Recovery, there are two different modes of recovery stipulated in Sections 25 and 28 of the Act. The recovery of debt is not limited to recovery from the actual debtor to the bank or financial institution but is extended to recovery from other persons who are indebted to the debtor called \"third party debtorders\" or \"garnisheeorders\". Sub-sections (2) to (4) of Section 28 are in the nature of garnishment proceedings. A garnishment is a proceeding by which a diligent creditor may legally obtain preference on other creditors by sequestration of the effects of a debtor in the hands of his debtorIf a court is passing an order to recover the amount from the  salary through the employer, i.e., by a garnishee order, thena garnishee order  cannot exceed 50% of a debtor's monthly income.This is to ensure the debtor has enough income to meet basic needs.There are also exemptions for certain types of income like minimum wages.Therefore you may wait for the court judgment in this regard and plan further steps accordinlgy.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Can I get custody of my 5 year old daughter if I file for divorce",
    "answer": "I understand this is a deeply personal and emotionally draining phase, and I appreciate your courage in taking the first step toward clarity and resolution.Here’s a structured legal insight into your rights and options underHindu Marriage Lawandchild custody principles, tailored to your concerns:🔹1. Can You File for Divorce – Despite Your Husband’s Refusal?Yes.Under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, you can initiate divorce proceedingseven if your husband is unwilling, on valid legal grounds such as:Mental cruelty and incompatibility(Section 13(1)(ia))Breakdown of marriagewith no chance of reconciliationEven though there is a past extra-marital involvement, the court will not prevent you fromseeking divorce, especially if the marriage is irretrievably broken and you have suffered emotionally.🔹2. Will the Alleged Adultery Impact Your Child Custody Rights?In family courts,child custody is NOT about punishing either parent. The focus is always:🔸 “What is in the best interest of the child?”Unless it is proven that you arean unfit or abusive parent, yourpast personal relationshipwillnot automatically disqualify youfrom having custody or visitation rights.Also:Merephotos, chats, and hotel bookingsmay suggest a relationship, butmay not be enough to conclusively prove adulteryin court unless there's concrete evidence like eyewitness accounts or admissions.⚖️Indian courts are moving toward a progressive, child-centric view, and do not take away parenting rights purely due to a consensual adult relationship that didn’t harm the child.🔹3. Types of Custody You Can SeekYou can claim any of the following:Full physical custody, especially if the child is attached to you or still a minorJoint custody, with child residing primarily with you and periodic access to the fatherVisitation rights, if shared parenting is possibleThe court also looks into:Child’s age and preference (if over 9–10 years)Stability and emotional comfort of the homeEducation and upbringing environment✅ You can also seekinterim custodyduring the case andmaintenance for the childunder Section125 CrPCor Guardians and Wards Act.🔹4. Practical Legal Steps You Can Take NowHere’s what I recommend as your next move:✅1. Start with Consultation & Case StrategyWe’ll draft your divorce petition based onmental crueltyand irretrievable breakdown. You need not file on adultery grounds.✅2. File for Custody SimultaneouslyIn the same family court, you can requestinterim custody and permanent custodyof your child.✅3. Keep All Evidence Ready – Yours and HisWe’ll organize your records ofhis mental tortureand prepare a defense if he uses your past affair against you out of vengeance.✅4. Mediation OptionYou can also explore court-sponsored mediation, where terms of custody, separation, and maintenance can be discussed—without heavy courtroom trauma.📌 Final WordYou have thefull right to exit a toxic marriage, andcourts will not ignore your role as a motherbased on personal mistakes if you’ve otherwise acted in good faith and responsibly. Your strength lies in preparing early, legally, and emotionally.Would you like me to assist you with:Drafting yourdivorce and custody petitionHandling anticipatory moves from your husband (including mental harassment or misuse of legal process)Setting up aconfidential legal strategyto protect your child’s future and your peace of mind?Feel free to message or WhatsApp me directly atNine Five Nine Two Five Zero Zero Zero Six Eightfor a completely private consultation.

    "context": "Asked 1 month ago in Family Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Can I get custody of my 5 year old daughter if I file for divorce",
    "answer": "Divorce in Your CaseMental cruelty on the part of the husband is a good ground for divorce under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955. As you have suffered mental torture for 8 years, you can seek divorce on this ground. Your extramarital affair, though mentioned by your husband, is not a criminal act (adultery was legalized in India in 2018) but can be used as a reason for divorce. It will not exclude you from divorce.2. Child Custody IssuesAs your daughter is 5 years old, courts always like to give custody to the mother unless there are serious circumstances impairing the well-being of the child. Significantly, adultery or marital infidelity by a parent alone does not bar them from obtaining custody. Courts are most concerned with the child's well-being and whether or not the parent can ensure the child a secure and loving home. The court will take into account factors such as your capability to take care of the child, the child's ease and overall well-being and not your moral evaluation of your own personal life.3. Regarding the Evidence of AdulteryChats, pictures, and hotel bookings can be used as circumstantial evidence of adultery, but adultery is no longer a criminal act. It can be considered as a reason for divorce but won't necessarily impact the custody rights unless it damages the welfare of the child. Your husband can attempt to bring this evidence before the court, but the court will distinguish between the issues of adultery and custody.4. Removing the Child from the Home of the Marital CoupleIf you are being mentally tortured and your husband is not permitting you to go out, you can take refuge under the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005 (PWDVA), where you can obtain protection orders and residence orders so that you remain safe. You can go to the police or a women's helpline for instant help and protection. Legally speaking, you can't simply go out of the house with the child without a court order or informing her or him because the two parents equally have rights to the child. But your daughter being less than 7, courts would predominantly give the mother custody. To prevent legal issues, approach the family court and file a petition for custody and protection orders prior to moving out. In case you move out without notice, your husband may accuse you of kidnapping, which will create problems.5. Practically How to ProceedFile a divorce petition on the grounds of cruelty in the family court. At the same time, file a custody petition for your daughter, highlighting her well-being and your capability to take care of her. File a case under the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct to obtain protection orders for harassment and mental torture by your husband. Approach local women's helplines or NGOs for immediate protection and legal assistance. Do not confront or leave the house suddenly without legal protection to avoid charges of kidnapping or contempt of court.Dealing with Your Fear That Husband Will Contact the Other ManYour husband will attempt to get the other man into court for proving adultery, but this will not impact your rights to custody except that it has been proven that your relationship is detrimental to the welfare of the child. Emphasize your case on your mental torture and your capacity to provide a secure environment to your daughter.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Misspelling in father’s middle name on marriage registration",
    "answer": "Correcting the Name on the Marriage CertificateThe Correction Procedure: Indian marriage certificates can be updated or in the said case may be corrected by making an application to the local marriage registrar office in which the marriage was being registered. This is normally done by through the process of submitting an application together with an evidence of the correct name (like the father's Aadhaar card, PAN card, or passport) and an affidavit stating the reason for the error of the same.The Physical Presence Requirement: Majority of the state marriage registrar offices demand that the applicant or at least one of the parties must be physically present for verification, thumb impression, and witness authentication. This is a standard procedure and a protocol in order to avoid fraud.Limitations in Online Application: Although marriage registration applications can be started online in most states, corrections generally need offline submission and personal verification at the registrar's office.If You Are Unable to Be Present Physically in IndiaYou may sign a Power of Attorney in the US naming a reliable relative, friend, or a legal practitioner in India to represent you to file the correction application and formalities at the registrar's office.A notarized affidavit from wife or the authorized person might be required wherein they are required to explain the error and request the correction. Along with that supporting identity documents of the party will also be necessary.Contact the marriage registrar office or local municipal corporation where the marriage was registered to confirm the exact documents and process for correction via PoA, by fulfilling the conditions.Impact on Immigration PetitionMinor misspelling in the marriage certificate, particularly in a relative's name (such as the father's middle name), usually will not make much difference in immigration petitions, as long as the marriage certificate is genuine and valid. You may present an affidavit or a notarized letter stating the misspelling along with the original certificate. Immigration officials generally accept such clarifications as long as the misspelling is slight and does not impact the identities of the parties. Nevertheless, it is suggested that the correction be undertaken prior to the filing of the immigration petition so that no delay or request for supplemental evidence is encountered from immigration officials. A notarized affidavit documenting the mistake and confirming the proper name can serve to temporarily clear up the situation for immigration purposes. A notary document, however, does not substitute for the official change on the marriage certificate. It is a corroborating document, not a replacement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "To correct a misspelling of a father's middle name on a marriage registration, the first step is to contact the registrar's office or the department responsible for marriage registrations in your state.You will likely need to submit an application for correction along with supporting documents, such as an affidavit from the father stating the correct spelling of his middle name.It's also helpful to have copies of other relevant documents, like birth certificates or other identification, to support the correction.To rectify the error online,  you may locate the official website for marriage registration in your state (e.g., the state's Department of Vital Statistics or Registrar of Marriages).Look for a section related to marriage certificate updates, corrections, or modifications.You might find an option within the \"Services\" or \"Marriage Registration\" menu.If you want to do it physically then your wife cn execute a power of attorney authorising any close relative in India to carry out this task by visiting the concerned registrar office and comply with the legal requirements to complete the desired tasksT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Misspelling in father’s middle name on marriage registration",
    "answer": "Correcting the Name on the Marriage CertificateThe Correction Procedure: Indian marriage certificates can be updated or in the said case may be corrected by making an application to the local marriage registrar office in which the marriage was being registered. This is normally done by through the process of submitting an application together with an evidence of the correct name (like the father's Aadhaar card, PAN card, or passport) and an affidavit stating the reason for the error of the same.The Physical Presence Requirement: Majority of the state marriage registrar offices demand that the applicant or at least one of the parties must be physically present for verification, thumb impression, and witness authentication. This is a standard procedure and a protocol in order to avoid fraud.Limitations in Online Application: Although marriage registration applications can be started online in most states, corrections generally need offline submission and personal verification at the registrar's office.If You Are Unable to Be Present Physically in IndiaYou may sign a Power of Attorney in the US naming a reliable relative, friend, or a legal practitioner in India to represent you to file the correction application and formalities at the registrar's office.A notarized affidavit from wife or the authorized person might be required wherein they are required to explain the error and request the correction. Along with that supporting identity documents of the party will also be necessary.Contact the marriage registrar office or local municipal corporation where the marriage was registered to confirm the exact documents and process for correction via PoA, by fulfilling the conditions.Impact on Immigration PetitionMinor misspelling in the marriage certificate, particularly in a relative's name (such as the father's middle name), usually will not make much difference in immigration petitions, as long as the marriage certificate is genuine and valid. You may present an affidavit or a notarized letter stating the misspelling along with the original certificate. Immigration officials generally accept such clarifications as long as the misspelling is slight and does not impact the identities of the parties. Nevertheless, it is suggested that the correction be undertaken prior to the filing of the immigration petition so that no delay or request for supplemental evidence is encountered from immigration officials. A notarized affidavit documenting the mistake and confirming the proper name can serve to temporarily clear up the situation for immigration purposes. A notary document, however, does not substitute for the official change on the marriage certificate. It is a corroborating document, not a replacement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Dispute over transportation fees of my child",
    "answer": "Manual Challan Procedure:Schools often issue a “manual challan” when fees are paid offline (by cash, demand draft, or bank transfer). This challan should detail each fee component (tuition, bus fee, etc.). However, many schools use digital portals that combine all fees, and there’s no statutory mandate requiring them to split components.What You Can Request:Ask the school management to provide a revised fee invoice (or manual challan) that clearly shows tuition and bus charges separately.If they refuse, send a formal email stating that you will only authorize payment for tuition fees (with corresponding bank transfer records showing the breakdown in the narration).Alternatives & Record Keeping:Use traceable bank transfers where you clearly note “Tuition Fee – [Term]” as the payment purpose.Retain all emails and transfer receipts to document that you paid the tuition fee.If the dispute escalates, consider involving the education authority or filing an application in family court to get clarity on fee sharing.These steps help protect you legally and show your intent to pay only the appropriate component while discouraging further disputes."

    "answer": "I understand this is a deeply personal and emotionally draining phase, and I appreciate your courage in taking the first step toward clarity and resolution.Here’s a structured legal insight into your rights and options underHindu Marriage Lawandchild custody principles, tailored to your concerns:🔹1. Can You File for Divorce – Despite Your Husband’s Refusal?Yes.Under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, you can initiate divorce proceedingseven if your husband is unwilling, on valid legal grounds such as:Mental cruelty and incompatibility(Section 13(1)(ia))Breakdown of marriagewith no chance of reconciliationEven though there is a past extra-marital involvement, the court will not prevent you fromseeking divorce, especially if the marriage is irretrievably broken and you have suffered emotionally.🔹2. Will the Alleged Adultery Impact Your Child Custody Rights?In family courts,child custody is NOT about punishing either parent. The focus is always:🔸 “What is in the best interest of the child?”Unless it is proven that you arean unfit or abusive parent, yourpast personal relationshipwillnot automatically disqualify youfrom having custody or visitation rights.Also:Merephotos, chats, and hotel bookingsmay suggest a relationship, butmay not be enough to conclusively prove adulteryin court unless there's concrete evidence like eyewitness accounts or admissions.⚖️Indian courts are moving toward a progressive, child-centric view, and do not take away parenting rights purely due to a consensual adult relationship that didn’t harm the child.🔹3. Types of Custody You Can SeekYou can claim any of the following:Full physical custody, especially if the child is attached to you or still a minorJoint custody, with child residing primarily with you and periodic access to the fatherVisitation rights, if shared parenting is possibleThe court also looks into:Child’s age and preference (if over 9–10 years)Stability and emotional comfort of the homeEducation and upbringing environment✅ You can also seekinterim custodyduring the case andmaintenance for the childunder Section125 CrPCor Guardians and Wards Act.🔹4. Practical Legal Steps You Can Take NowHere’s what I recommend as your next move:✅1. Start with Consultation & Case StrategyWe’ll draft your divorce petition based onmental crueltyand irretrievable breakdown. You need not file on adultery grounds.✅2. File for Custody SimultaneouslyIn the same family court, you can requestinterim custody and permanent custodyof your child.✅3. Keep All Evidence Ready – Yours and HisWe’ll organize your records ofhis mental tortureand prepare a defense if he uses your past affair against you out of vengeance.✅4. Mediation OptionYou can also explore court-sponsored mediation, where terms of custody, separation, and maintenance can be discussed—without heavy courtroom trauma.📌 Final WordYou have thefull right to exit a toxic marriage, andcourts will not ignore your role as a motherbased on personal mistakes if you’ve otherwise acted in good faith and responsibly. Your strength lies in preparing early, legally, and emotionally.Would you like me to assist you with:Drafting yourdivorce and custody petitionHandling anticipatory moves from your husband (including mental harassment or misuse of legal process)Setting up aconfidential legal strategyto protect your child’s future and your peace of mind?Feel free to message or WhatsApp me directly atNine Five Nine Two Five Zero Zero Zero Six Eightfor a completely private consultation.

    "question": "Can I get custody of my 5 year old daughter if I file for divorce",
    "answer": "Divorce in Your CaseMental cruelty on the part of the husband is a good ground for divorce under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955. As you have suffered mental torture for 8 years, you can seek divorce on this ground. Your extramarital affair, though mentioned by your husband, is not a criminal act (adultery was legalized in India in 2018) but can be used as a reason for divorce. It will not exclude you from divorce.2. Child Custody IssuesAs your daughter is 5 years old, courts always like to give custody to the mother unless there are serious circumstances impairing the well-being of the child. Significantly, adultery or marital infidelity by a parent alone does not bar them from obtaining custody. Courts are most concerned with the child's well-being and whether or not the parent can ensure the child a secure and loving home. The court will take into account factors such as your capability to take care of the child, the child's ease and overall well-being and not your moral evaluation of your own personal life.3. Regarding the Evidence of AdulteryChats, pictures, and hotel bookings can be used as circumstantial evidence of adultery, but adultery is no longer a criminal act. It can be considered as a reason for divorce but won't necessarily impact the custody rights unless it damages the welfare of the child. Your husband can attempt to bring this evidence before the court, but the court will distinguish between the issues of adultery and custody.4. Removing the Child from the Home of the Marital CoupleIf you are being mentally tortured and your husband is not permitting you to go out, you can take refuge under the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005 (PWDVA), where you can obtain protection orders and residence orders so that you remain safe. You can go to the police or a women's helpline for instant help and protection. Legally speaking, you can't simply go out of the house with the child without a court order or informing her or him because the two parents equally have rights to the child. But your daughter being less than 7, courts would predominantly give the mother custody. To prevent legal issues, approach the family court and file a petition for custody and protection orders prior to moving out. In case you move out without notice, your husband may accuse you of kidnapping, which will create problems.5. Practically How to ProceedFile a divorce petition on the grounds of cruelty in the family court. At the same time, file a custody petition for your daughter, highlighting her well-being and your capability to take care of her. File a case under the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct to obtain protection orders for harassment and mental torture by your husband. Approach local women's helplines or NGOs for immediate protection and legal assistance. Do not confront or leave the house suddenly without legal protection to avoid charges of kidnapping or contempt of court.Dealing with Your Fear That Husband Will Contact the Other ManYour husband will attempt to get the other man into court for proving adultery, but this will not impact your rights to custody except that it has been proven that your relationship is detrimental to the welfare of the child. Emphasize your case on your mental torture and your capacity to provide a secure environment to your daughter.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Regarding complaint on 118 violation",
    "answer": "Thanks for sharing these important details. From what you've explained, your matter involves a mix ofproperty law under Section 118 of the Himachal Pradesh Tenancy and Land Reforms Act, tenancy issues, and a pending criminal complaint—all of which require strategic legal handling to protect your rights and close this issue permanently.Let me guide you point-by-point:🔹Regarding the Alleged Violation of Section 118As per Section 118, non-agriculturists require permission to purchase or lease land in Himachal Pradesh. Since you’ve already obtained government permission topurchase the land, your ownership is valid.However, creating a lease deed with a non-agriculturist without proper government permission may technically be seen as a violationonly if:It is a long-term lease that amounts to transfer of possession/control,It is considered a disguised sale or permanent arrangement,Andif there is irrefutable proof that a formal lease was executed and acted upon.Your defence here will rely on:Thenature of the agreement(short-term, non-renewable, no possession rights, and conditional use only after registration),Thefact that you initiated registration and NOC was granted by police in 3 months,And thatthe agreement has no evidentiary strength, as it’s not in his possession, it was partly oral, and was not registered or legally enforceable under the Act.So yes—youcan challenge the validity of the lease agreement, or state that it was aconditional licence, not a lease, and certainly not in the nature of transfer contemplated under Section 118.🔹Regarding the Eviction & Trespassing FIRSince:The FIR is pending but chargesheet has not been filed for 7 months,You have a NOC from police themselves to operate the homestay,His possession was conditional and terminated due to breach,You have astrong casethat there was no illegal trespass. Police delay in filing the chargesheet may also work in your favour aslack of prima facie evidence.We can even consider moving toquash the FIRunder Section482 CrPCif needed—after reviewing the contents of the complaint.🔹Regarding Complaints to Tourism/Revenue AuthoritiesThis is just pressure tactics. Now that your homestay is registered, you are legally compliant. I can help youdraft a proper reply to the Tehsildarexplaining:That there was no valid lease or transfer,That the agreement was not acted upon legally or completed,And that the complainant is trying to harass you after being evicted for suspicious activity.We’ll also highlight theNOC and registration of the homestayto show bona fide compliance.📌 My Professional Suggestion:You’re at a stage where everything needs to be consolidated withlegally strong, clear replies—before things go against you in record. Based on what you've told me, I can assist you with:Drafting a professional legal replyto the Tehsildar under Section 118,Strategic adviceon handling the police FIR and possibly getting it quashed,Drafting a replyto the tourism department to close that complaint, andPreparing future-proof documentation for your homestay to avoid such issues again.Let me handle this properly for you—you’ve already taken all the right steps like getting NOC and registration, now let’s put it all togetherlegally and professionally.Warm regardsContact/WhatsApp No-Sharan ChopraAdvocate, Chandigarh121 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sharan Chopra"

Tenancy and Land Reforms Act, 1972 the land purchased by a non-agriculturist after obtaining the permission of Government is required to be put to use within stipulated period for the purpose for which permission was granted.Therefore you may gather evidence to establish the fact that there was no violation in this regard and challenge the same appropriately before the concerned authorities.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Child custody",
    "answer": "Thank you for sharing the detailed background. Your case involves sensitive and critical issues ofchild custody,jurisdiction, andthe welfare of a minor, which Indian courts treat with utmost priority. Let me address your queries one by one withclarity and practical advice:1. Can this case be expedited or transferred to High Court?Yes, it can. Since the matter pertains to the custody of aminor child, you can file awrit petition or transfer petitionbefore the Hon’ble High Court underArticle 227 of theConstitution of Indiato seek expeditious hearing or direct intervention.Courts are generally receptive to such prayers, especially whencustody-related delaysare causing hardship to the child.In addition, you can move anapplication for early hearingin the family court as an interim relief, supported by valid grounds like schooling, documentation delays, etc.2. Will the Court consider your son’s opinion (he’s now 12)?Yes, absolutely. Indian courts, particularly underGuardians and Wards ActandHindu Minority and Guardianship Act, do take theopinion of a minor above 9 yearsinto account—provided the child is mature enough to understand the situation.However, it is notbinding—it’s one of the factors.If there is influence or coaching from any side (e.g., paternal family), the court can directchild counselingor interaction with theChild Welfare Committee (CWC)or aCourt-appointed Counselor.3. How to expedite the case legally?To fast-track the process:File aninterlocutory applicationin the family court forearly disposalor priority listing.Alternatively, approach theHigh Courtvia writ jurisdiction fordirections to the family court to conclude the matter within a time-bound period.You may also mention your difficulty in applying forpassport, Aadhaar, or visadue to the pending case, making it a compelling ground for urgency.4. How much weight does the Court give to child’s opinion?The Court always prioritizes“the best interest of the child”over mere preferences. If the father’s household has past instability (remarriages, divorce), and if the child is in astable, nurturing environmentunder your parents, it worksin your favour.The court will consider factors like:Schooling, routines, emotional bondingYour financial capability and international opportunitiesChild’s safety, moral environment, and future stability5. Approximate cost to fight the case in High Court?Acustody-related writ or transfer petitionin High Court can range from ₹75,000 to ₹1,50,000 depending on the complexity, urgency, and the lawyer’s experience.However, I tailor my professional chargesbased on your circumstancesand ensurecomplete end-to-end support, including representation, drafting, and follow-ups.6. Chances of High Court accepting your matter?Verystrong, provided the documentation is proper and the petition clearly shows:Undue delayin lower courtImpact on your son’s rights and developmentLegal hurdles in gettingpassport or visaYourCanadian citizenshipand genuine intent to raise your child in a stable environmentHigh Courts interveneespecially when lower courts show delay or when minors’ future is compromised.✅ Why Engage Me?I specialize incomplex family law matters, particularly involvingNRI/OCI parents.I can ensurestrategic representation, solid drafting, andcourtroom advocacy.I will guide you onhow to present your son’s best interest,gather supporting documents, and managepassport and visa documentationlegally.We can set up apaid consultation over a call or Zoomat your convenience where I’ll review the court papers and plan your next legal move in detail.Please feel free to reach out on WhatsApp atNINE FIVE NINE TWO FIVE ZERO ZERO ZERO SIX EIGHTto schedule a discussion.Warm regards,Advocate, Punjab & Haryana High Court📍 Based in ChandigarhSharan ChopraAdvocate, Chandigarh121 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sharan Chopra"

    "answer": "I understand this is a deeply personal and emotionally draining phase, and I appreciate your courage in taking the first step toward clarity and resolution.Here’s a structured legal insight into your rights and options underHindu Marriage Lawandchild custody principles, tailored to your concerns:🔹1. Can You File for Divorce – Despite Your Husband’s Refusal?Yes.Under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, you can initiate divorce proceedingseven if your husband is unwilling, on valid legal grounds such as:Mental cruelty and incompatibility(Section 13(1)(ia))Breakdown of marriagewith no chance of reconciliationEven though there is a past extra-marital involvement, the court will not prevent you fromseeking divorce, especially if the marriage is irretrievably broken and you have suffered emotionally.🔹2. Will the Alleged Adultery Impact Your Child Custody Rights?In family courts,child custody is NOT about punishing either parent. The focus is always:🔸 “What is in the best interest of the child?”Unless it is proven that you arean unfit or abusive parent, yourpast personal relationshipwillnot automatically disqualify youfrom having custody or visitation rights.Also:Merephotos, chats, and hotel bookingsmay suggest a relationship, butmay not be enough to conclusively prove adulteryin court unless there's concrete evidence like eyewitness accounts or admissions.⚖️Indian courts are moving toward a progressive, child-centric view, and do not take away parenting rights purely due to a consensual adult relationship that didn’t harm the child.🔹3. Types of Custody You Can SeekYou can claim any of the following:Full physical custody, especially if the child is attached to you or still a minorJoint custody, with child residing primarily with you and periodic access to the fatherVisitation rights, if shared parenting is possibleThe court also looks into:Child’s age and preference (if over 9–10 years)Stability and emotional comfort of the homeEducation and upbringing environment✅ You can also seekinterim custodyduring the case andmaintenance for the childunder Section125 CrPCor Guardians and Wards Act.🔹4. Practical Legal Steps You Can Take NowHere’s what I recommend as your next move:✅1. Start with Consultation & Case StrategyWe’ll draft your divorce petition based onmental crueltyand irretrievable breakdown. You need not file on adultery grounds.✅2. File for Custody SimultaneouslyIn the same family court, you can requestinterim custody and permanent custodyof your child.✅3. Keep All Evidence Ready – Yours and HisWe’ll organize your records ofhis mental tortureand prepare a defense if he uses your past affair against you out of vengeance.✅4. Mediation OptionYou can also explore court-sponsored mediation, where terms of custody, separation, and maintenance can be discussed—without heavy courtroom trauma.📌 Final WordYou have thefull right to exit a toxic marriage, andcourts will not ignore your role as a motherbased on personal mistakes if you’ve otherwise acted in good faith and responsibly. Your strength lies in preparing early, legally, and emotionally.Would you like me to assist you with:Drafting yourdivorce and custody petitionHandling anticipatory moves from your husband (including mental harassment or misuse of legal process)Setting up aconfidential legal strategyto protect your child’s future and your peace of mind?Feel free to message or WhatsApp me directly atNine Five Nine Two Five Zero Zero Zero Six Eightfor a completely private consultation.

  {
    "context": "Asked 1 month ago in Family Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Can I get custody of my 5 year old daughter if I file for divorce",
    "answer": "Divorce in Your CaseMental cruelty on the part of the husband is a good ground for divorce under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955. As you have suffered mental torture for 8 years, you can seek divorce on this ground. Your extramarital affair, though mentioned by your husband, is not a criminal act (adultery was legalized in India in 2018) but can be used as a reason for divorce. It will not exclude you from divorce.2. Child Custody IssuesAs your daughter is 5 years old, courts always like to give custody to the mother unless there are serious circumstances impairing the well-being of the child. Significantly, adultery or marital infidelity by a parent alone does not bar them from obtaining custody. Courts are most concerned with the child's well-being and whether or not the parent can ensure the child a secure and loving home. The court will take into account factors such as your capability to take care of the child, the child's ease and overall well-being and not your moral evaluation of your own personal life.3. Regarding the Evidence of AdulteryChats, pictures, and hotel bookings can be used as circumstantial evidence of adultery, but adultery is no longer a criminal act. It can be considered as a reason for divorce but won't necessarily impact the custody rights unless it damages the welfare of the child. Your husband can attempt to bring this evidence before the court, but the court will distinguish between the issues of adultery and custody.4. Removing the Child from the Home of the Marital CoupleIf you are being mentally tortured and your husband is not permitting you to go out, you can take refuge under the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005 (PWDVA), where you can obtain protection orders and residence orders so that you remain safe. You can go to the police or a women's helpline for instant help and protection. Legally speaking, you can't simply go out of the house with the child without a court order or informing her or him because the two parents equally have rights to the child. But your daughter being less than 7, courts would predominantly give the mother custody. To prevent legal issues, approach the family court and file a petition for custody and protection orders prior to moving out. In case you move out without notice, your husband may accuse you of kidnapping, which will create problems.5. Practically How to ProceedFile a divorce petition on the grounds of cruelty in the family court. At the same time, file a custody petition for your daughter, highlighting her well-being and your capability to take care of her. File a case under the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct to obtain protection orders for harassment and mental torture by your husband. Approach local women's helplines or NGOs for immediate protection and legal assistance. Do not confront or leave the house suddenly without legal protection to avoid charges of kidnapping or contempt of court.Dealing with Your Fear That Husband Will Contact the Other ManYour husband will attempt to get the other man into court for proving adultery, but this will not impact your rights to custody except that it has been proven that your relationship is detrimental to the welfare of the child. Emphasize your case on your mental torture and your capacity to provide a secure environment to your daughter.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "-  As per law, even a mother who is a housewife can gain custody of the child and the father will be asked to provide child support.- The mother is the preferred custodial parent when the child is less than five years old. The opinion of a child who is over nine years old will be considered.- Hence, being mother of baby child, you are the only & fit to get full custody legally.- Further, if he is not ready for divorce then you can file a contested divorce case before the family Court on the ground of cruelty and false allegation- Further, he cannot take any legal action against you for the said affairs , except that he can take divorce on this ground.- You can contact me, if  further suggestions needed.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Joint property dispute",
    "answer": "Hindu law of property is not yet codified. It derived from ancient shastras and commentaries. Any contribution by a family member to the  funds of acquisition of property makes that property joint.  That every ordinary acquisition becomes joint, no matter how much or how little each individual member of the family may have contributed to its being made. “If any help is taken from the family property it is enough to make the self-acquired property the property of the family.” This the law laid down by SC in number of pronouncements. There need not be any agreement to treat the  property joint. Any refund of contribution will be an admission of contribution and will be seen as an attempt to bypass the  establish proposition of law.Ravi ShindeAdvocate, Hyderabad4923 Answers42 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ravi Shinde"

    "answer": "Dear client,It looks like you are pursuing a contested divorce in India, which is being based in the U.S. Since your wife has not been participating in the court hearings, the case will move towards the e-parte divorce. The following are things that you can do:As you have published a notice in the newspaper, the court will check if your wife appears on the next hearing date. And if she still does not appear, the court may proceed ex parte and move toward granting the divorce.If ex parte, the court could grant divorce within 2-3 hearings, and it may take around 5-6 months. And if contested, then it will take around 2-3 years.Ensure your substituted service as giving notice in the newspaper is a sufficient proof of proper notice.But there are various ways through which your wife can delay the divorce proceeding, by appearing at the last moment and contesting the divorce and resettling the divorce proceeding.If she does not appear for the case again in June, request the court to proceed with an ex parte decree immediately.Hope this helps you; if you still have any clarifications or issues, do not hesitate to ask.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "In Periannan (S) v. CIT, in a partition between a father and his two sons, the father had to pay to one of his sons a sum over two lakhs. The son purchased property worth more than 5 lakhs and took a sum of Rs. 50k by withdrawing from the amount owed by father and paid it as advance. The balance is paid out of his self acquired funds. At the time of purchase assesee was not married. But subsequently when he marred, he constituted Hindu joint family with his wife. It was held that property in his hands should be treated as joint family property notwithstanding that only small portion of purchase price came from the joint family funds.

    "question": "Child custody",
    "answer": "Thank you for sharing the detailed background. Your case involves sensitive and critical issues ofchild custody,jurisdiction, andthe welfare of a minor, which Indian courts treat with utmost priority. Let me address your queries one by one withclarity and practical advice:1. Can this case be expedited or transferred to High Court?Yes, it can. Since the matter pertains to the custody of aminor child, you can file awrit petition or transfer petitionbefore the Hon’ble High Court underArticle 227 of theConstitution of Indiato seek expeditious hearing or direct intervention.Courts are generally receptive to such prayers, especially whencustody-related delaysare causing hardship to the child.In addition, you can move anapplication for early hearingin the family court as an interim relief, supported by valid grounds like schooling, documentation delays, etc.2. Will the Court consider your son’s opinion (he’s now 12)?Yes, absolutely. Indian courts, particularly underGuardians and Wards ActandHindu Minority and Guardianship Act, do take theopinion of a minor above 9 yearsinto account—provided the child is mature enough to understand the situation.However, it is notbinding—it’s one of the factors.If there is influence or coaching from any side (e.g., paternal family), the court can directchild counselingor interaction with theChild Welfare Committee (CWC)or aCourt-appointed Counselor.3. How to expedite the case legally?To fast-track the process:File aninterlocutory applicationin the family court forearly disposalor priority listing.Alternatively, approach theHigh Courtvia writ jurisdiction fordirections to the family court to conclude the matter within a time-bound period.You may also mention your difficulty in applying forpassport, Aadhaar, or visadue to the pending case, making it a compelling ground for urgency.4. How much weight does the Court give to child’s opinion?The Court always prioritizes“the best interest of the child”over mere preferences. If the father’s household has past instability (remarriages, divorce), and if the child is in astable, nurturing environmentunder your parents, it worksin your favour.The court will consider factors like:Schooling, routines, emotional bondingYour financial capability and international opportunitiesChild’s safety, moral environment, and future stability5. Approximate cost to fight the case in High Court?Acustody-related writ or transfer petitionin High Court can range from ₹75,000 to ₹1,50,000 depending on the complexity, urgency, and the lawyer’s experience.However, I tailor my professional chargesbased on your circumstancesand ensurecomplete end-to-end support, including representation, drafting, and follow-ups.6. Chances of High Court accepting your matter?Verystrong, provided the documentation is proper and the petition clearly shows:Undue delayin lower courtImpact on your son’s rights and developmentLegal hurdles in gettingpassport or visaYourCanadian citizenshipand genuine intent to raise your child in a stable environmentHigh Courts interveneespecially when lower courts show delay or when minors’ future is compromised.✅ Why Engage Me?I specialize incomplex family law matters, particularly involvingNRI/OCI parents.I can ensurestrategic representation, solid drafting, andcourtroom advocacy.I will guide you onhow to present your son’s best interest,gather supporting documents, and managepassport and visa documentationlegally.We can set up apaid consultation over a call or Zoomat your convenience where I’ll review the court papers and plan your next legal move in detail.Please feel free to reach out on WhatsApp atNINE FIVE NINE TWO FIVE ZERO ZERO ZERO SIX EIGHTto schedule a discussion.Warm regards,Advocate, Punjab & Haryana High Court📍 Based in ChandigarhSharan ChopraAdvocate, Chandigarh121 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sharan Chopra"

    "question": "Misspelling in father’s middle name on marriage registration",
    "answer": "To correct a misspelling of a father's middle name on a marriage registration, the first step is to contact the registrar's office or the department responsible for marriage registrations in your state.You will likely need to submit an application for correction along with supporting documents, such as an affidavit from the father stating the correct spelling of his middle name.It's also helpful to have copies of other relevant documents, like birth certificates or other identification, to support the correction.To rectify the error online,  you may locate the official website for marriage registration in your state (e.g., the state's Department of Vital Statistics or Registrar of Marriages).Look for a section related to marriage certificate updates, corrections, or modifications.You might find an option within the \"Services\" or \"Marriage Registration\" menu.If you want to do it physically then your wife cn execute a power of attorney authorising any close relative in India to carry out this task by visiting the concerned registrar office and comply with the legal requirements to complete the desired tasksT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Misspelling in father’s middle name on marriage registration",
    "answer": "Correcting the Name on the Marriage CertificateThe Correction Procedure: Indian marriage certificates can be updated or in the said case may be corrected by making an application to the local marriage registrar office in which the marriage was being registered. This is normally done by through the process of submitting an application together with an evidence of the correct name (like the father's Aadhaar card, PAN card, or passport) and an affidavit stating the reason for the error of the same.The Physical Presence Requirement: Majority of the state marriage registrar offices demand that the applicant or at least one of the parties must be physically present for verification, thumb impression, and witness authentication. This is a standard procedure and a protocol in order to avoid fraud.Limitations in Online Application: Although marriage registration applications can be started online in most states, corrections generally need offline submission and personal verification at the registrar's office.If You Are Unable to Be Present Physically in IndiaYou may sign a Power of Attorney in the US naming a reliable relative, friend, or a legal practitioner in India to represent you to file the correction application and formalities at the registrar's office.A notarized affidavit from wife or the authorized person might be required wherein they are required to explain the error and request the correction. Along with that supporting identity documents of the party will also be necessary.Contact the marriage registrar office or local municipal corporation where the marriage was registered to confirm the exact documents and process for correction via PoA, by fulfilling the conditions.Impact on Immigration PetitionMinor misspelling in the marriage certificate, particularly in a relative's name (such as the father's middle name), usually will not make much difference in immigration petitions, as long as the marriage certificate is genuine and valid. You may present an affidavit or a notarized letter stating the misspelling along with the original certificate. Immigration officials generally accept such clarifications as long as the misspelling is slight and does not impact the identities of the parties. Nevertheless, it is suggested that the correction be undertaken prior to the filing of the immigration petition so that no delay or request for supplemental evidence is encountered from immigration officials. A notarized affidavit documenting the mistake and confirming the proper name can serve to temporarily clear up the situation for immigration purposes. A notary document, however, does not substitute for the official change on the marriage certificate. It is a corroborating document, not a replacement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "You have an insolvency case pending disposal.During the pendency of an insolvency case, any legal action to recover debt, including the borrowed loans, is stayed.This means creditors are temporarily prohibited from initiating or continuing any legal action against the debtor.The purpose of this moratorium is to allow the debtor to restructure their debts and explore resolution options without the immediate pressure of legal action.As far as pending DRT  case, if you default on a loan and have no assets to repay the loan amount in a DRT (Debt Recovery Tribunal) case, the bank may proceed with recovery actions, which could include taking possession of secured assets if any, and ultimately selling them to recover the outstanding debt. The DRT may also issue orders to compel you to repay the loan, and if you fail to comply, the bank can potentially pursue further legal avenues for recovery, such as wage garnishment or seizing other assets if they can be identified.You can also try to negotiate a One-Time Settlement (OTS) with the bank to resolve the issue.Once you lost theDRT caseyoucan donothing.

    "answer": "You are referring to garnishee proceedings, i.e., recovery of the debit amount from the salary through the employer.With regard to the recovery of debt determined by the DRT, after the issuance of the Certificate of Recovery, there are two different modes of recovery stipulated in Sections 25 and 28 of the Act. The recovery of debt is not limited to recovery from the actual debtor to the bank or financial institution but is extended to recovery from other persons who are indebted to the debtor called \"third party debtorders\" or \"garnisheeorders\". Sub-sections (2) to (4) of Section 28 are in the nature of garnishment proceedings. A garnishment is a proceeding by which a diligent creditor may legally obtain preference on other creditors by sequestration of the effects of a debtor in the hands of his debtorIf a court is passing an order to recover the amount from the  salary through the employer, i.e., by a garnishee order, thena garnishee order  cannot exceed 50% of a debtor's monthly income.This is to ensure the debtor has enough income to meet basic needs.There are also exemptions for certain types of income like minimum wages.Therefore you may wait for the court judgment in this regard and plan further steps accordinlgy.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Manual Challan Procedure:Schools often issue a “manual challan” when fees are paid offline (by cash, demand draft, or bank transfer). This challan should detail each fee component (tuition, bus fee, etc.). However, many schools use digital portals that combine all fees, and there’s no statutory mandate requiring them to split components.What You Can Request:Ask the school management to provide a revised fee invoice (or manual challan) that clearly shows tuition and bus charges separately.If they refuse, send a formal email stating that you will only authorize payment for tuition fees (with corresponding bank transfer records showing the breakdown in the narration).Alternatives & Record Keeping:Use traceable bank transfers where you clearly note “Tuition Fee – [Term]” as the payment purpose.Retain all emails and transfer receipts to document that you paid the tuition fee.If the dispute escalates, consider involving the education authority or filing an application in family court to get clarity on fee sharing.These steps help protect you legally and show your intent to pay only the appropriate component while discouraging further disputes."

    "answer": "I understand this is a deeply personal and emotionally draining phase, and I appreciate your courage in taking the first step toward clarity and resolution.Here’s a structured legal insight into your rights and options underHindu Marriage Lawandchild custody principles, tailored to your concerns:🔹1. Can You File for Divorce – Despite Your Husband’s Refusal?Yes.Under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, you can initiate divorce proceedingseven if your husband is unwilling, on valid legal grounds such as:Mental cruelty and incompatibility(Section 13(1)(ia))Breakdown of marriagewith no chance of reconciliationEven though there is a past extra-marital involvement, the court will not prevent you fromseeking divorce, especially if the marriage is irretrievably broken and you have suffered emotionally.🔹2. Will the Alleged Adultery Impact Your Child Custody Rights?In family courts,child custody is NOT about punishing either parent. The focus is always:🔸 “What is in the best interest of the child?”Unless it is proven that you arean unfit or abusive parent, yourpast personal relationshipwillnot automatically disqualify youfrom having custody or visitation rights.Also:Merephotos, chats, and hotel bookingsmay suggest a relationship, butmay not be enough to conclusively prove adulteryin court unless there's concrete evidence like eyewitness accounts or admissions.⚖️Indian courts are moving toward a progressive, child-centric view, and do not take away parenting rights purely due to a consensual adult relationship that didn’t harm the child.🔹3. Types of Custody You Can SeekYou can claim any of the following:Full physical custody, especially if the child is attached to you or still a minorJoint custody, with child residing primarily with you and periodic access to the fatherVisitation rights, if shared parenting is possibleThe court also looks into:Child’s age and preference (if over 9–10 years)Stability and emotional comfort of the homeEducation and upbringing environment✅ You can also seekinterim custodyduring the case andmaintenance for the childunder Section125 CrPCor Guardians and Wards Act.🔹4. Practical Legal Steps You Can Take NowHere’s what I recommend as your next move:✅1. Start with Consultation & Case StrategyWe’ll draft your divorce petition based onmental crueltyand irretrievable breakdown. You need not file on adultery grounds.✅2. File for Custody SimultaneouslyIn the same family court, you can requestinterim custody and permanent custodyof your child.✅3. Keep All Evidence Ready – Yours and HisWe’ll organize your records ofhis mental tortureand prepare a defense if he uses your past affair against you out of vengeance.✅4. Mediation OptionYou can also explore court-sponsored mediation, where terms of custody, separation, and maintenance can be discussed—without heavy courtroom trauma.📌 Final WordYou have thefull right to exit a toxic marriage, andcourts will not ignore your role as a motherbased on personal mistakes if you’ve otherwise acted in good faith and responsibly. Your strength lies in preparing early, legally, and emotionally.Would you like me to assist you with:Drafting yourdivorce and custody petitionHandling anticipatory moves from your husband (including mental harassment or misuse of legal process)Setting up aconfidential legal strategyto protect your child’s future and your peace of mind?Feel free to message or WhatsApp me directly atNine Five Nine Two Five Zero Zero Zero Six Eightfor a completely private consultation.

    "context": "Asked 1 month ago in Family Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Can I get custody of my 5 year old daughter if I file for divorce",
    "answer": "Divorce in Your CaseMental cruelty on the part of the husband is a good ground for divorce under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955. As you have suffered mental torture for 8 years, you can seek divorce on this ground. Your extramarital affair, though mentioned by your husband, is not a criminal act (adultery was legalized in India in 2018) but can be used as a reason for divorce. It will not exclude you from divorce.2. Child Custody IssuesAs your daughter is 5 years old, courts always like to give custody to the mother unless there are serious circumstances impairing the well-being of the child. Significantly, adultery or marital infidelity by a parent alone does not bar them from obtaining custody. Courts are most concerned with the child's well-being and whether or not the parent can ensure the child a secure and loving home. The court will take into account factors such as your capability to take care of the child, the child's ease and overall well-being and not your moral evaluation of your own personal life.3. Regarding the Evidence of AdulteryChats, pictures, and hotel bookings can be used as circumstantial evidence of adultery, but adultery is no longer a criminal act. It can be considered as a reason for divorce but won't necessarily impact the custody rights unless it damages the welfare of the child. Your husband can attempt to bring this evidence before the court, but the court will distinguish between the issues of adultery and custody.4. Removing the Child from the Home of the Marital CoupleIf you are being mentally tortured and your husband is not permitting you to go out, you can take refuge under the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005 (PWDVA), where you can obtain protection orders and residence orders so that you remain safe. You can go to the police or a women's helpline for instant help and protection. Legally speaking, you can't simply go out of the house with the child without a court order or informing her or him because the two parents equally have rights to the child. But your daughter being less than 7, courts would predominantly give the mother custody. To prevent legal issues, approach the family court and file a petition for custody and protection orders prior to moving out. In case you move out without notice, your husband may accuse you of kidnapping, which will create problems.5. Practically How to ProceedFile a divorce petition on the grounds of cruelty in the family court. At the same time, file a custody petition for your daughter, highlighting her well-being and your capability to take care of her. File a case under the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct to obtain protection orders for harassment and mental torture by your husband. Approach local women's helplines or NGOs for immediate protection and legal assistance. Do not confront or leave the house suddenly without legal protection to avoid charges of kidnapping or contempt of court.Dealing with Your Fear That Husband Will Contact the Other ManYour husband will attempt to get the other man into court for proving adultery, but this will not impact your rights to custody except that it has been proven that your relationship is detrimental to the welfare of the child. Emphasize your case on your mental torture and your capacity to provide a secure environment to your daughter.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Child custody",
    "answer": "Thank you for sharing the detailed background. Your case involves sensitive and critical issues ofchild custody,jurisdiction, andthe welfare of a minor, which Indian courts treat with utmost priority. Let me address your queries one by one withclarity and practical advice:1. Can this case be expedited or transferred to High Court?Yes, it can. Since the matter pertains to the custody of aminor child, you can file awrit petition or transfer petitionbefore the Hon’ble High Court underArticle 227 of theConstitution of Indiato seek expeditious hearing or direct intervention.Courts are generally receptive to such prayers, especially whencustody-related delaysare causing hardship to the child.In addition, you can move anapplication for early hearingin the family court as an interim relief, supported by valid grounds like schooling, documentation delays, etc.2. Will the Court consider your son’s opinion (he’s now 12)?Yes, absolutely. Indian courts, particularly underGuardians and Wards ActandHindu Minority and Guardianship Act, do take theopinion of a minor above 9 yearsinto account—provided the child is mature enough to understand the situation.However, it is notbinding—it’s one of the factors.If there is influence or coaching from any side (e.g., paternal family), the court can directchild counselingor interaction with theChild Welfare Committee (CWC)or aCourt-appointed Counselor.3. How to expedite the case legally?To fast-track the process:File aninterlocutory applicationin the family court forearly disposalor priority listing.Alternatively, approach theHigh Courtvia writ jurisdiction fordirections to the family court to conclude the matter within a time-bound period.You may also mention your difficulty in applying forpassport, Aadhaar, or visadue to the pending case, making it a compelling ground for urgency.4. How much weight does the Court give to child’s opinion?The Court always prioritizes“the best interest of the child”over mere preferences. If the father’s household has past instability (remarriages, divorce), and if the child is in astable, nurturing environmentunder your parents, it worksin your favour.The court will consider factors like:Schooling, routines, emotional bondingYour financial capability and international opportunitiesChild’s safety, moral environment, and future stability5. Approximate cost to fight the case in High Court?Acustody-related writ or transfer petitionin High Court can range from ₹75,000 to ₹1,50,000 depending on the complexity, urgency, and the lawyer’s experience.However, I tailor my professional chargesbased on your circumstancesand ensurecomplete end-to-end support, including representation, drafting, and follow-ups.6. Chances of High Court accepting your matter?Verystrong, provided the documentation is proper and the petition clearly shows:Undue delayin lower courtImpact on your son’s rights and developmentLegal hurdles in gettingpassport or visaYourCanadian citizenshipand genuine intent to raise your child in a stable environmentHigh Courts interveneespecially when lower courts show delay or when minors’ future is compromised.✅ Why Engage Me?I specialize incomplex family law matters, particularly involvingNRI/OCI parents.I can ensurestrategic representation, solid drafting, andcourtroom advocacy.I will guide you onhow to present your son’s best interest,gather supporting documents, and managepassport and visa documentationlegally.We can set up apaid consultation over a call or Zoomat your convenience where I’ll review the court papers and plan your next legal move in detail.Please feel free to reach out on WhatsApp atNINE FIVE NINE TWO FIVE ZERO ZERO ZERO SIX EIGHTto schedule a discussion.Warm regards,Advocate, Punjab & Haryana High Court📍 Based in ChandigarhSharan ChopraAdvocate, Chandigarh121 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sharan Chopra"

    "question": "Misspelling in father’s middle name on marriage registration",
    "answer": "Correcting the Name on the Marriage CertificateThe Correction Procedure: Indian marriage certificates can be updated or in the said case may be corrected by making an application to the local marriage registrar office in which the marriage was being registered. This is normally done by through the process of submitting an application together with an evidence of the correct name (like the father's Aadhaar card, PAN card, or passport) and an affidavit stating the reason for the error of the same.The Physical Presence Requirement: Majority of the state marriage registrar offices demand that the applicant or at least one of the parties must be physically present for verification, thumb impression, and witness authentication. This is a standard procedure and a protocol in order to avoid fraud.Limitations in Online Application: Although marriage registration applications can be started online in most states, corrections generally need offline submission and personal verification at the registrar's office.If You Are Unable to Be Present Physically in IndiaYou may sign a Power of Attorney in the US naming a reliable relative, friend, or a legal practitioner in India to represent you to file the correction application and formalities at the registrar's office.A notarized affidavit from wife or the authorized person might be required wherein they are required to explain the error and request the correction. Along with that supporting identity documents of the party will also be necessary.Contact the marriage registrar office or local municipal corporation where the marriage was registered to confirm the exact documents and process for correction via PoA, by fulfilling the conditions.Impact on Immigration PetitionMinor misspelling in the marriage certificate, particularly in a relative's name (such as the father's middle name), usually will not make much difference in immigration petitions, as long as the marriage certificate is genuine and valid. You may present an affidavit or a notarized letter stating the misspelling along with the original certificate. Immigration officials generally accept such clarifications as long as the misspelling is slight and does not impact the identities of the parties. Nevertheless, it is suggested that the correction be undertaken prior to the filing of the immigration petition so that no delay or request for supplemental evidence is encountered from immigration officials. A notarized affidavit documenting the mistake and confirming the proper name can serve to temporarily clear up the situation for immigration purposes. A notary document, however, does not substitute for the official change on the marriage certificate. It is a corroborating document, not a replacement.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The recovery of debt is not limited to recovery from the actual debtor to the bank or financial institution but is extended to recovery from other persons who are indebted to the debtor called \"third party debtorders\" or \"garnisheeorders\". Sub-sections (2) to (4) of Section 28 are in the nature of garnishment proceedings. A garnishment is a proceeding by which a diligent creditor may legally obtain preference on other creditors by sequestration of the effects of a debtor in the hands of his debtorIf a court is passing an order to recover the amount from the  salary through the employer, i.e., by a garnishee order, thena garnishee order  cannot exceed 50% of a debtor's monthly income.This is to ensure the debtor has enough income to meet basic needs.There are also exemptions for certain types of income like minimum wages.Therefore you may wait for the court judgment in this regard and plan further steps accordinlgy.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "DRT case for personal loan default",
    "answer": "- As per the RBI, the bank should give proper time and offers for the settlement of loan amount.,  on the ground of health and sudden loss- Since, there is no property in your name for attachment then the Tribunal can order for the attachment of the salary per month.-  However, even if there is any property in your wife name then it will not come under the attachment for the recovery of loan which you have taken from the bank, if she is not a guarantor- You can mention before the DRT that the salary is only a source of your livelihood and hence only 1/3 should be deducted- Yes , the DRT can approach directly to your employer , if you will not agree for the same.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Dispute over transportation fees of my child",
    "answer": "Manual Challan Procedure:Schools often issue a “manual challan” when fees are paid offline (by cash, demand draft, or bank transfer). This challan should detail each fee component (tuition, bus fee, etc.). However, many schools use digital portals that combine all fees, and there’s no statutory mandate requiring them to split components.What You Can Request:Ask the school management to provide a revised fee invoice (or manual challan) that clearly shows tuition and bus charges separately.If they refuse, send a formal email stating that you will only authorize payment for tuition fees (with corresponding bank transfer records showing the breakdown in the narration).Alternatives & Record Keeping:Use traceable bank transfers where you clearly note “Tuition Fee – [Term]” as the payment purpose.Retain all emails and transfer receipts to document that you paid the tuition fee.If the dispute escalates, consider involving the education authority or filing an application in family court to get clarity on fee sharing.These steps help protect you legally and show your intent to pay only the appropriate component while discouraging further disputes."

    "question": "Child custody",
    "answer": "Thank you for sharing the detailed background. Your case involves sensitive and critical issues ofchild custody,jurisdiction, andthe welfare of a minor, which Indian courts treat with utmost priority. Let me address your queries one by one withclarity and practical advice:1. Can this case be expedited or transferred to High Court?Yes, it can. Since the matter pertains to the custody of aminor child, you can file awrit petition or transfer petitionbefore the Hon’ble High Court underArticle 227 of theConstitution of Indiato seek expeditious hearing or direct intervention.Courts are generally receptive to such prayers, especially whencustody-related delaysare causing hardship to the child.In addition, you can move anapplication for early hearingin the family court as an interim relief, supported by valid grounds like schooling, documentation delays, etc.2. Will the Court consider your son’s opinion (he’s now 12)?Yes, absolutely. Indian courts, particularly underGuardians and Wards ActandHindu Minority and Guardianship Act, do take theopinion of a minor above 9 yearsinto account—provided the child is mature enough to understand the situation.However, it is notbinding—it’s one of the factors.If there is influence or coaching from any side (e.g., paternal family), the court can directchild counselingor interaction with theChild Welfare Committee (CWC)or aCourt-appointed Counselor.3. How to expedite the case legally?To fast-track the process:File aninterlocutory applicationin the family court forearly disposalor priority listing.Alternatively, approach theHigh Courtvia writ jurisdiction fordirections to the family court to conclude the matter within a time-bound period.You may also mention your difficulty in applying forpassport, Aadhaar, or visadue to the pending case, making it a compelling ground for urgency.4. How much weight does the Court give to child’s opinion?The Court always prioritizes“the best interest of the child”over mere preferences. If the father’s household has past instability (remarriages, divorce), and if the child is in astable, nurturing environmentunder your parents, it worksin your favour.The court will consider factors like:Schooling, routines, emotional bondingYour financial capability and international opportunitiesChild’s safety, moral environment, and future stability5. Approximate cost to fight the case in High Court?Acustody-related writ or transfer petitionin High Court can range from ₹75,000 to ₹1,50,000 depending on the complexity, urgency, and the lawyer’s experience.However, I tailor my professional chargesbased on your circumstancesand ensurecomplete end-to-end support, including representation, drafting, and follow-ups.6. Chances of High Court accepting your matter?Verystrong, provided the documentation is proper and the petition clearly shows:Undue delayin lower courtImpact on your son’s rights and developmentLegal hurdles in gettingpassport or visaYourCanadian citizenshipand genuine intent to raise your child in a stable environmentHigh Courts interveneespecially when lower courts show delay or when minors’ future is compromised.✅ Why Engage Me?I specialize incomplex family law matters, particularly involvingNRI/OCI parents.I can ensurestrategic representation, solid drafting, andcourtroom advocacy.I will guide you onhow to present your son’s best interest,gather supporting documents, and managepassport and visa documentationlegally.We can set up apaid consultation over a call or Zoomat your convenience where I’ll review the court papers and plan your next legal move in detail.Please feel free to reach out on WhatsApp atNINE FIVE NINE TWO FIVE ZERO ZERO ZERO SIX EIGHTto schedule a discussion.Warm regards,Advocate, Punjab & Haryana High Court📍 Based in ChandigarhSharan ChopraAdvocate, Chandigarh121 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sharan Chopra"

    "question": "DRT case for personal loan default",
    "answer": "You are referring to garnishee proceedings, i.e., recovery of the debit amount from the salary through the employer.With regard to the recovery of debt determined by the DRT, after the issuance of the Certificate of Recovery, there are two different modes of recovery stipulated in Sections 25 and 28 of the Act. The recovery of debt is not limited to recovery from the actual debtor to the bank or financial institution but is extended to recovery from other persons who are indebted to the debtor called \"third party debtorders\" or \"garnisheeorders\". Sub-sections (2) to (4) of Section 28 are in the nature of garnishment proceedings. A garnishment is a proceeding by which a diligent creditor may legally obtain preference on other creditors by sequestration of the effects of a debtor in the hands of his debtorIf a court is passing an order to recover the amount from the  salary through the employer, i.e., by a garnishee order, thena garnishee order  cannot exceed 50% of a debtor's monthly income.This is to ensure the debtor has enough income to meet basic needs.There are also exemptions for certain types of income like minimum wages.Therefore you may wait for the court judgment in this regard and plan further steps accordinlgy.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "DRT case for personal loan default",
    "answer": "You are referring to garnishee proceedings, i.e., recovery of the debit amount from the salary through the employer.With regard to the recovery of debt determined by the DRT, after the issuance of the Certificate of Recovery, there are two different modes of recovery stipulated in Sections 25 and 28 of the Act. The recovery of debt is not limited to recovery from the actual debtor to the bank or financial institution but is extended to recovery from other persons who are indebted to the debtor called \"third party debtorders\" or \"garnisheeorders\". Sub-sections (2) to (4) of Section 28 are in the nature of garnishment proceedings. A garnishment is a proceeding by which a diligent creditor may legally obtain preference on other creditors by sequestration of the effects of a debtor in the hands of his debtorIf a court is passing an order to recover the amount from the  salary through the employer, i.e., by a garnishee order, thena garnishee order  cannot exceed 50% of a debtor's monthly income.This is to ensure the debtor has enough income to meet basic needs.There are also exemptions for certain types of income like minimum wages.Therefore you may wait for the court judgment in this regard and plan further steps accordinlgy.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Dispute over transportation fees of my child",
    "answer": "Manual Challan Procedure:Schools often issue a “manual challan” when fees are paid offline (by cash, demand draft, or bank transfer). This challan should detail each fee component (tuition, bus fee, etc.). However, many schools use digital portals that combine all fees, and there’s no statutory mandate requiring them to split components.What You Can Request:Ask the school management to provide a revised fee invoice (or manual challan) that clearly shows tuition and bus charges separately.If they refuse, send a formal email stating that you will only authorize payment for tuition fees (with corresponding bank transfer records showing the breakdown in the narration).Alternatives & Record Keeping:Use traceable bank transfers where you clearly note “Tuition Fee – [Term]” as the payment purpose.Retain all emails and transfer receipts to document that you paid the tuition fee.If the dispute escalates, consider involving the education authority or filing an application in family court to get clarity on fee sharing.These steps help protect you legally and show your intent to pay only the appropriate component while discouraging further disputes."

    "question": "Regarding complaint on 118 violation",
    "answer": "Thanks for sharing these important details. From what you've explained, your matter involves a mix ofproperty law under Section 118 of the Himachal Pradesh Tenancy and Land Reforms Act, tenancy issues, and a pending criminal complaint—all of which require strategic legal handling to protect your rights and close this issue permanently.Let me guide you point-by-point:🔹Regarding the Alleged Violation of Section 118As per Section 118, non-agriculturists require permission to purchase or lease land in Himachal Pradesh. Since you’ve already obtained government permission topurchase the land, your ownership is valid.However, creating a lease deed with a non-agriculturist without proper government permission may technically be seen as a violationonly if:It is a long-term lease that amounts to transfer of possession/control,It is considered a disguised sale or permanent arrangement,Andif there is irrefutable proof that a formal lease was executed and acted upon.Your defence here will rely on:Thenature of the agreement(short-term, non-renewable, no possession rights, and conditional use only after registration),Thefact that you initiated registration and NOC was granted by police in 3 months,And thatthe agreement has no evidentiary strength, as it’s not in his possession, it was partly oral, and was not registered or legally enforceable under the Act.So yes—youcan challenge the validity of the lease agreement, or state that it was aconditional licence, not a lease, and certainly not in the nature of transfer contemplated under Section 118.🔹Regarding the Eviction & Trespassing FIRSince:The FIR is pending but chargesheet has not been filed for 7 months,You have a NOC from police themselves to operate the homestay,His possession was conditional and terminated due to breach,You have astrong casethat there was no illegal trespass. Police delay in filing the chargesheet may also work in your favour aslack of prima facie evidence.We can even consider moving toquash the FIRunder Section482 CrPCif needed—after reviewing the contents of the complaint.🔹Regarding Complaints to Tourism/Revenue AuthoritiesThis is just pressure tactics. Now that your homestay is registered, you are legally compliant. I can help youdraft a proper reply to the Tehsildarexplaining:That there was no valid lease or transfer,That the agreement was not acted upon legally or completed,And that the complainant is trying to harass you after being evicted for suspicious activity.We’ll also highlight theNOC and registration of the homestayto show bona fide compliance.📌 My Professional Suggestion:You’re at a stage where everything needs to be consolidated withlegally strong, clear replies—before things go against you in record. Based on what you've told me, I can assist you with:Drafting a professional legal replyto the Tehsildar under Section 118,Strategic adviceon handling the police FIR and possibly getting it quashed,Drafting a replyto the tourism department to close that complaint, andPreparing future-proof documentation for your homestay to avoid such issues again.Let me handle this properly for you—you’ve already taken all the right steps like getting NOC and registration, now let’s put it all togetherlegally and professionally.Warm regardsContact/WhatsApp No-Sharan ChopraAdvocate, Chandigarh121 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sharan Chopra"

Tenancy and Land Reforms Act, 1972 the land purchased by a non-agriculturist after obtaining the permission of Government is required to be put to use within stipulated period for the purpose for which permission was granted.Therefore you may gather evidence to establish the fact that there was no violation in this regard and challenge the same appropriately before the concerned authorities.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Dispute over transportation fees of my child",
    "answer": "Manual Challan Procedure:Schools often issue a “manual challan” when fees are paid offline (by cash, demand draft, or bank transfer). This challan should detail each fee component (tuition, bus fee, etc.). However, many schools use digital portals that combine all fees, and there’s no statutory mandate requiring them to split components.What You Can Request:Ask the school management to provide a revised fee invoice (or manual challan) that clearly shows tuition and bus charges separately.If they refuse, send a formal email stating that you will only authorize payment for tuition fees (with corresponding bank transfer records showing the breakdown in the narration).Alternatives & Record Keeping:Use traceable bank transfers where you clearly note “Tuition Fee – [Term]” as the payment purpose.Retain all emails and transfer receipts to document that you paid the tuition fee.If the dispute escalates, consider involving the education authority or filing an application in family court to get clarity on fee sharing.These steps help protect you legally and show your intent to pay only the appropriate component while discouraging further disputes."

    "answer": "Hindu law of property is not yet codified. It derived from ancient shastras and commentaries. Any contribution by a family member to the  funds of acquisition of property makes that property joint.  That every ordinary acquisition becomes joint, no matter how much or how little each individual member of the family may have contributed to its being made. “If any help is taken from the family property it is enough to make the self-acquired property the property of the family.” This the law laid down by SC in number of pronouncements. There need not be any agreement to treat the  property joint. Any refund of contribution will be an admission of contribution and will be seen as an attempt to bypass the  establish proposition of law.Ravi ShindeAdvocate, Hyderabad4923 Answers42 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ravi Shinde"

The following are things that you can do:As you have published a notice in the newspaper, the court will check if your wife appears on the next hearing date. And if she still does not appear, the court may proceed ex parte and move toward granting the divorce.If ex parte, the court could grant divorce within 2-3 hearings, and it may take around 5-6 months. And if contested, then it will take around 2-3 years.Ensure your substituted service as giving notice in the newspaper is a sufficient proof of proper notice.But there are various ways through which your wife can delay the divorce proceeding, by appearing at the last moment and contesting the divorce and resettling the divorce proceeding.If she does not appear for the case again in June, request the court to proceed with an ex parte decree immediately.Hope this helps you; if you still have any clarifications or issues, do not hesitate to ask.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Breaking of engagement",
    "answer": "The Legal Status of Engagement in IndiaEngagement is a religious and social understanding, but not a legally binding agreement in Indian law. Either party can terminate the engagement at any moment prior to marriage without any form of liability. There is no breach of promise to marry law or damages exclusively for wrongful termination of engagement.2. How to Legally Break the EngagementYou can advise the girl and her family in writing (preferably by way of a legal notice) that you do not want to continue with the marriage. Return the gifts or costs incurred on account of the engagement to avoid future quarrels. It is recommended that there be a written mutual settlement or admission that neither party has any claims against the other to avoid future harassment or legal proceedings.3. Issue Regarding Caste and Social BarrierThough caste is a social consideration, as per law it is not an aspect to force or nullify an engagement or marriage. It is your right to call off the engagement owing to caste issues, but stand ready for anticipated social or familial retribution.4. Physical Relationship and Concerns of Government JobHaving had a physical relationship on agreed terms, it does not amount to legal obligations to get married. There is no legal requirement to marry because of physical encounters. Being a government worker, there is no immediate legal penalty for calling off the engagement, but be watchful for any social or work-related repercussions.5. Threats of Suicide and WhatsApp MessagesSave and store all WhatsApp messages and any other proof of threats or abuse. Suicide threats are serious; you might want to report to local authorities or apply for protection orders if you are threatened. You can also further choose to register a police complaint for criminal harassment or intimidation if the threats persist. It is best to see a lawyer right away to shield yourself from any form of false accusations or coercion.6. Potential Legal Risks and How to Avoid ThemThe family of the girl or the girl herself may attempt to lodge complaints like dowry harassment or defamation. If you have not harassed her or demanded dowry, these complaints can be rebutted. Document all communication and keep away from using abusive or threatening language. If false cases are lodged, you can approach court for quashing of FIRs and apply for anticipatory bail if required.7. Practical Steps to Take NowIssue a notice through a lawyer to legally call off the engagement and make your stand clear. Save all records of threats or harassment. Avoid face-to-face confrontation; allow your lawyer to deal with correspondence. If threatened or harassed, register a police complaint and avail yourself of legal protection. Seek advice and counsel from a family law attorney.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Thanks for reaching out with your situation — I completely understand how sensitive and urgent this is, especially whenchildren are involvedand the property is in her name. Let me guide you withclear, practical legal optionsto protect yourself and your children.🔍 Your Situation in Brief:You and your wife have beenliving separately for over a year.Sheleft the matrimonial homevoluntarily and is allegedly in an extramarital relationship.You havecustody of the children, and you all currently reside in the house which islegally in her name.Now she wants toreturn forcibly, possibly with the intention to harass or disturb, or to gain an upper hand in court proceedings.🚫 Can You Stop Her from Entering the House?This istricky, becauseshe is the legal ownerof the house. However, youdo have legal options, especially when children’s welfare is at stake and when herintentions are malicious or harassing.✅ Legal Options to Consider:1.Injunction/Restraining Order (Temporary Injunction under Order 39 CPC)You can file acivil suit for injunctionin the local civil court requesting that sheshould not be allowed to enter or disturb possessiondue to herabandonmentand current litigation.Grounds: Her absence for 1+ year, emotional harm to children, and current custody litigation.Especially strong if you can show she hasno intention to cohabit, and only wants to create pressure or gain leverage.2.Guardianship and Custody Proceedings (Ongoing)You can file aninterim applicationin the custody case torestrict her from entering the home, as her presence will disturb the children’s mental well-being.Courts prioritize thebest interest of children, and this is a powerful ground.3.Filing for Divorce (Yes, It’s Advisable Now)Filing a divorce now (if not already done) will:Give you legal standing to present her affair and abandonment asgrounds for divorce.Strengthen your custody claim.Allow you toseek residential rights/protectionfor yourself and children under Section 26 of theHindu Marriage Actor through interim orders.4.Police Protection (If Threats/Force Involved)If she tries to enter forcibly or threatens violence, you canlodge a police complaintor requestprotectionfrom local authorities.⚠️ Important Notes:Do NOT physically block her entry without a court order— since she’s the legal owner, this can backfire.Let the courtrestrict her legally— which will be in your favour considering the history and your children's custody.💼 How I Can Help:Drafting and filing theinjunction petition, divorce case, or interim custody application.Preparinglegal grounds with proof(like her absence, affair, mental effect on children).Handling court filingsremotely or in person, depending on where you're based.Would you like me to start with thedivorce petition + injunction draft?

    "question": "Builder acquiring majority units in a Delhi builder-floor: legal options for dissenting owners (dos) to safeguard rights against",
    "answer": "You're dealing with a common yet complex issue in Delhi involving builder-floor redevelopments where a builder acquires majority units (5 of 8, possibly 6 soon) and pressures remaining dissenting owners (DOs) into selling. Legally, if the builder claims the property as undivided (due to no OC, CC, or sanctioned plan), he may file a partition suit and seek a court-ordered auction. In such cases, there’s a real risk of undervaluation, especially if the builder influences the valuation process. This has happened in past Delhi cases, where court-supervised sales favored builders due to low reserve prices. To protect your interests, DOs should immediately filecaveatsin local and High Court, issue alegal noticeasserting ownership rights, and fileRTIswith MCD/DDA regarding building legality. If partition or auction is initiated, demand acourt-appointed independent valuerand requestHigh Court supervisionfor transparency. Filing awrit petitionunder Article 226 is a strong option if there's coercion or procedural unfairness. While litigation may stretch 5–10 years with costs ranging ₹5–30 lakhs, resisting can lead to higher compensation or better redevelopment terms. Joint legal action by DOs improves your position significantly.Shubham GoyalAdvocate, Delhi1186 Answers7 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shubham Goyal"

    "question": "Builder acquiring majority units in a Delhi builder-floor: legal options for dissenting owners (dos) to safeguard rights against",
    "answer": "1. The builder may move court for partition since the building has no OC or CC besides there are two dissenting owners for redevelopment. In that case the DOs would be made as parties to the suit, they can then challenge the suit filed by him on merits and can oppose the valuer or commissioner recommended by the builder, instead they can request the court to appoint independent valuer or a commissioner.2. Any person who intends to grasp the properties by any illegal means can adopt any type of strategy including the under valuation of the property therefore it is not an uncommon situation.  you need to exercise cautionary measures accordingly.3. A builder cannot unilaterally demand a partition of independent flats solely based on owning a majority share, as each flat owner has a right to their property and a proportionate share in the land.This UDS ensures that apartment owners are the legal holders of the land, providing rights in common spaces, and the overall property.Partitioning a property involves dividing it into separate, independent units.While a builder may have a majority share, they cannot unilaterally force a partition or redevelopment of independent flats without the consent of all the flat owners.4. Insofar as the time taken for disposal of the case by lower courts till supreme court, is an enigmatic situation, nobody can predict the time taken at different levels or each level owing to various factors involved in the  court cases across India.In cases of disputes or redevelopment, the UDS ownership is vital, as it helps in asserting claims.The builder therefore cannot bring the properties into a partition suit, because it is not maintainable as the properties / flats are already partitioned into individual unitsT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Frequent forcible shifting of paid allotted parking lots in the name of cultural activities",
    "answer": "As a senior citizen who has paid for an assigned open parking lot in your gated community, you have a good legal and practical ground to protest the coercive relocation of your parking lot and blocking of access during cultural events.Legal Position on Paid Parking Allotment in Gated CommunitiesWhen you pay for a particular parking space, you get a contractual right to occupy that space. This right is guaranteed under the terms of your contract with the RWA or the housing society, and it cannot be arbitrarily withdrawn or changed without your prior permission. The Supreme Court rulings and RERA directives make it very clear that both the open and stilt parking areas are common areas but usage rights are distributed among the residents on payment or allotment. The allotments have to be respected by the RWA and the RWA cannot arbitrarily displace a resident's vehicle without following due process and consent of the party. RWAs are able to hold community events but in a manner that does not take away the rights of residents. Preventing the main roads from use or pushing residents to displace paid parking cars, particularly seniors who need medical attention, is tantamount to abuse of authority.Rights as a Senior Citizen and ResidentThe medical requirements and age enhance your right to free access to your vehicle. Therefore, the following action made by the RWA that hinders your quick access to your car in times of emergencies can infringe on your right to health. You have the legal right to peacefully enjoy the paid parking area without unwarranted interference or forced shifting. The RWA has to allow free passage of ambulances and emergency services at all times of the day. Therefore, keeping the main circular road closed for hours is not reasonable and can be challenged in the court.Legality of Forcible Shifting of Your VehicleMaking you move your vehicle without notice, consent, or alternative arrangement would probably be against the law. The RWA must ensure to also offer adequate alternatives. Such conduct might contravene the society's own bye-laws or the Maharashtra Ownership Flats Act (MOFA) or equivalent state legislation applying to housing societies, which require honest and equitable management of parking.Recommended Legal ActionReference the conditions of your parking allotment and society bye-laws to ensure your rights and obligations of the RWA.Write a formal complaint to the RWA, mentioning your status as a senior citizen, medical emergency requirements, and right to paid parking. Ask them not to disturb your parking space.You can invoke provisions under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, which protects senior citizens' rights to property and peaceful living.In case the RWA continues, send a legal notice via an attorney requesting the stoppage of forcible changing and hindrance.You can go to the Consumer Forum or Civil Court seeking enforcement of your rights, alleging harassment and breach of contractual rights.In case of obstruction of ambulances or emergency access, you can also lodge a police complaint for obstruction of emergency services.Record all cases of forced relocation, road blocking, and any medical emergencies arising out of delay.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Hindu law of property is not yet codified. It derived from ancient shastras and commentaries. Any contribution by a family member to the  funds of acquisition of property makes that property joint.  That every ordinary acquisition becomes joint, no matter how much or how little each individual member of the family may have contributed to its being made. “If any help is taken from the family property it is enough to make the self-acquired property the property of the family.” This the law laid down by SC in number of pronouncements. There need not be any agreement to treat the  property joint. Any refund of contribution will be an admission of contribution and will be seen as an attempt to bypass the  establish proposition of law.Ravi ShindeAdvocate, Hyderabad4923 Answers42 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ravi Shinde"

    "answer": "Dear client,It looks like you are pursuing a contested divorce in India, which is being based in the U.S. Since your wife has not been participating in the court hearings, the case will move towards the e-parte divorce. The following are things that you can do:As you have published a notice in the newspaper, the court will check if your wife appears on the next hearing date. And if she still does not appear, the court may proceed ex parte and move toward granting the divorce.If ex parte, the court could grant divorce within 2-3 hearings, and it may take around 5-6 months. And if contested, then it will take around 2-3 years.Ensure your substituted service as giving notice in the newspaper is a sufficient proof of proper notice.But there are various ways through which your wife can delay the divorce proceeding, by appearing at the last moment and contesting the divorce and resettling the divorce proceeding.If she does not appear for the case again in June, request the court to proceed with an ex parte decree immediately.Hope this helps you; if you still have any clarifications or issues, do not hesitate to ask.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "In Periannan (S) v. CIT, in a partition between a father and his two sons, the father had to pay to one of his sons a sum over two lakhs. The son purchased property worth more than 5 lakhs and took a sum of Rs. 50k by withdrawing from the amount owed by father and paid it as advance. The balance is paid out of his self acquired funds. At the time of purchase assesee was not married. But subsequently when he marred, he constituted Hindu joint family with his wife. It was held that property in his hands should be treated as joint family property notwithstanding that only small portion of purchase price came from the joint family funds.

    "question": "Regarding complaint on 118 violation",
    "answer": "Thanks for sharing these important details. From what you've explained, your matter involves a mix ofproperty law under Section 118 of the Himachal Pradesh Tenancy and Land Reforms Act, tenancy issues, and a pending criminal complaint—all of which require strategic legal handling to protect your rights and close this issue permanently.Let me guide you point-by-point:🔹Regarding the Alleged Violation of Section 118As per Section 118, non-agriculturists require permission to purchase or lease land in Himachal Pradesh. Since you’ve already obtained government permission topurchase the land, your ownership is valid.However, creating a lease deed with a non-agriculturist without proper government permission may technically be seen as a violationonly if:It is a long-term lease that amounts to transfer of possession/control,It is considered a disguised sale or permanent arrangement,Andif there is irrefutable proof that a formal lease was executed and acted upon.Your defence here will rely on:Thenature of the agreement(short-term, non-renewable, no possession rights, and conditional use only after registration),Thefact that you initiated registration and NOC was granted by police in 3 months,And thatthe agreement has no evidentiary strength, as it’s not in his possession, it was partly oral, and was not registered or legally enforceable under the Act.So yes—youcan challenge the validity of the lease agreement, or state that it was aconditional licence, not a lease, and certainly not in the nature of transfer contemplated under Section 118.🔹Regarding the Eviction & Trespassing FIRSince:The FIR is pending but chargesheet has not been filed for 7 months,You have a NOC from police themselves to operate the homestay,His possession was conditional and terminated due to breach,You have astrong casethat there was no illegal trespass. Police delay in filing the chargesheet may also work in your favour aslack of prima facie evidence.We can even consider moving toquash the FIRunder Section482 CrPCif needed—after reviewing the contents of the complaint.🔹Regarding Complaints to Tourism/Revenue AuthoritiesThis is just pressure tactics. Now that your homestay is registered, you are legally compliant. I can help youdraft a proper reply to the Tehsildarexplaining:That there was no valid lease or transfer,That the agreement was not acted upon legally or completed,And that the complainant is trying to harass you after being evicted for suspicious activity.We’ll also highlight theNOC and registration of the homestayto show bona fide compliance.📌 My Professional Suggestion:You’re at a stage where everything needs to be consolidated withlegally strong, clear replies—before things go against you in record. Based on what you've told me, I can assist you with:Drafting a professional legal replyto the Tehsildar under Section 118,Strategic adviceon handling the police FIR and possibly getting it quashed,Drafting a replyto the tourism department to close that complaint, andPreparing future-proof documentation for your homestay to avoid such issues again.Let me handle this properly for you—you’ve already taken all the right steps like getting NOC and registration, now let’s put it all togetherlegally and professionally.Warm regardsContact/WhatsApp No-Sharan ChopraAdvocate, Chandigarh121 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sharan Chopra"

Tenancy and Land Reforms Act, 1972 the land purchased by a non-agriculturist after obtaining the permission of Government is required to be put to use within stipulated period for the purpose for which permission was granted.Therefore you may gather evidence to establish the fact that there was no violation in this regard and challenge the same appropriately before the concerned authorities.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Regarding complaint on 118 violation",
    "answer": "Thanks for sharing these important details. From what you've explained, your matter involves a mix ofproperty law under Section 118 of the Himachal Pradesh Tenancy and Land Reforms Act, tenancy issues, and a pending criminal complaint—all of which require strategic legal handling to protect your rights and close this issue permanently.Let me guide you point-by-point:🔹Regarding the Alleged Violation of Section 118As per Section 118, non-agriculturists require permission to purchase or lease land in Himachal Pradesh. Since you’ve already obtained government permission topurchase the land, your ownership is valid.However, creating a lease deed with a non-agriculturist without proper government permission may technically be seen as a violationonly if:It is a long-term lease that amounts to transfer of possession/control,It is considered a disguised sale or permanent arrangement,Andif there is irrefutable proof that a formal lease was executed and acted upon.Your defence here will rely on:Thenature of the agreement(short-term, non-renewable, no possession rights, and conditional use only after registration),Thefact that you initiated registration and NOC was granted by police in 3 months,And thatthe agreement has no evidentiary strength, as it’s not in his possession, it was partly oral, and was not registered or legally enforceable under the Act.So yes—youcan challenge the validity of the lease agreement, or state that it was aconditional licence, not a lease, and certainly not in the nature of transfer contemplated under Section 118.🔹Regarding the Eviction & Trespassing FIRSince:The FIR is pending but chargesheet has not been filed for 7 months,You have a NOC from police themselves to operate the homestay,His possession was conditional and terminated due to breach,You have astrong casethat there was no illegal trespass. Police delay in filing the chargesheet may also work in your favour aslack of prima facie evidence.We can even consider moving toquash the FIRunder Section482 CrPCif needed—after reviewing the contents of the complaint.🔹Regarding Complaints to Tourism/Revenue AuthoritiesThis is just pressure tactics. Now that your homestay is registered, you are legally compliant. I can help youdraft a proper reply to the Tehsildarexplaining:That there was no valid lease or transfer,That the agreement was not acted upon legally or completed,And that the complainant is trying to harass you after being evicted for suspicious activity.We’ll also highlight theNOC and registration of the homestayto show bona fide compliance.📌 My Professional Suggestion:You’re at a stage where everything needs to be consolidated withlegally strong, clear replies—before things go against you in record. Based on what you've told me, I can assist you with:Drafting a professional legal replyto the Tehsildar under Section 118,Strategic adviceon handling the police FIR and possibly getting it quashed,Drafting a replyto the tourism department to close that complaint, andPreparing future-proof documentation for your homestay to avoid such issues again.Let me handle this properly for you—you’ve already taken all the right steps like getting NOC and registration, now let’s put it all togetherlegally and professionally.Warm regardsContact/WhatsApp No-Sharan ChopraAdvocate, Chandigarh121 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sharan Chopra"

Tenancy and Land Reforms Act, 1972 the land purchased by a non-agriculturist after obtaining the permission of Government is required to be put to use within stipulated period for the purpose for which permission was granted.Therefore you may gather evidence to establish the fact that there was no violation in this regard and challenge the same appropriately before the concerned authorities.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

However, youdo have legal options, especially when children’s welfare is at stake and when herintentions are malicious or harassing.✅ Legal Options to Consider:1.Injunction/Restraining Order (Temporary Injunction under Order 39 CPC)You can file acivil suit for injunctionin the local civil court requesting that sheshould not be allowed to enter or disturb possessiondue to herabandonmentand current litigation.Grounds: Her absence for 1+ year, emotional harm to children, and current custody litigation.Especially strong if you can show she hasno intention to cohabit, and only wants to create pressure or gain leverage.2.Guardianship and Custody Proceedings (Ongoing)You can file aninterim applicationin the custody case torestrict her from entering the home, as her presence will disturb the children’s mental well-being.Courts prioritize thebest interest of children, and this is a powerful ground.3.Filing for Divorce (Yes, It’s Advisable Now)Filing a divorce now (if not already done) will:Give you legal standing to present her affair and abandonment asgrounds for divorce.Strengthen your custody claim.Allow you toseek residential rights/protectionfor yourself and children under Section 26 of theHindu Marriage Actor through interim orders.4.Police Protection (If Threats/Force Involved)If she tries to enter forcibly or threatens violence, you canlodge a police complaintor requestprotectionfrom local authorities.⚠️ Important Notes:Do NOT physically block her entry without a court order— since she’s the legal owner, this can backfire.Let the courtrestrict her legally— which will be in your favour considering the history and your children's custody.💼 How I Can Help:Drafting and filing theinjunction petition, divorce case, or interim custody application.Preparinglegal grounds with proof(like her absence, affair, mental effect on children).Handling court filingsremotely or in person, depending on where you're based.Would you like me to start with thedivorce petition + injunction draft? I can guide you step-by-step and ensure your and your children’s rights are fully protected.Let’s connect directly if you’re ready to proceed.Best regards,Advocate – Family Law & Property DisputesWhatsApp On -Available for ConsultationSharan ChopraAdvocate, Chandigarh121 AnswersTalk to Advocate Sharan Chopra"

    "question": "Frequent forcible shifting of paid allotted parking lots in the name of cultural activities",
    "answer": "As a senior citizen who has paid for an assigned open parking lot in your gated community, you have a good legal and practical ground to protest the coercive relocation of your parking lot and blocking of access during cultural events.Legal Position on Paid Parking Allotment in Gated CommunitiesWhen you pay for a particular parking space, you get a contractual right to occupy that space. This right is guaranteed under the terms of your contract with the RWA or the housing society, and it cannot be arbitrarily withdrawn or changed without your prior permission. The Supreme Court rulings and RERA directives make it very clear that both the open and stilt parking areas are common areas but usage rights are distributed among the residents on payment or allotment. The allotments have to be respected by the RWA and the RWA cannot arbitrarily displace a resident's vehicle without following due process and consent of the party. RWAs are able to hold community events but in a manner that does not take away the rights of residents. Preventing the main roads from use or pushing residents to displace paid parking cars, particularly seniors who need medical attention, is tantamount to abuse of authority.Rights as a Senior Citizen and ResidentThe medical requirements and age enhance your right to free access to your vehicle. Therefore, the following action made by the RWA that hinders your quick access to your car in times of emergencies can infringe on your right to health. You have the legal right to peacefully enjoy the paid parking area without unwarranted interference or forced shifting. The RWA has to allow free passage of ambulances and emergency services at all times of the day. Therefore, keeping the main circular road closed for hours is not reasonable and can be challenged in the court.Legality of Forcible Shifting of Your VehicleMaking you move your vehicle without notice, consent, or alternative arrangement would probably be against the law. The RWA must ensure to also offer adequate alternatives. Such conduct might contravene the society's own bye-laws or the Maharashtra Ownership Flats Act (MOFA) or equivalent state legislation applying to housing societies, which require honest and equitable management of parking.Recommended Legal ActionReference the conditions of your parking allotment and society bye-laws to ensure your rights and obligations of the RWA.Write a formal complaint to the RWA, mentioning your status as a senior citizen, medical emergency requirements, and right to paid parking. Ask them not to disturb your parking space.You can invoke provisions under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, which protects senior citizens' rights to property and peaceful living.In case the RWA continues, send a legal notice via an attorney requesting the stoppage of forcible changing and hindrance.You can go to the Consumer Forum or Civil Court seeking enforcement of your rights, alleging harassment and breach of contractual rights.In case of obstruction of ambulances or emergency access, you can also lodge a police complaint for obstruction of emergency services.Record all cases of forced relocation, road blocking, and any medical emergencies arising out of delay.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "context": "Asked 2 months ago in Family Law Religion: Hindu",
    "question": "Breaking of engagement",
    "answer": "The Legal Status of Engagement in IndiaEngagement is a religious and social understanding, but not a legally binding agreement in Indian law. Either party can terminate the engagement at any moment prior to marriage without any form of liability. There is no breach of promise to marry law or damages exclusively for wrongful termination of engagement.2. How to Legally Break the EngagementYou can advise the girl and her family in writing (preferably by way of a legal notice) that you do not want to continue with the marriage. Return the gifts or costs incurred on account of the engagement to avoid future quarrels. It is recommended that there be a written mutual settlement or admission that neither party has any claims against the other to avoid future harassment or legal proceedings.3. Issue Regarding Caste and Social BarrierThough caste is a social consideration, as per law it is not an aspect to force or nullify an engagement or marriage. It is your right to call off the engagement owing to caste issues, but stand ready for anticipated social or familial retribution.4. Physical Relationship and Concerns of Government JobHaving had a physical relationship on agreed terms, it does not amount to legal obligations to get married. There is no legal requirement to marry because of physical encounters. Being a government worker, there is no immediate legal penalty for calling off the engagement, but be watchful for any social or work-related repercussions.5. Threats of Suicide and WhatsApp MessagesSave and store all WhatsApp messages and any other proof of threats or abuse. Suicide threats are serious; you might want to report to local authorities or apply for protection orders if you are threatened. You can also further choose to register a police complaint for criminal harassment or intimidation if the threats persist. It is best to see a lawyer right away to shield yourself from any form of false accusations or coercion.6. Potential Legal Risks and How to Avoid ThemThe family of the girl or the girl herself may attempt to lodge complaints like dowry harassment or defamation. If you have not harassed her or demanded dowry, these complaints can be rebutted. Document all communication and keep away from using abusive or threatening language. If false cases are lodged, you can approach court for quashing of FIRs and apply for anticipatory bail if required.7. Practical Steps to Take NowIssue a notice through a lawyer to legally call off the engagement and make your stand clear. Save all records of threats or harassment. Avoid face-to-face confrontation; allow your lawyer to deal with correspondence. If threatened or harassed, register a police complaint and avail yourself of legal protection. Seek advice and counsel from a family law attorney.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Frequent forcible shifting of paid allotted parking lots in the name of cultural activities",
    "answer": "As a senior citizen who has paid for an assigned open parking lot in your gated community, you have a good legal and practical ground to protest the coercive relocation of your parking lot and blocking of access during cultural events.Legal Position on Paid Parking Allotment in Gated CommunitiesWhen you pay for a particular parking space, you get a contractual right to occupy that space. This right is guaranteed under the terms of your contract with the RWA or the housing society, and it cannot be arbitrarily withdrawn or changed without your prior permission. The Supreme Court rulings and RERA directives make it very clear that both the open and stilt parking areas are common areas but usage rights are distributed among the residents on payment or allotment. The allotments have to be respected by the RWA and the RWA cannot arbitrarily displace a resident's vehicle without following due process and consent of the party. RWAs are able to hold community events but in a manner that does not take away the rights of residents. Preventing the main roads from use or pushing residents to displace paid parking cars, particularly seniors who need medical attention, is tantamount to abuse of authority.Rights as a Senior Citizen and ResidentThe medical requirements and age enhance your right to free access to your vehicle. Therefore, the following action made by the RWA that hinders your quick access to your car in times of emergencies can infringe on your right to health. You have the legal right to peacefully enjoy the paid parking area without unwarranted interference or forced shifting. The RWA has to allow free passage of ambulances and emergency services at all times of the day. Therefore, keeping the main circular road closed for hours is not reasonable and can be challenged in the court.Legality of Forcible Shifting of Your VehicleMaking you move your vehicle without notice, consent, or alternative arrangement would probably be against the law. The RWA must ensure to also offer adequate alternatives. Such conduct might contravene the society's own bye-laws or the Maharashtra Ownership Flats Act (MOFA) or equivalent state legislation applying to housing societies, which require honest and equitable management of parking.Recommended Legal ActionReference the conditions of your parking allotment and society bye-laws to ensure your rights and obligations of the RWA.Write a formal complaint to the RWA, mentioning your status as a senior citizen, medical emergency requirements, and right to paid parking. Ask them not to disturb your parking space.You can invoke provisions under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, which protects senior citizens' rights to property and peaceful living.In case the RWA continues, send a legal notice via an attorney requesting the stoppage of forcible changing and hindrance.You can go to the Consumer Forum or Civil Court seeking enforcement of your rights, alleging harassment and breach of contractual rights.In case of obstruction of ambulances or emergency access, you can also lodge a police complaint for obstruction of emergency services.Record all cases of forced relocation, road blocking, and any medical emergencies arising out of delay.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "The Legal Status of Engagement in IndiaEngagement is a religious and social understanding, but not a legally binding agreement in Indian law. Either party can terminate the engagement at any moment prior to marriage without any form of liability. There is no breach of promise to marry law or damages exclusively for wrongful termination of engagement.2. How to Legally Break the EngagementYou can advise the girl and her family in writing (preferably by way of a legal notice) that you do not want to continue with the marriage. Return the gifts or costs incurred on account of the engagement to avoid future quarrels. It is recommended that there be a written mutual settlement or admission that neither party has any claims against the other to avoid future harassment or legal proceedings.3. Issue Regarding Caste and Social BarrierThough caste is a social consideration, as per law it is not an aspect to force or nullify an engagement or marriage. It is your right to call off the engagement owing to caste issues, but stand ready for anticipated social or familial retribution.4. Physical Relationship and Concerns of Government JobHaving had a physical relationship on agreed terms, it does not amount to legal obligations to get married. There is no legal requirement to marry because of physical encounters. Being a government worker, there is no immediate legal penalty for calling off the engagement, but be watchful for any social or work-related repercussions.5. Threats of Suicide and WhatsApp MessagesSave and store all WhatsApp messages and any other proof of threats or abuse. Suicide threats are serious; you might want to report to local authorities or apply for protection orders if you are threatened. You can also further choose to register a police complaint for criminal harassment or intimidation if the threats persist. It is best to see a lawyer right away to shield yourself from any form of false accusations or coercion.6. Potential Legal Risks and How to Avoid ThemThe family of the girl or the girl herself may attempt to lodge complaints like dowry harassment or defamation. If you have not harassed her or demanded dowry, these complaints can be rebutted. Document all communication and keep away from using abusive or threatening language. If false cases are lodged, you can approach court for quashing of FIRs and apply for anticipatory bail if required.7. Practical Steps to Take NowIssue a notice through a lawyer to legally call off the engagement and make your stand clear. Save all records of threats or harassment. Avoid face-to-face confrontation; allow your lawyer to deal with correspondence. If threatened or harassed, register a police complaint and avail yourself of legal protection. Seek advice and counsel from a family law attorney.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Frequent forcible shifting of paid allotted parking lots in the name of cultural activities",
    "answer": "As a senior citizen who has paid for an assigned open parking lot in your gated community, you have a good legal and practical ground to protest the coercive relocation of your parking lot and blocking of access during cultural events.Legal Position on Paid Parking Allotment in Gated CommunitiesWhen you pay for a particular parking space, you get a contractual right to occupy that space. This right is guaranteed under the terms of your contract with the RWA or the housing society, and it cannot be arbitrarily withdrawn or changed without your prior permission. The Supreme Court rulings and RERA directives make it very clear that both the open and stilt parking areas are common areas but usage rights are distributed among the residents on payment or allotment. The allotments have to be respected by the RWA and the RWA cannot arbitrarily displace a resident's vehicle without following due process and consent of the party. RWAs are able to hold community events but in a manner that does not take away the rights of residents. Preventing the main roads from use or pushing residents to displace paid parking cars, particularly seniors who need medical attention, is tantamount to abuse of authority.Rights as a Senior Citizen and ResidentThe medical requirements and age enhance your right to free access to your vehicle. Therefore, the following action made by the RWA that hinders your quick access to your car in times of emergencies can infringe on your right to health. You have the legal right to peacefully enjoy the paid parking area without unwarranted interference or forced shifting. The RWA has to allow free passage of ambulances and emergency services at all times of the day. Therefore, keeping the main circular road closed for hours is not reasonable and can be challenged in the court.Legality of Forcible Shifting of Your VehicleMaking you move your vehicle without notice, consent, or alternative arrangement would probably be against the law. The RWA must ensure to also offer adequate alternatives. Such conduct might contravene the society's own bye-laws or the Maharashtra Ownership Flats Act (MOFA) or equivalent state legislation applying to housing societies, which require honest and equitable management of parking.Recommended Legal ActionReference the conditions of your parking allotment and society bye-laws to ensure your rights and obligations of the RWA.Write a formal complaint to the RWA, mentioning your status as a senior citizen, medical emergency requirements, and right to paid parking. Ask them not to disturb your parking space.You can invoke provisions under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, which protects senior citizens' rights to property and peaceful living.In case the RWA continues, send a legal notice via an attorney requesting the stoppage of forcible changing and hindrance.You can go to the Consumer Forum or Civil Court seeking enforcement of your rights, alleging harassment and breach of contractual rights.In case of obstruction of ambulances or emergency access, you can also lodge a police complaint for obstruction of emergency services.Record all cases of forced relocation, road blocking, and any medical emergencies arising out of delay.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Let me guide you withclear, practical legal optionsto protect yourself and your children.🔍 Your Situation in Brief:You and your wife have beenliving separately for over a year.Sheleft the matrimonial homevoluntarily and is allegedly in an extramarital relationship.You havecustody of the children, and you all currently reside in the house which islegally in her name.Now she wants toreturn forcibly, possibly with the intention to harass or disturb, or to gain an upper hand in court proceedings.🚫 Can You Stop Her from Entering the House?This istricky, becauseshe is the legal ownerof the house. However, youdo have legal options, especially when children’s welfare is at stake and when herintentions are malicious or harassing.✅ Legal Options to Consider:1.Injunction/Restraining Order (Temporary Injunction under Order 39 CPC)You can file acivil suit for injunctionin the local civil court requesting that sheshould not be allowed to enter or disturb possessiondue to herabandonmentand current litigation.Grounds: Her absence for 1+ year, emotional harm to children, and current custody litigation.Especially strong if you can show she hasno intention to cohabit, and only wants to create pressure or gain leverage.2.Guardianship and Custody Proceedings (Ongoing)You can file aninterim applicationin the custody case torestrict her from entering the home, as her presence will disturb the children’s mental well-being.Courts prioritize thebest interest of children, and this is a powerful ground.3.Filing for Divorce (Yes, It’s Advisable Now)Filing a divorce now (if not already done) will:Give you legal standing to present her affair and abandonment asgrounds for divorce.Strengthen your custody claim.Allow you toseek residential rights/protectionfor yourself and children under Section 26 of theHindu Marriage Actor through interim orders.4.Police Protection (If Threats/Force Involved)If she tries to enter forcibly or threatens violence, you canlodge a police complaintor requestprotectionfrom local authorities.⚠️ Important Notes:Do NOT physically block her entry without a court order— since she’s the legal owner, this can backfire.Let the courtrestrict her legally— which will be in your favour considering the history and your children's custody.💼 How I Can Help:Drafting and filing theinjunction petition, divorce case, or interim custody application.Preparinglegal grounds with proof(like her absence, affair, mental effect on children).Handling court filingsremotely or in person, depending on where you're based.Would you like me to start with thedivorce petition + injunction draft?

It is best to see a lawyer right away to shield yourself from any form of false accusations or coercion.6. Potential Legal Risks and How to Avoid ThemThe family of the girl or the girl herself may attempt to lodge complaints like dowry harassment or defamation. If you have not harassed her or demanded dowry, these complaints can be rebutted. Document all communication and keep away from using abusive or threatening language. If false cases are lodged, you can approach court for quashing of FIRs and apply for anticipatory bail if required.7. Practical Steps to Take NowIssue a notice through a lawyer to legally call off the engagement and make your stand clear. Save all records of threats or harassment. Avoid face-to-face confrontation; allow your lawyer to deal with correspondence. If threatened or harassed, register a police complaint and avail yourself of legal protection.

    "question": "Frequent forcible shifting of paid allotted parking lots in the name of cultural activities",
    "answer": "As a senior citizen who has paid for an assigned open parking lot in your gated community, you have a good legal and practical ground to protest the coercive relocation of your parking lot and blocking of access during cultural events.Legal Position on Paid Parking Allotment in Gated CommunitiesWhen you pay for a particular parking space, you get a contractual right to occupy that space. This right is guaranteed under the terms of your contract with the RWA or the housing society, and it cannot be arbitrarily withdrawn or changed without your prior permission. The Supreme Court rulings and RERA directives make it very clear that both the open and stilt parking areas are common areas but usage rights are distributed among the residents on payment or allotment. The allotments have to be respected by the RWA and the RWA cannot arbitrarily displace a resident's vehicle without following due process and consent of the party. RWAs are able to hold community events but in a manner that does not take away the rights of residents. Preventing the main roads from use or pushing residents to displace paid parking cars, particularly seniors who need medical attention, is tantamount to abuse of authority.Rights as a Senior Citizen and ResidentThe medical requirements and age enhance your right to free access to your vehicle. Therefore, the following action made by the RWA that hinders your quick access to your car in times of emergencies can infringe on your right to health. You have the legal right to peacefully enjoy the paid parking area without unwarranted interference or forced shifting. The RWA has to allow free passage of ambulances and emergency services at all times of the day. Therefore, keeping the main circular road closed for hours is not reasonable and can be challenged in the court.Legality of Forcible Shifting of Your VehicleMaking you move your vehicle without notice, consent, or alternative arrangement would probably be against the law. The RWA must ensure to also offer adequate alternatives. Such conduct might contravene the society's own bye-laws or the Maharashtra Ownership Flats Act (MOFA) or equivalent state legislation applying to housing societies, which require honest and equitable management of parking.Recommended Legal ActionReference the conditions of your parking allotment and society bye-laws to ensure your rights and obligations of the RWA.Write a formal complaint to the RWA, mentioning your status as a senior citizen, medical emergency requirements, and right to paid parking. Ask them not to disturb your parking space.You can invoke provisions under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, which protects senior citizens' rights to property and peaceful living.In case the RWA continues, send a legal notice via an attorney requesting the stoppage of forcible changing and hindrance.You can go to the Consumer Forum or Civil Court seeking enforcement of your rights, alleging harassment and breach of contractual rights.In case of obstruction of ambulances or emergency access, you can also lodge a police complaint for obstruction of emergency services.Record all cases of forced relocation, road blocking, and any medical emergencies arising out of delay.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Breaking of engagement",
    "answer": "The Legal Status of Engagement in IndiaEngagement is a religious and social understanding, but not a legally binding agreement in Indian law. Either party can terminate the engagement at any moment prior to marriage without any form of liability. There is no breach of promise to marry law or damages exclusively for wrongful termination of engagement.2. How to Legally Break the EngagementYou can advise the girl and her family in writing (preferably by way of a legal notice) that you do not want to continue with the marriage. Return the gifts or costs incurred on account of the engagement to avoid future quarrels. It is recommended that there be a written mutual settlement or admission that neither party has any claims against the other to avoid future harassment or legal proceedings.3. Issue Regarding Caste and Social BarrierThough caste is a social consideration, as per law it is not an aspect to force or nullify an engagement or marriage. It is your right to call off the engagement owing to caste issues, but stand ready for anticipated social or familial retribution.4. Physical Relationship and Concerns of Government JobHaving had a physical relationship on agreed terms, it does not amount to legal obligations to get married. There is no legal requirement to marry because of physical encounters. Being a government worker, there is no immediate legal penalty for calling off the engagement, but be watchful for any social or work-related repercussions.5. Threats of Suicide and WhatsApp MessagesSave and store all WhatsApp messages and any other proof of threats or abuse. Suicide threats are serious; you might want to report to local authorities or apply for protection orders if you are threatened. You can also further choose to register a police complaint for criminal harassment or intimidation if the threats persist. It is best to see a lawyer right away to shield yourself from any form of false accusations or coercion.6. Potential Legal Risks and How to Avoid ThemThe family of the girl or the girl herself may attempt to lodge complaints like dowry harassment or defamation. If you have not harassed her or demanded dowry, these complaints can be rebutted. Document all communication and keep away from using abusive or threatening language. If false cases are lodged, you can approach court for quashing of FIRs and apply for anticipatory bail if required.7. Practical Steps to Take NowIssue a notice through a lawyer to legally call off the engagement and make your stand clear. Save all records of threats or harassment. Avoid face-to-face confrontation; allow your lawyer to deal with correspondence. If threatened or harassed, register a police complaint and avail yourself of legal protection.

However, youdo have legal options, especially when children’s welfare is at stake and when herintentions are malicious or harassing.✅ Legal Options to Consider:1.Injunction/Restraining Order (Temporary Injunction under Order 39 CPC)You can file acivil suit for injunctionin the local civil court requesting that sheshould not be allowed to enter or disturb possessiondue to herabandonmentand current litigation.Grounds: Her absence for 1+ year, emotional harm to children, and current custody litigation.Especially strong if you can show she hasno intention to cohabit, and only wants to create pressure or gain leverage.2.Guardianship and Custody Proceedings (Ongoing)You can file aninterim applicationin the custody case torestrict her from entering the home, as her presence will disturb the children’s mental well-being.Courts prioritize thebest interest of children, and this is a powerful ground.3.Filing for Divorce (Yes, It’s Advisable Now)Filing a divorce now (if not already done) will:Give you legal standing to present her affair and abandonment asgrounds for divorce.Strengthen your custody claim.Allow you toseek residential rights/protectionfor yourself and children under Section 26 of theHindu Marriage Actor through interim orders.4.Police Protection (If Threats/Force Involved)If she tries to enter forcibly or threatens violence, you canlodge a police complaintor requestprotectionfrom local authorities.⚠️ Important Notes:Do NOT physically block her entry without a court order— since she’s the legal owner, this can backfire.Let the courtrestrict her legally— which will be in your favour considering the history and your children's custody.💼 How I Can Help:Drafting and filing theinjunction petition, divorce case, or interim custody application.Preparinglegal grounds with proof(like her absence, affair, mental effect on children).Handling court filingsremotely or in person, depending on where you're based.Would you like me to start with thedivorce petition + injunction draft?

    "question": "Builder acquiring majority units in a Delhi builder-floor: legal options for dissenting owners (dos) to safeguard rights against",
    "answer": "You're dealing with a common yet complex issue in Delhi involving builder-floor redevelopments where a builder acquires majority units (5 of 8, possibly 6 soon) and pressures remaining dissenting owners (DOs) into selling. Legally, if the builder claims the property as undivided (due to no OC, CC, or sanctioned plan), he may file a partition suit and seek a court-ordered auction. In such cases, there’s a real risk of undervaluation, especially if the builder influences the valuation process. This has happened in past Delhi cases, where court-supervised sales favored builders due to low reserve prices. To protect your interests, DOs should immediately filecaveatsin local and High Court, issue alegal noticeasserting ownership rights, and fileRTIswith MCD/DDA regarding building legality. If partition or auction is initiated, demand acourt-appointed independent valuerand requestHigh Court supervisionfor transparency. Filing awrit petitionunder Article 226 is a strong option if there's coercion or procedural unfairness. While litigation may stretch 5–10 years with costs ranging ₹5–30 lakhs, resisting can lead to higher compensation or better redevelopment terms. Joint legal action by DOs improves your position significantly.Shubham GoyalAdvocate, Delhi1186 Answers7 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shubham Goyal"

    "question": "Builder acquiring majority units in a Delhi builder-floor: legal options for dissenting owners (dos) to safeguard rights against",
    "answer": "1. The builder may move court for partition since the building has no OC or CC besides there are two dissenting owners for redevelopment. In that case the DOs would be made as parties to the suit, they can then challenge the suit filed by him on merits and can oppose the valuer or commissioner recommended by the builder, instead they can request the court to appoint independent valuer or a commissioner.2. Any person who intends to grasp the properties by any illegal means can adopt any type of strategy including the under valuation of the property therefore it is not an uncommon situation.  you need to exercise cautionary measures accordingly.3. A builder cannot unilaterally demand a partition of independent flats solely based on owning a majority share, as each flat owner has a right to their property and a proportionate share in the land.This UDS ensures that apartment owners are the legal holders of the land, providing rights in common spaces, and the overall property.Partitioning a property involves dividing it into separate, independent units.While a builder may have a majority share, they cannot unilaterally force a partition or redevelopment of independent flats without the consent of all the flat owners.4. Insofar as the time taken for disposal of the case by lower courts till supreme court, is an enigmatic situation, nobody can predict the time taken at different levels or each level owing to various factors involved in the  court cases across India.In cases of disputes or redevelopment, the UDS ownership is vital, as it helps in asserting claims.The builder therefore cannot bring the properties into a partition suit, because it is not maintainable as the properties / flats are already partitioned into individual unitsT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

CAT can be approached only when there is some dispute between employee and Bank. Here there is no dispute as such, you are only asserting your right. Before approaching High Court you need to issue a lawyer's notice seeking transfer or there is already correspondence for transfer you can directly approach High Court. Government guidelines for spouse transfer in public sector banks in India generally allow for the transfer of employees based on the posting of their spouse, particularly when both are working in the public sector. Here are some key points regarding these guidelines:Eligibility: Both employees must be working in the public sector banks, and the request for transfer should be supported by valid documentation, such as marriage certificates.Transfer Requests: Employees can submit a request for transfer to the same location or nearby locations where their spouse is posted. This request is typically considered during the regular transfer processes.Priority Consideration: In many cases, banks have provisions to give priority to spouse transfer requests, especially when both partners are working in the same or related public sector institutions.Time Frame: The transfer request should be made within a reasonable time frame, often aligned with the bank’s transfer policy timelines, which may vary from bank to bank.Policy Variations: Specific policies and guidelines may differ between individual public sector banks, so employees should refer to their respective bank’s human resources department or official policy documents for precise information.Documentation: Employees may need to provide supporting documents, including proof of marriage and the spouse's employment details.Discretion of Management: While guidelines exist, the final decision often lies with the management, which may consider factors such as operational requirements, employee performance, and the availability of positions.It takes about six months for disposal of writ.Ravi ShindeAdvocate, Hyderabad4923 Answers42 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ravi Shinde"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. Obstructive sleep apnea could also put you at higher risk for recurrent heart attacks, strokes, or abnormal heartbeats. It can also lead to depression, memory problems, increase daytime sleepiness and the risk of accidents.Please understand that transfer is not a condition of service, but is merely an incidence of service. An employee, who joins service of an employer having establishments or offices all over India, can be posted in any part of the country and he cannot be heard to complain against transfer from one place to the other. If he fails to comply with or disobeys the order of transfer/posting, he does so at his own peril. Ordinarily, the Court will not interfere with the employer's prerogative to transfer and post an employee from one place or station to the other unless it is established that the action of the employer is contrary to the statutory provisions or is vitiated due to patent arbitrariness or mala fides. This proposition must be treated as settled by the judgments of the Supreme Court in B. Varadha Rao v. Stale of Karnataka , Abani Kanta Ray v. State of Orissa, Union of India v. S.L. Abbas , Public Services Tribunal Bar Association v. State of UP. , Union of India v. Janardhan Debanath & Kendriya Vidyala Sangathan v. Damodar Prasad Pandey.However, there are a number of decisions passed by various High Courts in favour of employees seeking transfer on medical grounds.

    "answer": "The builder's threats for a complaint to the MCD about the demolition by authorities are just created for the purpose of scaring you and get rid of the property.The builder cannot do the redevelopment of his own flats when all the flats are combined and in the same structure especially if other flat owners are not willing to go for this redevelopment.The builder cannot demolish his flats which are coexisting with other flats, in case he is threatening constantly about this, you may issue a legal notice instructing him to refrain from issuing such legal threats failing which you can approach civil court and obtain an order of temporary injunction in a suit for permanent injunction against the developer.You are right in your understanding that for ce auction of the entire building is legally not tenable.If the threat still persist then you can approah civil court with a suit for permanent injunction or high court with a petition to stall his proposed proceedings.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Validity of a registered sale agreement which was registered in 2010",
    "answer": "Aregistered sale agreement for immovable property is valid for three years from the date of registration.However, the ultimate sale deed must be executed and registered within a reasonable time, which is generally considered to be within that 3-year period.The limitation period for filing a suit for specific performance of an agreement to sell, as per Article 54 of the Limitation Act, 1963, is three years from the date fixed for performance, or if no date is fixed, from when the plaintiff has notice of the refusal to perform.In your case neither the buyer issued any notice to the vendor before the expiry of the time limit expressing his readiness and willingness to buy the property by paying the balance of sale consideration amount.Thus as per law the buyer cannot enforce the registration of sale deed beyond the period of three years.Besides, the property has been developed into a plotted layout and the entire plot have been sold out over the period from the date of development of  layout till this date, besides plenty of buyers have even constructed houses in the purchased plots, therefore there is no possibilities for the buyer to turn up at this stage claiming registration of property as per sale agreement and even if he is filing any case, it will not be entertained by court because the buyer was not given possession too at that time.you may proceed with the proposed purchase of property but as a precaution you may obtain a proper legal opinion from an experienced lawyer in the local and proceed only if recommendedT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

The agreement holder can file a case, but proving rights over the property after such a long delay is difficult. Since the land was developed, sold, and houses were built, the court is unlikely to order demolitions but may consider monetary compensation if the claim is valid.

    "question": "Validity of a registered sale agreement which was registered in 2010",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Since the agreement of sale has already been registered within 2010 but not settled, and the owner later developed and sold off the aforementioned property without lawful termination of such an agreement, certainly there are few legal options to consider. That's how this is most probably going to end up:1. Can the Agreement Holder of Year 2010 Return and File a Case?Yes, the agreement holder is free to file a case, but success is their destiny depending on various thingsLimitation Period: Under the Limitation Act, 1963, the limitation period for enforcing a sale agreement through Specific Performance is three years from the date on which the agreement was violated. Since the agreement was signed in 2010 and nothing was done, the period of limitation would have likely expired in 2013 unless extended by fresh payments or admissions.Doctrine of Laches & Acquiescence: The court will consider whether the holder of the agreement slept on their rights for 15 years, and the land became developed, sold, and possessed, which reflects no intention of invoking the agreement.Legal Standing of PACL Group: If the holder of the agreement was an employee and not the actual purchaser, the legal standing in seeking possession is questionable.2. What If They File a Case?If they sue on a case of Specific Performance, it will be rejected since the limitation period would have expired.They might sue for damages for breach of contract, but the burden of proof would rest with them to prove that they had paid consideration and had intended to complete the sale.If fraud or suppression of fact is alleged, the case would take longer, but reversing all transactions is a distant possibility.3. Will House Owners or Site Owners Face Any Issues?The current site owners have obtained registered sale deeds; hence they are bona fide purchasers for value without notice of defect.Courts are reluctant to interfere with third-party rights, especially where multiple transactions, construction, and public interest are involved.The worst-case scenario may be compensation being demanded from the original land owner, rather than demolition of houses.Hope this helps you; if you still have any clarifications or issues, do not hesitate to ask.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "It is confirmed that under Coal India's Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R) policy, for every two acres of land acquired, one employment opportunity is offered to land losers or their dependents, subject to vacancies and suitability.The offer of employment is subject to the candidates meeting minimum eligibility criteria and may require a period of training.The land losers who have clubbed their land in package deal can claim employment for only one loser of the clubbed two acres of land and remaining land losers of the package cannot claim employment or monetary compensation in lieu of the land contributed by them.  A person receiving job forgoes the claim for compensation and a person receiving compensation foregoes  all claims to employment the job.In view of the above said policy for compensation of job in the  land  acquisition, a  job or employment will be offered each to one of the person of  each of the 7/12 title holder be it 2 acres or more.Hence, if the law is understood properly then all the four land owners will get a job each or the monetary compensation as described in the act, whatever has been chosen by the land loser.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "As per section 8.1.B of the  R & R policy of CIL 2012, apart from payment of the  land compensation, employment may be given in the following manner:1. The maximum total number of employments that may be provided to the land losers will be limited to  total number of land acquired divided by two. However employment will be provided in proportion to the land possessed. 2. For every two acres of land one employment can be considered.The land losers who have clubbed their land in package deal can claim employment for only one loser of the clubbed two acres of land and remaining land losers of the package cannot claim employment or monetary compensation in lieu of the land contributed by them.  A person receiving job forgoes the claim for compensation and a person receiving compensation foregoes  all claims to employment the job.Thus in view of the above, the total land put together is 16 acres, hence divided by two, 8 employment can be claimed.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,As a purchaser at an auction, the following is what you should know:No second notice is necessary if the 15-day possession notice under Rule 8(1) and (2) of the Security Interest (Enforcement) Rules, 2002 has already been served (by pasting and letter) and the period has elapsed — which in your case fell due on 19th March 2025.Because the Bank has now been granted a specific date (21st April 2025) by the District Magistrate under Section 14 of the SARFAESI Act, physical possession will be realized by the order of the DM, and no new notice is legally mandated to be affixed again.But for procedural transparency, banks occasionally voluntarily post a second intimation out of precaution — but it is not required by law if prior compliance is already finished.Hope this helps you out, should you require any other explanations or difficulties, please just ask.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Sarfaesi Act 2002 u/s 14 physical possession notice 2nd time required",
    "answer": "Dear Client,As a purchaser at an auction, the following is what you should know:No second notice is necessary if the 15-day possession notice under Rule 8(1) and (2) of the Security Interest (Enforcement) Rules, 2002 has already been served (by pasting and letter) and the period has elapsed — which in your case fell due on 19th March 2025.Because the Bank has now been granted a specific date (21st April 2025) by the District Magistrate under Section 14 of the SARFAESI Act, physical possession will be realized by the order of the DM, and no new notice is legally mandated to be affixed again.But for procedural transparency, banks occasionally voluntarily post a second intimation out of precaution — but it is not required by law if prior compliance is already finished.Hope this helps you out, should you require any other explanations or difficulties, please just ask.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Tenancy law Kolkata",
    "answer": "In your case, tenancy and business ownership are separate legal matters. Here’s how they interact:Can your mother surrender the tenancy and take money without your NOC?If the tenancy is now in your mother’s name, she has legal control over it.However, since the business has been jointly run under apartnership firm, she cannot unilaterally dissolve the business or take business-related compensation without consulting you.If the tenancy was transferred with an understanding that it benefits the partnership business, you may have a claim against her taking money without the firm’s consent.You can challenge the surrender if you prove that the tenancy is for the firm's benefit and not her personal right.What happens to the company if she surrenders the tenancy?If the tenancy is surrendered, the business may lose its operating premises, affecting its continuation.If your mother withdraws from the partnership, you might need to dissolve or restructure the firm.You can legally challenge an unfair surrender by arguing that the premises were used by the partnership, not her alone.Suggested Actions:Verify the tenancy transfer documents—Did she sign any agreement specifying that the tenancy is personal or for the firm's benefit?Check the partnership agreement—Does it mention how business property (tenancy rights) are handled?Negotiate or legally contestif she plans to surrender without your agreement.For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.

    "answer": "These are available online. You need approach High Court of Telangana  at Hyderabad as this is infringement of you fundamental right  under Article 21. CAT can be approached only when there is some dispute between employee and Bank. Here there is no dispute as such, you are only asserting your right. Before approaching High Court you need to issue a lawyer's notice seeking transfer or there is already correspondence for transfer you can directly approach High Court. Government guidelines for spouse transfer in public sector banks in India generally allow for the transfer of employees based on the posting of their spouse, particularly when both are working in the public sector. Here are some key points regarding these guidelines:Eligibility: Both employees must be working in the public sector banks, and the request for transfer should be supported by valid documentation, such as marriage certificates.Transfer Requests: Employees can submit a request for transfer to the same location or nearby locations where their spouse is posted. This request is typically considered during the regular transfer processes.Priority Consideration: In many cases, banks have provisions to give priority to spouse transfer requests, especially when both partners are working in the same or related public sector institutions.Time Frame: The transfer request should be made within a reasonable time frame, often aligned with the bank’s transfer policy timelines, which may vary from bank to bank.Policy Variations: Specific policies and guidelines may differ between individual public sector banks, so employees should refer to their respective bank’s human resources department or official policy documents for precise information.Documentation: Employees may need to provide supporting documents, including proof of marriage and the spouse's employment details.Discretion of Management: While guidelines exist, the final decision often lies with the management, which may consider factors such as operational requirements, employee performance, and the availability of positions.It takes about six months for disposal of writ.Ravi ShindeAdvocate, Hyderabad4923 Answers42 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ravi Shinde"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. Obstructive sleep apnea could also put you at higher risk for recurrent heart attacks, strokes, or abnormal heartbeats. It can also lead to depression, memory problems, increase daytime sleepiness and the risk of accidents.Please understand that transfer is not a condition of service, but is merely an incidence of service. An employee, who joins service of an employer having establishments or offices all over India, can be posted in any part of the country and he cannot be heard to complain against transfer from one place to the other. If he fails to comply with or disobeys the order of transfer/posting, he does so at his own peril. Ordinarily, the Court will not interfere with the employer's prerogative to transfer and post an employee from one place or station to the other unless it is established that the action of the employer is contrary to the statutory provisions or is vitiated due to patent arbitrariness or mala fides. This proposition must be treated as settled by the judgments of the Supreme Court in B. Varadha Rao v. Stale of Karnataka , Abani Kanta Ray v. State of Orissa, Union of India v. S.L. Abbas , Public Services Tribunal Bar Association v. State of UP. , Union of India v. Janardhan Debanath & Kendriya Vidyala Sangathan v. Damodar Prasad Pandey.However, there are a number of decisions passed by various High Courts in favour of employees seeking transfer on medical grounds. You can approach the jurisdictional High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution as it covers both legal and fundamental violations.Detailed discussion is required in such cases.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

The desirability of such a course is obvious. However, this does not mean that their place of posting should invariably be one of their choices, even though their preference may be taken into account while making the decision in accordance with the administrative needs.- Hence your wife is entitled to get posting on spouse grounds.- You can file a complaint before the higher official of the bank, and if refused then she can approach Cat Administrative Tribunal for the same.- Send a legal notice before filing the complaint.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

Expressing serious concern at the “disturbing trend of developers approaching the court and seeking eviction and dispossession of non-cooperating members of housing societies’’, Justice S C Dharmadhikari held that any redevelopment activity “should not compromise the rights of the members and must safeguard the existence of the society.However please note that if the society has passed resolution approving the contract to the developer with the conditions therein by passing a resolution with two third majority, then your proposal to initiate legal action or obtain stay may not be entertained.If the builder is not considering the FSI as per the regulations of the redevelopment then you can fight for your rights through sub registrar or cooperative court.Confirm if the developer has not furnished bank guarantee and is not willing to pay rent to you at par with other members then you  have a case against the developer before the cooperative court.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

CAT can be approached only when there is some dispute between employee and Bank. Here there is no dispute as such, you are only asserting your right. Before approaching High Court you need to issue a lawyer's notice seeking transfer or there is already correspondence for transfer you can directly approach High Court. Government guidelines for spouse transfer in public sector banks in India generally allow for the transfer of employees based on the posting of their spouse, particularly when both are working in the public sector. Here are some key points regarding these guidelines:Eligibility: Both employees must be working in the public sector banks, and the request for transfer should be supported by valid documentation, such as marriage certificates.Transfer Requests: Employees can submit a request for transfer to the same location or nearby locations where their spouse is posted. This request is typically considered during the regular transfer processes.Priority Consideration: In many cases, banks have provisions to give priority to spouse transfer requests, especially when both partners are working in the same or related public sector institutions.Time Frame: The transfer request should be made within a reasonable time frame, often aligned with the bank’s transfer policy timelines, which may vary from bank to bank.Policy Variations: Specific policies and guidelines may differ between individual public sector banks, so employees should refer to their respective bank’s human resources department or official policy documents for precise information.Documentation: Employees may need to provide supporting documents, including proof of marriage and the spouse's employment details.Discretion of Management: While guidelines exist, the final decision often lies with the management, which may consider factors such as operational requirements, employee performance, and the availability of positions.It takes about six months for disposal of writ.Ravi ShindeAdvocate, Hyderabad4923 Answers42 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ravi Shinde"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. Obstructive sleep apnea could also put you at higher risk for recurrent heart attacks, strokes, or abnormal heartbeats. It can also lead to depression, memory problems, increase daytime sleepiness and the risk of accidents.Please understand that transfer is not a condition of service, but is merely an incidence of service. An employee, who joins service of an employer having establishments or offices all over India, can be posted in any part of the country and he cannot be heard to complain against transfer from one place to the other. If he fails to comply with or disobeys the order of transfer/posting, he does so at his own peril. Ordinarily, the Court will not interfere with the employer's prerogative to transfer and post an employee from one place or station to the other unless it is established that the action of the employer is contrary to the statutory provisions or is vitiated due to patent arbitrariness or mala fides. This proposition must be treated as settled by the judgments of the Supreme Court in B. Varadha Rao v. Stale of Karnataka , Abani Kanta Ray v. State of Orissa, Union of India v. S.L. Abbas , Public Services Tribunal Bar Association v. State of UP. , Union of India v. Janardhan Debanath & Kendriya Vidyala Sangathan v. Damodar Prasad Pandey.However, there are a number of decisions passed by various High Courts in favour of employees seeking transfer on medical grounds. You can approach the jurisdictional High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution as it covers both legal and fundamental violations.Detailed discussion is required in such cases.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Since the agreement of sale has already been registered within 2010 but not settled, and the owner later developed and sold off the aforementioned property without lawful termination of such an agreement, certainly there are few legal options to consider. That's how this is most probably going to end up:1. Can the Agreement Holder of Year 2010 Return and File a Case?Yes, the agreement holder is free to file a case, but success is their destiny depending on various thingsLimitation Period: Under the Limitation Act, 1963, the limitation period for enforcing a sale agreement through Specific Performance is three years from the date on which the agreement was violated. Since the agreement was signed in 2010 and nothing was done, the period of limitation would have likely expired in 2013 unless extended by fresh payments or admissions.Doctrine of Laches & Acquiescence: The court will consider whether the holder of the agreement slept on their rights for 15 years, and the land became developed, sold, and possessed, which reflects no intention of invoking the agreement.Legal Standing of PACL Group: If the holder of the agreement was an employee and not the actual purchaser, the legal standing in seeking possession is questionable.2. What If They File a Case?If they sue on a case of Specific Performance, it will be rejected since the limitation period would have expired.They might sue for damages for breach of contract, but the burden of proof would rest with them to prove that they had paid consideration and had intended to complete the sale.If fraud or suppression of fact is alleged, the case would take longer, but reversing all transactions is a distant possibility.3. Will House Owners or Site Owners Face Any Issues?The current site owners have obtained registered sale deeds; hence they are bona fide purchasers for value without notice of defect.Courts are reluctant to interfere with third-party rights, especially where multiple transactions, construction, and public interest are involved.The worst-case scenario may be compensation being demanded from the original land owner, rather than demolition of houses.Hope this helps you; if you still have any clarifications or issues, do not hesitate to ask.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Validity of a registered sale agreement which was registered in 2010",
    "answer": "Aregistered sale agreement for immovable property is valid for three years from the date of registration.However, the ultimate sale deed must be executed and registered within a reasonable time, which is generally considered to be within that 3-year period.The limitation period for filing a suit for specific performance of an agreement to sell, as per Article 54 of the Limitation Act, 1963, is three years from the date fixed for performance, or if no date is fixed, from when the plaintiff has notice of the refusal to perform.In your case neither the buyer issued any notice to the vendor before the expiry of the time limit expressing his readiness and willingness to buy the property by paying the balance of sale consideration amount.Thus as per law the buyer cannot enforce the registration of sale deed beyond the period of three years.Besides, the property has been developed into a plotted layout and the entire plot have been sold out over the period from the date of development of  layout till this date, besides plenty of buyers have even constructed houses in the purchased plots, therefore there is no possibilities for the buyer to turn up at this stage claiming registration of property as per sale agreement and even if he is filing any case, it will not be entertained by court because the buyer was not given possession too at that time.you may proceed with the proposed purchase of property but as a precaution you may obtain a proper legal opinion from an experienced lawyer in the local and proceed only if recommendedT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "There are many aspects to be considered by court.Firstly since you have returned half of the amount, the court will conclude it as a hand loan borrowed by you and not an amount invested by him for purchasing the property.Secondly there's no agreement between you and him accepting him as joint owner just because he had lent the amount.Thirdly this is a joint property purchased in the joint name of your wife and you with her contribution through her own sources of income.Next, he never raised a claim for a share in the property when he accepted the partial amount of loan you returned earlier.Next, your willingness expressed before court to repay the balance loan amount with interest to him is a major advantage on your side which court will consider as a valid issue to decide the case against him besides many more aspects that the court take them for deciding the dispute and to arrive at a conclusion that it was a loan amount and an investment neither it was a joint family property.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

CAT can be approached only when there is some dispute between employee and Bank. Here there is no dispute as such, you are only asserting your right. Before approaching High Court you need to issue a lawyer's notice seeking transfer or there is already correspondence for transfer you can directly approach High Court. Government guidelines for spouse transfer in public sector banks in India generally allow for the transfer of employees based on the posting of their spouse, particularly when both are working in the public sector. Here are some key points regarding these guidelines:Eligibility: Both employees must be working in the public sector banks, and the request for transfer should be supported by valid documentation, such as marriage certificates.Transfer Requests: Employees can submit a request for transfer to the same location or nearby locations where their spouse is posted. This request is typically considered during the regular transfer processes.Priority Consideration: In many cases, banks have provisions to give priority to spouse transfer requests, especially when both partners are working in the same or related public sector institutions.Time Frame: The transfer request should be made within a reasonable time frame, often aligned with the bank’s transfer policy timelines, which may vary from bank to bank.Policy Variations: Specific policies and guidelines may differ between individual public sector banks, so employees should refer to their respective bank’s human resources department or official policy documents for precise information.Documentation: Employees may need to provide supporting documents, including proof of marriage and the spouse's employment details.Discretion of Management: While guidelines exist, the final decision often lies with the management, which may consider factors such as operational requirements, employee performance, and the availability of positions.It takes about six months for disposal of writ.Ravi ShindeAdvocate, Hyderabad4923 Answers42 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ravi Shinde"

    "answer": "These cases are very common in various Courts of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. Obstructive sleep apnea could also put you at higher risk for recurrent heart attacks, strokes, or abnormal heartbeats. It can also lead to depression, memory problems, increase daytime sleepiness and the risk of accidents.Please understand that transfer is not a condition of service, but is merely an incidence of service. An employee, who joins service of an employer having establishments or offices all over India, can be posted in any part of the country and he cannot be heard to complain against transfer from one place to the other. If he fails to comply with or disobeys the order of transfer/posting, he does so at his own peril. Ordinarily, the Court will not interfere with the employer's prerogative to transfer and post an employee from one place or station to the other unless it is established that the action of the employer is contrary to the statutory provisions or is vitiated due to patent arbitrariness or mala fides. This proposition must be treated as settled by the judgments of the Supreme Court in B. Varadha Rao v. Stale of Karnataka , Abani Kanta Ray v. State of Orissa, Union of India v. S.L. Abbas , Public Services Tribunal Bar Association v. State of UP. , Union of India v. Janardhan Debanath & Kendriya Vidyala Sangathan v. Damodar Prasad Pandey.However, there are a number of decisions passed by various High Courts in favour of employees seeking transfer on medical grounds. You can approach the jurisdictional High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution as it covers both legal and fundamental violations.Detailed discussion is required in such cases.You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.Gopal VermaAdvocate on RecordSupreme Court of IndiaShri Gopal VermaAdvocate, DelhiAvailable Now418 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shri Gopal Verma NOW!"

    "question": "Validity of a registered sale agreement which was registered in 2010",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Since the agreement of sale has already been registered within 2010 but not settled, and the owner later developed and sold off the aforementioned property without lawful termination of such an agreement, certainly there are few legal options to consider. That's how this is most probably going to end up:1. Can the Agreement Holder of Year 2010 Return and File a Case?Yes, the agreement holder is free to file a case, but success is their destiny depending on various thingsLimitation Period: Under the Limitation Act, 1963, the limitation period for enforcing a sale agreement through Specific Performance is three years from the date on which the agreement was violated. Since the agreement was signed in 2010 and nothing was done, the period of limitation would have likely expired in 2013 unless extended by fresh payments or admissions.Doctrine of Laches & Acquiescence: The court will consider whether the holder of the agreement slept on their rights for 15 years, and the land became developed, sold, and possessed, which reflects no intention of invoking the agreement.Legal Standing of PACL Group: If the holder of the agreement was an employee and not the actual purchaser, the legal standing in seeking possession is questionable.2. What If They File a Case?If they sue on a case of Specific Performance, it will be rejected since the limitation period would have expired.They might sue for damages for breach of contract, but the burden of proof would rest with them to prove that they had paid consideration and had intended to complete the sale.If fraud or suppression of fact is alleged, the case would take longer, but reversing all transactions is a distant possibility.3. Will House Owners or Site Owners Face Any Issues?The current site owners have obtained registered sale deeds; hence they are bona fide purchasers for value without notice of defect.Courts are reluctant to interfere with third-party rights, especially where multiple transactions, construction, and public interest are involved.The worst-case scenario may be compensation being demanded from the original land owner, rather than demolition of houses.Hope this helps you; if you still have any clarifications or issues, do not hesitate to ask.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Fardoon Apartment Cooperative Housing Society (Bombay High Court)In a path-breaking judgment, the Bombay high court has held that even a single dissenting member of a cooperative housing society cannot be thrown out by a builder based on a mere development agreement with the society and a majority of the flat owners in it for redevelopment of the building. Expressing serious concern at the “disturbing trend of developers approaching the court and seeking eviction and dispossession of non-cooperating members of housing societies’’, Justice S C Dharmadhikari held that any redevelopment activity “should not compromise the rights of the members and must safeguard the existence of the society.However please note that if the society has passed resolution approving the contract to the developer with the conditions therein by passing a resolution with two third majority, then your proposal to initiate legal action or obtain stay may not be entertained.If the builder is not considering the FSI as per the regulations of the redevelopment then you can fight for your rights through sub registrar or cooperative court.Confirm if the developer has not furnished bank guarantee and is not willing to pay rent to you at par with other members then you  have a case against the developer before the cooperative court.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Since the agreement of sale has already been registered within 2010 but not settled, and the owner later developed and sold off the aforementioned property without lawful termination of such an agreement, certainly there are few legal options to consider. That's how this is most probably going to end up:1. Can the Agreement Holder of Year 2010 Return and File a Case?Yes, the agreement holder is free to file a case, but success is their destiny depending on various thingsLimitation Period: Under the Limitation Act, 1963, the limitation period for enforcing a sale agreement through Specific Performance is three years from the date on which the agreement was violated. Since the agreement was signed in 2010 and nothing was done, the period of limitation would have likely expired in 2013 unless extended by fresh payments or admissions.Doctrine of Laches & Acquiescence: The court will consider whether the holder of the agreement slept on their rights for 15 years, and the land became developed, sold, and possessed, which reflects no intention of invoking the agreement.Legal Standing of PACL Group: If the holder of the agreement was an employee and not the actual purchaser, the legal standing in seeking possession is questionable.2. What If They File a Case?If they sue on a case of Specific Performance, it will be rejected since the limitation period would have expired.They might sue for damages for breach of contract, but the burden of proof would rest with them to prove that they had paid consideration and had intended to complete the sale.If fraud or suppression of fact is alleged, the case would take longer, but reversing all transactions is a distant possibility.3. Will House Owners or Site Owners Face Any Issues?The current site owners have obtained registered sale deeds; hence they are bona fide purchasers for value without notice of defect.Courts are reluctant to interfere with third-party rights, especially where multiple transactions, construction, and public interest are involved.The worst-case scenario may be compensation being demanded from the original land owner, rather than demolition of houses.Hope this helps you; if you still have any clarifications or issues, do not hesitate to ask.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Is Medical Testimony Mandatory for a Medical Negligence Case?Yes, medical testimony ishighly recommendedbutnot always mandatory. Courts rely onexpert opinionsto establish whether the doctor deviated from standard medical practices. Without a medical expert, proving negligence becomes challenging, but not impossible.Your Case StrengthYour allegations (billing discrepancies, lack of informed consent, improper care, patient misidentification, and unexplained deterioration)raise serious concerns. However, to prove negligence legally, you need:Medical Records– Obtain and review all records from the hospital.Independent Expert Opinion– A neutral doctor can analyze the case.Hospital Guidelines & Standard Practices– Compare actions against medical protocols.Eyewitness Testimonies– Statements from nurses, hospital staff, or other patients’ families.Legal Timeline ConcernMedical negligence cases inConsumer Court:2 yearsfrom the date of incident.Exception:If you were mentally unfit to file earlier, courts may allow a delay.Criminal Negligence (IPC 304A): Generally within3 years, but earlier is better.Next StepsConsult a Medical Expertto strengthen your case.File a Complaint in Consumer Courtbefore the2-year limit expires.Consider a Criminal Case (IPC 304A)if gross negligence is evident.Would you like help drafting a legal complaint?Shubham GoyalAdvocate, Delhi1186 Answers7 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shubham Goyal"

    "answer": "Dear client,The divorce decree alone is not sufficient to remove her name from the property title, even if she mentions that she has no claim over the property. To remove her name, you will need to execute a legal transfer of ownership by following various steps:As she is the co-owner, her name can only be removed by executing a relinquishment deed in your favor, and after registration of the deed, her name shall be removed from the property deed.And for the execution of the relinquishment deed, she has to present in India. And if she is not present in India, she has to execute the following through making a power of attorney in favor of a representative in India.And once the relinquishment deed is executed, apply for the mutation.Hope this helps you; if you still have any clarifications or issues, do not hesitate to ask.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Divorce Decree is NOT Sufficient– It only confirms she won’t claim the property butdoes not remove her name from the title.

    "question": "Remove ex-wife name from plot sale deed/papers after mutual divorce",
    "answer": "Does the Divorce Decree suffice to remove her name from the property?No, the divorce decree alone is not sufficient to remove your ex-wife’s name from the property records. Property ownership is governed by theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, and adivorce decreedoes not automatically alter thetitlein the Sub-Registrar’s Office. Even if the decree explicitly states that your ex-wife waives any claim, her name remains on thesale deedand she retains legal ownership unless a validrelinquishmentortransferis executed.Process to Remove Her Name from the Title:Since both of you are co-owners as per the sale deed, your ex-wife’s consent is required to transfer her share. The appropriate legal instruments for this purpose are:(a) Relinquishment Deed:If your ex-wife is willing to surrender her ownership rights, arelinquishment deedcan be executed in your favour. This deed must be registered underSection 17 of the Registration Act, 1908.Steps to Execute a Relinquishment Deed:Draft the Deed: Prepare a deed explicitly stating her intention to relinquish her share.Stamp Duty & Registration Fee: InKarnataka, stamp duty is approximately5% to 7%of the market value of her share. Aregistration feeof₹500applies if transferred to a family member, but this does not apply to an ex-spouse.Registration: Both parties must appear before theSub-Registrarwhere the property is located to complete the registration.Mutation: Once registered, apply to the local revenue office for mutation to update ownership records.(b) Gift Deed:Alternatively, your ex-wife may execute agift deedtransferring her share to you. This also requires registration and incurs similar stamp duty charges.Key Difference:Relinquishment Deedis used between co-owners and usually within family members.Gift Deedcan be executed in favour of anyone and is broader in scope.Power of Attorney (PoA) if She Cannot Be Physically Present:If your ex-wife is unable to travel to India, she may issue aSpecial Power of Attorney (SPA)authorising someone to act on her behalf for theexecution and registrationof the relinquishment or gift deed.Procedure for NRI Power of Attorney:Draft the PoA: It must specifically empower the attorney to transfer her ownership rights.Attestation: The PoA must be attested by theIndian Consulate/Embassyornotarised and apostilledif issued from a Hague Convention country.Adjudication in India: Upon receipt in India, the PoA must beadjudicatedunder theIndian Stamp Act, 1899at the local Sub-Registrar’s Office.Execution of Transfer: The authorised person can then execute and register therelinquishmentorgift deedon her behalf.Who Can Be the Attorney?The PoA can be granted toany individual, including afriend,lawyer, orprofessional—it is not restricted to blood relatives.Conclusion:Thedivorce decreeis not enough to remove your ex-wife’s name from the property records.Arelinquishment deedorgift deedmust be executed and registered.If your ex-wife cannot be present in India, she can issue aSpecial Power of Attorneyto facilitate the process.For assistance indrafting legal documentsor further legal support, you may reach out to us.Thanks and Regards,Advocate Aman VermaLegal CorridorAman VermaAdvocate, Delhi400 AnswersTalk to Advocate Aman Verma"

    "answer": "As the property was purchased by your father on your brother's name, it becomes your brother's property hence any claim towards any share in the property made by you may not be tenable in law.However if the property was purchased using ancestral funds (money inherited from previous generations), you may have a claim to a share, even if the property is in your brother's name.If the property was purchased using your father's self-earned money, it is considered his self-acquired property, and he can legally transfer it to anyone, including your brother, without your consent.You have not stated whether your father is living or not, if your father is living then you cannot claim any share in the property as right for any reason.If your father had a will and it specifies the distribution of his property, the will will determine who inherits what.If you can prove that your father used ancestral funds to purchase the property, you may have a stronger case for a share, even if the property is in your brother's name.You may need to provide evidence such as bank statements, transaction records, or other documentation that demonstrates your father's financial contribution.You cannot legally get ashareof thepropertyif it is registered inyourbrothersname.

    "question": "Validity of a registered sale agreement which was registered in 2010",
    "answer": "Aregistered sale agreement for immovable property is valid for three years from the date of registration.However, the ultimate sale deed must be executed and registered within a reasonable time, which is generally considered to be within that 3-year period.The limitation period for filing a suit for specific performance of an agreement to sell, as per Article 54 of the Limitation Act, 1963, is three years from the date fixed for performance, or if no date is fixed, from when the plaintiff has notice of the refusal to perform.In your case neither the buyer issued any notice to the vendor before the expiry of the time limit expressing his readiness and willingness to buy the property by paying the balance of sale consideration amount.Thus as per law the buyer cannot enforce the registration of sale deed beyond the period of three years.Besides, the property has been developed into a plotted layout and the entire plot have been sold out over the period from the date of development of  layout till this date, besides plenty of buyers have even constructed houses in the purchased plots, therefore there is no possibilities for the buyer to turn up at this stage claiming registration of property as per sale agreement and even if he is filing any case, it will not be entertained by court because the buyer was not given possession too at that time.you may proceed with the proposed purchase of property but as a precaution you may obtain a proper legal opinion from an experienced lawyer in the local and proceed only if recommendedT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "The 2010 sale agreement was never executed, and since 15 years have passed, the claim may be barred by limitation under the Limitation Act, 1963. The agreement holder can file a case, but proving rights over the property after such a long delay is difficult. Since the land was developed, sold, and houses were built, the court is unlikely to order demolitions but may consider monetary compensation if the claim is valid. To protect your purchase, verify title records, check encumbrance certificates, and get a legal opinion. The landowner should also issue a public notice declaring any past claims void.Siddharth JainAdvocate, New Delhi6464 Answers102 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Siddharth Jain"

    "question": "Validity of a registered sale agreement which was registered in 2010",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Since the agreement of sale has already been registered within 2010 but not settled, and the owner later developed and sold off the aforementioned property without lawful termination of such an agreement, certainly there are few legal options to consider. That's how this is most probably going to end up:1. Can the Agreement Holder of Year 2010 Return and File a Case?Yes, the agreement holder is free to file a case, but success is their destiny depending on various thingsLimitation Period: Under the Limitation Act, 1963, the limitation period for enforcing a sale agreement through Specific Performance is three years from the date on which the agreement was violated. Since the agreement was signed in 2010 and nothing was done, the period of limitation would have likely expired in 2013 unless extended by fresh payments or admissions.Doctrine of Laches & Acquiescence: The court will consider whether the holder of the agreement slept on their rights for 15 years, and the land became developed, sold, and possessed, which reflects no intention of invoking the agreement.Legal Standing of PACL Group: If the holder of the agreement was an employee and not the actual purchaser, the legal standing in seeking possession is questionable.2. What If They File a Case?If they sue on a case of Specific Performance, it will be rejected since the limitation period would have expired.They might sue for damages for breach of contract, but the burden of proof would rest with them to prove that they had paid consideration and had intended to complete the sale.If fraud or suppression of fact is alleged, the case would take longer, but reversing all transactions is a distant possibility.3. Will House Owners or Site Owners Face Any Issues?The current site owners have obtained registered sale deeds; hence they are bona fide purchasers for value without notice of defect.Courts are reluctant to interfere with third-party rights, especially where multiple transactions, construction, and public interest are involved.The worst-case scenario may be compensation being demanded from the original land owner, rather than demolition of houses.Hope this helps you; if you still have any clarifications or issues, do not hesitate to ask.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

As per law, A wife has the right to claim decent living standards and basic comforts of life from her husband. Hence for claiming the maintenance, you can file a petition under section125 CrPc.- Your husband is under legal obligation to provide the same to you at any cost, even he is working or not.2. Law entitles wives a basic right to reside in the matrimonial/ home, whether the house owned by her husband or his parents, a rented property or officially provided to him.- Hence, for claiming your residential right, medical expenses etc, and also for teaching a lesson to the family members of your husband, who subjected you torture & harassment, you can file a petition under the provisions ofDomestic ViolenceAct.3. As per the Supreme Court, A wife has complete ownership rights over all her Streedhan, the gifts and money given to her before and after marriage. The denial of Streedhan to the wife makes the husband and in-laws liable for criminal charges.- And further, if the husband or his family members subjected a woman to cruelty for the dowry demand, then they can be booked under Section 498-A.- You can lodge a written complaint against your husband, in the Women cell/Mahila Police, after mentioning all the details of torture & harassment.- The women cell firstly will try to reconcile the dispute; otherwise, they will lodge an FIR against all the person, who subjected you cruelty. .- If you are presently residing in India, then you cannot file a case or complaint in US Court, hence you should file the cases in India , and the Court has power to direct him to appear , otherwise his passport can also be impounded.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Rights on land",
    "answer": "Adverse possession(12+ years of continuous, open, and hostile possession)can be claimed, but in your case, itmay not be the best optionbecause:1️⃣Family-Owned Property– Since you occupied the first floorwith your brother’s knowledge, it’snot hostile possession, which is a key requirement for adverse possession.2️⃣Better Legal Options Exist– Instead of adverse possession, apartition suitbased on your father’s financial contribution is astronger claim.3️⃣Right of Easement– Since you've used theaccess and parking for 40 years, you can legally stop your brother from blocking your path under theIndian Easements Act, 1882.Best Course of Action:✅File a Partition Suit– Claim your rightful share based on your father’s payment.✅Get an Injunction– Stop your brother from blocking access or selling the land.✅Use Adverse Possession (Only If Needed)– As a backup if all else fails.Would you like help drafting alegal notice or partition suit?Shubham GoyalAdvocate, Delhi1186 Answers7 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shubham Goyal"

There are various options through which you can save your property:Sell it or gift it to your mother or brother and ensure that the sale is made at proper market value and through a proper banking channel to make it look legitimate; otherwise, if challenged as fraudulent, then the court may set it aside under section 53 of theTransfer of Property Act.• The second thing that you can do is wait for the high court order; if the high court overturns Section 9 of the decree, the attachment of the property won't be an issue.If you do not have any intention to live with her, consider offering her a financial settlement to avoid prolonged financial trouble.Hope this helps you; if you still have any clarifications or issues, do not hesitate to ask.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Your written submissions are showing that you are subjected to cruelty from your husband- Hence, you should know, that legally you are having following right  :-1. As per law, A wife has the right to claim decent living standards and basic comforts of life from her husband. Hence for claiming the maintenance, you can file a petition under section125 CrPc.- Your husband is under legal obligation to provide the same to you at any cost, even he is working or not.2. Law entitles wives a basic right to reside in the matrimonial/ home, whether the house owned by her husband or his parents, a rented property or officially provided to him.- Hence, for claiming your residential right, medical expenses etc, and also for teaching a lesson to the family members of your husband, who subjected you torture & harassment, you can file a petition under the provisions ofDomestic ViolenceAct.3. As per the Supreme Court, A wife has complete ownership rights over all her Streedhan, the gifts and money given to her before and after marriage. The denial of Streedhan to the wife makes the husband and in-laws liable for criminal charges.- And further, if the husband or his family members subjected a woman to cruelty for the dowry demand, then they can be booked under Section 498-A.- You can lodge a written complaint against your husband, in the Women cell/Mahila Police, after mentioning all the details of torture & harassment.- The women cell firstly will try to reconcile the dispute; otherwise, they will lodge an FIR against all the person, who subjected you cruelty. .- If you are presently residing in India, then you cannot file a case or complaint in US Court, hence you should file the cases in India , and the Court has power to direct him to appear , otherwise his passport can also be impounded.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

Fardoon Apartment Cooperative Housing Society (Bombay High Court)In a path-breaking judgment, the Bombay high court has held that even a single dissenting member of a cooperative housing society cannot be thrown out by a builder based on a mere development agreement with the society and a majority of the flat owners in it for redevelopment of the building. Expressing serious concern at the “disturbing trend of developers approaching the court and seeking eviction and dispossession of non-cooperating members of housing societies’’, Justice S C Dharmadhikari held that any redevelopment activity “should not compromise the rights of the members and must safeguard the existence of the society.However please note that if the society has passed resolution approving the contract to the developer with the conditions therein by passing a resolution with two third majority, then your proposal to initiate legal action or obtain stay may not be entertained.If the builder is not considering the FSI as per the regulations of the redevelopment then you can fight for your rights through sub registrar or cooperative court.Confirm if the developer has not furnished bank guarantee and is not willing to pay rent to you at par with other members then you  have a case against the developer before the cooperative court.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Rights on land",
    "answer": "As the property was purchased by your father on your brother's name, it becomes your brother's property hence any claim towards any share in the property made by you may not be tenable in law.However if the property was purchased using ancestral funds (money inherited from previous generations), you may have a claim to a share, even if the property is in your brother's name.If the property was purchased using your father's self-earned money, it is considered his self-acquired property, and he can legally transfer it to anyone, including your brother, without your consent.You have not stated whether your father is living or not, if your father is living then you cannot claim any share in the property as right for any reason.If your father had a will and it specifies the distribution of his property, the will will determine who inherits what.If you can prove that your father used ancestral funds to purchase the property, you may have a stronger case for a share, even if the property is in your brother's name.You may need to provide evidence such as bank statements, transaction records, or other documentation that demonstrates your father's financial contribution.You cannot legally get ashareof thepropertyif it is registered inyourbrothersname.

    "question": "Breach of Compromise Deed",
    "answer": "Given the facts of your case, your relative's claim of paying ₹30 lakhs in cash without a receipt appears to be an afterthought and an attempt to evade liability. Since the compromise deed clearly outlines the payment terms and you possess the original post-dated cheques, you have a strong case. Here is a strategic approach to proceed:File a New Case Under Section 138 of the NI Act:Since the post-dated cheques were part of the compromise agreement and have now been dishonoured, you are entitled to initiate fresh proceedings under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. Ensure that you send a legal notice to your relative within 30 days of cheque dishonour demanding the payment within 15 days. If he fails to pay, you can file a new complaint under Section 138 within 30 days after the notice period ends.Avoid Filing a New FIR Immediately:Since this is a financial dispute and you already have criminal cases pending, it is advisable to focus on thecheque bounceroute rather than filing a fresh FIR. However, if you have evidence that he has acted fraudulently or intends to cheat (e.g., issuing cheques knowing they would bounce), you may consider filing a new criminal complaint under Sections 406 (Criminal Breach of Trust) and 420 (Cheating) of the IPC.Consider Filing a New Summary Suit:If you wish to secure your claim faster, you may also initiate a fresh summary suit under Order XXXVII of the CPC for the recovery of ₹30 lakhs based on the dishonoured cheques and the compromise deed. This can run parallel to your Section 138 case.Update the Court in Existing Cases:You may file an application in the pending cases informing the court of the breach of the compromise agreement. This strengthens your primary claim of ₹1.5 crores by establishing his repeated dishonesty and non-compliance. However, the dishonour of new cheques creates a fresh cause of action that is best pursued separately for procedural efficiency.Advantage for Your Primary ₹1.5 Crore Case:The breach of the compromise agreement bolsters your original claim by highlighting his unwillingness to honour financial commitments. If the ₹30 lakh payment is successfully recovered, it can be adjusted against your initial ₹1.5 crore claim. His failure to fulfil the compromise terms could weaken his credibility across all pending cases.A multi-pronged approach—filing a fresh Section 138 case while maintaining the pressure through your ongoing civil and criminal proceedings—will provide maximum legal leverage. Consulting with your advocate for case-specific nuances and court procedures is advised for efficient handling.For a detailed consultation, feel free to reach us atwww.legalcorridors.com.Thanks and Regards,Advocate Aman VermaLegal CorridorAman VermaAdvocate, Delhi400 AnswersTalk to Advocate Aman Verma"

    "answer": "In Acknur Constructions Pvt Limited Vs. Fardoon Apartment Cooperative Housing Society (Bombay High Court)In a path-breaking judgment, the Bombay high court has held that even a single dissenting member of a cooperative housing society cannot be thrown out by a builder based on a mere development agreement with the society and a majority of the flat owners in it for redevelopment of the building. Expressing serious concern at the “disturbing trend of developers approaching the court and seeking eviction and dispossession of non-cooperating members of housing societies’’, Justice S C Dharmadhikari held that any redevelopment activity “should not compromise the rights of the members and must safeguard the existence of the society.However please note that if the society has passed resolution approving the contract to the developer with the conditions therein by passing a resolution with two third majority, then your proposal to initiate legal action or obtain stay may not be entertained.If the builder is not considering the FSI as per the regulations of the redevelopment then you can fight for your rights through sub registrar or cooperative court.Confirm if the developer has not furnished bank guarantee and is not willing to pay rent to you at par with other members then you  have a case against the developer before the cooperative court.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear client,Since section 9, i.e., therestitution of conjugal rightsdecree, can only be enforceable under order 21, rule 32 CPC, the court can order compliance, and the seizure of property can be done only in extreme cases; however, the attachment is not immediate and requires multiple proceedings. There are various options through which you can save your property:Sell it or gift it to your mother or brother and ensure that the sale is made at proper market value and through a proper banking channel to make it look legitimate; otherwise, if challenged as fraudulent, then the court may set it aside under section 53 of theTransfer of Property Act.• The second thing that you can do is wait for the high court order; if the high court overturns Section 9 of the decree, the attachment of the property won't be an issue.If you do not have any intention to live with her, consider offering her a financial settlement to avoid prolonged financial trouble.Hope this helps you; if you still have any clarifications or issues, do not hesitate to ask.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "I want to transfer my land property, since my wife got the decree of Section-9 HMA in her favour.",
    "answer": "Dear client,Since section 9, i.e., therestitution of conjugal rightsdecree, can only be enforceable under order 21, rule 32 CPC, the court can order compliance, and the seizure of property can be done only in extreme cases; however, the attachment is not immediate and requires multiple proceedings. There are various options through which you can save your property:Sell it or gift it to your mother or brother and ensure that the sale is made at proper market value and through a proper banking channel to make it look legitimate; otherwise, if challenged as fraudulent, then the court may set it aside under section 53 of theTransfer of Property Act.• The second thing that you can do is wait for the high court order; if the high court overturns Section 9 of the decree, the attachment of the property won't be an issue.If you do not have any intention to live with her, consider offering her a financial settlement to avoid prolonged financial trouble.Hope this helps you; if you still have any clarifications or issues, do not hesitate to ask.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Fardoon Apartment Cooperative Housing Society (Bombay High Court)In a path-breaking judgment, the Bombay high court has held that even a single dissenting member of a cooperative housing society cannot be thrown out by a builder based on a mere development agreement with the society and a majority of the flat owners in it for redevelopment of the building. Expressing serious concern at the “disturbing trend of developers approaching the court and seeking eviction and dispossession of non-cooperating members of housing societies’’, Justice S C Dharmadhikari held that any redevelopment activity “should not compromise the rights of the members and must safeguard the existence of the society.However please note that if the society has passed resolution approving the contract to the developer with the conditions therein by passing a resolution with two third majority, then your proposal to initiate legal action or obtain stay may not be entertained.If the builder is not considering the FSI as per the regulations of the redevelopment then you can fight for your rights through sub registrar or cooperative court.Confirm if the developer has not furnished bank guarantee and is not willing to pay rent to you at par with other members then you  have a case against the developer before the cooperative court.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

The following are things that you can do:As you have published a notice in the newspaper, the court will check if your wife appears on the next hearing date. And if she still does not appear, the court may proceed ex parte and move toward granting the divorce.If ex parte, the court could grant divorce within 2-3 hearings, and it may take around 5-6 months. And if contested, then it will take around 2-3 years.Ensure your substituted service as giving notice in the newspaper is a sufficient proof of proper notice.But there are various ways through which your wife can delay the divorce proceeding, by appearing at the last moment and contesting the divorce and resettling the divorce proceeding.If she does not appear for the case again in June, request the court to proceed with an ex parte decree immediately.Hope this helps you; if you still have any clarifications or issues, do not hesitate to ask.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "In Periannan (S) v. CIT, in a partition between a father and his two sons, the father had to pay to one of his sons a sum over two lakhs. The son purchased property worth more than 5 lakhs and took a sum of Rs. 50k by withdrawing from the amount owed by father and paid it as advance. The balance is paid out of his self acquired funds. At the time of purchase assesee was not married. But subsequently when he marred, he constituted Hindu joint family with his wife. It was held that property in his hands should be treated as joint family property notwithstanding that only small portion of purchase price came from the joint family funds. The Court followed a decision of Allahabad High Court in Mangal Singh’s case.—Mayne’s Treatise on Hindu Law, foreword by Justice S.A. Bobde, Chief Justice of India, 18th Ed. 2022, page 939.My opinion is based on whatever little knowledge of law I acquired through practice and research.

    "question": "ROM in India or Singapore?",
    "answer": "Dear Sidhi,I understand your concerns regarding the legal implications of marriage in Singapore versus India. Each jurisdiction has different laws governing marriage, property rights, and spousal support, and it is crucial to assess the legal consequences before deciding where to marry. Let’s break down the key aspects:1. Legal Framework in Singapore vs. IndiaMarriage in Singapore (ROM - Registry of Marriages):Governed by theWomen’s Charter, which applies to civil marriages.In case ofdivorce, the court can ordermaintenance (alimony)to either spouse based on factors like the length of the marriage, financial contribution, and future needs.While Singapore courts primarily deal with assets within their jurisdiction, in certain circumstances, theymay consider overseas assets, including property in India, especially if the asset was part of the marital pool.A marriage registered in Singapore islegally valid in India, but Indian courts can still assert jurisdiction if either spouse is Indian and resides in India.Marriage in India:Governed by theHindu Marriage Act, 1955(if both are Hindus) or theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954(for interfaith marriages).Indivorce, alimony is decided based onfinancial capacity, duration of the marriage, and the dependent spouse’s needs.Indian courts typically do not have jurisdiction over assets outside India.2. Alimony and Property Rights:In Singapore:Alimony is not automatic; the court considers financial needs and contributions. If your marriage is short-term,spousal support may be limited. However, Singapore courts may stillrecognise foreign propertyfor division.In India:Alimony depends onincome and lifestyle. Courts in India typically do not enforce foreign maintenance orders, but reciprocal enforcement treaties may apply in some cases.3. Impact on Immigration and Residency:Marrying in Singaporecan facilitate easier processing forPermanent Residency (PR)and other legal formalities if you plan to live there permanently.Marrying in Indiawould require additional steps to register the marriage in Singapore for PR purposes, which could delay the process.4. Safeguarding Your Assets:If you are concerned about protecting your assets in India, you may consider:Prenuptial Agreement:Valid in both jurisdictions if signed voluntarily with full disclosure.Separate Property Structure:Keep assets solely in your name before the marriage.Legal Advice:Engage lawyers in both countries todraft an agreementprotecting your property rights.Recommendation:If your primary concern isease of residence and legal processes in Singapore, registering the marriage there may be beneficial. However, if you wantgreater control over your Indian assetsand to limit potential claims, anIndian marriageoffers better protection under Indian law.For a comprehensive legal strategy and to safeguard your rights in both countries, feel free to reach us atwww.legalcorridors.com.Thanks and Regards,Advocate Aman VermaLegal CorridorAman VermaAdvocate, Delhi400 AnswersTalk to Advocate Aman Verma"

    "answer": "Dear client,Since the agreement has expired in March 2025, and the buyer has failed to make full payment, you have strong legal grounds to cancel the agreement and reclaim the possession. Here is what you can do:Send a legal notice to the buyer stating to the buyer that the agreement has been canceled and the possession must be returned to its original owner.As the agreement has been done for the sale of the ancestral property, your mother alone does not have the right to sell the property without the consent of the legal heirs. So the legal heirs can challenge the validity of the sale by filing a suit for injunction in the appropriate court.You can also file a complaint for the encroachment by the buyer over the property for putting the sheds on your plot.Hope this helps you; if you still have any clarifications or issues, do not hesitate toAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "There are many aspects to be considered by court.Firstly since you have returned half of the amount, the court will conclude it as a hand loan borrowed by you and not an amount invested by him for purchasing the property.Secondly there's no agreement between you and him accepting him as joint owner just because he had lent the amount.Thirdly this is a joint property purchased in the joint name of your wife and you with her contribution through her own sources of income.Next, he never raised a claim for a share in the property when he accepted the partial amount of loan you returned earlier.Next, your willingness expressed before court to repay the balance loan amount with interest to him is a major advantage on your side which court will consider as a valid issue to decide the case against him besides many more aspects that the court take them for deciding the dispute and to arrive at a conclusion that it was a loan amount and an investment neither it was a joint family property.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "As the property was purchased by your father on your brother's name, it becomes your brother's property hence any claim towards any share in the property made by you may not be tenable in law.However if the property was purchased using ancestral funds (money inherited from previous generations), you may have a claim to a share, even if the property is in your brother's name.If the property was purchased using your father's self-earned money, it is considered his self-acquired property, and he can legally transfer it to anyone, including your brother, without your consent.You have not stated whether your father is living or not, if your father is living then you cannot claim any share in the property as right for any reason.If your father had a will and it specifies the distribution of his property, the will will determine who inherits what.If you can prove that your father used ancestral funds to purchase the property, you may have a stronger case for a share, even if the property is in your brother's name.You may need to provide evidence such as bank statements, transaction records, or other documentation that demonstrates your father's financial contribution.You cannot legally get ashareof thepropertyif it is registered inyourbrothersname. The lawwillconsider that thepropertyis owned by your brother.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88758 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Adverse possession(12+ years of continuous, open, and hostile possession)can be claimed, but in your case, itmay not be the best optionbecause:1️⃣Family-Owned Property– Since you occupied the first floorwith your brother’s knowledge, it’snot hostile possession, which is a key requirement for adverse possession.2️⃣Better Legal Options Exist– Instead of adverse possession, apartition suitbased on your father’s financial contribution is astronger claim.3️⃣Right of Easement– Since you've used theaccess and parking for 40 years, you can legally stop your brother from blocking your path under theIndian Easements Act, 1882.Best Course of Action:✅File a Partition Suit– Claim your rightful share based on your father’s payment.✅Get an Injunction– Stop your brother from blocking access or selling the land.✅Use Adverse Possession (Only If Needed)– As a backup if all else fails.Would you like help drafting alegal notice or partition suit?Shubham GoyalAdvocate, Delhi1186 Answers7 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Shubham Goyal"
