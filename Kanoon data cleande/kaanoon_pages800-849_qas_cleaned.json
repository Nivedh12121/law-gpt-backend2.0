    "answer": "Dear Client,Since the accused is required to appear in court although the FIR and charge sheet have been filed, you have some legal measures under the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) {previously,Code of Criminal Procedure(CrPC)}. According to section 227 of BNSS (previously, Section 204 of theCriminal Procedure Code), the magistrate may issue summons to the accused person. In the event that they do not show up after being called by the magistrate, you can ask the magistrate of get a warrant of arrest under Section 72 of BNSS (previously, Section 70 of CrPC). If an accused refuses to respond to or ignore the summons issued to them, you can apply for a bailable warrant under Section 90 of BNSS (previously, Section 87 of CrPC). If the accused fails to follow the direction of the court, the court may order for the arrest of the accused under Section 91 of BNSS (previously, Section 88 of theCriminal Procedure Code) or it may order for a non-bailable warrant. In case the magistrate fails to take proper action you can go to sessions court under Section 438 of BNSS (previously, Section 397 of CrPC) and ask for revision so as to ensure that the summons are enforced to compel the accused to appear. It is necessary to take records of all the hearings and stay in touch with your attorney to manage this process and achieve the goal of punishment for the accused.Hope this advice helps in solving your query.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear ClientSince in your case the summons are yet to be served to the accused, the court can go ahead. But you can move to court to declare the accused as absconding under Section 267 of BNSS (earlier Section 82 of CrPC), when it is clear that accused is avoiding service of summons deliberately. You can even file an application before the court to direct the police to resort to further measures for making effective service of summons, even at the accused's residence with affixation or a newspaper as provided under Section 229 of BNSS and formerly under Section 65 of CrPC. If the accused fails to appear even after this order, you can move an application for the issue of a non-bailable warrant under Section 91 of BNSS (earlier Section 88 of CrPC).

    "answer": "Dear Client,Since you have a lease agreement valid until April 15, 2025, the police cannot charge you with criminal trespassing. According to the Section 327 of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (previously,   IPC Section 447) speaks about criminal trespass that when someone enters or remains on another’s property without permission or right. The notice from the owner is invalid because your lease gives you lawful possession therefore, your rights remains that of a tenant. The owner allows you to occupy the property through the lease agreement, therefore cannot unilaterally eject you out of the property without following the right legal processes of evicting you before the agreed time of the lease agreement. Hence you have a right to be in the property and cannot therefore be accused of criminal trespass. A legal practitioner should be consulted to review the lease agreement and facilitate the preparation of the response to the owner’s notice while protecting your tenancy rights.Hope you find this advice beneficial.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Is it legal to incorporate Pvt Limited company which gets 100% profits from stock trading",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the answers of your questions regarding the incorporation of private limited company or LLP for stock trading;1) Yes, one is allowed to incorporate a private limited company or LLP and generate 100% of revenue from stock trading. But there are some conditions which one has to follow or avoid while using it.2) If the company has 50% or more total assets in the form of shares, securities, bonds, etc. and has 50% or more gross income from these financial assets, then it will come under the category of NBFC i.e., Non-Banking Financial Company and it is compulsory to obtain NBFC license from RBI. To get this NBFC license however it is not very easy as there are a lot of regulatory standards that have to be met.3) It is not always beneficial for you from a tax point of view to incorporate a private limited company or LLP. The company, its profits, will be subjected to the corporate tax rate, the current being 25% for small companies while any dividend paid to shareholders will further be charged for taxes. While it is true that some of these may be applicable to an individual and not to a company or corporation.4)Yes, it is allowed to deduct the director’s salary while operating a private limited company. However, the salary should be reasonable and should be equivalent to the salary paid in other similar organizations. From the salary income, taxes will be deducted from the side of the director.5) It is also possible to form an LLP and make profit from stock investing. For tax purposes, LLPs are classified as pass-through entities, and the income is taxed in the hands of the partners. If an LLP does not fall into the above criteria it does not need to hold an NBFC license.6) If the overall profits from stock investment are less then 50%, NBFC license may not be necessary to be obtained. However, it is proper to keep records/documentation in order to support the recognition of income as business income as opposed to being capital gains.It is better to turn to a tax consultant or an attorney who would be familiar with rules and provisions of the finance legislation. The decision to incorporate a company or LLP for trading in stocks depends with the kind of stocks one intends to invest in, and level of risk tolerance that one has.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Is it legal to incorporate Pvt Limited company which gets 100% profits from stock trading",
    "answer": "1. Legality of Owning a Pvt Ltd or LLP for Stock TradingYes, it is legal to own a Pvt Ltd or LLP that derives 100% of its profits from stock trading. However, the company’s Memorandum of Association (MOA) must include stock trading as one of its objectives.2. Requirement for NBFC LicenseIf the primary business of the Pvt Ltd or LLP is stock trading and it involves managing funds from multiple investors, it may be classified as a Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC), which requires an NBFC license from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). However, if you are only using your own and your brother’s money, it might not require an NBFC license.3. Tax Efficiency: Pvt Ltd or LLP vs. Individual AccountPvt Ltd Company: The corporate tax rate for Pvt Ltd companies is generally lower than the highest individual tax rate. For companies with a turnover of up to INR 400 crore, the tax rate is 25%, and for others, it is 30%. Additionally, companies can claim various business expenses, which can reduce taxable income.LLP: LLPs are taxed at a flat rate of 30% plus surcharge and cess as applicable. LLPs also allow for the distribution of profits without additional dividend distribution tax, which can be beneficial.Individual Account: Individuals are taxed based on income slabs, which can go up to 42.7% including surcharge. However, individuals can also claim expenses related to trading under ITR-3.4. Claiming Director’s Salary as ExpenseYes, a Pvt Ltd company can claim the director’s salary as an expense, provided it is reasonable and in line with the company’s financial performance. There are no specific limits on director remuneration for private companies, but it must be approved by the board of directors and comply with the Companies Act, 2013.5. If the profits from stock investments fall under 50% of the total profit, your company may not require an NBFC license. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) generally mandates an NBFC license for companies where financial activities constitute more than 50% of the total assets and income. This is known as the 50-50 test.In your case, if stock trading profits are less than 50% of the total profits, and the financial assets are also less than 50% of the total assets, a Private Limited Company (Pvt Ltd) should be sufficient without needing an NBFC license.Gagandeep Singh ThandiAdvocate, Pathankot68 AnswersTalk to Advocate Gagandeep Singh Thandi"

But if the company is involved in stock broking and does not involve in lending business or any other financial service then, it could not be categorized as NBFC. Under the Companies Act, 2013 it is legal for the private limited companies to invest in share market with certain regulations such as record-keeping, audit, and following corporate regulations. A tax on the gains made in stock trading may be charged in form capital gains tax.

    "question": "Is it legal to incorporate Pvt Limited company which gets 100% profits from stock trading",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the answers of your questions regarding the incorporation of private limited company or LLP for stock trading;1) Yes, one is allowed to incorporate a private limited company or LLP and generate 100% of revenue from stock trading. But there are some conditions which one has to follow or avoid while using it.2) If the company has 50% or more total assets in the form of shares, securities, bonds, etc. and has 50% or more gross income from these financial assets, then it will come under the category of NBFC i.e., Non-Banking Financial Company and it is compulsory to obtain NBFC license from RBI. To get this NBFC license however it is not very easy as there are a lot of regulatory standards that have to be met.3) It is not always beneficial for you from a tax point of view to incorporate a private limited company or LLP. The company, its profits, will be subjected to the corporate tax rate, the current being 25% for small companies while any dividend paid to shareholders will further be charged for taxes. While it is true that some of these may be applicable to an individual and not to a company or corporation.4)Yes, it is allowed to deduct the director’s salary while operating a private limited company. However, the salary should be reasonable and should be equivalent to the salary paid in other similar organizations. From the salary income, taxes will be deducted from the side of the director.5) It is also possible to form an LLP and make profit from stock investing. For tax purposes, LLPs are classified as pass-through entities, and the income is taxed in the hands of the partners. If an LLP does not fall into the above criteria it does not need to hold an NBFC license.6) If the overall profits from stock investment are less then 50%, NBFC license may not be necessary to be obtained. However, it is proper to keep records/documentation in order to support the recognition of income as business income as opposed to being capital gains.It is better to turn to a tax consultant or an attorney who would be familiar with rules and provisions of the finance legislation. The decision to incorporate a company or LLP for trading in stocks depends with the kind of stocks one intends to invest in, and level of risk tolerance that one has.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Is it legal to incorporate Pvt Limited company which gets 100% profits from stock trading",
    "answer": "1. Legality of Owning a Pvt Ltd or LLP for Stock TradingYes, it is legal to own a Pvt Ltd or LLP that derives 100% of its profits from stock trading. However, the company’s Memorandum of Association (MOA) must include stock trading as one of its objectives.2. Requirement for NBFC LicenseIf the primary business of the Pvt Ltd or LLP is stock trading and it involves managing funds from multiple investors, it may be classified as a Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC), which requires an NBFC license from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). However, if you are only using your own and your brother’s money, it might not require an NBFC license.3. Tax Efficiency: Pvt Ltd or LLP vs. Individual AccountPvt Ltd Company: The corporate tax rate for Pvt Ltd companies is generally lower than the highest individual tax rate. For companies with a turnover of up to INR 400 crore, the tax rate is 25%, and for others, it is 30%. Additionally, companies can claim various business expenses, which can reduce taxable income.LLP: LLPs are taxed at a flat rate of 30% plus surcharge and cess as applicable. LLPs also allow for the distribution of profits without additional dividend distribution tax, which can be beneficial.Individual Account: Individuals are taxed based on income slabs, which can go up to 42.7% including surcharge. However, individuals can also claim expenses related to trading under ITR-3.4. Claiming Director’s Salary as ExpenseYes, a Pvt Ltd company can claim the director’s salary as an expense, provided it is reasonable and in line with the company’s financial performance. There are no specific limits on director remuneration for private companies, but it must be approved by the board of directors and comply with the Companies Act, 2013.5. If the profits from stock investments fall under 50% of the total profit, your company may not require an NBFC license. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) generally mandates an NBFC license for companies where financial activities constitute more than 50% of the total assets and income. This is known as the 50-50 test.In your case, if stock trading profits are less than 50% of the total profits, and the financial assets are also less than 50% of the total assets, a Private Limited Company (Pvt Ltd) should be sufficient without needing an NBFC license.Gagandeep Singh ThandiAdvocate, Pathankot68 AnswersTalk to Advocate Gagandeep Singh Thandi"

    "answer": "Dear Client,As you have made a registered Gift Deed to transfer 50% rights of your flat to your wife’s self, you should not be liable to pay transfer fees under the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act. As per By-law No. 38, transfer fees cannot go beyond ₹25,000 and many societies cannot demand extra charges as ‘voluntary donations.’ Since the society has received legal opinion stating no objection to the transfer, you may wish to refer to relevant legal provisions that prove that the society’s resolution to charge for transfer fees is unlawful. The third step is to make a formal appeal to the managing committee of the society through a legal notice stating the laws under which you want to get a waiver of the fee. If they do not, you can go through the Registrar of Cooperative Societies or the legal avenues available through the Bombay High Court. Collect all documents such as the Gift Deed document, the societies standing rules, and requirements needed for the transfer without charges. In the event that the society makes any unreasonable demands, it is wise to engage an attorney to represent you in the case.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Redevelopment - Compliance of Tender",
    "answer": "1. Changes to the Development Agreement (DA)The managing committee should not change the points in the DA that are contrary to the original Tender without the consent of the society members. The Tender is a binding document, and any significant changes should be approved by the general body of the society. The directives under Section 79A emphasize transparency and collective decision-making.2. Signing the Development Agreement Without Detailed PlansThe managing committee cannot force you to sign the DA without providing the detailed plans of your new apartment, amenities, and parking. Transparency is crucial in the redevelopment process, and members have the right to know what they are agreeing to before signing any legal documents.Legal Actions You Can TakeRequest a Special General Body Meeting (SGBM): You can request an SGBM to discuss the changes in the DA and ensure that all members are informed and can voice their concerns. This meeting can be called by a certain percentage of members as per your society’s bylaws.File a Complaint with the Registrar: If the managing committee is not adhering to the directives and is making changes that are not in the members’ best interests, you can file a complaint with the Registrar of Co-operative Societies. The Registrar has the authority to intervene and ensure compliance with the directives.Mediation: Sometimes, mediation can be a less confrontational way to resolve disputes. A mediator can help facilitate discussions between the managing committee and the members to reach a mutually agreeable solution.Gagandeep Singh ThandiAdvocate, Pathankot68 AnswersTalk to Advocate Gagandeep Singh Thandi"

    "question": "Is it legal to incorporate Pvt Limited company which gets 100% profits from stock trading",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Here is the answers of your questions regarding the incorporation of private limited company or LLP for stock trading;1) Yes, one is allowed to incorporate a private limited company or LLP and generate 100% of revenue from stock trading. But there are some conditions which one has to follow or avoid while using it.2) If the company has 50% or more total assets in the form of shares, securities, bonds, etc. and has 50% or more gross income from these financial assets, then it will come under the category of NBFC i.e., Non-Banking Financial Company and it is compulsory to obtain NBFC license from RBI. To get this NBFC license however it is not very easy as there are a lot of regulatory standards that have to be met.3) It is not always beneficial for you from a tax point of view to incorporate a private limited company or LLP. The company, its profits, will be subjected to the corporate tax rate, the current being 25% for small companies while any dividend paid to shareholders will further be charged for taxes. While it is true that some of these may be applicable to an individual and not to a company or corporation.4)Yes, it is allowed to deduct the director’s salary while operating a private limited company. However, the salary should be reasonable and should be equivalent to the salary paid in other similar organizations. From the salary income, taxes will be deducted from the side of the director.5) It is also possible to form an LLP and make profit from stock investing. For tax purposes, LLPs are classified as pass-through entities, and the income is taxed in the hands of the partners. If an LLP does not fall into the above criteria it does not need to hold an NBFC license.6) If the overall profits from stock investment are less then 50%, NBFC license may not be necessary to be obtained. However, it is proper to keep records/documentation in order to support the recognition of income as business income as opposed to being capital gains.It is better to turn to a tax consultant or an attorney who would be familiar with rules and provisions of the finance legislation. The decision to incorporate a company or LLP for trading in stocks depends with the kind of stocks one intends to invest in, and level of risk tolerance that one has.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Is it legal to incorporate Pvt Limited company which gets 100% profits from stock trading",
    "answer": "1. Legality of Owning a Pvt Ltd or LLP for Stock TradingYes, it is legal to own a Pvt Ltd or LLP that derives 100% of its profits from stock trading. However, the company’s Memorandum of Association (MOA) must include stock trading as one of its objectives.2. Requirement for NBFC LicenseIf the primary business of the Pvt Ltd or LLP is stock trading and it involves managing funds from multiple investors, it may be classified as a Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC), which requires an NBFC license from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). However, if you are only using your own and your brother’s money, it might not require an NBFC license.3. Tax Efficiency: Pvt Ltd or LLP vs. Individual AccountPvt Ltd Company: The corporate tax rate for Pvt Ltd companies is generally lower than the highest individual tax rate. For companies with a turnover of up to INR 400 crore, the tax rate is 25%, and for others, it is 30%. Additionally, companies can claim various business expenses, which can reduce taxable income.LLP: LLPs are taxed at a flat rate of 30% plus surcharge and cess as applicable. LLPs also allow for the distribution of profits without additional dividend distribution tax, which can be beneficial.Individual Account: Individuals are taxed based on income slabs, which can go up to 42.7% including surcharge. However, individuals can also claim expenses related to trading under ITR-3.4. Claiming Director’s Salary as ExpenseYes, a Pvt Ltd company can claim the director’s salary as an expense, provided it is reasonable and in line with the company’s financial performance. There are no specific limits on director remuneration for private companies, but it must be approved by the board of directors and comply with the Companies Act, 2013.5. If the profits from stock investments fall under 50% of the total profit, your company may not require an NBFC license. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) generally mandates an NBFC license for companies where financial activities constitute more than 50% of the total assets and income. This is known as the 50-50 test.In your case, if stock trading profits are less than 50% of the total profits, and the financial assets are also less than 50% of the total assets, a Private Limited Company (Pvt Ltd) should be sufficient without needing an NBFC license.Gagandeep Singh ThandiAdvocate, Pathankot68 AnswersTalk to Advocate Gagandeep Singh Thandi"

But if the company is involved in stock broking and does not involve in lending business or any other financial service then, it could not be categorized as NBFC. Under the Companies Act, 2013 it is legal for the private limited companies to invest in share market with certain regulations such as record-keeping, audit, and following corporate regulations. A tax on the gains made in stock trading may be charged in form capital gains tax.

As per By-law No. 38, transfer fees cannot go beyond ₹25,000 and many societies cannot demand extra charges as ‘voluntary donations.’ Since the society has received legal opinion stating no objection to the transfer, you may wish to refer to relevant legal provisions that prove that the society’s resolution to charge for transfer fees is unlawful. The third step is to make a formal appeal to the managing committee of the society through a legal notice stating the laws under which you want to get a waiver of the fee. If they do not, you can go through the Registrar of Cooperative Societies or the legal avenues available through the Bombay High Court. Collect all documents such as the Gift Deed document, the societies standing rules, and requirements needed for the transfer without charges. In the event that the society makes any unreasonable demands, it is wise to engage an attorney to represent you in the case.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Notary GPA sale deed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In view of the fact that the sale transaction in your case was effected on 19 August, 2011 i.e., even before judgment passed by SC, we would rather raise a presumption favouring validity of sales transactions provided such GPAS were still valid and duly executed as at this point. The land could theoretically be reclaimed by the original owners if it is determined that such a transaction was invalid. For the houses that are already constructed on this land, if it turns out no legal transaction has taken place then those who built their homes will have to choose between eviction (if they cannot negotiate with the rightful owners) or negotiation. And then, the Government could also revoke sale of those and constructions on these would be as good as squatters in a forest. The parties should perform a comprehensive legal due diligence of the GPAs and check their legality before establishing that as providing any tittle interest. The best idea is to handle the difference of opinion in a friendly way but if that cannot be done, then maybe we have to look on taking it into court where it will bring an absolute judgment about who owns what.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Landlord trying to evict me forcefully, making false accusations and trying to file false cases",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Since you have a lease agreement valid until April 15, 2025, the police cannot charge you with criminal trespassing. According to the Section 327 of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (previously,   IPC Section 447) speaks about criminal trespass that when someone enters or remains on another’s property without permission or right. The notice from the owner is invalid because your lease gives you lawful possession therefore, your rights remains that of a tenant. The owner allows you to occupy the property through the lease agreement, therefore cannot unilaterally eject you out of the property without following the right legal processes of evicting you before the agreed time of the lease agreement. Hence you have a right to be in the property and cannot therefore be accused of criminal trespass. A legal practitioner should be consulted to review the lease agreement and facilitate the preparation of the response to the owner’s notice while protecting your tenancy rights.Hope you find this advice beneficial.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The land could theoretically be reclaimed by the original owners if it is determined that such a transaction was invalid. For the houses that are already constructed on this land, if it turns out no legal transaction has taken place then those who built their homes will have to choose between eviction (if they cannot negotiate with the rightful owners) or negotiation. And then, the Government could also revoke sale of those and constructions on these would be as good as squatters in a forest. The parties should perform a comprehensive legal due diligence of the GPAs and check their legality before establishing that as providing any tittle interest. The best idea is to handle the difference of opinion in a friendly way but if that cannot be done, then maybe we have to look on taking it into court where it will bring an absolute judgment about who owns what.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Reclaim KAIDB Acquired Land if the land is not used by the KIADB for industrial purposes",
    "answer": "In 2010, the Supreme Court had ruled that the government cannot be compelled to reconvey the land to the original owner if the same can be utilised for any public purpose other than the one for which it was acquired. In another ruling in 2016, the apex court also said that authorities can return the land to the original owner in case its transfer to a third party leads to profiteering.“When the land sought to be acquired for a public purpose is allowed to be transferred to private persons, any administrative action or private transaction could be held to be vitiated by fraud. There is no legal sanction for such action,” it added.In case of land acquired under the 2013 law, land that remains unutilised for five years can be returned to the original owner. Section 101 of the 2013 law says that such land “shall be returned to the original owner or owners or their legal heirs”. The law also allows for enlisting the land into a government-prescribed land bank.In your case the compensation has not been fully paid neither the interest towards the delayed payment towards land acquired was paid despite many visits to the concerned office.Hence you may file a writ petition before high court nd seek the reliefs as suggested.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Reclaim KAIDB Acquired Land if the land is not used by the KIADB for industrial purposes",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The land so acquired by the government cannot be reclaimed once the landowners have accepted the compensation and it continues to remain in possession of the land acquisition authority for whatever purpose. However, if the land abates utility and no development has been undertaken or carried out on the acquired land fee, if necessary, you can file a legal case challenging the acquisition on the ground that after such a long lapse of time the purpose mentioned in the order of acquisition was not accomplished. As far as the compensation awarded relates to land, building, trees, wells etc, since you have not been paid for all these, you may approach the court and file a plaint to claim this compensation. During award of compensation, if there is a delay in making payment of the same, interest is payable at the rate of 9 per cent for the first year and 15 per cent p.a. for the subsequent periods which runs from the date the land was taken possession of till the time the compensation is paid. You can claim interest on account of the delayed compensation deposits. Interest cannot be waived and is a statutory entitlement. Payment of tax deducted under the Income-tax Act, 1961 on compensation received in respect of compulsory acquisition of urban agricultural land should be paid to the agriculturalist. There is no requirement of TDS for rural agricultural land. However, supposing the compensation is received, in such cases also, TDS is deducted as per the provisions of the Act.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,As per RERA, it is now the duty of the builder to disclose and provide parking areas within common spaces. Except if the agreement deed permits selling open parking spaces, which ordinarily is not allowed. Builders cannot also sell the parking spaces independently. When the society is created, it also takes charge of maintaining common spaces which includes parking lots as well. If it has free parking space, the society needs to allot on first come and own basis which is either through a lottery system or as passed in AGM. Failure to issue available parking spaces in this circumstance may be seen as arbitrarily or discriminatory. If the society's actions seem arbitrary, you can file a complaint against the builder for their failure to fulfil obligations before Gujarat RERA Authority as well as approach Registrar of Societies. You can also think of filling a civil suit or complaint with the Consumer Forum for deficiency in service. Before seeking redress via the law, it might also be worth compiling evidence or trying to mediate with your society.

According to Section 6 of theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, in the event of a lease, no rights are assigned over common areas like parking, unless the lease document states otherwise. Further, the RERA clearly states that builders need to specify in terms of sale of properties that if you have paid for parking and parking space was promised to you then it is your right. If the society continues to bar you, then it advised to seek the help of a lawyer for complaining to RERA or sue the society executives. Your rights should also receive protection from the tenancy laws and the rules set by RERA.I hope this advice is fruitful.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Criteria for Inclusion in OBC Non-creamy layer(NCL) for Retired Pensioners",
    "answer": "Dear Client,OBC NCL status is based on the job of parents or income, these marks are not decided discursively. Job is not only parameter. let’s say if your father get a class I Promotion after age of 40 then he will also be coming under as Non-Creamy Layer. Thus, as per this criterion you are still OBC Non-Creamy Layer. According to latest rules, Income limit for the unreserved candidates with no disability is Rs 8 lakh per annum. However, income from salaries & the agriculture land shall not considered as counting this revenue. It only does not consider revenue from incomes like business, professional income and other revenues. There is no income limit included for pension. This is because the pension counts as income, and any amount of salary will be excluded from deciding your apparent status for NCL purposes. Interest Income on Provident Fund, Gratuity and other saving may be included while calculating the limit of income. Nonetheless, this might only drive the overall income over Rs. 8 lakh thresholds (based on quantum of investment). Earnings of a contractual job even in the same govt department would be invariably salary income so. This should not affect your eligibility as salary income is excluded from the criteria of NCL. If the total interest income from PF, gratuity & savings is less than 8 lakh pa you may come under the scope of OBC NCL.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Except if the agreement deed permits selling open parking spaces, which ordinarily is not allowed. Builders cannot also sell the parking spaces independently.

If it has free parking space, the society needs to allot on first come and own basis which is either through a lottery system or as passed in AGM. Failure to issue available parking spaces in this circumstance may be seen as arbitrarily or discriminatory.

According to Section 6 of theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, in the event of a lease, no rights are assigned over common areas like parking, unless the lease document states otherwise. Further, the RERA clearly states that builders need to specify in terms of sale of properties that if you have paid for parking and parking space was promised to you then it is your right. If the society continues to bar you, then it advised to seek the help of a lawyer for complaining to RERA or sue the society executives. Your rights should also receive protection from the tenancy laws and the rules set by RERA.I hope this advice is fruitful.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Since you have a lease agreement valid until April 15, 2025, the police cannot charge you with criminal trespassing. According to the Section 327 of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (previously,   IPC Section 447) speaks about criminal trespass that when someone enters or remains on another’s property without permission or right. The notice from the owner is invalid because your lease gives you lawful possession therefore, your rights remains that of a tenant. The owner allows you to occupy the property through the lease agreement, therefore cannot unilaterally eject you out of the property without following the right legal processes of evicting you before the agreed time of the lease agreement. Hence you have a right to be in the property and cannot therefore be accused of criminal trespass. A legal practitioner should be consulted to review the lease agreement and facilitate the preparation of the response to the owner’s notice while protecting your tenancy rights.Hope you find this advice beneficial.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Sir,I understand your situation and the difficulties you are facing. Based on the information provided, I will try to guide you on the grounds for seeking divorce in India and the relevant legal provisions.Grounds for Divorce in India: Under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, which applies to Sikhs as well, the following grounds are available for seeking divorce:a) Adultery (Section 13(1)(i)): Although adultery has been decriminalized, it remains a valid ground for seeking divorce in India.b) Cruelty (Section 13(1)(ia)): The assault and harassment you faced from your wife can potentially be considered cruelty, which is a ground for divorce.c) Desertion (Section 13(1)(ib)): If your wife has deserted you for a continuous period of at least two years immediately preceding the presentation of the divorce petition, you can seek divorce on this ground.Evidence: You mentioned having call records from the telecom company and some recordings as evidence of your wife's adultery. These can be crucial pieces of evidence to support your divorce petition.Procedure: You can file a divorce petition in the appropriate Family Court or District Court in India, where your wife is currently residing or where the marriage was solemnized. The court will consider the evidence presented by both parties and decide on granting the divorce based on the merits of the case.Dowry Allegations: Regarding the false dowry allegations made by your wife, the closure of the case by the SSP office stating no dowry was demanded or given will work in your favor. You can present this order as evidence to counter any potential dowry-related claims made by your wife during the divorce proceedings.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighcourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "answer": "Contested Divorce on the Grounds of Mental Cruelty, Adultery, and Harassment: If you file for a contested divorce on the grounds of mental cruelty, adultery, and harassment of your parents, and you have substantial evidence to support your claims, your case can be quite strong. Mental cruelty and adultery are valid grounds for divorce under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955. However, the burden of proof lies on you to establish these grounds with clear and convincing evidence.The time frame for a contested divorce case can vary depending on the complexity of the case, the court's docket, and the cooperation of both parties. Generally, a contested divorce case in India can take anywhere from 24 months to 5 years or more, depending on the circumstances.Maintenance, Alimony, and Ancestral Property Rights: Yes, a contested divorce can lead to the court granting interim and permanent maintenance, as well as alimony, to the aggrieved spouse. The court considers various factors, such as the financial status of both parties, the standard of living during the marriage, and the ability of the spouse to support themselves.However, the right to ancestral property is governed by personal laws and may vary based on your religious affiliation. In general, a wife does not have an automatic right to her husband's ancestral property unless specified in a will or settlement.Making the Lover a Co-Respondent: For Hindu marriages governed by theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, there is no provision to implead a co-respondent.Validity of Police Report from Australia: Indian courts can consider crimes committed by Indian citizens in other countries as evidence in legal proceedings. However, the evidentiary value and admissibility of the police report from Australia will depend on factors such as the nature of the crime, the laws of the foreign country, and the court's discretion.Protection from Court upon Visiting India: If you are apprehensive about visiting India due to potential harassment or threats from your wife, you can seek protection from the court. You can file an application for an ex-parte order or an interim injunction restraining your wife from causing any harm or harassment to you during the pendency of the divorce proceedings.Risk of False Allegations or Cases: Even after filing for divorce in India, there is a risk that your wife may file false allegations or cases against you during the court proceedings. However, if you have substantial evidence to counter such allegations, the court is likely to dismiss them.For more legal assistance, you can contact me.Kindly give a 5 Star Rating if you are satisfied.Best Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighcourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

However, if you have children from the marriage, they may have a claim to ancestral property.Making Her Lover a Co-Respondent: You can make her alleged lover a co-respondent in the divorce petition, especially if you are claiming adultery as a ground for divorce.Validity of the Australian Police Report: The police report of her assault on you in Australia can be submitted as evidence in the Indian court.

Additionally, you can request the court to issue an order restraining your wife from filing any false complaints against you during your visit.Possibility of Fake Allegations After Filing for Divorce: Yes, even after filing for divorce, your wife can still file fake allegations or cases against you during the court proceedings.

    "question": "Finance agencies trying to include co-applicant fraudulently after the applicant committed suicide",
    "answer": "Dear Client,From the loans your father borrowed, it is noteworthy that they borrowed under a proprietorship firm in your father’s name then you or your mother cannot be held responsible for those debts if you or your mother did not co-sign for the loans or were not involved in the signing of the loans. In India, TheHindu Succession Act, 1956 lays down the law of inheritance of property and according to the section 6 of the act, the heirs cannot be held responsible for the payment of the deceased’s debts if they stand to inherit something from him. The notice you published in the newspaper to searching anyone to blame for your father’s debts also do support your defense that you are not responsible. If your mother did not sign any of the documents as the co-applicant for the finance company then you cannot make her responsible for your father’s loans. The finance company which is seeking your mother’s Aadhaar and bank details may be trying to falsely intimate her as co-applicant which is illegal.The property transferred to you by your father, that is, the agricultural land are governed by theTransfer of Property Act, 1882. The gift deed that had been prepared and registered prior to your father’s demise, you and your siblings therefore qualify as legal. A valid gift is done irrevocably and when the property is conveyed, it becomes the donee’s self acquired asset. If, in most cases, the loans were obtained after the preparation of the gift deed then such loans cannot be used to touch the property in question. Further, it is a well-known fact that the land was your grandfather’s self-acquired property and was legally demised to the defendants and hence the piece of land you got through the gift deed of 1.5 acres belongs to you. In other cases, the finance agencies may attempt to seize this property. But if the transfer was carried out bona fide and long before any question of debt was contemplated then you have excellent legal perspective.Any loans which may have been received by the beneficiaries after the gift deed had been prepared should not be recovered from the property. As we have seen the property is now your self-acquired property, all the 1.5 acres should be protected and not half of it. The concept of splitting it doesn’t apply because after the gift deed only you stand as the owner of the house. Use of the gift deed in exchange for the money can also be actionable in case of any legal on the property because according to theTransfer of Property Act, gift deed is legal. You can also initiate a case where you seek an order of perpetual prohibition which will restrain the creditors on the property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,As per RERA, it is now the duty of the builder to disclose and provide parking areas within common spaces. Except if the agreement deed permits selling open parking spaces, which ordinarily is not allowed. Builders cannot also sell the parking spaces independently. When the society is created, it also takes charge of maintaining common spaces which includes parking lots as well. If it has free parking space, the society needs to allot on first come and own basis which is either through a lottery system or as passed in AGM. Failure to issue available parking spaces in this circumstance may be seen as arbitrarily or discriminatory. If the society's actions seem arbitrary, you can file a complaint against the builder for their failure to fulfil obligations before Gujarat RERA Authority as well as approach Registrar of Societies. You can also think of filling a civil suit or complaint with the Consumer Forum for deficiency in service. Before seeking redress via the law, it might also be worth compiling evidence or trying to mediate with your society.

    "answer": "Dear Client,If you as a resident member of the society do not have a parking allotment letter from the builder whereas other members of the society have, you may still have a legal right to park your car on the common ground. According to Section 6 of theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, in the event of a lease, no rights are assigned over common areas like parking, unless the lease document states otherwise. Further, the RERA clearly states that builders need to specify in terms of sale of properties that if you have paid for parking and parking space was promised to you then it is your right. If the society continues to bar you, then it advised to seek the help of a lawyer for complaining to RERA or sue the society executives. Your rights should also receive protection from the tenancy laws and the rules set by RERA.I hope this advice is fruitful.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "US child custody order in India",
    "answer": "Dear Client,If your wife has taken your U.S.-born child to India without your consent, enforcing U.S. court orders for the child's return can be challenging, especially since India is not a signatory to the Hague Convention on International Child Abduction. However, you can seek enforcement of the U.S. custody order by filing a petition in an Indian court under Section 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, which deals with the recognition of foreign judgments. You may file this petition in the High Court or Family Court where your wife and child currently reside in India. While the Indian court will focus on the child's best interests, presenting a certified copy of the U.S. court order and demonstrating that returning to the U.S. aligns with those interests could support your case. Despite potential challenges, such as jurisdictional issues and the Indian court's discretion, a well-argued petition could lead to the enforcement of your custody rights.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Reclaim KAIDB Acquired Land if the land is not used by the KIADB for industrial purposes",
    "answer": "In 2010, the Supreme Court had ruled that the government cannot be compelled to reconvey the land to the original owner if the same can be utilised for any public purpose other than the one for which it was acquired. In another ruling in 2016, the apex court also said that authorities can return the land to the original owner in case its transfer to a third party leads to profiteering.“When the land sought to be acquired for a public purpose is allowed to be transferred to private persons, any administrative action or private transaction could be held to be vitiated by fraud. There is no legal sanction for such action,” it added.In case of land acquired under the 2013 law, land that remains unutilised for five years can be returned to the original owner. Section 101 of the 2013 law says that such land “shall be returned to the original owner or owners or their legal heirs”. The law also allows for enlisting the land into a government-prescribed land bank.In your case the compensation has not been fully paid neither the interest towards the delayed payment towards land acquired was paid despite many visits to the concerned office.Hence you may file a writ petition before high court nd seek the reliefs as suggested.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Reclaim KAIDB Acquired Land if the land is not used by the KIADB for industrial purposes",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The land so acquired by the government cannot be reclaimed once the landowners have accepted the compensation and it continues to remain in possession of the land acquisition authority for whatever purpose. However, if the land abates utility and no development has been undertaken or carried out on the acquired land fee, if necessary, you can file a legal case challenging the acquisition on the ground that after such a long lapse of time the purpose mentioned in the order of acquisition was not accomplished. As far as the compensation awarded relates to land, building, trees, wells etc, since you have not been paid for all these, you may approach the court and file a plaint to claim this compensation. During award of compensation, if there is a delay in making payment of the same, interest is payable at the rate of 9 per cent for the first year and 15 per cent p.a. for the subsequent periods which runs from the date the land was taken possession of till the time the compensation is paid. You can claim interest on account of the delayed compensation deposits. Interest cannot be waived and is a statutory entitlement. Payment of tax deducted under the Income-tax Act, 1961 on compensation received in respect of compulsory acquisition of urban agricultural land should be paid to the agriculturalist. There is no requirement of TDS for rural agricultural land. However, supposing the compensation is received, in such cases also, TDS is deducted as per the provisions of the Act.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,As per RERA, it is now the duty of the builder to disclose and provide parking areas within common spaces. Except if the agreement deed permits selling open parking spaces, which ordinarily is not allowed. Builders cannot also sell the parking spaces independently. When the society is created, it also takes charge of maintaining common spaces which includes parking lots as well. If it has free parking space, the society needs to allot on first come and own basis which is either through a lottery system or as passed in AGM. Failure to issue available parking spaces in this circumstance may be seen as arbitrarily or discriminatory. If the society's actions seem arbitrary, you can file a complaint against the builder for their failure to fulfil obligations before Gujarat RERA Authority as well as approach Registrar of Societies. You can also think of filling a civil suit or complaint with the Consumer Forum for deficiency in service. Before seeking redress via the law, it might also be worth compiling evidence or trying to mediate with your society.

According to Section 6 of theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, in the event of a lease, no rights are assigned over common areas like parking, unless the lease document states otherwise. Further, the RERA clearly states that builders need to specify in terms of sale of properties that if you have paid for parking and parking space was promised to you then it is your right. If the society continues to bar you, then it advised to seek the help of a lawyer for complaining to RERA or sue the society executives. Your rights should also receive protection from the tenancy laws and the rules set by RERA.I hope this advice is fruitful.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "MT 799 is a free format SWIFT message type that banks use to securely communicate information about bank guarantees (demand guarantees) and letters of credit (documentary credits). It's an essential part of international trade and allows banks to communicate with each other through the SWIFT system without transferring funds or paying.MT 799 can confirm funds or proof of deposits for a potential trade, or certify financial capability. It demonstrates to the vendor that the buyer has the money available to perform the transaction, and that the payment will come from a verifiable source like a bank. However, in its standard format, MT 799 is not a promise to pay or a form of bank guarantee.However you may proceed in this regard with abundant caution by verifying the details through another reliable source."

    "question": "Finance agencies trying to include co-applicant fraudulently after the applicant committed suicide",
    "answer": "Dear Client,From the loans your father borrowed, it is noteworthy that they borrowed under a proprietorship firm in your father’s name then you or your mother cannot be held responsible for those debts if you or your mother did not co-sign for the loans or were not involved in the signing of the loans. In India, TheHindu Succession Act, 1956 lays down the law of inheritance of property and according to the section 6 of the act, the heirs cannot be held responsible for the payment of the deceased’s debts if they stand to inherit something from him. The notice you published in the newspaper to searching anyone to blame for your father’s debts also do support your defense that you are not responsible. If your mother did not sign any of the documents as the co-applicant for the finance company then you cannot make her responsible for your father’s loans. The finance company which is seeking your mother’s Aadhaar and bank details may be trying to falsely intimate her as co-applicant which is illegal.The property transferred to you by your father, that is, the agricultural land are governed by theTransfer of Property Act, 1882. The gift deed that had been prepared and registered prior to your father’s demise, you and your siblings therefore qualify as legal. A valid gift is done irrevocably and when the property is conveyed, it becomes the donee’s self acquired asset. If, in most cases, the loans were obtained after the preparation of the gift deed then such loans cannot be used to touch the property in question. Further, it is a well-known fact that the land was your grandfather’s self-acquired property and was legally demised to the defendants and hence the piece of land you got through the gift deed of 1.5 acres belongs to you. In other cases, the finance agencies may attempt to seize this property. But if the transfer was carried out bona fide and long before any question of debt was contemplated then you have excellent legal perspective.Any loans which may have been received by the beneficiaries after the gift deed had been prepared should not be recovered from the property. As we have seen the property is now your self-acquired property, all the 1.5 acres should be protected and not half of it. The concept of splitting it doesn’t apply because after the gift deed only you stand as the owner of the house. Use of the gift deed in exchange for the money can also be actionable in case of any legal on the property because according to theTransfer of Property Act, gift deed is legal. You can also initiate a case where you seek an order of perpetual prohibition which will restrain the creditors on the property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,You can file a complaint against the society and its managing committee under the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, 1960. Since the Deputy Registrar has already ruled in your favor and ordered the adjustment of the illegally collected money, their non-compliance can be considered a violation of the Act. If the society's managing committee continues to ignore the Registrar's order, you can consider filing a Contempt of Court petition in the High Court. This petition will be based on the society's willful disobedience of the lawful order passed by the Registrar, which amounts to contempt of a judicial authority. Given the harassment and illegal demands, you may also consider filing a criminal complaint against the secretary and the managing committee under section 383, 406 and 506 of theIndian Penal Code. You can also file a civil suit for damages for mental harassment and defamation. Under tort law, you may claim compensation for the mental agony, distress, and damage to your reputation caused by the society's actions If the society still does not comply, escalate the matter by filing a writ petition or contempt petition in the High Court.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Since you have a lease agreement valid until April 15, 2025, the police cannot charge you with criminal trespassing. According to the Section 327 of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (previously,   IPC Section 447) speaks about criminal trespass that when someone enters or remains on another’s property without permission or right. The notice from the owner is invalid because your lease gives you lawful possession therefore, your rights remains that of a tenant. The owner allows you to occupy the property through the lease agreement, therefore cannot unilaterally eject you out of the property without following the right legal processes of evicting you before the agreed time of the lease agreement. Hence you have a right to be in the property and cannot therefore be accused of criminal trespass. A legal practitioner should be consulted to review the lease agreement and facilitate the preparation of the response to the owner’s notice while protecting your tenancy rights.Hope you find this advice beneficial.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Finance agencies trying to include co-applicant fraudulently after the applicant committed suicide",
    "answer": "Dear Client,From the loans your father borrowed, it is noteworthy that they borrowed under a proprietorship firm in your father’s name then you or your mother cannot be held responsible for those debts if you or your mother did not co-sign for the loans or were not involved in the signing of the loans. In India, TheHindu Succession Act, 1956 lays down the law of inheritance of property and according to the section 6 of the act, the heirs cannot be held responsible for the payment of the deceased’s debts if they stand to inherit something from him. The notice you published in the newspaper to searching anyone to blame for your father’s debts also do support your defense that you are not responsible. If your mother did not sign any of the documents as the co-applicant for the finance company then you cannot make her responsible for your father’s loans. The finance company which is seeking your mother’s Aadhaar and bank details may be trying to falsely intimate her as co-applicant which is illegal.The property transferred to you by your father, that is, the agricultural land are governed by theTransfer of Property Act, 1882. The gift deed that had been prepared and registered prior to your father’s demise, you and your siblings therefore qualify as legal. A valid gift is done irrevocably and when the property is conveyed, it becomes the donee’s self acquired asset. If, in most cases, the loans were obtained after the preparation of the gift deed then such loans cannot be used to touch the property in question. Further, it is a well-known fact that the land was your grandfather’s self-acquired property and was legally demised to the defendants and hence the piece of land you got through the gift deed of 1.5 acres belongs to you. In other cases, the finance agencies may attempt to seize this property. But if the transfer was carried out bona fide and long before any question of debt was contemplated then you have excellent legal perspective.Any loans which may have been received by the beneficiaries after the gift deed had been prepared should not be recovered from the property. As we have seen the property is now your self-acquired property, all the 1.5 acres should be protected and not half of it. The concept of splitting it doesn’t apply because after the gift deed only you stand as the owner of the house. Use of the gift deed in exchange for the money can also be actionable in case of any legal on the property because according to theTransfer of Property Act, gift deed is legal. You can also initiate a case where you seek an order of perpetual prohibition which will restrain the creditors on the property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, you can seek enforcement of the U.S. custody order by filing a petition in an Indian court under Section 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, which deals with the recognition of foreign judgments. You may file this petition in the High Court or Family Court where your wife and child currently reside in India. While the Indian court will focus on the child's best interests, presenting a certified copy of the U.S. court order and demonstrating that returning to the U.S. aligns with those interests could support your case. Despite potential challenges, such as jurisdictional issues and the Indian court's discretion, a well-argued petition could lead to the enforcement of your custody rights.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Since the Deputy Registrar has already ruled in your favor and ordered the adjustment of the illegally collected money, their non-compliance can be considered a violation of the Act. If the society's managing committee continues to ignore the Registrar's order, you can consider filing a Contempt of Court petition in the High Court. This petition will be based on the society's willful disobedience of the lawful order passed by the Registrar, which amounts to contempt of a judicial authority. Given the harassment and illegal demands, you may also consider filing a criminal complaint against the secretary and the managing committee under section 383, 406 and 506 of theIndian Penal Code. You can also file a civil suit for damages for mental harassment and defamation. Under tort law, you may claim compensation for the mental agony, distress, and damage to your reputation caused by the society's actions If the society still does not comply, escalate the matter by filing a writ petition or contempt petition in the High Court.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Since you have a lease agreement valid until April 15, 2025, the police cannot charge you with criminal trespassing. According to the Section 327 of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (previously,   IPC Section 447) speaks about criminal trespass that when someone enters or remains on another’s property without permission or right. The notice from the owner is invalid because your lease gives you lawful possession therefore, your rights remains that of a tenant. The owner allows you to occupy the property through the lease agreement, therefore cannot unilaterally eject you out of the property without following the right legal processes of evicting you before the agreed time of the lease agreement. Hence you have a right to be in the property and cannot therefore be accused of criminal trespass. A legal practitioner should be consulted to review the lease agreement and facilitate the preparation of the response to the owner’s notice while protecting your tenancy rights.Hope you find this advice beneficial.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "(A)  The property so called ancestral property in the village was obtained by your father out of a partition from his cousins hence it cannot be categorized as ancestral property, therefore as per law, if your father is not willing to give any share in it to you or to anyone, then nobody can claim any share in it as a right.(B) Your father's voluntary act of orally agreeing to give any share in the property to you and not honoring it will not come under criminal breach of trust.  The call records in your possession are not considered as valid and legally enforceable document to support your claim as what you have mentioned here.  Your mention about the written plan is not a document which would be enforceable in law hence if you decide to fight in the court of law on that basis, you will not get any share in this property neither you will be able to win the case which is ab initio not maintainable.(C) if at all you want to lodge any criminal complaint against them then you may have to do so only in the place where the cause of action arose and not on any false promise or misguidance made by anyone.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Property law and family arrangement",
    "answer": "Dear Client,As \"VY\" is ancestral property, underHindu Succession Act, 1956, it is co-parcenary property, meaning that all male members (including you and your brother) have an equal right to it by birth. However, your father's share is also ancestral, and he can distribute his share as he pleases during his lifetime. This means he can choose to go against the previous verbal or written family agreements unless those agreements are legally binding. Since there was a written plan similar to the \"CY\" plan that was verbally agreed upon, your father’s ability to alter the distribution depends on whether that plan was legally documented and agreed upon by all coparceners. If it was only verbal, it might be difficult to enforce it legally without strong supporting evidence. If your father decides not to honor the previous plan, the default legal rule would apply, potentially limiting your share to 1/3 of his share in the remaining ancestral property.Filing for an injunction to prevent the sale of \"VY\" property is a valid legal remedy. An injunction can temporarily halt the sale until the dispute is resolved. This would protect your interest while the case is ongoing. File a criminal breach of trust case in Pune if you have substantial evidence to support the claim that your family is dishonestly depriving you of your rightful share. Your lawyer’s advice against filing a partition suit is based on the fact that it would legally entitle your mother to a share, potentially reducing your portion to 1/4, as perHindu Succession Act, 1956. Filing a criminal case in Pune is feasible since all parties reside there, and it would be more convenient for you. If necessary, be prepared to move the case to the village court in Bihar, which may put additional pressure on the counterparty.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In the said judgment, SC reiterated the observations of its earlier judgement that a MOFS prepared after family arrangement was already made for the purpose of recording the information or for the information of the court, is not required to be registered.Ajay SethiAdvocate, Mumbai98567 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi"

    "answer": "Oral family settlements are legally binding and can be used to divide property, even if they are not acted upon:The Supreme Court has ruled that family settlement deeds are legally binding and have legal force, as long as they are fair and equitable, voluntary, and not induced by fraud or coercion."

    "question": "Property law and family arrangement",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Filing a title suit for specific plots of the \"VY\" ancestral property is indeed a viable approach. This suit would help in establishing your share according to the family arrangement and could also request a halt on the sale of the property until the title is confirmed. Alternatively, seeking a declaration that the property is joint can also be pursued. If the counterparty proceeds with the sale and registration without including you, filing a criminal case could be considered, particularly if there is evidence of fraud or breach of trust. A well-documented memo reflecting a fair and balanced arrangement can be considered valid even without formal registration, provided it accurately represents the agreement and intentions of the parties involved. Therefore, your understanding is correct, i.e. a family arrangement recorded in writing and supported by clear evidence can be upheld, but if it involves creating new rights or significant changes, registration might be required to establish it formally.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

There is no restriction under Indian law that prevents someone from being a surety for multiple people in various cases. Each bail application is considered on its own merits, and the role of the surety in one case does not affect their ability to act as a surety in another case.If someone has an FIR registered against them in a civil case that has been pending for 10 years, it does not affect their ability to act as a surety for someone else. The role of a surety in one case is generally independent of their legal status in other cases. However, the person seeking bail or acting as a surety must meet the conditions set by the court, and any ongoing legal issues might be considered by the court when evaluating their credibility as a surety.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Gather all relevant evidence, including the prosecution report, the accused’s guilty plea, and any communications or RTI replies related to the initial incident. This evidence can support your claim that the SC/ST FIR is frivolous and meant to obstruct justice. Engage a lawyer who specializes in criminal law and has experience dealing with SC/ST Act cases.

    "question": "Property law and family arrangement",
    "answer": "Dear Client,As \"VY\" is ancestral property, underHindu Succession Act, 1956, it is co-parcenary property, meaning that all male members (including you and your brother) have an equal right to it by birth. However, your father's share is also ancestral, and he can distribute his share as he pleases during his lifetime. This means he can choose to go against the previous verbal or written family agreements unless those agreements are legally binding. Since there was a written plan similar to the \"CY\" plan that was verbally agreed upon, your father’s ability to alter the distribution depends on whether that plan was legally documented and agreed upon by all coparceners. If it was only verbal, it might be difficult to enforce it legally without strong supporting evidence. If your father decides not to honor the previous plan, the default legal rule would apply, potentially limiting your share to 1/3 of his share in the remaining ancestral property.Filing for an injunction to prevent the sale of \"VY\" property is a valid legal remedy. An injunction can temporarily halt the sale until the dispute is resolved. This would protect your interest while the case is ongoing. File a criminal breach of trust case in Pune if you have substantial evidence to support the claim that your family is dishonestly depriving you of your rightful share. Your lawyer’s advice against filing a partition suit is based on the fact that it would legally entitle your mother to a share, potentially reducing your portion to 1/4, as perHindu Succession Act, 1956. Filing a criminal case in Pune is feasible since all parties reside there, and it would be more convenient for you. If necessary, be prepared to move the case to the village court in Bihar, which may put additional pressure on the counterparty.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In the said judgment, SC reiterated the observations of its earlier judgement that a MOFS prepared after family arrangement was already made for the purpose of recording the information or for the information of the court, is not required to be registered.Ajay SethiAdvocate, Mumbai98567 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi"

    "question": "Property law and family arrangement",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Filing a title suit for specific plots of the \"VY\" ancestral property is indeed a viable approach. This suit would help in establishing your share according to the family arrangement and could also request a halt on the sale of the property until the title is confirmed. Alternatively, seeking a declaration that the property is joint can also be pursued. If the counterparty proceeds with the sale and registration without including you, filing a criminal case could be considered, particularly if there is evidence of fraud or breach of trust. A well-documented memo reflecting a fair and balanced arrangement can be considered valid even without formal registration, provided it accurately represents the agreement and intentions of the parties involved. Therefore, your understanding is correct, i.e. a family arrangement recorded in writing and supported by clear evidence can be upheld, but if it involves creating new rights or significant changes, registration might be required to establish it formally.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

There is no restriction under Indian law that prevents someone from being a surety for multiple people in various cases. Each bail application is considered on its own merits, and the role of the surety in one case does not affect their ability to act as a surety in another case.If someone has an FIR registered against them in a civil case that has been pending for 10 years, it does not affect their ability to act as a surety for someone else. The role of a surety in one case is generally independent of their legal status in other cases. However, the person seeking bail or acting as a surety must meet the conditions set by the court, and any ongoing legal issues might be considered by the court when evaluating their credibility as a surety.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

You can argue that the accused is attempting to misuse the provisions of the SC/ST Act to harass you, a public servant, and to seek vengeance after pleading guilty to the earlier charges. Gather all relevant evidence, including the prosecution report, the accused’s guilty plea, and any communications or RTI replies related to the initial incident.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Your mother can file a complaint under the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, 2005 (PWDVA)and since the incident involved physical violence, she can file an FIR under Section 85 of theIndian Penal Code(IPC), which deals with cruelty by the husband or his relatives Your mother can move to Jabalpur and file her complaints and cases from there. An FIR can be filed at the place of occurrence of the crime. However, if she moves to Jabalpur, she can still file a complaint there and seek a transfer of the case to Jabalpur. She can apply for a protection order which would legally prevent your father from committing any further acts ofdomestic violence. Your mother can file for divorce on the grounds of cruelty under Section 13(1)(ia) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955. Cruelty includes both physical and mental abuse. She can file for divorce in the family court in Jabalpur, as under theHindu Marriage Act, she can file a divorce petition where she is currently residing. It is crucial to engage a lawyer who specializes in family law anddomestic violencecases. The lawyer can guide her through filing complaints, applying for protection orders, and initiating divorce proceedings.

    "answer": "Yes, she can move to her parent’s house and file complaints from there. She can file an FIR at any police station. If she files it in Lucknow, she can still pursue the legal proceedings from Jabalpur. The police in Lucknow will transfer the case to the appropriate jurisdiction if needed. According to Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC), a case can be filed where the defendant resides or where the cause of action arises. This means she has the flexibility to choose the location that is most convenient for her means either lucknow or jabalpur any of them. Once the FIR is filed, she can coordinate with her lawyer to handle the proceedings from Jabalpur. Many legal processes can be managed remotely, and her lawyer can represent her in court if necessary. However, it might be beneficial for her to move to her parent’s house for support and safety. Filing the FIR in Lucknow and then managing the legal proceedings from Jabalpur could provide her with the necessary support system while ensuring the legal process continues smoothly.Complaint underSection 498AIPC can be filed at place of woman’s residence, Supreme Court reiterates, Over five months after a three-judge Bench of the Supreme Court ruled that an estranged wife can approach courts at a place where she has taken shelter after being driven out of her matrimonial home in order to file complaint underSection 498Aof theIndian Penal Code, a two-Judge Bench has reiterated this position.

    "answer": "Dear Client,You can file a petition under Section 482 of theCriminal Procedure Code(CrPC) in the High Court to quash the FIR filed under the SC/ST Act. The key argument would be that the FIR is an afterthought and has been filed with malafide intentions, as the accused had already pleaded guilty in a prior case for the same incident. You can argue that the accused is attempting to misuse the provisions of the SC/ST Act to harass you, a public servant, and to seek vengeance after pleading guilty to the earlier charges. Gather all relevant evidence, including the prosecution report, the accused’s guilty plea, and any communications or RTI replies related to the initial incident. This evidence can support your claim that the SC/ST FIR is frivolous and meant to obstruct justice. Engage a lawyer who specializes in criminal law and has experience dealing with SC/ST Act cases.

Income from such a house should be chargeable as Income from House PropertyThe seller should purchase a residential house either 1 year before the date of sale/transfer or 2 years after the date of sale/transfer. In case the seller is constructing a house, the seller has an extended time, ie. the seller will have to construct the residential house within 3 years from the date of sale/transfer.The new residential house should be in India.

    "answer": "1. Assuming your flat is registered as an apartment and the apartment owners association is a registered body. If so, all occupants are owners. Thus, all of you own part of the land in the proportion of FSI consumed/used. Unless all of you agree and sign the agreement, redevelopment can not happen.2. As per earlier DCR, terraces were allowed free of FSI. In unified DCR that are implemented in entire Maharashtra except Mumbai, they have proposed ancillary FSI and terrace too is counted. Now, it will not be beneficial to give terraces and yiu will notice that terraces are not planned in new upcoming buildings.it may not work economically viable to give built up area same as terrace area in the proposed new building. All of you have to sit together and work out a compromise formula by coming couple of steps closer to each other.3. The redevelopment committee of the association will take care of it.4. It is not mandatory for the society create a website for such activities, besides the communication sent through whatsapp is also a voluntary service and cannot be claimed as a right, it is you who have to regularly follow up with the society to know the updates.5. If you are interested to escalate the matter through legal sources then you should have sent the legal notice by registered post and not through social media or whats app media.The legal notice sent by registered post will certainly invoke response failing which yo can sue the association for deficiency in serviceT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Redevelopment of society based on floor plan or physical existence",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Terrace Entitlement: If the terrace is part of the approved floor plan and you have paid stamp duty and registration fees for it, you have a legal claim to it. If the builder asserts that the terrace was illegally constructed, it is crucial to verify this claim with municipal records. However, since you have been paying stamp duty and registration, you may argue that you have legal possession. Obtain the approved building plan from the local municipal authority. This will clarify whether the terrace was legally constructed.Physical Existence vs. Floor Plan: During redevelopment, the original approved floor plan is usually the determining factor for entitlements, not just the physical existence of features.Measuring Apartment Square Footage: While it's not mandatory to appoint an architect specifically for measurement, accurate measurement of the property is essential to ensure you are being fairly compensated in the redevelopment process. You have the right to be fully informed about the redevelopment process, including the accurate size of your property.Transparency and Communication: Under the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960, the managing committee has a duty to keep members informed. There is no specific law mandating the maintenance of a website, but effective communication is a legal expectation. You can lodge a complaint with the Registrar of Societies if the society fails to maintain transparency or adequately inform members.Lack of Response to Legal Notice: If the society fails to respond to a legal notice, you can consider escalating the matter legally. You can file a complaint with the Registrar of Societies or approach the cooperative court. You may consider filing a civil suit for declaratory relief and/or damages, particularly if the builder or society refuses to honour your legal rights.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Redevelopment of society based on floor plan or physical existence",
    "answer": "As the members have already vacated the building and are without homes, it is but obvious that the builder will try to take advantage of that situationOrdinarily even if there are violations to the sanctioned building plans,  the builder usually agrees to accommodate since the society has an upper hand. If majority members have violated the building plans then in order to get majority consent for redevelopment,  the builder even goes to the extent of offering extra area over and above the eligibility of the members, from his free sale component. However that happens only when the members have not yet vacated their premisesIn your case the society and its members do not have that upper hand in the negotiations with the builderThough the builder is legally right that he is liable to give area in the new building considering the sanctioned building plans of old building , but this is always a matter of contract and agreement between the society and the builderJust by paying property tax and maintenance for the premises (which have been unauthorizedly expanded and extended) the extra areas do not get legitimized.Even slum dwellers pay property tax...so would it mean that their hutments are legal structures ?So in your case I would suggest to negotiate hard with the builder to make him provide also for the extra areas constructed or put up by the membersOfcourse all this is subject to project feasibilityIf due to giving area from the builder's sale component,  the project becomes inviable for him, then he would not show interestSo the interest of both the builder and society need to be balancedYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Disproportionate UDS between existing owners and future new owners in a redevelopment project",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The builder's proposal to allocate 60% of the additional built-up area from increased FSI to himself and only 40% to the existing owners raises several legal concerns, particularly regarding the Uniformity of Distributive Share and the rights of the existing owners versus new buyers. Legally, UDS refers to the proportionate share of the land that each flat owner holds, which is calculated based on the area of their individual flats relative to the total land area. Since the FSI increase allows for more construction, the distribution of this additional space typically should be proportional to the existing UDS shares to ensure fairness. However, there is no specific regulation under RERA or CMDA that explicitly governs the allocation of additional FSI benefits in terms of UDS. The lack of clear regulation means that agreements are often subject to negotiation between the builder and the housing association.The builder’s assurance that the UDS of existing owners will remain unchanged while offering a disproportionate share of the additional built-up area to himself could potentially be valid if documented properly in an agreement. However, this approach may create disparities for new buyers, who will receive a smaller proportion of UDS compared to existing owners. If new buyers are informed about their reduced UDS share and agree to it, there may be limited grounds for legal challenge. However, if the allocation appears unfair or discriminatory, it might invite disputes or legal challenges from future buyers. To address these concerns, consider negotiating a fair distribution of the additional FSI benefits and documenting the agreement in a legally binding MOU.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Driving under these conditions is illegal and could result in severe penalties, including additional charges for violating the terms of the suspension. In the event of an accident with a two-wheeler rider who was not wearing a helmet and was under the influence of alcohol, the lack of CCTV evidence or eyewitnesses means fault determination will rely heavily on police investigations and medical reports.

    "question": "Property law and family arrangement",
    "answer": "(A)  The property so called ancestral property in the village was obtained by your father out of a partition from his cousins hence it cannot be categorized as ancestral property, therefore as per law, if your father is not willing to give any share in it to you or to anyone, then nobody can claim any share in it as a right.(B) Your father's voluntary act of orally agreeing to give any share in the property to you and not honoring it will not come under criminal breach of trust.  The call records in your possession are not considered as valid and legally enforceable document to support your claim as what you have mentioned here.  Your mention about the written plan is not a document which would be enforceable in law hence if you decide to fight in the court of law on that basis, you will not get any share in this property neither you will be able to win the case which is ab initio not maintainable.(C) if at all you want to lodge any criminal complaint against them then you may have to do so only in the place where the cause of action arose and not on any false promise or misguidance made by anyone.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Property law and family arrangement",
    "answer": "Dear Client,As \"VY\" is ancestral property, underHindu Succession Act, 1956, it is co-parcenary property, meaning that all male members (including you and your brother) have an equal right to it by birth. However, your father's share is also ancestral, and he can distribute his share as he pleases during his lifetime. This means he can choose to go against the previous verbal or written family agreements unless those agreements are legally binding. Since there was a written plan similar to the \"CY\" plan that was verbally agreed upon, your father’s ability to alter the distribution depends on whether that plan was legally documented and agreed upon by all coparceners. If it was only verbal, it might be difficult to enforce it legally without strong supporting evidence. If your father decides not to honor the previous plan, the default legal rule would apply, potentially limiting your share to 1/3 of his share in the remaining ancestral property.Filing for an injunction to prevent the sale of \"VY\" property is a valid legal remedy. An injunction can temporarily halt the sale until the dispute is resolved. This would protect your interest while the case is ongoing. File a criminal breach of trust case in Pune if you have substantial evidence to support the claim that your family is dishonestly depriving you of your rightful share. Your lawyer’s advice against filing a partition suit is based on the fact that it would legally entitle your mother to a share, potentially reducing your portion to 1/4, as perHindu Succession Act, 1956. Filing a criminal case in Pune is feasible since all parties reside there, and it would be more convenient for you. If necessary, be prepared to move the case to the village court in Bihar, which may put additional pressure on the counterparty.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In the said judgment, SC reiterated the observations of its earlier judgement that a MOFS prepared after family arrangement was already made for the purpose of recording the information or for the information of the court, is not required to be registered.Ajay SethiAdvocate, Mumbai98567 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi"

    "question": "Property law and family arrangement",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Filing a title suit for specific plots of the \"VY\" ancestral property is indeed a viable approach. This suit would help in establishing your share according to the family arrangement and could also request a halt on the sale of the property until the title is confirmed. Alternatively, seeking a declaration that the property is joint can also be pursued. If the counterparty proceeds with the sale and registration without including you, filing a criminal case could be considered, particularly if there is evidence of fraud or breach of trust. A well-documented memo reflecting a fair and balanced arrangement can be considered valid even without formal registration, provided it accurately represents the agreement and intentions of the parties involved. Therefore, your understanding is correct, i.e. a family arrangement recorded in writing and supported by clear evidence can be upheld, but if it involves creating new rights or significant changes, registration might be required to establish it formally.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This process entails the systematic closure of the company's affairs, including the sale of assets, settlement of debts from the proceeds, and distribution of any remaining surplus to the shareholders according to their stake in the company. The initiation of winding up occurs either by a court order or through a voluntary resolution passed by the company.The objective of winding up is to ensure an orderly closure and distribution of the company's assets.the following detailed procedure is to be followed:Directors assess the company's financial position and declare its ability to pay all debts. This declaration, made on Form 107 as per Rule 269, is supported by an auditor's report.The board convenes to decide on proposing voluntary winding up to the shareholders and schedules a General Meeting (Annual or Extraordinary) as per Section 362.The resolution to wind up is published in the Official Gazette and newspapers within 10 days, ensuring public notification. A copy is also filed with the Registrar in compliance with Section 361.Upon completing the winding-up process, the liquidator compiles a final report and financial account, summoning a meeting of members to present these documents. This step is conducted on Form 111 as per Rule 279, following Section 370.Within a week following the final meeting, the liquidator submits a copy of the final report and accounts to the Registrar using Form 112, as dictated by Rule 279 and Section 370, marking the completion of the winding-up process.Thus whatever agreement between you both can be decided in the meeting before applying for winding up.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Winding up a company because of deadlock",
    "answer": "Dear Client,To achieve your objective of winding up the company and starting a new one, you need to navigate several challenges and follow a structured approach. The main challenges include the legal deadlock due to your wife’s petition for the appointment of an administrator at the NCLT, which could delay or complicate the winding-up process. Additionally, her opposition to the winding-up and preference for continuing operations could hinder your plans. To address these issues, consider negotiating with your wife to reach a mutual agreement on asset distribution and company closure, possibly involving mediation to resolve disputes. If negotiations fail, you can file for voluntary winding up under Section 271 of the Companies Act, 2013, ensuring compliance with all legal requirements, including appointing a liquidator and distributing assets. To protect your new venture, clearly document and separate the assets and intellectual property from the old company.

    "question": "Tenant property theft liability",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In this situation, your liability as landlords for the loss of the old tenant's belongings largely depends on several factors, including the terms of the rental agreement, the specific promises made by your father, and the actions of the new tenants. Generally, landlords are not liable for the personal property of tenants unless there is a specific agreement or contract that provides for such a responsibility. In this case, if the new tenants were responsible for breaking into the trunk, they would be the primary parties liable for any theft. However, if your father made a verbal promise to the old tenant regarding the storage of his belongings, and if this promise was understood to be part of the rental arrangement, it could create a basis for a claim. To determine the validity of the old tenant's claim, you would need to verify what was in the trunk and assess the value of the items reported as stolen. To address the claim, consider collecting evidence of their value, investigating the genuineness of their claim and then offer resolution (if any).Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

NRIs are generally defined under the Income Tax Act, 1961, based on their stay duration in India.No, under the current regulations, NRIs are not permitted to purchase agricultural land in Telangana, or in other states, unless they have specific permissions or exceptions under certain conditions. The general rule restricts NRIs from owning agricultural land in India.Building a farmhouse on agricultural land is subject to restrictions. Typically, agricultural land is meant for farming and cultivation, not for constructing commercial or residential buildings. Constructing a farmhouse with amenities like a swimming pool and opening it for public rental may violate agricultural land use regulations.Yes, if you intend to use the land for purposes other than agriculture, such as constructing a farmhouse with commercial elements, you will need to convert the land from agricultural to a non-agricultural (NALA) use. NALA stands for Non-Agricultural Land Acquisition, and this process is required to change the land use classification.For constructing a farmhouse intended for commercial use, such as renting out to the public, you would need to convert the land to a commercial use. The process involves, applying for conversion by providing supporting documents and obtaining approval.Agricultural lands are generally lower cost, have tax benefits, and no conversion is needed for farming activities. However, have limited resale value for non-farming purposes, and potential regulatory hurdles for land use changes. Whereas, Commercial lands have higher resale value, potential for income generation, and flexibility for various business uses but they also have Higher cost, increased regulatory scrutiny, and additional taxes as disadvantages.The time required for NALA conversion can vary depending on the state and specific circumstances. Generally, it can take several months to complete the conversion process, involving administrative review and approvals.Yes, it is possible to sell the land after NALA conversion. However, ensure that the conversion process is properly documented and approved by the authorities. You must follow all legal requirements, such as updating land records and complying with any specific state regulations regarding the sale of converted land.Yes, it is possible to convert a portion of the land to commercial use, provided you get the necessary approvals from local authorities. The conversion of a small portion to commercial use while keeping the rest as agricultural land is feasible, but it requires clear documentation and adherence to zoning regulations.

    "question": "Property law and family arrangement",
    "answer": "Dear Client,As \"VY\" is ancestral property, underHindu Succession Act, 1956, it is co-parcenary property, meaning that all male members (including you and your brother) have an equal right to it by birth. However, your father's share is also ancestral, and he can distribute his share as he pleases during his lifetime. This means he can choose to go against the previous verbal or written family agreements unless those agreements are legally binding. Since there was a written plan similar to the \"CY\" plan that was verbally agreed upon, your father’s ability to alter the distribution depends on whether that plan was legally documented and agreed upon by all coparceners. If it was only verbal, it might be difficult to enforce it legally without strong supporting evidence. If your father decides not to honor the previous plan, the default legal rule would apply, potentially limiting your share to 1/3 of his share in the remaining ancestral property.Filing for an injunction to prevent the sale of \"VY\" property is a valid legal remedy. An injunction can temporarily halt the sale until the dispute is resolved. This would protect your interest while the case is ongoing. File a criminal breach of trust case in Pune if you have substantial evidence to support the claim that your family is dishonestly depriving you of your rightful share. Your lawyer’s advice against filing a partition suit is based on the fact that it would legally entitle your mother to a share, potentially reducing your portion to 1/4, as perHindu Succession Act, 1956. Filing a criminal case in Pune is feasible since all parties reside there, and it would be more convenient for you. If necessary, be prepared to move the case to the village court in Bihar, which may put additional pressure on the counterparty.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In the said judgment, SC reiterated the observations of its earlier judgement that a MOFS prepared after family arrangement was already made for the purpose of recording the information or for the information of the court, is not required to be registered.Ajay SethiAdvocate, Mumbai98567 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi"

    "question": "Property law and family arrangement",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Filing a title suit for specific plots of the \"VY\" ancestral property is indeed a viable approach. This suit would help in establishing your share according to the family arrangement and could also request a halt on the sale of the property until the title is confirmed. Alternatively, seeking a declaration that the property is joint can also be pursued. If the counterparty proceeds with the sale and registration without including you, filing a criminal case could be considered, particularly if there is evidence of fraud or breach of trust. A well-documented memo reflecting a fair and balanced arrangement can be considered valid even without formal registration, provided it accurately represents the agreement and intentions of the parties involved. Therefore, your understanding is correct, i.e. a family arrangement recorded in writing and supported by clear evidence can be upheld, but if it involves creating new rights or significant changes, registration might be required to establish it formally.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Questions related to Agriculture Land and NALA conversion",
    "answer": "Dear Client,A Non-Resident Indian (NRI) is an Indian citizen who resides outside India for reasons such as employment, business, or other circumstances that indicate an intention to stay abroad for an extended period. NRIs are generally defined under the Income Tax Act, 1961, based on their stay duration in India.No, under the current regulations, NRIs are not permitted to purchase agricultural land in Telangana, or in other states, unless they have specific permissions or exceptions under certain conditions. The general rule restricts NRIs from owning agricultural land in India.Building a farmhouse on agricultural land is subject to restrictions. Typically, agricultural land is meant for farming and cultivation, not for constructing commercial or residential buildings. Constructing a farmhouse with amenities like a swimming pool and opening it for public rental may violate agricultural land use regulations.Yes, if you intend to use the land for purposes other than agriculture, such as constructing a farmhouse with commercial elements, you will need to convert the land from agricultural to a non-agricultural (NALA) use. NALA stands for Non-Agricultural Land Acquisition, and this process is required to change the land use classification.For constructing a farmhouse intended for commercial use, such as renting out to the public, you would need to convert the land to a commercial use. The process involves, applying for conversion by providing supporting documents and obtaining approval.Agricultural lands are generally lower cost, have tax benefits, and no conversion is needed for farming activities. However, have limited resale value for non-farming purposes, and potential regulatory hurdles for land use changes. Whereas, Commercial lands have higher resale value, potential for income generation, and flexibility for various business uses but they also have Higher cost, increased regulatory scrutiny, and additional taxes as disadvantages.The time required for NALA conversion can vary depending on the state and specific circumstances. Generally, it can take several months to complete the conversion process, involving administrative review and approvals.Yes, it is possible to sell the land after NALA conversion. However, ensure that the conversion process is properly documented and approved by the authorities. You must follow all legal requirements, such as updating land records and complying with any specific state regulations regarding the sale of converted land.Yes, it is possible to convert a portion of the land to commercial use, provided you get the necessary approvals from local authorities. The conversion of a small portion to commercial use while keeping the rest as agricultural land is feasible, but it requires clear documentation and adherence to zoning regulations. Ensure you obtain specific permissions for the mixed-use of the land and comply with the local planning guidelines.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The initiation of winding up occurs either by a court order or through a voluntary resolution passed by the company.The objective of winding up is to ensure an orderly closure and distribution of the company's assets.the following detailed procedure is to be followed:Directors assess the company's financial position and declare its ability to pay all debts. This declaration, made on Form 107 as per Rule 269, is supported by an auditor's report.The board convenes to decide on proposing voluntary winding up to the shareholders and schedules a General Meeting (Annual or Extraordinary) as per Section 362.The resolution to wind up is published in the Official Gazette and newspapers within 10 days, ensuring public notification. A copy is also filed with the Registrar in compliance with Section 361.Upon completing the winding-up process, the liquidator compiles a final report and financial account, summoning a meeting of members to present these documents. This step is conducted on Form 111 as per Rule 279, following Section 370.Within a week following the final meeting, the liquidator submits a copy of the final report and accounts to the Registrar using Form 112, as dictated by Rule 279 and Section 370, marking the completion of the winding-up process.Thus whatever agreement between you both can be decided in the meeting before applying for winding up.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Winding up a company because of deadlock",
    "answer": "Dear Client,To achieve your objective of winding up the company and starting a new one, you need to navigate several challenges and follow a structured approach. The main challenges include the legal deadlock due to your wife’s petition for the appointment of an administrator at the NCLT, which could delay or complicate the winding-up process. Additionally, her opposition to the winding-up and preference for continuing operations could hinder your plans. To address these issues, consider negotiating with your wife to reach a mutual agreement on asset distribution and company closure, possibly involving mediation to resolve disputes. If negotiations fail, you can file for voluntary winding up under Section 271 of the Companies Act, 2013, ensuring compliance with all legal requirements, including appointing a liquidator and distributing assets. To protect your new venture, clearly document and separate the assets and intellectual property from the old company.

    "question": "Redevelopment of society based on floor plan or physical existence",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Terrace Entitlement: If the terrace is part of the approved floor plan and you have paid stamp duty and registration fees for it, you have a legal claim to it. If the builder asserts that the terrace was illegally constructed, it is crucial to verify this claim with municipal records. However, since you have been paying stamp duty and registration, you may argue that you have legal possession. Obtain the approved building plan from the local municipal authority. This will clarify whether the terrace was legally constructed.Physical Existence vs. Floor Plan: During redevelopment, the original approved floor plan is usually the determining factor for entitlements, not just the physical existence of features.Measuring Apartment Square Footage: While it's not mandatory to appoint an architect specifically for measurement, accurate measurement of the property is essential to ensure you are being fairly compensated in the redevelopment process. You have the right to be fully informed about the redevelopment process, including the accurate size of your property.Transparency and Communication: Under the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960, the managing committee has a duty to keep members informed. There is no specific law mandating the maintenance of a website, but effective communication is a legal expectation. You can lodge a complaint with the Registrar of Societies if the society fails to maintain transparency or adequately inform members.Lack of Response to Legal Notice: If the society fails to respond to a legal notice, you can consider escalating the matter legally. You can file a complaint with the Registrar of Societies or approach the cooperative court. You may consider filing a civil suit for declaratory relief and/or damages, particularly if the builder or society refuses to honour your legal rights.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Redevelopment of society based on floor plan or physical existence",
    "answer": "As the members have already vacated the building and are without homes, it is but obvious that the builder will try to take advantage of that situationOrdinarily even if there are violations to the sanctioned building plans,  the builder usually agrees to accommodate since the society has an upper hand. If majority members have violated the building plans then in order to get majority consent for redevelopment,  the builder even goes to the extent of offering extra area over and above the eligibility of the members, from his free sale component. However that happens only when the members have not yet vacated their premisesIn your case the society and its members do not have that upper hand in the negotiations with the builderThough the builder is legally right that he is liable to give area in the new building considering the sanctioned building plans of old building , but this is always a matter of contract and agreement between the society and the builderJust by paying property tax and maintenance for the premises (which have been unauthorizedly expanded and extended) the extra areas do not get legitimized.Even slum dwellers pay property tax...so would it mean that their hutments are legal structures ?So in your case I would suggest to negotiate hard with the builder to make him provide also for the extra areas constructed or put up by the membersOfcourse all this is subject to project feasibilityIf due to giving area from the builder's sale component,  the project becomes inviable for him, then he would not show interestSo the interest of both the builder and society need to be balancedYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Dear Client,If the society is not adhering to proper procedures or failing in its duties, you can file a complaint with the Registrar of Cooperative Societies under the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960. The Registrar can investigate the complaint and direct the society to act in accordance with the law. You can take legal action against the society and its managing committee if they are not performing their duties. This may include filing a suit for specific performance, injunction, or damages if the society or its officials are acting in bad faith or violating the rules. If you believe that the balcony or terrace was legally constructed and the seller did not disclose any illegalities, you can pursue a claim for misrepresentation or fraud against the seller. This would involve filing a suit for breach of contract or misrepresentation in a civil court. If it is proven that the balcony or terrace was illegally constructed, you may face legal challenges including potential fines or the need to remove the illegal structure.

    "question": "Disproportionate UDS between existing owners and future new owners in a redevelopment project",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The builder's proposal to allocate 60% of the additional built-up area from increased FSI to himself and only 40% to the existing owners raises several legal concerns, particularly regarding the Uniformity of Distributive Share and the rights of the existing owners versus new buyers. Legally, UDS refers to the proportionate share of the land that each flat owner holds, which is calculated based on the area of their individual flats relative to the total land area. Since the FSI increase allows for more construction, the distribution of this additional space typically should be proportional to the existing UDS shares to ensure fairness. However, there is no specific regulation under RERA or CMDA that explicitly governs the allocation of additional FSI benefits in terms of UDS. The lack of clear regulation means that agreements are often subject to negotiation between the builder and the housing association.The builder’s assurance that the UDS of existing owners will remain unchanged while offering a disproportionate share of the additional built-up area to himself could potentially be valid if documented properly in an agreement. However, this approach may create disparities for new buyers, who will receive a smaller proportion of UDS compared to existing owners. If new buyers are informed about their reduced UDS share and agree to it, there may be limited grounds for legal challenge. However, if the allocation appears unfair or discriminatory, it might invite disputes or legal challenges from future buyers. To address these concerns, consider negotiating a fair distribution of the additional FSI benefits and documenting the agreement in a legally binding MOU.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This process entails the systematic closure of the company's affairs, including the sale of assets, settlement of debts from the proceeds, and distribution of any remaining surplus to the shareholders according to their stake in the company. The initiation of winding up occurs either by a court order or through a voluntary resolution passed by the company.The objective of winding up is to ensure an orderly closure and distribution of the company's assets.the following detailed procedure is to be followed:Directors assess the company's financial position and declare its ability to pay all debts. This declaration, made on Form 107 as per Rule 269, is supported by an auditor's report.The board convenes to decide on proposing voluntary winding up to the shareholders and schedules a General Meeting (Annual or Extraordinary) as per Section 362.The resolution to wind up is published in the Official Gazette and newspapers within 10 days, ensuring public notification. A copy is also filed with the Registrar in compliance with Section 361.Upon completing the winding-up process, the liquidator compiles a final report and financial account, summoning a meeting of members to present these documents. This step is conducted on Form 111 as per Rule 279, following Section 370.Within a week following the final meeting, the liquidator submits a copy of the final report and accounts to the Registrar using Form 112, as dictated by Rule 279 and Section 370, marking the completion of the winding-up process.Thus whatever agreement between you both can be decided in the meeting before applying for winding up.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

Failure to do so results in penaltiesUpon a liquidator's appointment, the powers held by the company's directors, chief executive, and other officers are suspended, except for specific actions like notifying stakeholders of the winding-up resolution, appointing a liquidator, and similar procedural tasks.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,To achieve your objective of winding up the company and starting a new one, you need to navigate several challenges and follow a structured approach. The main challenges include the legal deadlock due to your wife’s petition for the appointment of an administrator at the NCLT, which could delay or complicate the winding-up process. Additionally, her opposition to the winding-up and preference for continuing operations could hinder your plans. To address these issues, consider negotiating with your wife to reach a mutual agreement on asset distribution and company closure, possibly involving mediation to resolve disputes. If negotiations fail, you can file for voluntary winding up under Section 271 of the Companies Act, 2013, ensuring compliance with all legal requirements, including appointing a liquidator and distributing assets. To protect your new venture, clearly document and separate the assets and intellectual property from the old company.

    "question": "Redevelopment of society based on floor plan or physical existence",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Terrace Entitlement: If the terrace is part of the approved floor plan and you have paid stamp duty and registration fees for it, you have a legal claim to it. If the builder asserts that the terrace was illegally constructed, it is crucial to verify this claim with municipal records. However, since you have been paying stamp duty and registration, you may argue that you have legal possession. Obtain the approved building plan from the local municipal authority. This will clarify whether the terrace was legally constructed.Physical Existence vs. Floor Plan: During redevelopment, the original approved floor plan is usually the determining factor for entitlements, not just the physical existence of features.Measuring Apartment Square Footage: While it's not mandatory to appoint an architect specifically for measurement, accurate measurement of the property is essential to ensure you are being fairly compensated in the redevelopment process. You have the right to be fully informed about the redevelopment process, including the accurate size of your property.Transparency and Communication: Under the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960, the managing committee has a duty to keep members informed. There is no specific law mandating the maintenance of a website, but effective communication is a legal expectation. You can lodge a complaint with the Registrar of Societies if the society fails to maintain transparency or adequately inform members.Lack of Response to Legal Notice: If the society fails to respond to a legal notice, you can consider escalating the matter legally. You can file a complaint with the Registrar of Societies or approach the cooperative court. You may consider filing a civil suit for declaratory relief and/or damages, particularly if the builder or society refuses to honour your legal rights.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Redevelopment of society based on floor plan or physical existence",
    "answer": "As the members have already vacated the building and are without homes, it is but obvious that the builder will try to take advantage of that situationOrdinarily even if there are violations to the sanctioned building plans,  the builder usually agrees to accommodate since the society has an upper hand. If majority members have violated the building plans then in order to get majority consent for redevelopment,  the builder even goes to the extent of offering extra area over and above the eligibility of the members, from his free sale component. However that happens only when the members have not yet vacated their premisesIn your case the society and its members do not have that upper hand in the negotiations with the builderThough the builder is legally right that he is liable to give area in the new building considering the sanctioned building plans of old building , but this is always a matter of contract and agreement between the society and the builderJust by paying property tax and maintenance for the premises (which have been unauthorizedly expanded and extended) the extra areas do not get legitimized.Even slum dwellers pay property tax...so would it mean that their hutments are legal structures ?So in your case I would suggest to negotiate hard with the builder to make him provide also for the extra areas constructed or put up by the membersOfcourse all this is subject to project feasibilityIf due to giving area from the builder's sale component,  the project becomes inviable for him, then he would not show interestSo the interest of both the builder and society need to be balancedYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Dear Client,If the society is not adhering to proper procedures or failing in its duties, you can file a complaint with the Registrar of Cooperative Societies under the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960. The Registrar can investigate the complaint and direct the society to act in accordance with the law. You can take legal action against the society and its managing committee if they are not performing their duties. This may include filing a suit for specific performance, injunction, or damages if the society or its officials are acting in bad faith or violating the rules. If you believe that the balcony or terrace was legally constructed and the seller did not disclose any illegalities, you can pursue a claim for misrepresentation or fraud against the seller. This would involve filing a suit for breach of contract or misrepresentation in a civil court. If it is proven that the balcony or terrace was illegally constructed, you may face legal challenges including potential fines or the need to remove the illegal structure. Gather all relevant documents including the sale deed, previous correspondence, and any evidence supporting the legality of the balcony or terrace.

    "question": "Disproportionate UDS between existing owners and future new owners in a redevelopment project",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The builder's proposal to allocate 60% of the additional built-up area from increased FSI to himself and only 40% to the existing owners raises several legal concerns, particularly regarding the Uniformity of Distributive Share and the rights of the existing owners versus new buyers. Legally, UDS refers to the proportionate share of the land that each flat owner holds, which is calculated based on the area of their individual flats relative to the total land area. Since the FSI increase allows for more construction, the distribution of this additional space typically should be proportional to the existing UDS shares to ensure fairness. However, there is no specific regulation under RERA or CMDA that explicitly governs the allocation of additional FSI benefits in terms of UDS. The lack of clear regulation means that agreements are often subject to negotiation between the builder and the housing association.The builder’s assurance that the UDS of existing owners will remain unchanged while offering a disproportionate share of the additional built-up area to himself could potentially be valid if documented properly in an agreement. However, this approach may create disparities for new buyers, who will receive a smaller proportion of UDS compared to existing owners. If new buyers are informed about their reduced UDS share and agree to it, there may be limited grounds for legal challenge. However, if the allocation appears unfair or discriminatory, it might invite disputes or legal challenges from future buyers. To address these concerns, consider negotiating a fair distribution of the additional FSI benefits and documenting the agreement in a legally binding MOU.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This process entails the systematic closure of the company's affairs, including the sale of assets, settlement of debts from the proceeds, and distribution of any remaining surplus to the shareholders according to their stake in the company. The initiation of winding up occurs either by a court order or through a voluntary resolution passed by the company.The objective of winding up is to ensure an orderly closure and distribution of the company's assets.the following detailed procedure is to be followed:Directors assess the company's financial position and declare its ability to pay all debts. This declaration, made on Form 107 as per Rule 269, is supported by an auditor's report.The board convenes to decide on proposing voluntary winding up to the shareholders and schedules a General Meeting (Annual or Extraordinary) as per Section 362.The resolution to wind up is published in the Official Gazette and newspapers within 10 days, ensuring public notification. A copy is also filed with the Registrar in compliance with Section 361.Upon completing the winding-up process, the liquidator compiles a final report and financial account, summoning a meeting of members to present these documents. This step is conducted on Form 111 as per Rule 279, following Section 370.Within a week following the final meeting, the liquidator submits a copy of the final report and accounts to the Registrar using Form 112, as dictated by Rule 279 and Section 370, marking the completion of the winding-up process.Thus whatever agreement between you both can be decided in the meeting before applying for winding up.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

This action is typically initiated for several reasons, including:Unpaid Debts:The company fails to settle its debts, prompting creditors to seek legal redress through winding up.Special Resolution:The company's members pass a special resolution acknowledging the need to dissolve the company due to insurmountable challenges or other reasons.Unlawful Acts:The company or its management engages in illegal activities, compromising its integrity and legal standing.Fraud and Misconduct:Involvement in fraudulent practices or serious misconduct tarnishes the company's reputation and operational legality.The process begins with filing a petition to the tribunal, accompanied by a detailed statement of the company's affairs, requesting the winding up.The tribunal appoints a liquidator to oversee and manage the winding-up process, ensuring the company's assets are fairly distributed to its creditors and shareholders.The liquidator must submit a copy of the winding-up order to the ROC within 30 days. Failure to do so results in penaltiesUpon a liquidator's appointment, the powers held by the company's directors, chief executive, and other officers are suspended, except for specific actions like notifying stakeholders of the winding-up resolution, appointing a liquidator, and similar procedural tasks.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Winding up a company because of deadlock",
    "answer": "Dear Client,To achieve your objective of winding up the company and starting a new one, you need to navigate several challenges and follow a structured approach. The main challenges include the legal deadlock due to your wife’s petition for the appointment of an administrator at the NCLT, which could delay or complicate the winding-up process. Additionally, her opposition to the winding-up and preference for continuing operations could hinder your plans. To address these issues, consider negotiating with your wife to reach a mutual agreement on asset distribution and company closure, possibly involving mediation to resolve disputes. If negotiations fail, you can file for voluntary winding up under Section 271 of the Companies Act, 2013, ensuring compliance with all legal requirements, including appointing a liquidator and distributing assets. To protect your new venture, clearly document and separate the assets and intellectual property from the old company. Seek legal advice to draft agreements that safeguard your interests and prevent future claims.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Tenant property theft liability",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In this situation, your liability as landlords for the loss of the old tenant's belongings largely depends on several factors, including the terms of the rental agreement, the specific promises made by your father, and the actions of the new tenants. Generally, landlords are not liable for the personal property of tenants unless there is a specific agreement or contract that provides for such a responsibility. In this case, if the new tenants were responsible for breaking into the trunk, they would be the primary parties liable for any theft. However, if your father made a verbal promise to the old tenant regarding the storage of his belongings, and if this promise was understood to be part of the rental arrangement, it could create a basis for a claim. To determine the validity of the old tenant's claim, you would need to verify what was in the trunk and assess the value of the items reported as stolen. To address the claim, consider collecting evidence of their value, investigating the genuineness of their claim and then offer resolution (if any).Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,A digitally impounded license indicates that your driving privileges have been suspended or restricted. Driving under these conditions is illegal and could result in severe penalties, including additional charges for violating the terms of the suspension. In the event of an accident with a two-wheeler rider who was not wearing a helmet and was under the influence of alcohol, the lack of CCTV evidence or eyewitnesses means fault determination will rely heavily on police investigations and medical reports. Despite the other party's potential fault, you could face criminal charges for driving with an impounded license and civil liability for damages and medical expenses. The penalties could include additional charges and complications with insurance claims. It is crucial to seek legal counsel immediately to navigate the complexities of the case. A lawyer can help address the charges related to the impounded license, handle the criminal and civil aspects of the accident, and work on mitigating potential penalties.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,As \"VY\" is ancestral property, underHindu Succession Act, 1956, it is co-parcenary property, meaning that all male members (including you and your brother) have an equal right to it by birth. However, your father's share is also ancestral, and he can distribute his share as he pleases during his lifetime. This means he can choose to go against the previous verbal or written family agreements unless those agreements are legally binding. Since there was a written plan similar to the \"CY\" plan that was verbally agreed upon, your father’s ability to alter the distribution depends on whether that plan was legally documented and agreed upon by all coparceners. If it was only verbal, it might be difficult to enforce it legally without strong supporting evidence. If your father decides not to honor the previous plan, the default legal rule would apply, potentially limiting your share to 1/3 of his share in the remaining ancestral property.Filing for an injunction to prevent the sale of \"VY\" property is a valid legal remedy. An injunction can temporarily halt the sale until the dispute is resolved. This would protect your interest while the case is ongoing. File a criminal breach of trust case in Pune if you have substantial evidence to support the claim that your family is dishonestly depriving you of your rightful share. Your lawyer’s advice against filing a partition suit is based on the fact that it would legally entitle your mother to a share, potentially reducing your portion to 1/4, as perHindu Succession Act, 1956. Filing a criminal case in Pune is feasible since all parties reside there, and it would be more convenient for you.

    "question": "Property law and family arrangement",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Filing a title suit for specific plots of the \"VY\" ancestral property is indeed a viable approach. This suit would help in establishing your share according to the family arrangement and could also request a halt on the sale of the property until the title is confirmed. Alternatively, seeking a declaration that the property is joint can also be pursued. If the counterparty proceeds with the sale and registration without including you, filing a criminal case could be considered, particularly if there is evidence of fraud or breach of trust. A well-documented memo reflecting a fair and balanced arrangement can be considered valid even without formal registration, provided it accurately represents the agreement and intentions of the parties involved. Therefore, your understanding is correct, i.e. a family arrangement recorded in writing and supported by clear evidence can be upheld, but if it involves creating new rights or significant changes, registration might be required to establish it formally.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In the said judgment, SC reiterated the observations of its earlier judgement that a MOFS prepared after family arrangement was already made for the purpose of recording the information or for the information of the court, is not required to be registered.Ajay SethiAdvocate, Mumbai98567 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi"

    "question": "Property law and family arrangement",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Filing a title suit for specific plots of the \"VY\" ancestral property is indeed a viable approach. This suit would help in establishing your share according to the family arrangement and could also request a halt on the sale of the property until the title is confirmed. Alternatively, seeking a declaration that the property is joint can also be pursued. If the counterparty proceeds with the sale and registration without including you, filing a criminal case could be considered, particularly if there is evidence of fraud or breach of trust. A well-documented memo reflecting a fair and balanced arrangement can be considered valid even without formal registration, provided it accurately represents the agreement and intentions of the parties involved. Therefore, your understanding is correct, i.e. a family arrangement recorded in writing and supported by clear evidence can be upheld, but if it involves creating new rights or significant changes, registration might be required to establish it formally.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Title deed lost from SBI",
    "answer": "Dear Sir/Madam,Thank you for your query regarding the retrieval of your property title deed from the State Bank of India (SBI) after the closure of your agricultural loan. Based on the information provided, I will provide an expert legal response to assist you in this matter.Under the Indian laws, when a borrower takes a loan from a bank and provides immovable property as security, the bank holds the original title deed of the property until the loan is fully repaid. Once the loan is closed, the bank is legally obligated to return the original title deed to the borrower.In your case, since you have closed the loan in 2013 and have not received the original title deed back from the bank, you have the following legal options:Send a Legal Notice: You can send a legal notice to the concerned SBI branch, demanding the return of your original title deed within a specified time frame (usually 15-30 days). The notice should clearly state the loan details, the date of closure, and the fact that you have not received the original title deed despite repeated requests.File a Consumer Complaint: If the bank fails to respond to the legal notice or does not return the title deed, you can file a consumer complaint against SBI before the appropriate District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Kerala. Banks are considered \"service providers\" under theConsumer Protection Act, and failure to return the title deed after loan closure can be considered a deficiency in service.Approach the Banking Ombudsman: You can also file a complaint with the Banking Ombudsman appointed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for your region. The Banking Ombudsman has the power to pass an order directing the bank to return the title deed or provide compensation.File a Civil Suit: If the above options do not yield a favorable result, you can file a civil suit against SBI in the appropriate court in Kerala, seeking the return of the original title deed or compensation for the loss/damage caused due to the bank's negligence.It is important to note that you should have proper documentation, such as the loan closure certificate, to support your claim. Additionally, you should keep records of all communications with the bank regarding the retrieval of the title deed.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighcourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "answer": "Dear Client.Send a formal letter to the bank's branch manager requesting a detailed explanation of the situation. In the letter, state that you did not collect the original title deed and that the bank has confirmed it cannot locate the document. Request that they acknowledge in writing that the title deed was lost while in their custody. If the branch does not resolve your issue, escalate the matter to the bank's regional office or the customer grievance redressal cell. Every bank, including SBI, has a specific process for handling customer complaints. If the bank fails to resolve the issue within 30 days, you can file a complaint with the Banking Ombudsman. You can file the complaint online, by email, or through a letter. If the above steps do not yield results, you may send a legal notice to the bank, demanding the return of your title deed or appropriate compensation for the loss of the original document. At the same time you can also apply for a duplicate title deed.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Tenant property theft liability",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In this situation, your liability as landlords for the loss of the old tenant's belongings largely depends on several factors, including the terms of the rental agreement, the specific promises made by your father, and the actions of the new tenants. Generally, landlords are not liable for the personal property of tenants unless there is a specific agreement or contract that provides for such a responsibility. In this case, if the new tenants were responsible for breaking into the trunk, they would be the primary parties liable for any theft. However, if your father made a verbal promise to the old tenant regarding the storage of his belongings, and if this promise was understood to be part of the rental arrangement, it could create a basis for a claim. To determine the validity of the old tenant's claim, you would need to verify what was in the trunk and assess the value of the items reported as stolen. To address the claim, consider collecting evidence of their value, investigating the genuineness of their claim and then offer resolution (if any).Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Redevelopment of society based on floor plan or physical existence",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Terrace Entitlement: If the terrace is part of the approved floor plan and you have paid stamp duty and registration fees for it, you have a legal claim to it. If the builder asserts that the terrace was illegally constructed, it is crucial to verify this claim with municipal records. However, since you have been paying stamp duty and registration, you may argue that you have legal possession. Obtain the approved building plan from the local municipal authority. This will clarify whether the terrace was legally constructed.Physical Existence vs. Floor Plan: During redevelopment, the original approved floor plan is usually the determining factor for entitlements, not just the physical existence of features.Measuring Apartment Square Footage: While it's not mandatory to appoint an architect specifically for measurement, accurate measurement of the property is essential to ensure you are being fairly compensated in the redevelopment process. You have the right to be fully informed about the redevelopment process, including the accurate size of your property.Transparency and Communication: Under the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960, the managing committee has a duty to keep members informed. There is no specific law mandating the maintenance of a website, but effective communication is a legal expectation. You can lodge a complaint with the Registrar of Societies if the society fails to maintain transparency or adequately inform members.Lack of Response to Legal Notice: If the society fails to respond to a legal notice, you can consider escalating the matter legally. You can file a complaint with the Registrar of Societies or approach the cooperative court. You may consider filing a civil suit for declaratory relief and/or damages, particularly if the builder or society refuses to honour your legal rights.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "As the members have already vacated the building and are without homes, it is but obvious that the builder will try to take advantage of that situationOrdinarily even if there are violations to the sanctioned building plans,  the builder usually agrees to accommodate since the society has an upper hand. If majority members have violated the building plans then in order to get majority consent for redevelopment,  the builder even goes to the extent of offering extra area over and above the eligibility of the members, from his free sale component. However that happens only when the members have not yet vacated their premisesIn your case the society and its members do not have that upper hand in the negotiations with the builderThough the builder is legally right that he is liable to give area in the new building considering the sanctioned building plans of old building , but this is always a matter of contract and agreement between the society and the builderJust by paying property tax and maintenance for the premises (which have been unauthorizedly expanded and extended) the extra areas do not get legitimized.Even slum dwellers pay property tax...so would it mean that their hutments are legal structures ?So in your case I would suggest to negotiate hard with the builder to make him provide also for the extra areas constructed or put up by the membersOfcourse all this is subject to project feasibilityIf due to giving area from the builder's sale component,  the project becomes inviable for him, then he would not show interestSo the interest of both the builder and society need to be balancedYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Dear client,I’m sorry to hear about the difficulties you’re facing. Let’s address your questions step by step.Steps to Register the Property in Your Father’s Name1. Verify the Will: Ensure that the will is legally valid and has been probated. Probate is the legal process through which a will is validated by the court.2. Gather Necessary Documents: Collect all required documents, including the will, death certificate of your grandfather, identity proofs, and any previous property registration documents.3. Legal Heir Certificate: Obtain a legal heir certificate if not already done. This certificate will list all the legal heirs of your grandfather.4. No Objection Certificate (NOC): Obtain NOCs from all legal heirs, including the children of the deceased brother and sister. This is crucial to avoid any future disputes.5. Approach the Sub-Registrar: Submit all the documents to the sub-registrar’s office for the registration process. The sub-registrar will verify the documents and proceed with the registration.Addressing the Demand for a Share• Negotiation: Try to negotiate with your father’s brother to resolve the issue amicably. Sometimes, a mutual agreement can be reached without legal intervention.• Legal Notice: If negotiation fails, consider sending a legal notice through your lawyer, stating that the demand for a share is unjustified and that you are prepared to take legal action if necessary.• Court Intervention: As a last resort, you can approach the court to enforce the will and compel the brother to sign the necessary documents.Signature of Deceased Uncle’s ChildrenYes, the signatures of the deceased uncle’s children are necessary. They are legal heirs and have a right to the property. Their consent is required to ensure that there are no future disputes regarding the property.Additional Steps• Consult a Lawyer: Given the complexities involved, it is advisable to consult a lawyer who specializes in property law. They can guide you through the process and help address any legal challenges.• Documentation: Keep all communications and documents well-organized. This will be helpful if the matter escalates to legal proceedings.Thank you.

    "question": "Property law and family arrangement",
    "answer": "Dear Client,As \"VY\" is ancestral property, underHindu Succession Act, 1956, it is co-parcenary property, meaning that all male members (including you and your brother) have an equal right to it by birth. However, your father's share is also ancestral, and he can distribute his share as he pleases during his lifetime. This means he can choose to go against the previous verbal or written family agreements unless those agreements are legally binding. Since there was a written plan similar to the \"CY\" plan that was verbally agreed upon, your father’s ability to alter the distribution depends on whether that plan was legally documented and agreed upon by all coparceners. If it was only verbal, it might be difficult to enforce it legally without strong supporting evidence. If your father decides not to honor the previous plan, the default legal rule would apply, potentially limiting your share to 1/3 of his share in the remaining ancestral property.Filing for an injunction to prevent the sale of \"VY\" property is a valid legal remedy. An injunction can temporarily halt the sale until the dispute is resolved. This would protect your interest while the case is ongoing. File a criminal breach of trust case in Pune if you have substantial evidence to support the claim that your family is dishonestly depriving you of your rightful share. Your lawyer’s advice against filing a partition suit is based on the fact that it would legally entitle your mother to a share, potentially reducing your portion to 1/4, as perHindu Succession Act, 1956. Filing a criminal case in Pune is feasible since all parties reside there, and it would be more convenient for you. If necessary, be prepared to move the case to the village court in Bihar, which may put additional pressure on the counterparty.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

In the said judgment, SC reiterated the observations of its earlier judgement that a MOFS prepared after family arrangement was already made for the purpose of recording the information or for the information of the court, is not required to be registered.Ajay SethiAdvocate, Mumbai98567 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi"

    "question": "Property law and family arrangement",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Filing a title suit for specific plots of the \"VY\" ancestral property is indeed a viable approach. This suit would help in establishing your share according to the family arrangement and could also request a halt on the sale of the property until the title is confirmed. Alternatively, seeking a declaration that the property is joint can also be pursued. If the counterparty proceeds with the sale and registration without including you, filing a criminal case could be considered, particularly if there is evidence of fraud or breach of trust. A well-documented memo reflecting a fair and balanced arrangement can be considered valid even without formal registration, provided it accurately represents the agreement and intentions of the parties involved. Therefore, your understanding is correct, i.e. a family arrangement recorded in writing and supported by clear evidence can be upheld, but if it involves creating new rights or significant changes, registration might be required to establish it formally.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Tenant property theft liability",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In this situation, your liability as landlords for the loss of the old tenant's belongings largely depends on several factors, including the terms of the rental agreement, the specific promises made by your father, and the actions of the new tenants. Generally, landlords are not liable for the personal property of tenants unless there is a specific agreement or contract that provides for such a responsibility. In this case, if the new tenants were responsible for breaking into the trunk, they would be the primary parties liable for any theft. However, if your father made a verbal promise to the old tenant regarding the storage of his belongings, and if this promise was understood to be part of the rental arrangement, it could create a basis for a claim. To determine the validity of the old tenant's claim, you would need to verify what was in the trunk and assess the value of the items reported as stolen. To address the claim, consider collecting evidence of their value, investigating the genuineness of their claim and then offer resolution (if any).Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

NRIs are generally defined under the Income Tax Act, 1961, based on their stay duration in India.No, under the current regulations, NRIs are not permitted to purchase agricultural land in Telangana, or in other states, unless they have specific permissions or exceptions under certain conditions. The general rule restricts NRIs from owning agricultural land in India.Building a farmhouse on agricultural land is subject to restrictions. Typically, agricultural land is meant for farming and cultivation, not for constructing commercial or residential buildings. Constructing a farmhouse with amenities like a swimming pool and opening it for public rental may violate agricultural land use regulations.Yes, if you intend to use the land for purposes other than agriculture, such as constructing a farmhouse with commercial elements, you will need to convert the land from agricultural to a non-agricultural (NALA) use. NALA stands for Non-Agricultural Land Acquisition, and this process is required to change the land use classification.For constructing a farmhouse intended for commercial use, such as renting out to the public, you would need to convert the land to a commercial use. The process involves, applying for conversion by providing supporting documents and obtaining approval.Agricultural lands are generally lower cost, have tax benefits, and no conversion is needed for farming activities. However, have limited resale value for non-farming purposes, and potential regulatory hurdles for land use changes. Whereas, Commercial lands have higher resale value, potential for income generation, and flexibility for various business uses but they also have Higher cost, increased regulatory scrutiny, and additional taxes as disadvantages.The time required for NALA conversion can vary depending on the state and specific circumstances. Generally, it can take several months to complete the conversion process, involving administrative review and approvals.Yes, it is possible to sell the land after NALA conversion. However, ensure that the conversion process is properly documented and approved by the authorities. You must follow all legal requirements, such as updating land records and complying with any specific state regulations regarding the sale of converted land.Yes, it is possible to convert a portion of the land to commercial use, provided you get the necessary approvals from local authorities.

    "answer": "Dear Sir,I understand your situation and the difficulties you are facing. Based on the information provided, I will try to guide you on the grounds for seeking divorce in India and the relevant legal provisions.Grounds for Divorce in India: Under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, which applies to Sikhs as well, the following grounds are available for seeking divorce:a) Adultery (Section 13(1)(i)): Although adultery has been decriminalized, it remains a valid ground for seeking divorce in India.b) Cruelty (Section 13(1)(ia)): The assault and harassment you faced from your wife can potentially be considered cruelty, which is a ground for divorce.c) Desertion (Section 13(1)(ib)): If your wife has deserted you for a continuous period of at least two years immediately preceding the presentation of the divorce petition, you can seek divorce on this ground.Evidence: You mentioned having call records from the telecom company and some recordings as evidence of your wife's adultery. These can be crucial pieces of evidence to support your divorce petition.Procedure: You can file a divorce petition in the appropriate Family Court or District Court in India, where your wife is currently residing or where the marriage was solemnized. The court will consider the evidence presented by both parties and decide on granting the divorce based on the merits of the case.Dowry Allegations: Regarding the false dowry allegations made by your wife, the closure of the case by the SSP office stating no dowry was demanded or given will work in your favor. You can present this order as evidence to counter any potential dowry-related claims made by your wife during the divorce proceedings.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighcourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "answer": "Contested Divorce on the Grounds of Mental Cruelty, Adultery, and Harassment: If you file for a contested divorce on the grounds of mental cruelty, adultery, and harassment of your parents, and you have substantial evidence to support your claims, your case can be quite strong. Mental cruelty and adultery are valid grounds for divorce under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955. However, the burden of proof lies on you to establish these grounds with clear and convincing evidence.The time frame for a contested divorce case can vary depending on the complexity of the case, the court's docket, and the cooperation of both parties. Generally, a contested divorce case in India can take anywhere from 24 months to 5 years or more, depending on the circumstances.Maintenance, Alimony, and Ancestral Property Rights: Yes, a contested divorce can lead to the court granting interim and permanent maintenance, as well as alimony, to the aggrieved spouse. The court considers various factors, such as the financial status of both parties, the standard of living during the marriage, and the ability of the spouse to support themselves.However, the right to ancestral property is governed by personal laws and may vary based on your religious affiliation. In general, a wife does not have an automatic right to her husband's ancestral property unless specified in a will or settlement.Making the Lover a Co-Respondent: For Hindu marriages governed by theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, there is no provision to implead a co-respondent.Validity of Police Report from Australia: Indian courts can consider crimes committed by Indian citizens in other countries as evidence in legal proceedings. However, the evidentiary value and admissibility of the police report from Australia will depend on factors such as the nature of the crime, the laws of the foreign country, and the court's discretion.Protection from Court upon Visiting India: If you are apprehensive about visiting India due to potential harassment or threats from your wife, you can seek protection from the court. You can file an application for an ex-parte order or an interim injunction restraining your wife from causing any harm or harassment to you during the pendency of the divorce proceedings.Risk of False Allegations or Cases: Even after filing for divorce in India, there is a risk that your wife may file false allegations or cases against you during the court proceedings. However, if you have substantial evidence to counter such allegations, the court is likely to dismiss them.For more legal assistance, you can contact me.Kindly give a 5 Star Rating if you are satisfied.Best Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighcourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Strength and Effectiveness of Your Case: Filing for divorce on the grounds of mental cruelty, adultery, and harassment of your parents can be a strong case, provided you have substantial evidence. Under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, mental cruelty and adultery are recognized grounds for divorce. While adultery is no longer a criminal offense in India, it still remains a valid ground for divorce. The duration of a contested divorce case can vary depending on the complexity of the case and the court's backlog.Interim and Permanent Maintenance, Alimony, and Property Rights: Yes, in a contested divorce, your wife can claim interim and permanent maintenance or alimony under Section 24 and Section 25 of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955. The court considers factors such as your income, her income, and the standard of living during the marriage. Under Hindu law, your wife has no right to your ancestral property. However, if you have children from the marriage, they may have a claim to ancestral property.Making Her Lover a Co-Respondent: You can make her alleged lover a co-respondent in the divorce petition, especially if you are claiming adultery as a ground for divorce.Validity of the Australian Police Report: The police report of her assault on you in Australia can be submitted as evidence in the Indian court. While Indian courts may not directly consider it a crime under Indian law, it will still be relevant in establishing a pattern of behaviour or mental cruelty.Protection from Court if You Visit India: You can seek protection from the court if you fear for your safety upon returning to India. Additionally, you can request the court to issue an order restraining your wife from filing any false complaints against you during your visit.Possibility of Fake Allegations After Filing for Divorce: Yes, even after filing for divorce, your wife can still file fake allegations or cases against you during the court proceedings. However, if such allegations arise, you can defend yourself legally by challenging the credibility of the claims. You can also file a petition for anticipatory bail to protect yourself from arrest in case of any false criminal cases being filed against you.It's crucial to work with a skilled family law attorney in India who can guide you through the legal procedures and help protect your rights.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Your understanding aligns with the guidelines outlined by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) regarding the determination of the creamy layer status under the Other Backward Classes (OBC) category. As per the DoPT guidelines, income from salaries and income from agricultural land are not to be included when calculating the total family income for determining the creamy layer status. The income/wealth test applies to individuals or families involved in trade, business, or professional activities. The threshold set is a gross annual income of ₹8 lakhs or more from sources other than salary and agricultural income. Since your mother’s business income of ₹4 lakhs annually is from a business, this income will be included in the assessment. In your case, the combined income from other should be assessed against the ₹8 lakhs threshold over three consecutive years to determine if your family falls under the creamy layer. For your situation, only your mother’s business income of ₹4 lakhs would be included in the calculation. Since this income is below the ₹8 lakh threshold, your family would likely not fall under the creamy layer, assuming the combined income from other sources (if any) also remains below ₹8 lakhs.

    "question": "Redevelopment of society based on floor plan or physical existence",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Terrace Entitlement: If the terrace is part of the approved floor plan and you have paid stamp duty and registration fees for it, you have a legal claim to it. If the builder asserts that the terrace was illegally constructed, it is crucial to verify this claim with municipal records. However, since you have been paying stamp duty and registration, you may argue that you have legal possession. Obtain the approved building plan from the local municipal authority. This will clarify whether the terrace was legally constructed.Physical Existence vs. Floor Plan: During redevelopment, the original approved floor plan is usually the determining factor for entitlements, not just the physical existence of features.Measuring Apartment Square Footage: While it's not mandatory to appoint an architect specifically for measurement, accurate measurement of the property is essential to ensure you are being fairly compensated in the redevelopment process. You have the right to be fully informed about the redevelopment process, including the accurate size of your property.Transparency and Communication: Under the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960, the managing committee has a duty to keep members informed. There is no specific law mandating the maintenance of a website, but effective communication is a legal expectation. You can lodge a complaint with the Registrar of Societies if the society fails to maintain transparency or adequately inform members.Lack of Response to Legal Notice: If the society fails to respond to a legal notice, you can consider escalating the matter legally. You can file a complaint with the Registrar of Societies or approach the cooperative court. You may consider filing a civil suit for declaratory relief and/or damages, particularly if the builder or society refuses to honour your legal rights.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "As the members have already vacated the building and are without homes, it is but obvious that the builder will try to take advantage of that situationOrdinarily even if there are violations to the sanctioned building plans,  the builder usually agrees to accommodate since the society has an upper hand. If majority members have violated the building plans then in order to get majority consent for redevelopment,  the builder even goes to the extent of offering extra area over and above the eligibility of the members, from his free sale component. However that happens only when the members have not yet vacated their premisesIn your case the society and its members do not have that upper hand in the negotiations with the builderThough the builder is legally right that he is liable to give area in the new building considering the sanctioned building plans of old building , but this is always a matter of contract and agreement between the society and the builderJust by paying property tax and maintenance for the premises (which have been unauthorizedly expanded and extended) the extra areas do not get legitimized.Even slum dwellers pay property tax...so would it mean that their hutments are legal structures ?So in your case I would suggest to negotiate hard with the builder to make him provide also for the extra areas constructed or put up by the membersOfcourse all this is subject to project feasibilityIf due to giving area from the builder's sale component,  the project becomes inviable for him, then he would not show interestSo the interest of both the builder and society need to be balancedYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Dear Client,If the society is not adhering to proper procedures or failing in its duties, you can file a complaint with the Registrar of Cooperative Societies under the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960. The Registrar can investigate the complaint and direct the society to act in accordance with the law. You can take legal action against the society and its managing committee if they are not performing their duties. This may include filing a suit for specific performance, injunction, or damages if the society or its officials are acting in bad faith or violating the rules.

This would involve filing a suit for breach of contract or misrepresentation in a civil court. If it is proven that the balcony or terrace was illegally constructed, you may face legal challenges including potential fines or the need to remove the illegal structure. Gather all relevant documents including the sale deed, previous correspondence, and any evidence supporting the legality of the balcony or terrace.

    "question": "Tenant property theft liability",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In this situation, your liability as landlords for the loss of the old tenant's belongings largely depends on several factors, including the terms of the rental agreement, the specific promises made by your father, and the actions of the new tenants. Generally, landlords are not liable for the personal property of tenants unless there is a specific agreement or contract that provides for such a responsibility. In this case, if the new tenants were responsible for breaking into the trunk, they would be the primary parties liable for any theft. However, if your father made a verbal promise to the old tenant regarding the storage of his belongings, and if this promise was understood to be part of the rental arrangement, it could create a basis for a claim. To determine the validity of the old tenant's claim, you would need to verify what was in the trunk and assess the value of the items reported as stolen. To address the claim, consider collecting evidence of their value, investigating the genuineness of their claim and then offer resolution (if any).Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,A Non-Resident Indian (NRI) is an Indian citizen who resides outside India for reasons such as employment, business, or other circumstances that indicate an intention to stay abroad for an extended period. NRIs are generally defined under the Income Tax Act, 1961, based on their stay duration in India.No, under the current regulations, NRIs are not permitted to purchase agricultural land in Telangana, or in other states, unless they have specific permissions or exceptions under certain conditions. The general rule restricts NRIs from owning agricultural land in India.Building a farmhouse on agricultural land is subject to restrictions. Typically, agricultural land is meant for farming and cultivation, not for constructing commercial or residential buildings. Constructing a farmhouse with amenities like a swimming pool and opening it for public rental may violate agricultural land use regulations.Yes, if you intend to use the land for purposes other than agriculture, such as constructing a farmhouse with commercial elements, you will need to convert the land from agricultural to a non-agricultural (NALA) use. NALA stands for Non-Agricultural Land Acquisition, and this process is required to change the land use classification.For constructing a farmhouse intended for commercial use, such as renting out to the public, you would need to convert the land to a commercial use. The process involves, applying for conversion by providing supporting documents and obtaining approval.Agricultural lands are generally lower cost, have tax benefits, and no conversion is needed for farming activities. However, have limited resale value for non-farming purposes, and potential regulatory hurdles for land use changes. Whereas, Commercial lands have higher resale value, potential for income generation, and flexibility for various business uses but they also have Higher cost, increased regulatory scrutiny, and additional taxes as disadvantages.The time required for NALA conversion can vary depending on the state and specific circumstances. Generally, it can take several months to complete the conversion process, involving administrative review and approvals.Yes, it is possible to sell the land after NALA conversion. However, ensure that the conversion process is properly documented and approved by the authorities. You must follow all legal requirements, such as updating land records and complying with any specific state regulations regarding the sale of converted land.Yes, it is possible to convert a portion of the land to commercial use, provided you get the necessary approvals from local authorities. The conversion of a small portion to commercial use while keeping the rest as agricultural land is feasible, but it requires clear documentation and adherence to zoning regulations. Ensure you obtain specific permissions for the mixed-use of the land and comply with the local planning guidelines.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "A known acquaintance committed a financial fraud and accused me of having an affair with his wife for personal gain",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,I understand that you have been through a very difficult and emotionally traumatic situation. Based on the details provided, it appears that there are multiple legal issues involved, and you may have grounds to take action against the family. However, before proceeding, it is crucial to gather all relevant evidence and documentation to support your claims.Firstly, regarding the financial aspect, since you have invested a substantial amount of money (₹15 lakhs) towards the purchase of the flat, you may have a claim for the recovery of that amount. If there was a written agreement or understanding regarding the investment and the promised care in return, it would strengthen your case. In the absence of a written agreement, you may still have a claim based on the principles of equity and unjust enrichment.Secondly, the allegations of defamation (libel and slander) made by the husband against you are serious offenses under the BNS. Defamation involves making false statements that harm the reputation of another person. If the husband has made such false statements about you having an affair with his wife, you may have grounds to file a criminal complaint for defamation under BNS.Thirdly, the emotional distress, stress, and depression caused by the family's actions may also give rise to a claim for compensation under the law of torts. You may be able to seek damages for the mental anguish and emotional harm suffered due to their actions.To proceed with legal action, I would recommend the following steps:Gather all relevant evidence and documentation, including any written agreements, communications (emails, text messages, etc.), and witness statements, if available.Consult with an experienced civil and criminal lawyer in your area to evaluate the strength of your case and the appropriate legal remedies available.For the recovery of the invested amount, you may file a civil suit in the appropriate court, seeking the return of the money along with interest and any other damages.For the defamation allegations, you may file a criminal complaint with the local police station, providing evidence of the false statements made by the husband.Regarding the emotional distress and mental anguish, you may include a claim for damages in the civil suit or file a separate suit for compensation under the law of torts.It is important to note that legal proceedings can be complex and time-consuming, and the outcome will depend on the strength of the evidence and the interpretation of the law by the courts.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay Highcourt.Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

Based on the information provided, I will try to guide you on the grounds for seeking divorce in India and the relevant legal provisions.Grounds for Divorce in India: Under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, which applies to Sikhs as well, the following grounds are available for seeking divorce:a) Adultery (Section 13(1)(i)): Although adultery has been decriminalized, it remains a valid ground for seeking divorce in India.b) Cruelty (Section 13(1)(ia)): The assault and harassment you faced from your wife can potentially be considered cruelty, which is a ground for divorce.c) Desertion (Section 13(1)(ib)): If your wife has deserted you for a continuous period of at least two years immediately preceding the presentation of the divorce petition, you can seek divorce on this ground.Evidence: You mentioned having call records from the telecom company and some recordings as evidence of your wife's adultery. These can be crucial pieces of evidence to support your divorce petition.Procedure: You can file a divorce petition in the appropriate Family Court or District Court in India, where your wife is currently residing or where the marriage was solemnized. The court will consider the evidence presented by both parties and decide on granting the divorce based on the merits of the case.Dowry Allegations: Regarding the false dowry allegations made by your wife, the closure of the case by the SSP office stating no dowry was demanded or given will work in your favor. You can present this order as evidence to counter any potential dowry-related claims made by your wife during the divorce proceedings.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighcourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "answer": "Contested Divorce on the Grounds of Mental Cruelty, Adultery, and Harassment: If you file for a contested divorce on the grounds of mental cruelty, adultery, and harassment of your parents, and you have substantial evidence to support your claims, your case can be quite strong. Mental cruelty and adultery are valid grounds for divorce under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955. However, the burden of proof lies on you to establish these grounds with clear and convincing evidence.The time frame for a contested divorce case can vary depending on the complexity of the case, the court's docket, and the cooperation of both parties. Generally, a contested divorce case in India can take anywhere from 24 months to 5 years or more, depending on the circumstances.Maintenance, Alimony, and Ancestral Property Rights: Yes, a contested divorce can lead to the court granting interim and permanent maintenance, as well as alimony, to the aggrieved spouse. The court considers various factors, such as the financial status of both parties, the standard of living during the marriage, and the ability of the spouse to support themselves.However, the right to ancestral property is governed by personal laws and may vary based on your religious affiliation. In general, a wife does not have an automatic right to her husband's ancestral property unless specified in a will or settlement.Making the Lover a Co-Respondent: For Hindu marriages governed by theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, there is no provision to implead a co-respondent.Validity of Police Report from Australia: Indian courts can consider crimes committed by Indian citizens in other countries as evidence in legal proceedings. However, the evidentiary value and admissibility of the police report from Australia will depend on factors such as the nature of the crime, the laws of the foreign country, and the court's discretion.Protection from Court upon Visiting India: If you are apprehensive about visiting India due to potential harassment or threats from your wife, you can seek protection from the court. You can file an application for an ex-parte order or an interim injunction restraining your wife from causing any harm or harassment to you during the pendency of the divorce proceedings.Risk of False Allegations or Cases: Even after filing for divorce in India, there is a risk that your wife may file false allegations or cases against you during the court proceedings. However, if you have substantial evidence to counter such allegations, the court is likely to dismiss them.For more legal assistance, you can contact me.Kindly give a 5 Star Rating if you are satisfied.Best Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighcourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Strength and Effectiveness of Your Case: Filing for divorce on the grounds of mental cruelty, adultery, and harassment of your parents can be a strong case, provided you have substantial evidence. Under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, mental cruelty and adultery are recognized grounds for divorce. While adultery is no longer a criminal offense in India, it still remains a valid ground for divorce. The duration of a contested divorce case can vary depending on the complexity of the case and the court's backlog.Interim and Permanent Maintenance, Alimony, and Property Rights: Yes, in a contested divorce, your wife can claim interim and permanent maintenance or alimony under Section 24 and Section 25 of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955. The court considers factors such as your income, her income, and the standard of living during the marriage. Under Hindu law, your wife has no right to your ancestral property. However, if you have children from the marriage, they may have a claim to ancestral property.Making Her Lover a Co-Respondent: You can make her alleged lover a co-respondent in the divorce petition, especially if you are claiming adultery as a ground for divorce.Validity of the Australian Police Report: The police report of her assault on you in Australia can be submitted as evidence in the Indian court. While Indian courts may not directly consider it a crime under Indian law, it will still be relevant in establishing a pattern of behaviour or mental cruelty.Protection from Court if You Visit India: You can seek protection from the court if you fear for your safety upon returning to India. Additionally, you can request the court to issue an order restraining your wife from filing any false complaints against you during your visit.Possibility of Fake Allegations After Filing for Divorce: Yes, even after filing for divorce, your wife can still file fake allegations or cases against you during the court proceedings. However, if such allegations arise, you can defend yourself legally by challenging the credibility of the claims. You can also file a petition for anticipatory bail to protect yourself from arrest in case of any false criminal cases being filed against you.It's crucial to work with a skilled family law attorney in India who can guide you through the legal procedures and help protect your rights.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Title deed lost from SBI",
    "answer": "Dear Sir/Madam,Thank you for your query regarding the retrieval of your property title deed from the State Bank of India (SBI) after the closure of your agricultural loan. Based on the information provided, I will provide an expert legal response to assist you in this matter.Under the Indian laws, when a borrower takes a loan from a bank and provides immovable property as security, the bank holds the original title deed of the property until the loan is fully repaid. Once the loan is closed, the bank is legally obligated to return the original title deed to the borrower.In your case, since you have closed the loan in 2013 and have not received the original title deed back from the bank, you have the following legal options:Send a Legal Notice: You can send a legal notice to the concerned SBI branch, demanding the return of your original title deed within a specified time frame (usually 15-30 days). The notice should clearly state the loan details, the date of closure, and the fact that you have not received the original title deed despite repeated requests.File a Consumer Complaint: If the bank fails to respond to the legal notice or does not return the title deed, you can file a consumer complaint against SBI before the appropriate District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Kerala. Banks are considered \"service providers\" under theConsumer Protection Act, and failure to return the title deed after loan closure can be considered a deficiency in service.Approach the Banking Ombudsman: You can also file a complaint with the Banking Ombudsman appointed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for your region. The Banking Ombudsman has the power to pass an order directing the bank to return the title deed or provide compensation.File a Civil Suit: If the above options do not yield a favorable result, you can file a civil suit against SBI in the appropriate court in Kerala, seeking the return of the original title deed or compensation for the loss/damage caused due to the bank's negligence.It is important to note that you should have proper documentation, such as the loan closure certificate, to support your claim. Additionally, you should keep records of all communications with the bank regarding the retrieval of the title deed.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighcourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

In the letter, state that you did not collect the original title deed and that the bank has confirmed it cannot locate the document. Request that they acknowledge in writing that the title deed was lost while in their custody. If the branch does not resolve your issue, escalate the matter to the bank's regional office or the customer grievance redressal cell. Every bank, including SBI, has a specific process for handling customer complaints. If the bank fails to resolve the issue within 30 days, you can file a complaint with the Banking Ombudsman. You can file the complaint online, by email, or through a letter. If the above steps do not yield results, you may send a legal notice to the bank, demanding the return of your title deed or appropriate compensation for the loss of the original document.

    "answer": "1. Assuming your flat is registered as an apartment and the apartment owners association is a registered body. If so, all occupants are owners. Thus, all of you own part of the land in the proportion of FSI consumed/used. Unless all of you agree and sign the agreement, redevelopment can not happen.2. As per earlier DCR, terraces were allowed free of FSI. In unified DCR that are implemented in entire Maharashtra except Mumbai, they have proposed ancillary FSI and terrace too is counted. Now, it will not be beneficial to give terraces and yiu will notice that terraces are not planned in new upcoming buildings.it may not work economically viable to give built up area same as terrace area in the proposed new building. All of you have to sit together and work out a compromise formula by coming couple of steps closer to each other.3. The redevelopment committee of the association will take care of it.4. It is not mandatory for the society create a website for such activities, besides the communication sent through whatsapp is also a voluntary service and cannot be claimed as a right, it is you who have to regularly follow up with the society to know the updates.5. If you are interested to escalate the matter through legal sources then you should have sent the legal notice by registered post and not through social media or whats app media.The legal notice sent by registered post will certainly invoke response failing which yo can sue the association for deficiency in serviceT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Redevelopment of society based on floor plan or physical existence",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Terrace Entitlement: If the terrace is part of the approved floor plan and you have paid stamp duty and registration fees for it, you have a legal claim to it. If the builder asserts that the terrace was illegally constructed, it is crucial to verify this claim with municipal records. However, since you have been paying stamp duty and registration, you may argue that you have legal possession. Obtain the approved building plan from the local municipal authority. This will clarify whether the terrace was legally constructed.Physical Existence vs. Floor Plan: During redevelopment, the original approved floor plan is usually the determining factor for entitlements, not just the physical existence of features.Measuring Apartment Square Footage: While it's not mandatory to appoint an architect specifically for measurement, accurate measurement of the property is essential to ensure you are being fairly compensated in the redevelopment process. You have the right to be fully informed about the redevelopment process, including the accurate size of your property.Transparency and Communication: Under the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960, the managing committee has a duty to keep members informed. There is no specific law mandating the maintenance of a website, but effective communication is a legal expectation. You can lodge a complaint with the Registrar of Societies if the society fails to maintain transparency or adequately inform members.Lack of Response to Legal Notice: If the society fails to respond to a legal notice, you can consider escalating the matter legally. You can file a complaint with the Registrar of Societies or approach the cooperative court. You may consider filing a civil suit for declaratory relief and/or damages, particularly if the builder or society refuses to honour your legal rights.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "As the members have already vacated the building and are without homes, it is but obvious that the builder will try to take advantage of that situationOrdinarily even if there are violations to the sanctioned building plans,  the builder usually agrees to accommodate since the society has an upper hand. If majority members have violated the building plans then in order to get majority consent for redevelopment,  the builder even goes to the extent of offering extra area over and above the eligibility of the members, from his free sale component. However that happens only when the members have not yet vacated their premisesIn your case the society and its members do not have that upper hand in the negotiations with the builderThough the builder is legally right that he is liable to give area in the new building considering the sanctioned building plans of old building , but this is always a matter of contract and agreement between the society and the builderJust by paying property tax and maintenance for the premises (which have been unauthorizedly expanded and extended) the extra areas do not get legitimized.Even slum dwellers pay property tax...so would it mean that their hutments are legal structures ?So in your case I would suggest to negotiate hard with the builder to make him provide also for the extra areas constructed or put up by the membersOfcourse all this is subject to project feasibilityIf due to giving area from the builder's sale component,  the project becomes inviable for him, then he would not show interestSo the interest of both the builder and society need to be balancedYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Based on the details provided, it appears that the matter has gone through various stages in the lower court and the High Court. The Supreme Court has also rejected the Special Leave Petition (SLP) filed against the High Court's order. Here's a legal analysis and advice on the way forward:The High Court's order directing the payment of Rs. 25,000/- per month as maintenance is binding and needs to be complied with, as the Supreme Court has declined to interfere with the order.The fact that the lower court case was dismissed for a period of 44 months due to non-appearance does not automatically absolve you from the maintenance obligation during that period. The High Court, while passing the order, was aware of the dismissal and still directed the payment of arrears.The High Court's order was passed ex-parte (without hearing you), which is a procedural irregularity. However, the Supreme Court's dismissal of the SLP implies that it did not find merit in challenging the High Court's order on this ground.You have the following options:a. File a Review Petition before the Supreme Court, highlighting any apparent error or mistake in the order rejecting the SLP. However, the chances of success in a Review Petition are generally low, as the Supreme Court is reluctant to review its orders unless there are exceptional circumstances.b. File a Curative Petition before the Supreme Court, which is the last judicial resort available. Curative Petitions are entertained in rare cases where there has been a violation of principles of natural justice or a gross miscarriage of justice. The threshold for admission of a Curative Petition is extremely high, and it is advisable to seek legal counsel before pursuing this option.c. Comply with the High Court's order and pay the arrears and the ongoing maintenance of Rs. 25,000/- per month. If there are genuine financial constraints, you can file an application before the High Court or the lower court, seeking a modification or reduction in the maintenance amount, citing your financial circumstances and any change in the circumstances of the parties.d. Explore the possibility of an out-of-court settlement or mediation with the opposite party, if feasible, to arrive at a mutually agreeable maintenance amount and resolve the matter amicably.It is important to note that non-compliance with the High Court's order may lead to contempt of court proceedings or other legal consequences.For more legal assistance, you can contact me.Kindly give a 5 Star Rating if you are satisfied.Best Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighcourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

As per the DoPT guidelines, income from salaries and income from agricultural land are not to be included when calculating the total family income for determining the creamy layer status. The income/wealth test applies to individuals or families involved in trade, business, or professional activities. The threshold set is a gross annual income of ₹8 lakhs or more from sources other than salary and agricultural income. Since your mother’s business income of ₹4 lakhs annually is from a business, this income will be included in the assessment. In your case, the combined income from other should be assessed against the ₹8 lakhs threshold over three consecutive years to determine if your family falls under the creamy layer. For your situation, only your mother’s business income of ₹4 lakhs would be included in the calculation. Since this income is below the ₹8 lakh threshold, your family would likely not fall under the creamy layer, assuming the combined income from other sources (if any) also remains below ₹8 lakhs.

These can be crucial pieces of evidence to support your divorce petition.Procedure: You can file a divorce petition in the appropriate Family Court or District Court in India, where your wife is currently residing or where the marriage was solemnized.

    "answer": "Contested Divorce on the Grounds of Mental Cruelty, Adultery, and Harassment: If you file for a contested divorce on the grounds of mental cruelty, adultery, and harassment of your parents, and you have substantial evidence to support your claims, your case can be quite strong. Mental cruelty and adultery are valid grounds for divorce under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955. However, the burden of proof lies on you to establish these grounds with clear and convincing evidence.The time frame for a contested divorce case can vary depending on the complexity of the case, the court's docket, and the cooperation of both parties. Generally, a contested divorce case in India can take anywhere from 24 months to 5 years or more, depending on the circumstances.Maintenance, Alimony, and Ancestral Property Rights: Yes, a contested divorce can lead to the court granting interim and permanent maintenance, as well as alimony, to the aggrieved spouse. The court considers various factors, such as the financial status of both parties, the standard of living during the marriage, and the ability of the spouse to support themselves.However, the right to ancestral property is governed by personal laws and may vary based on your religious affiliation. In general, a wife does not have an automatic right to her husband's ancestral property unless specified in a will or settlement.Making the Lover a Co-Respondent: For Hindu marriages governed by theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, there is no provision to implead a co-respondent.Validity of Police Report from Australia: Indian courts can consider crimes committed by Indian citizens in other countries as evidence in legal proceedings. However, the evidentiary value and admissibility of the police report from Australia will depend on factors such as the nature of the crime, the laws of the foreign country, and the court's discretion.Protection from Court upon Visiting India: If you are apprehensive about visiting India due to potential harassment or threats from your wife, you can seek protection from the court. You can file an application for an ex-parte order or an interim injunction restraining your wife from causing any harm or harassment to you during the pendency of the divorce proceedings.Risk of False Allegations or Cases: Even after filing for divorce in India, there is a risk that your wife may file false allegations or cases against you during the court proceedings. However, if you have substantial evidence to counter such allegations, the court is likely to dismiss them.For more legal assistance, you can contact me.Kindly give a 5 Star Rating if you are satisfied.Best Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighcourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Strength and Effectiveness of Your Case: Filing for divorce on the grounds of mental cruelty, adultery, and harassment of your parents can be a strong case, provided you have substantial evidence. Under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, mental cruelty and adultery are recognized grounds for divorce. While adultery is no longer a criminal offense in India, it still remains a valid ground for divorce. The duration of a contested divorce case can vary depending on the complexity of the case and the court's backlog.Interim and Permanent Maintenance, Alimony, and Property Rights: Yes, in a contested divorce, your wife can claim interim and permanent maintenance or alimony under Section 24 and Section 25 of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955. The court considers factors such as your income, her income, and the standard of living during the marriage. Under Hindu law, your wife has no right to your ancestral property. However, if you have children from the marriage, they may have a claim to ancestral property.Making Her Lover a Co-Respondent: You can make her alleged lover a co-respondent in the divorce petition, especially if you are claiming adultery as a ground for divorce.Validity of the Australian Police Report: The police report of her assault on you in Australia can be submitted as evidence in the Indian court. While Indian courts may not directly consider it a crime under Indian law, it will still be relevant in establishing a pattern of behaviour or mental cruelty.Protection from Court if You Visit India: You can seek protection from the court if you fear for your safety upon returning to India. Additionally, you can request the court to issue an order restraining your wife from filing any false complaints against you during your visit.Possibility of Fake Allegations After Filing for Divorce: Yes, even after filing for divorce, your wife can still file fake allegations or cases against you during the court proceedings. However, if such allegations arise, you can defend yourself legally by challenging the credibility of the claims. You can also file a petition for anticipatory bail to protect yourself from arrest in case of any false criminal cases being filed against you.It's crucial to work with a skilled family law attorney in India who can guide you through the legal procedures and help protect your rights.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If the foreign national gets remarried to another foreigner or an Indian, the existing OCI registration will be cancelled, and a fresh application will be required.Adultery as a Ground for Divorce in India:Adultery is still considered a ground for divorce in India, even though it is no longer a criminal offense.Under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, adultery is recognized as a valid reason for seeking divorceTo establish adultery as a ground, you need to prove:Voluntary sexual intercourse by your spouse with someone other than you.The act of adultery should have occurred after marriage.Your call records and recordings may serve as evidence to support your claim.Other Grounds for Divorce:Apart from adultery, there are other grounds for divorce under theHindu Marriage Act:Cruelty: If your spouse has treated you with cruelty, either physically or mentally.Desertion: If your spouse has abandoned you without reasonable cause for at least two years.Conversion: If your spouse has changed their religion.Unsoundness of Mind: If your spouse suffers from a mental disorder.Venereal Disease: If your spouse has a communicable venereal disease.Renunciation: If your spouse renounces the world by entering a religious order.Presumption of Death: If your spouse has been missing for seven years or more.Irretrievable Breakdown: It implies that a marriage has irreparably broken down, making it impossible for the couple to live together harmoniously.Dowry Allegations:The false dowry allegations made by your wife may not directly impact the grounds for divorce.However, it’s essential to address these allegations properly during legal proceedings.Ravi SinghAdvocate, Ranchi2 AnswersTalk to Advocate Ravi Singh"

    "question": "HC passed arbitrary order u/s/ 482, how to challenge",
    "answer": "Based on the details provided, it appears that the matter has gone through various stages in the lower court and the High Court. The Supreme Court has also rejected the Special Leave Petition (SLP) filed against the High Court's order. Here's a legal analysis and advice on the way forward:The High Court's order directing the payment of Rs. 25,000/- per month as maintenance is binding and needs to be complied with, as the Supreme Court has declined to interfere with the order.The fact that the lower court case was dismissed for a period of 44 months due to non-appearance does not automatically absolve you from the maintenance obligation during that period. The High Court, while passing the order, was aware of the dismissal and still directed the payment of arrears.The High Court's order was passed ex-parte (without hearing you), which is a procedural irregularity. However, the Supreme Court's dismissal of the SLP implies that it did not find merit in challenging the High Court's order on this ground.You have the following options:a. File a Review Petition before the Supreme Court, highlighting any apparent error or mistake in the order rejecting the SLP. However, the chances of success in a Review Petition are generally low, as the Supreme Court is reluctant to review its orders unless there are exceptional circumstances.b. File a Curative Petition before the Supreme Court, which is the last judicial resort available. Curative Petitions are entertained in rare cases where there has been a violation of principles of natural justice or a gross miscarriage of justice. The threshold for admission of a Curative Petition is extremely high, and it is advisable to seek legal counsel before pursuing this option.c.

    "answer": "Dear Client,According to the guidelines issued by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), income from salary is not included when calculating the total family income for backward class status. Therefore, your father's salary of ₹6 lakhs will not be considered in the income assessment. Similarly, income derived from agriculture is excluded from the total income calculation. If your family has agricultural income, it will not impact the assessment. Business income is considered in the total income calculation. Since your mother’s business generates ₹4 lakhs annually, this amount will be included in the assessment. For backward class benefits, the total family income should generally be less than ₹8 lakhs per annum. This means the combined income from all sources must not exceed this threshold. The income is assessed based on the most recent financial year. If your family’s income exceeds ₹8 lakhs in any single year, it may affect eligibility.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Eligibility for OBC NCL reservation",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Your understanding aligns with the guidelines outlined by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) regarding the determination of the creamy layer status under the Other Backward Classes (OBC) category. As per the DoPT guidelines, income from salaries and income from agricultural land are not to be included when calculating the total family income for determining the creamy layer status. The income/wealth test applies to individuals or families involved in trade, business, or professional activities. The threshold set is a gross annual income of ₹8 lakhs or more from sources other than salary and agricultural income. Since your mother’s business income of ₹4 lakhs annually is from a business, this income will be included in the assessment. In your case, the combined income from other should be assessed against the ₹8 lakhs threshold over three consecutive years to determine if your family falls under the creamy layer. For your situation, only your mother’s business income of ₹4 lakhs would be included in the calculation. Since this income is below the ₹8 lakh threshold, your family would likely not fall under the creamy layer, assuming the combined income from other sources (if any) also remains below ₹8 lakhs. Thus, you are likely eligible for OBC non-creamy layer benefits.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The DoPT's Office Memorandum  stipulates that the assessment of income for determining the creamy layer status is based on the income over the last three consecutive financial years. Since you have mentioned that the combined income for FY 2021-22 is less than ₹8 lakhs, the key factor will be the income in the other two financial years. If the combined income in any one of the previous three financial years exceeds ₹8 lakhs, the family will fall under the creamy layer for that period.

Based on the information provided, I will try to guide you on the grounds for seeking divorce in India and the relevant legal provisions.Grounds for Divorce in India: Under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, which applies to Sikhs as well, the following grounds are available for seeking divorce:a) Adultery (Section 13(1)(i)): Although adultery has been decriminalized, it remains a valid ground for seeking divorce in India.b) Cruelty (Section 13(1)(ia)): The assault and harassment you faced from your wife can potentially be considered cruelty, which is a ground for divorce.c) Desertion (Section 13(1)(ib)): If your wife has deserted you for a continuous period of at least two years immediately preceding the presentation of the divorce petition, you can seek divorce on this ground.Evidence: You mentioned having call records from the telecom company and some recordings as evidence of your wife's adultery. These can be crucial pieces of evidence to support your divorce petition.Procedure: You can file a divorce petition in the appropriate Family Court or District Court in India, where your wife is currently residing or where the marriage was solemnized. The court will consider the evidence presented by both parties and decide on granting the divorce based on the merits of the case.Dowry Allegations: Regarding the false dowry allegations made by your wife, the closure of the case by the SSP office stating no dowry was demanded or given will work in your favor. You can present this order as evidence to counter any potential dowry-related claims made by your wife during the divorce proceedings.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighcourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "answer": "Contested Divorce on the Grounds of Mental Cruelty, Adultery, and Harassment: If you file for a contested divorce on the grounds of mental cruelty, adultery, and harassment of your parents, and you have substantial evidence to support your claims, your case can be quite strong. Mental cruelty and adultery are valid grounds for divorce under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955. However, the burden of proof lies on you to establish these grounds with clear and convincing evidence.The time frame for a contested divorce case can vary depending on the complexity of the case, the court's docket, and the cooperation of both parties. Generally, a contested divorce case in India can take anywhere from 24 months to 5 years or more, depending on the circumstances.Maintenance, Alimony, and Ancestral Property Rights: Yes, a contested divorce can lead to the court granting interim and permanent maintenance, as well as alimony, to the aggrieved spouse. The court considers various factors, such as the financial status of both parties, the standard of living during the marriage, and the ability of the spouse to support themselves.However, the right to ancestral property is governed by personal laws and may vary based on your religious affiliation. In general, a wife does not have an automatic right to her husband's ancestral property unless specified in a will or settlement.Making the Lover a Co-Respondent: For Hindu marriages governed by theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, there is no provision to implead a co-respondent.Validity of Police Report from Australia: Indian courts can consider crimes committed by Indian citizens in other countries as evidence in legal proceedings. However, the evidentiary value and admissibility of the police report from Australia will depend on factors such as the nature of the crime, the laws of the foreign country, and the court's discretion.Protection from Court upon Visiting India: If you are apprehensive about visiting India due to potential harassment or threats from your wife, you can seek protection from the court. You can file an application for an ex-parte order or an interim injunction restraining your wife from causing any harm or harassment to you during the pendency of the divorce proceedings.Risk of False Allegations or Cases: Even after filing for divorce in India, there is a risk that your wife may file false allegations or cases against you during the court proceedings. However, if you have substantial evidence to counter such allegations, the court is likely to dismiss them.For more legal assistance, you can contact me.Kindly give a 5 Star Rating if you are satisfied.Best Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighcourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "question": "HC passed arbitrary order u/s/ 482, how to challenge",
    "answer": "Dear Client,You can file a review petition in the High Court. In this petition, you can argue that the HC's ex parte order was passed without giving you an opportunity to be heard, which violates your right to a fair hearing. If there was a genuine misunderstanding or non-communication of facts in the HC, you can file an application for rectification or clarification of the HC’s order. This should be based on the fact that you continued to pay ₹15,000/month during the live period of the case and only missed payments after the case was dismissed, which should not be considered a default. Gather all evidence of payments made during the live period of the case, including any bank statements or receipts, to strengthen your case. If the opposite party seeks to execute the HC order for ₹25,000/month, be prepared to defend against it.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "HC passed arbitrary order u/s/ 482, how to challenge",
    "answer": "Based on the details provided, it appears that the matter has gone through various stages in the lower court and the High Court. The Supreme Court has also rejected the Special Leave Petition (SLP) filed against the High Court's order. Here's a legal analysis and advice on the way forward:The High Court's order directing the payment of Rs. 25,000/- per month as maintenance is binding and needs to be complied with, as the Supreme Court has declined to interfere with the order.The fact that the lower court case was dismissed for a period of 44 months due to non-appearance does not automatically absolve you from the maintenance obligation during that period. The High Court, while passing the order, was aware of the dismissal and still directed the payment of arrears.The High Court's order was passed ex-parte (without hearing you), which is a procedural irregularity. However, the Supreme Court's dismissal of the SLP implies that it did not find merit in challenging the High Court's order on this ground.You have the following options:a. File a Review Petition before the Supreme Court, highlighting any apparent error or mistake in the order rejecting the SLP. However, the chances of success in a Review Petition are generally low, as the Supreme Court is reluctant to review its orders unless there are exceptional circumstances.b. File a Curative Petition before the Supreme Court, which is the last judicial resort available. Curative Petitions are entertained in rare cases where there has been a violation of principles of natural justice or a gross miscarriage of justice. The threshold for admission of a Curative Petition is extremely high, and it is advisable to seek legal counsel before pursuing this option.c. Comply with the High Court's order and pay the arrears and the ongoing maintenance of Rs. 25,000/- per month. If there are genuine financial constraints, you can file an application before the High Court or the lower court, seeking a modification or reduction in the maintenance amount, citing your financial circumstances and any change in the circumstances of the parties.d. Explore the possibility of an out-of-court settlement or mediation with the opposite party, if feasible, to arrive at a mutually agreeable maintenance amount and resolve the matter amicably.It is important to note that non-compliance with the High Court's order may lead to contempt of court proceedings or other legal consequences.For more legal assistance, you can contact me.Kindly give a 5 Star Rating if you are satisfied.Best Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighcourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "question": "Predeceased son - Hindu female",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Laws are presumed to apply prospectively unless there is clear language indicating that they should apply retrospectively. This is particularly true in matters of succession, where the rights of heirs typically vest at the time of the decedent’s death. This amendment does not explicitly state that it applies retrospectively. As such, it would normally apply prospectively to cases of succession occurring after the amendment came into force. At the time of your grandmother’s death in 2014, the amendment had not yet been enacted. Therefore, the devolution of her property would be governed by the laws in effect at that time, which did not include the 2016 amendment. Under the pre-amendment law, the property would typically go to her own heirs, which may include her other children, and not necessarily revert back to the heirs of her predeceased son. The 2005 amendment to theHindu Succession Actwas interpreted by the courts to apply retroactively because it dealt with a daughter’s birthright to coparcenary property. This was a fundamental change recognizing the equal status of daughters. Kerala Amendment (2016), however, deals with the succession of property inherited by a female Hindu from her predeceased son. This does not relate to birthrights but to the specific circumstances of inheritance.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "A known acquaintance committed a financial fraud and accused me of having an affair with his wife for personal gain",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,I understand that you have been through a very difficult and emotionally traumatic situation. Based on the details provided, it appears that there are multiple legal issues involved, and you may have grounds to take action against the family. However, before proceeding, it is crucial to gather all relevant evidence and documentation to support your claims.Firstly, regarding the financial aspect, since you have invested a substantial amount of money (₹15 lakhs) towards the purchase of the flat, you may have a claim for the recovery of that amount. If there was a written agreement or understanding regarding the investment and the promised care in return, it would strengthen your case. In the absence of a written agreement, you may still have a claim based on the principles of equity and unjust enrichment.Secondly, the allegations of defamation (libel and slander) made by the husband against you are serious offenses under the BNS. Defamation involves making false statements that harm the reputation of another person. If the husband has made such false statements about you having an affair with his wife, you may have grounds to file a criminal complaint for defamation under BNS.Thirdly, the emotional distress, stress, and depression caused by the family's actions may also give rise to a claim for compensation under the law of torts. You may be able to seek damages for the mental anguish and emotional harm suffered due to their actions.To proceed with legal action, I would recommend the following steps:Gather all relevant evidence and documentation, including any written agreements, communications (emails, text messages, etc.), and witness statements, if available.Consult with an experienced civil and criminal lawyer in your area to evaluate the strength of your case and the appropriate legal remedies available.For the recovery of the invested amount, you may file a civil suit in the appropriate court, seeking the return of the money along with interest and any other damages.For the defamation allegations, you may file a criminal complaint with the local police station, providing evidence of the false statements made by the husband.Regarding the emotional distress and mental anguish, you may include a claim for damages in the civil suit or file a separate suit for compensation under the law of torts.It is important to note that legal proceedings can be complex and time-consuming, and the outcome will depend on the strength of the evidence and the interpretation of the law by the courts.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay Highcourt.Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "answer": "Dear Sir,I understand your situation and the difficulties you are facing. Based on the information provided, I will try to guide you on the grounds for seeking divorce in India and the relevant legal provisions.Grounds for Divorce in India: Under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, which applies to Sikhs as well, the following grounds are available for seeking divorce:a) Adultery (Section 13(1)(i)): Although adultery has been decriminalized, it remains a valid ground for seeking divorce in India.b) Cruelty (Section 13(1)(ia)): The assault and harassment you faced from your wife can potentially be considered cruelty, which is a ground for divorce.c) Desertion (Section 13(1)(ib)): If your wife has deserted you for a continuous period of at least two years immediately preceding the presentation of the divorce petition, you can seek divorce on this ground.Evidence: You mentioned having call records from the telecom company and some recordings as evidence of your wife's adultery. These can be crucial pieces of evidence to support your divorce petition.Procedure: You can file a divorce petition in the appropriate Family Court or District Court in India, where your wife is currently residing or where the marriage was solemnized. The court will consider the evidence presented by both parties and decide on granting the divorce based on the merits of the case.Dowry Allegations: Regarding the false dowry allegations made by your wife, the closure of the case by the SSP office stating no dowry was demanded or given will work in your favor.

    "answer": "Contested Divorce on the Grounds of Mental Cruelty, Adultery, and Harassment: If you file for a contested divorce on the grounds of mental cruelty, adultery, and harassment of your parents, and you have substantial evidence to support your claims, your case can be quite strong. Mental cruelty and adultery are valid grounds for divorce under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955. However, the burden of proof lies on you to establish these grounds with clear and convincing evidence.The time frame for a contested divorce case can vary depending on the complexity of the case, the court's docket, and the cooperation of both parties. Generally, a contested divorce case in India can take anywhere from 24 months to 5 years or more, depending on the circumstances.Maintenance, Alimony, and Ancestral Property Rights: Yes, a contested divorce can lead to the court granting interim and permanent maintenance, as well as alimony, to the aggrieved spouse. The court considers various factors, such as the financial status of both parties, the standard of living during the marriage, and the ability of the spouse to support themselves.However, the right to ancestral property is governed by personal laws and may vary based on your religious affiliation. In general, a wife does not have an automatic right to her husband's ancestral property unless specified in a will or settlement.Making the Lover a Co-Respondent: For Hindu marriages governed by theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, there is no provision to implead a co-respondent.Validity of Police Report from Australia: Indian courts can consider crimes committed by Indian citizens in other countries as evidence in legal proceedings. However, the evidentiary value and admissibility of the police report from Australia will depend on factors such as the nature of the crime, the laws of the foreign country, and the court's discretion.Protection from Court upon Visiting India: If you are apprehensive about visiting India due to potential harassment or threats from your wife, you can seek protection from the court. You can file an application for an ex-parte order or an interim injunction restraining your wife from causing any harm or harassment to you during the pendency of the divorce proceedings.Risk of False Allegations or Cases: Even after filing for divorce in India, there is a risk that your wife may file false allegations or cases against you during the court proceedings. However, if you have substantial evidence to counter such allegations, the court is likely to dismiss them.For more legal assistance, you can contact me.Kindly give a 5 Star Rating if you are satisfied.Best Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighcourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

Additionally, you can request the court to issue an order restraining your wife from filing any false complaints against you during your visit.Possibility of Fake Allegations After Filing for Divorce: Yes, even after filing for divorce, your wife can still file fake allegations or cases against you during the court proceedings.

    "answer": "Dear Client,It is possible to sue for divorce despite there being adomestic violencecase against you, however the ongoing case will impact on the divorce process. This is because, you can use evidence of your wife’s alleged adultery and the mental harassment as your defence as long as the evidence is relevant in court. Under the PWDVA, if the court finds her allegations ofdomestic violencetrue, you may be ordered to pay the maintenance and compensation she sought. It is also important to note that there is a possibility that your family members may have some risk if a court imposes protection or restraining orders on them since the violation of those orders will result in legal repercussions. The above complications state that it is essential to consult with a lawyer in order to get proper information and build a proper defence. The laws that apply to this case include section 18 the PWDVA on protection orders, section 20 on monetary relief, and section 23 on interim orders.Hope you find this answer satisfactory.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Predeceased son - Hindu female",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Laws are presumed to apply prospectively unless there is clear language indicating that they should apply retrospectively. This is particularly true in matters of succession, where the rights of heirs typically vest at the time of the decedent’s death. This amendment does not explicitly state that it applies retrospectively. As such, it would normally apply prospectively to cases of succession occurring after the amendment came into force. At the time of your grandmother’s death in 2014, the amendment had not yet been enacted. Therefore, the devolution of her property would be governed by the laws in effect at that time, which did not include the 2016 amendment. Under the pre-amendment law, the property would typically go to her own heirs, which may include her other children, and not necessarily revert back to the heirs of her predeceased son. The 2005 amendment to theHindu Succession Actwas interpreted by the courts to apply retroactively because it dealt with a daughter’s birthright to coparcenary property. This was a fundamental change recognizing the equal status of daughters. Kerala Amendment (2016), however, deals with the succession of property inherited by a female Hindu from her predeceased son. This does not relate to birthrights but to the specific circumstances of inheritance.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Eligibility for OBC NCL reservation",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Your understanding aligns with the guidelines outlined by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) regarding the determination of the creamy layer status under the Other Backward Classes (OBC) category. As per the DoPT guidelines, income from salaries and income from agricultural land are not to be included when calculating the total family income for determining the creamy layer status. The income/wealth test applies to individuals or families involved in trade, business, or professional activities. The threshold set is a gross annual income of ₹8 lakhs or more from sources other than salary and agricultural income. Since your mother’s business income of ₹4 lakhs annually is from a business, this income will be included in the assessment. In your case, the combined income from other should be assessed against the ₹8 lakhs threshold over three consecutive years to determine if your family falls under the creamy layer. For your situation, only your mother’s business income of ₹4 lakhs would be included in the calculation. Since this income is below the ₹8 lakh threshold, your family would likely not fall under the creamy layer, assuming the combined income from other sources (if any) also remains below ₹8 lakhs. Thus, you are likely eligible for OBC non-creamy layer benefits.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The DoPT's Office Memorandum  stipulates that the assessment of income for determining the creamy layer status is based on the income over the last three consecutive financial years. Since you have mentioned that the combined income for FY 2021-22 is less than ₹8 lakhs, the key factor will be the income in the other two financial years.

    "question": "HC passed arbitrary order u/s/ 482, how to challenge",
    "answer": "Based on the details provided, it appears that the matter has gone through various stages in the lower court and the High Court. The Supreme Court has also rejected the Special Leave Petition (SLP) filed against the High Court's order. Here's a legal analysis and advice on the way forward:The High Court's order directing the payment of Rs. 25,000/- per month as maintenance is binding and needs to be complied with, as the Supreme Court has declined to interfere with the order.The fact that the lower court case was dismissed for a period of 44 months due to non-appearance does not automatically absolve you from the maintenance obligation during that period. The High Court, while passing the order, was aware of the dismissal and still directed the payment of arrears.The High Court's order was passed ex-parte (without hearing you), which is a procedural irregularity. However, the Supreme Court's dismissal of the SLP implies that it did not find merit in challenging the High Court's order on this ground.You have the following options:a. File a Review Petition before the Supreme Court, highlighting any apparent error or mistake in the order rejecting the SLP. However, the chances of success in a Review Petition are generally low, as the Supreme Court is reluctant to review its orders unless there are exceptional circumstances.b. File a Curative Petition before the Supreme Court, which is the last judicial resort available. Curative Petitions are entertained in rare cases where there has been a violation of principles of natural justice or a gross miscarriage of justice. The threshold for admission of a Curative Petition is extremely high, and it is advisable to seek legal counsel before pursuing this option.c. Comply with the High Court's order and pay the arrears and the ongoing maintenance of Rs. 25,000/- per month. If there are genuine financial constraints, you can file an application before the High Court or the lower court, seeking a modification or reduction in the maintenance amount, citing your financial circumstances and any change in the circumstances of the parties.d. Explore the possibility of an out-of-court settlement or mediation with the opposite party, if feasible, to arrive at a mutually agreeable maintenance amount and resolve the matter amicably.It is important to note that non-compliance with the High Court's order may lead to contempt of court proceedings or other legal consequences.For more legal assistance, you can contact me.Kindly give a 5 Star Rating if you are satisfied.Best Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighcourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "question": "A known acquaintance committed a financial fraud and accused me of having an affair with his wife for personal gain",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,I understand that you have been through a very difficult and emotionally traumatic situation. Based on the details provided, it appears that there are multiple legal issues involved, and you may have grounds to take action against the family. However, before proceeding, it is crucial to gather all relevant evidence and documentation to support your claims.Firstly, regarding the financial aspect, since you have invested a substantial amount of money (₹15 lakhs) towards the purchase of the flat, you may have a claim for the recovery of that amount. If there was a written agreement or understanding regarding the investment and the promised care in return, it would strengthen your case. In the absence of a written agreement, you may still have a claim based on the principles of equity and unjust enrichment.Secondly, the allegations of defamation (libel and slander) made by the husband against you are serious offenses under the BNS. Defamation involves making false statements that harm the reputation of another person. If the husband has made such false statements about you having an affair with his wife, you may have grounds to file a criminal complaint for defamation under BNS.Thirdly, the emotional distress, stress, and depression caused by the family's actions may also give rise to a claim for compensation under the law of torts. You may be able to seek damages for the mental anguish and emotional harm suffered due to their actions.To proceed with legal action, I would recommend the following steps:Gather all relevant evidence and documentation, including any written agreements, communications (emails, text messages, etc.), and witness statements, if available.Consult with an experienced civil and criminal lawyer in your area to evaluate the strength of your case and the appropriate legal remedies available.For the recovery of the invested amount, you may file a civil suit in the appropriate court, seeking the return of the money along with interest and any other damages.For the defamation allegations, you may file a criminal complaint with the local police station, providing evidence of the false statements made by the husband.Regarding the emotional distress and mental anguish, you may include a claim for damages in the civil suit or file a separate suit for compensation under the law of torts.It is important to note that legal proceedings can be complex and time-consuming, and the outcome will depend on the strength of the evidence and the interpretation of the law by the courts.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay Highcourt.Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

These can be crucial pieces of evidence to support your divorce petition.Procedure: You can file a divorce petition in the appropriate Family Court or District Court in India, where your wife is currently residing or where the marriage was solemnized. The court will consider the evidence presented by both parties and decide on granting the divorce based on the merits of the case.Dowry Allegations: Regarding the false dowry allegations made by your wife, the closure of the case by the SSP office stating no dowry was demanded or given will work in your favor.

    "answer": "Contested Divorce on the Grounds of Mental Cruelty, Adultery, and Harassment: If you file for a contested divorce on the grounds of mental cruelty, adultery, and harassment of your parents, and you have substantial evidence to support your claims, your case can be quite strong. Mental cruelty and adultery are valid grounds for divorce under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955. However, the burden of proof lies on you to establish these grounds with clear and convincing evidence.The time frame for a contested divorce case can vary depending on the complexity of the case, the court's docket, and the cooperation of both parties. Generally, a contested divorce case in India can take anywhere from 24 months to 5 years or more, depending on the circumstances.Maintenance, Alimony, and Ancestral Property Rights: Yes, a contested divorce can lead to the court granting interim and permanent maintenance, as well as alimony, to the aggrieved spouse. The court considers various factors, such as the financial status of both parties, the standard of living during the marriage, and the ability of the spouse to support themselves.However, the right to ancestral property is governed by personal laws and may vary based on your religious affiliation. In general, a wife does not have an automatic right to her husband's ancestral property unless specified in a will or settlement.Making the Lover a Co-Respondent: For Hindu marriages governed by theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, there is no provision to implead a co-respondent.Validity of Police Report from Australia: Indian courts can consider crimes committed by Indian citizens in other countries as evidence in legal proceedings. However, the evidentiary value and admissibility of the police report from Australia will depend on factors such as the nature of the crime, the laws of the foreign country, and the court's discretion.Protection from Court upon Visiting India: If you are apprehensive about visiting India due to potential harassment or threats from your wife, you can seek protection from the court. You can file an application for an ex-parte order or an interim injunction restraining your wife from causing any harm or harassment to you during the pendency of the divorce proceedings.Risk of False Allegations or Cases: Even after filing for divorce in India, there is a risk that your wife may file false allegations or cases against you during the court proceedings. However, if you have substantial evidence to counter such allegations, the court is likely to dismiss them.For more legal assistance, you can contact me.Kindly give a 5 Star Rating if you are satisfied.Best Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighcourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Strength and Effectiveness of Your Case: Filing for divorce on the grounds of mental cruelty, adultery, and harassment of your parents can be a strong case, provided you have substantial evidence. Under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, mental cruelty and adultery are recognized grounds for divorce. While adultery is no longer a criminal offense in India, it still remains a valid ground for divorce. The duration of a contested divorce case can vary depending on the complexity of the case and the court's backlog.Interim and Permanent Maintenance, Alimony, and Property Rights: Yes, in a contested divorce, your wife can claim interim and permanent maintenance or alimony under Section 24 and Section 25 of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955. The court considers factors such as your income, her income, and the standard of living during the marriage. Under Hindu law, your wife has no right to your ancestral property. However, if you have children from the marriage, they may have a claim to ancestral property.Making Her Lover a Co-Respondent: You can make her alleged lover a co-respondent in the divorce petition, especially if you are claiming adultery as a ground for divorce.Validity of the Australian Police Report: The police report of her assault on you in Australia can be submitted as evidence in the Indian court. While Indian courts may not directly consider it a crime under Indian law, it will still be relevant in establishing a pattern of behaviour or mental cruelty.Protection from Court if You Visit India: You can seek protection from the court if you fear for your safety upon returning to India. Additionally, you can request the court to issue an order restraining your wife from filing any false complaints against you during your visit.Possibility of Fake Allegations After Filing for Divorce: Yes, even after filing for divorce, your wife can still file fake allegations or cases against you during the court proceedings. However, if such allegations arise, you can defend yourself legally by challenging the credibility of the claims. You can also file a petition for anticipatory bail to protect yourself from arrest in case of any false criminal cases being filed against you.It's crucial to work with a skilled family law attorney in India who can guide you through the legal procedures and help protect your rights.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Your understanding aligns with the guidelines outlined by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) regarding the determination of the creamy layer status under the Other Backward Classes (OBC) category. As per the DoPT guidelines, income from salaries and income from agricultural land are not to be included when calculating the total family income for determining the creamy layer status. The income/wealth test applies to individuals or families involved in trade, business, or professional activities. The threshold set is a gross annual income of ₹8 lakhs or more from sources other than salary and agricultural income. Since your mother’s business income of ₹4 lakhs annually is from a business, this income will be included in the assessment. In your case, the combined income from other should be assessed against the ₹8 lakhs threshold over three consecutive years to determine if your family falls under the creamy layer. For your situation, only your mother’s business income of ₹4 lakhs would be included in the calculation. Since this income is below the ₹8 lakh threshold, your family would likely not fall under the creamy layer, assuming the combined income from other sources (if any) also remains below ₹8 lakhs.

    "question": "Title deed lost from SBI",
    "answer": "Dear Sir/Madam,Thank you for your query regarding the retrieval of your property title deed from the State Bank of India (SBI) after the closure of your agricultural loan. Based on the information provided, I will provide an expert legal response to assist you in this matter.Under the Indian laws, when a borrower takes a loan from a bank and provides immovable property as security, the bank holds the original title deed of the property until the loan is fully repaid. Once the loan is closed, the bank is legally obligated to return the original title deed to the borrower.In your case, since you have closed the loan in 2013 and have not received the original title deed back from the bank, you have the following legal options:Send a Legal Notice: You can send a legal notice to the concerned SBI branch, demanding the return of your original title deed within a specified time frame (usually 15-30 days). The notice should clearly state the loan details, the date of closure, and the fact that you have not received the original title deed despite repeated requests.File a Consumer Complaint: If the bank fails to respond to the legal notice or does not return the title deed, you can file a consumer complaint against SBI before the appropriate District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Kerala. Banks are considered \"service providers\" under theConsumer Protection Act, and failure to return the title deed after loan closure can be considered a deficiency in service.Approach the Banking Ombudsman: You can also file a complaint with the Banking Ombudsman appointed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for your region. The Banking Ombudsman has the power to pass an order directing the bank to return the title deed or provide compensation.File a Civil Suit: If the above options do not yield a favorable result, you can file a civil suit against SBI in the appropriate court in Kerala, seeking the return of the original title deed or compensation for the loss/damage caused due to the bank's negligence.It is important to note that you should have proper documentation, such as the loan closure certificate, to support your claim. Additionally, you should keep records of all communications with the bank regarding the retrieval of the title deed.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighcourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

Request that they acknowledge in writing that the title deed was lost while in their custody. If the branch does not resolve your issue, escalate the matter to the bank's regional office or the customer grievance redressal cell. Every bank, including SBI, has a specific process for handling customer complaints. If the bank fails to resolve the issue within 30 days, you can file a complaint with the Banking Ombudsman. You can file the complaint online, by email, or through a letter. If the above steps do not yield results, you may send a legal notice to the bank, demanding the return of your title deed or appropriate compensation for the loss of the original document.

She can apply for a protection order which would legally prevent your father from committing any further acts ofdomestic violence. Your mother can file for divorce on the grounds of cruelty under Section 13(1)(ia) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955. Cruelty includes both physical and mental abuse. She can file for divorce in the family court in Jabalpur, as under theHindu Marriage Act, she can file a divorce petition where she is currently residing. It is crucial to engage a lawyer who specializes in family law anddomestic violencecases. The lawyer can guide her through filing complaints, applying for protection orders, and initiating divorce proceedings. Her safety and well-being are paramount, and relocating to a familiar environment with a support system is a wise decision.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Can a woman move to her parent's home in a different state before/during filing a domestic violence case?",
    "answer": "Yes, she can move to her parent’s house and file complaints from there. She can file an FIR at any police station. If she files it in Lucknow, she can still pursue the legal proceedings from Jabalpur. The police in Lucknow will transfer the case to the appropriate jurisdiction if needed. According to Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC), a case can be filed where the defendant resides or where the cause of action arises. This means she has the flexibility to choose the location that is most convenient for her means either lucknow or jabalpur any of them. Once the FIR is filed, she can coordinate with her lawyer to handle the proceedings from Jabalpur. Many legal processes can be managed remotely, and her lawyer can represent her in court if necessary. However, it might be beneficial for her to move to her parent’s house for support and safety. Filing the FIR in Lucknow and then managing the legal proceedings from Jabalpur could provide her with the necessary support system while ensuring the legal process continues smoothly.Complaint underSection 498AIPC can be filed at place of woman’s residence, Supreme Court reiterates, Over five months after a three-judge Bench of the Supreme Court ruled that an estranged wife can approach courts at a place where she has taken shelter after being driven out of her matrimonial home in order to file complaint underSection 498Aof theIndian Penal Code, a two-Judge Bench has reiterated this position. Hence, she can file cases under 498A, DV Act and any other court case under family law at jabalpur.Vivek Bhai PatelAdvocate, New Delhi26 AnswersTalk to Advocate Vivek Bhai Patel"

This should be based on the fact that you continued to pay ₹15,000/month during the live period of the case and only missed payments after the case was dismissed, which should not be considered a default.

    "question": "HC passed arbitrary order u/s/ 482, how to challenge",
    "answer": "Based on the details provided, it appears that the matter has gone through various stages in the lower court and the High Court. The Supreme Court has also rejected the Special Leave Petition (SLP) filed against the High Court's order. Here's a legal analysis and advice on the way forward:The High Court's order directing the payment of Rs. 25,000/- per month as maintenance is binding and needs to be complied with, as the Supreme Court has declined to interfere with the order.The fact that the lower court case was dismissed for a period of 44 months due to non-appearance does not automatically absolve you from the maintenance obligation during that period. The High Court, while passing the order, was aware of the dismissal and still directed the payment of arrears.The High Court's order was passed ex-parte (without hearing you), which is a procedural irregularity. However, the Supreme Court's dismissal of the SLP implies that it did not find merit in challenging the High Court's order on this ground.You have the following options:a. File a Review Petition before the Supreme Court, highlighting any apparent error or mistake in the order rejecting the SLP. However, the chances of success in a Review Petition are generally low, as the Supreme Court is reluctant to review its orders unless there are exceptional circumstances.b. File a Curative Petition before the Supreme Court, which is the last judicial resort available. Curative Petitions are entertained in rare cases where there has been a violation of principles of natural justice or a gross miscarriage of justice. The threshold for admission of a Curative Petition is extremely high, and it is advisable to seek legal counsel before pursuing this option.c. Comply with the High Court's order and pay the arrears and the ongoing maintenance of Rs. 25,000/- per month. If there are genuine financial constraints, you can file an application before the High Court or the lower court, seeking a modification or reduction in the maintenance amount, citing your financial circumstances and any change in the circumstances of the parties.d. Explore the possibility of an out-of-court settlement or mediation with the opposite party, if feasible, to arrive at a mutually agreeable maintenance amount and resolve the matter amicably.It is important to note that non-compliance with the High Court's order may lead to contempt of court proceedings or other legal consequences.For more legal assistance, you can contact me.Kindly give a 5 Star Rating if you are satisfied.Best Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighcourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

    "question": "A known acquaintance committed a financial fraud and accused me of having an affair with his wife for personal gain",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,I understand that you have been through a very difficult and emotionally traumatic situation. Based on the details provided, it appears that there are multiple legal issues involved, and you may have grounds to take action against the family. However, before proceeding, it is crucial to gather all relevant evidence and documentation to support your claims.Firstly, regarding the financial aspect, since you have invested a substantial amount of money (₹15 lakhs) towards the purchase of the flat, you may have a claim for the recovery of that amount. If there was a written agreement or understanding regarding the investment and the promised care in return, it would strengthen your case. In the absence of a written agreement, you may still have a claim based on the principles of equity and unjust enrichment.Secondly, the allegations of defamation (libel and slander) made by the husband against you are serious offenses under the BNS. Defamation involves making false statements that harm the reputation of another person. If the husband has made such false statements about you having an affair with his wife, you may have grounds to file a criminal complaint for defamation under BNS.Thirdly, the emotional distress, stress, and depression caused by the family's actions may also give rise to a claim for compensation under the law of torts. You may be able to seek damages for the mental anguish and emotional harm suffered due to their actions.To proceed with legal action, I would recommend the following steps:Gather all relevant evidence and documentation, including any written agreements, communications (emails, text messages, etc.), and witness statements, if available.Consult with an experienced civil and criminal lawyer in your area to evaluate the strength of your case and the appropriate legal remedies available.For the recovery of the invested amount, you may file a civil suit in the appropriate court, seeking the return of the money along with interest and any other damages.For the defamation allegations, you may file a criminal complaint with the local police station, providing evidence of the false statements made by the husband.Regarding the emotional distress and mental anguish, you may include a claim for damages in the civil suit or file a separate suit for compensation under the law of torts.It is important to note that legal proceedings can be complex and time-consuming, and the outcome will depend on the strength of the evidence and the interpretation of the law by the courts.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay Highcourt.Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

These can be crucial pieces of evidence to support your divorce petition.Procedure: You can file a divorce petition in the appropriate Family Court or District Court in India, where your wife is currently residing or where the marriage was solemnized.

    "answer": "Contested Divorce on the Grounds of Mental Cruelty, Adultery, and Harassment: If you file for a contested divorce on the grounds of mental cruelty, adultery, and harassment of your parents, and you have substantial evidence to support your claims, your case can be quite strong. Mental cruelty and adultery are valid grounds for divorce under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955. However, the burden of proof lies on you to establish these grounds with clear and convincing evidence.The time frame for a contested divorce case can vary depending on the complexity of the case, the court's docket, and the cooperation of both parties. Generally, a contested divorce case in India can take anywhere from 24 months to 5 years or more, depending on the circumstances.Maintenance, Alimony, and Ancestral Property Rights: Yes, a contested divorce can lead to the court granting interim and permanent maintenance, as well as alimony, to the aggrieved spouse. The court considers various factors, such as the financial status of both parties, the standard of living during the marriage, and the ability of the spouse to support themselves.However, the right to ancestral property is governed by personal laws and may vary based on your religious affiliation. In general, a wife does not have an automatic right to her husband's ancestral property unless specified in a will or settlement.Making the Lover a Co-Respondent: For Hindu marriages governed by theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, there is no provision to implead a co-respondent.Validity of Police Report from Australia: Indian courts can consider crimes committed by Indian citizens in other countries as evidence in legal proceedings. However, the evidentiary value and admissibility of the police report from Australia will depend on factors such as the nature of the crime, the laws of the foreign country, and the court's discretion.Protection from Court upon Visiting India: If you are apprehensive about visiting India due to potential harassment or threats from your wife, you can seek protection from the court. You can file an application for an ex-parte order or an interim injunction restraining your wife from causing any harm or harassment to you during the pendency of the divorce proceedings.Risk of False Allegations or Cases: Even after filing for divorce in India, there is a risk that your wife may file false allegations or cases against you during the court proceedings. However, if you have substantial evidence to counter such allegations, the court is likely to dismiss them.For more legal assistance, you can contact me.Kindly give a 5 Star Rating if you are satisfied.Best Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighcourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

Under theHindu Marriage Act, 1955, mental cruelty and adultery are recognized grounds for divorce. While adultery is no longer a criminal offense in India, it still remains a valid ground for divorce. The duration of a contested divorce case can vary depending on the complexity of the case and the court's backlog.Interim and Permanent Maintenance, Alimony, and Property Rights: Yes, in a contested divorce, your wife can claim interim and permanent maintenance or alimony under Section 24 and Section 25 of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955. The court considers factors such as your income, her income, and the standard of living during the marriage. Under Hindu law, your wife has no right to your ancestral property. However, if you have children from the marriage, they may have a claim to ancestral property.Making Her Lover a Co-Respondent: You can make her alleged lover a co-respondent in the divorce petition, especially if you are claiming adultery as a ground for divorce.Validity of the Australian Police Report: The police report of her assault on you in Australia can be submitted as evidence in the Indian court. While Indian courts may not directly consider it a crime under Indian law, it will still be relevant in establishing a pattern of behaviour or mental cruelty.Protection from Court if You Visit India: You can seek protection from the court if you fear for your safety upon returning to India. Additionally, you can request the court to issue an order restraining your wife from filing any false complaints against you during your visit.Possibility of Fake Allegations After Filing for Divorce: Yes, even after filing for divorce, your wife can still file fake allegations or cases against you during the court proceedings. However, if such allegations arise, you can defend yourself legally by challenging the credibility of the claims. You can also file a petition for anticipatory bail to protect yourself from arrest in case of any false criminal cases being filed against you.It's crucial to work with a skilled family law attorney in India who can guide you through the legal procedures and help protect your rights.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Title deed lost from SBI",
    "answer": "Dear Sir/Madam,Thank you for your query regarding the retrieval of your property title deed from the State Bank of India (SBI) after the closure of your agricultural loan. Based on the information provided, I will provide an expert legal response to assist you in this matter.Under the Indian laws, when a borrower takes a loan from a bank and provides immovable property as security, the bank holds the original title deed of the property until the loan is fully repaid. Once the loan is closed, the bank is legally obligated to return the original title deed to the borrower.In your case, since you have closed the loan in 2013 and have not received the original title deed back from the bank, you have the following legal options:Send a Legal Notice: You can send a legal notice to the concerned SBI branch, demanding the return of your original title deed within a specified time frame (usually 15-30 days). The notice should clearly state the loan details, the date of closure, and the fact that you have not received the original title deed despite repeated requests.File a Consumer Complaint: If the bank fails to respond to the legal notice or does not return the title deed, you can file a consumer complaint against SBI before the appropriate District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Kerala. Banks are considered \"service providers\" under theConsumer Protection Act, and failure to return the title deed after loan closure can be considered a deficiency in service.Approach the Banking Ombudsman: You can also file a complaint with the Banking Ombudsman appointed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for your region. The Banking Ombudsman has the power to pass an order directing the bank to return the title deed or provide compensation.File a Civil Suit: If the above options do not yield a favorable result, you can file a civil suit against SBI in the appropriate court in Kerala, seeking the return of the original title deed or compensation for the loss/damage caused due to the bank's negligence.It is important to note that you should have proper documentation, such as the loan closure certificate, to support your claim. Additionally, you should keep records of all communications with the bank regarding the retrieval of the title deed.Regards,Arunkumar KhediaAdvocate Bombay HighcourtArunkumar KhediaAdvocate, Mumbai67 AnswersTalk to Advocate Arunkumar Khedia"

In the letter, state that you did not collect the original title deed and that the bank has confirmed it cannot locate the document. Request that they acknowledge in writing that the title deed was lost while in their custody. If the branch does not resolve your issue, escalate the matter to the bank's regional office or the customer grievance redressal cell. Every bank, including SBI, has a specific process for handling customer complaints. If the bank fails to resolve the issue within 30 days, you can file a complaint with the Banking Ombudsman. You can file the complaint online, by email, or through a letter. If the above steps do not yield results, you may send a legal notice to the bank, demanding the return of your title deed or appropriate compensation for the loss of the original document. At the same time you can also apply for a duplicate title deed.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Registration of property from grandfather to father",
    "answer": "Dear client,I’m sorry to hear about the difficulties you’re facing. Let’s address your questions step by step.Steps to Register the Property in Your Father’s Name1. Verify the Will: Ensure that the will is legally valid and has been probated. Probate is the legal process through which a will is validated by the court.2. Gather Necessary Documents: Collect all required documents, including the will, death certificate of your grandfather, identity proofs, and any previous property registration documents.3. Legal Heir Certificate: Obtain a legal heir certificate if not already done. This certificate will list all the legal heirs of your grandfather.4. No Objection Certificate (NOC): Obtain NOCs from all legal heirs, including the children of the deceased brother and sister. This is crucial to avoid any future disputes.5. Approach the Sub-Registrar: Submit all the documents to the sub-registrar’s office for the registration process. The sub-registrar will verify the documents and proceed with the registration.Addressing the Demand for a Share• Negotiation: Try to negotiate with your father’s brother to resolve the issue amicably. Sometimes, a mutual agreement can be reached without legal intervention.• Legal Notice: If negotiation fails, consider sending a legal notice through your lawyer, stating that the demand for a share is unjustified and that you are prepared to take legal action if necessary.• Court Intervention: As a last resort, you can approach the court to enforce the will and compel the brother to sign the necessary documents.Signature of Deceased Uncle’s ChildrenYes, the signatures of the deceased uncle’s children are necessary. They are legal heirs and have a right to the property. Their consent is required to ensure that there are no future disputes regarding the property.Additional Steps• Consult a Lawyer: Given the complexities involved, it is advisable to consult a lawyer who specializes in property law. They can guide you through the process and help address any legal challenges.• Documentation: Keep all communications and documents well-organized. This will be helpful if the matter escalates to legal proceedings.Thank you.

    "question": "Confirmation deed with property extent changed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Legally, a confirmation deed can be executed at any time, even after a long period, if the original owner is still willing to confirm the transaction. The other parties' plan to get a confirmation deed for only their portion of the land without including your portion is legally possible. The law does not require that a confirmation deed cover all parts of a transaction if the original sale has been divided. Each party can individually confirm their portion with the original owner. However, this could lead to complications, especially if the original owner later disputes your portion of the land or if the other parties withdraw from any joint legal proceedings. The fact that the original owner has fraudulently entered into a lease agreement with another person adds complexity. Joining the deal might be a pragmatic solution if you believe that it will protect your interests and avoid the uncertainty of lengthy court proceedings. However, it is essential to ensure that your portion of the land is also confirmed in the deed, and you should not be left out of any negotiations.

    "question": "Confirmation deed with property extent changed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The original owner executed the sale of the entire 4-acre property through a General Power of Attorney. When the sale was completed, the original owner transferred all rights, title, and interest in the 4 acres to the purchaser(s). Under theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, once the sale is executed and registered, the original owner loses any claim over the property. The ownership rights are fully transferred to the purchaser. A confirmation deed is used to ratify or rectify an earlier transaction. The confirmation deed cannot be used to alter the fundamental nature of the original transaction or divide the property differently from the original sale. After the original sale, the property was divided and sold to different parties. These subsequent sales have been registered, and each party now owns their respective portions. Since the original owner has no remaining rights in the property, she cannot execute a confirmation deed for only a portion of the land without including the entire 4 acres. The original owner's fraudulent lease agreement with another person adds another layer of complexity. While joining the deal with the other parties might seem like a practical solution, it’s important to ensure that your rights are fully protected. If you prefer to stick with the court proceedings, you may argue that the original owner cannot legally execute a confirmation deed for only a part of the property. Given the complexity of the situation, it’s advisable to consult a property lawyer who can help you protect your interests effectively.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Registration of property from grandfather to father",
    "answer": "Dear client,I’m sorry to hear about the difficulties you’re facing. Let’s address your questions step by step.Steps to Register the Property in Your Father’s Name1. Verify the Will: Ensure that the will is legally valid and has been probated. Probate is the legal process through which a will is validated by the court.2. Gather Necessary Documents: Collect all required documents, including the will, death certificate of your grandfather, identity proofs, and any previous property registration documents.3. Legal Heir Certificate: Obtain a legal heir certificate if not already done. This certificate will list all the legal heirs of your grandfather.4. No Objection Certificate (NOC): Obtain NOCs from all legal heirs, including the children of the deceased brother and sister. This is crucial to avoid any future disputes.5. Approach the Sub-Registrar: Submit all the documents to the sub-registrar’s office for the registration process. The sub-registrar will verify the documents and proceed with the registration.Addressing the Demand for a Share• Negotiation: Try to negotiate with your father’s brother to resolve the issue amicably. Sometimes, a mutual agreement can be reached without legal intervention.• Legal Notice: If negotiation fails, consider sending a legal notice through your lawyer, stating that the demand for a share is unjustified and that you are prepared to take legal action if necessary.• Court Intervention: As a last resort, you can approach the court to enforce the will and compel the brother to sign the necessary documents.Signature of Deceased Uncle’s ChildrenYes, the signatures of the deceased uncle’s children are necessary. They are legal heirs and have a right to the property. Their consent is required to ensure that there are no future disputes regarding the property.Additional Steps• Consult a Lawyer: Given the complexities involved, it is advisable to consult a lawyer who specializes in property law. They can guide you through the process and help address any legal challenges.• Documentation: Keep all communications and documents well-organized.

    "question": "Confirmation deed with property extent changed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Legally, a confirmation deed can be executed at any time, even after a long period, if the original owner is still willing to confirm the transaction. The other parties' plan to get a confirmation deed for only their portion of the land without including your portion is legally possible. The law does not require that a confirmation deed cover all parts of a transaction if the original sale has been divided. Each party can individually confirm their portion with the original owner. However, this could lead to complications, especially if the original owner later disputes your portion of the land or if the other parties withdraw from any joint legal proceedings. The fact that the original owner has fraudulently entered into a lease agreement with another person adds complexity. Joining the deal might be a pragmatic solution if you believe that it will protect your interests and avoid the uncertainty of lengthy court proceedings. However, it is essential to ensure that your portion of the land is also confirmed in the deed, and you should not be left out of any negotiations. Given the complexity and potential for disputes, it would be wise to consult with a property lawyer.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Confirmation deed with property extent changed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The original owner executed the sale of the entire 4-acre property through a General Power of Attorney. When the sale was completed, the original owner transferred all rights, title, and interest in the 4 acres to the purchaser(s). Under theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, once the sale is executed and registered, the original owner loses any claim over the property. The ownership rights are fully transferred to the purchaser. A confirmation deed is used to ratify or rectify an earlier transaction. The confirmation deed cannot be used to alter the fundamental nature of the original transaction or divide the property differently from the original sale. After the original sale, the property was divided and sold to different parties. These subsequent sales have been registered, and each party now owns their respective portions. Since the original owner has no remaining rights in the property, she cannot execute a confirmation deed for only a portion of the land without including the entire 4 acres. The original owner's fraudulent lease agreement with another person adds another layer of complexity. While joining the deal with the other parties might seem like a practical solution, it’s important to ensure that your rights are fully protected. If you prefer to stick with the court proceedings, you may argue that the original owner cannot legally execute a confirmation deed for only a part of the property. Given the complexity of the situation, it’s advisable to consult a property lawyer who can help you protect your interests effectively.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Indian girl marrying Pakistani boy",
    "answer": "Dear Client,While it is legally possible for a Pakistani citizen to marry an Indian citizen under theSpecial Marriage Act, 1954, while on a tourist visa, this is generally discouraged. Marrying on a tourist visa might create complications, including issues with visa extension and legal status in India. After marriage, your husband would need to apply for an extension of his stay in India. He can apply for an X Visa (Entry Visa) based on marriage to an Indian citizen. This visa is initially granted for a year but can be extended annually.The documents required for a continuous stay include valid passport and visa, marriage certificate, proof of residence in India, application for X visa, a letter of recommendation from the Indian spouse and so on. After marriage, apply for the X Visa. Each year, apply for an extension of the X Visa through the Foreigners Regional Registration Office. Maintain proper documentation of your husband's legal stay and marriage for each extension.Under Section 5(1)(c) of the Citizenship Act, 1955, your husband can apply for Indian citizenship by naturalization after residing in India for at least 7 years. The stay must be continuous and on a valid visa. The process involves proving good character, intent to reside in India, and fulfilling other criteria set by the Ministry of Home Affairs.An X Visa does not grant work rights. To work legally, your husband would need to obtain an Employment Visa, which can be difficult for Pakistani citizens due to stringent security checks. You may explore the possibility of converting the X Visa to an Employment Visa if your husband secures a job offer.Foreigners on an X Visa are not eligible for an Aadhar card. However, your husband can use his passport and visa documents to obtain a Permanent Account Number (PAN) card, which can help in opening a bank account. He can open an NRO (Non-Resident Ordinary) account in India using his visa and passport as identification, along with proof of address in India.During the 7- year period, your husband can visit Pakistan, but re-entry into India will require re-application for a visa. Each visit outside India could affect his eligibility for citizenship, as continuous residence is required. After 7- years, travel restrictions may still apply due to existing Indo- Pak relations.You and your husband can decide the religion of your children. There is no legal obligation for children to follow the religion of either parent. Children from interfaith marriages are typically free to choose their religion upon reaching adulthood.Your ownership of immovable property in India remains unchanged after marriage. Indian property laws do not discriminate based on the nationality or religion of the spouse. Your ownership of immovable property in India remains unchanged after marriage. Indian property laws do not discriminate based on the nationality or religion of the spouse.As a couple, you can adopt under the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 (if you choose to follow Hindu law) or the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. The adoption process will take into account the religious backgrounds of both parents.

It may not be utilized for legally engaging in work activities since the visa doesn’t allow it. Since X cannot work legally he may look for employment through volunteering with NGOs of which some might have small wages to pay, engagement in skill development activities with the aim of getting better employment in future and participation in online freelancing provided he has specialized skills. Nevertheless, freelancing should be taken wisely so as not to violate the provisions of the visa laws. If X wishes to find lawful employment in India, he should consider applying for a work visa, which is granted upon presentation of a job offer and proof of possessing a more skilled position.

The term \"CMC Khata\" refers to the Khata issued by the City Municipal Council (CMC). A Khata represents properties that fully comply with all building by-laws, government regulations, and tax payments. B Khata denotes properties that do not comply fully with building by-laws or regulations. These properties might face restrictions on obtaining loans or building plan approvals, and converting them to A Khata requires clearing dues, penalties, and other compliance issues. Ensure that the title is clear and marketable. Check whether the land is approved for residential use. Confirm that the layout has been approved by the relevant planning authority, such as the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA), the Bangalore Metropolitan Region Development Authority (BMRDA), or the CMC. After registration, you may apply for conversion to A Khata once the area comes under the jurisdiction of BBMP. If the property does not comply with certain norms, it may be registered as B Khata.

The stay must be continuous and on a valid visa. The process involves proving good character, intent to reside in India, and fulfilling other criteria set by the Ministry of Home Affairs.An X Visa does not grant work rights. To work legally, your husband would need to obtain an Employment Visa, which can be difficult for Pakistani citizens due to stringent security checks. You may explore the possibility of converting the X Visa to an Employment Visa if your husband secures a job offer.Foreigners on an X Visa are not eligible for an Aadhar card. However, your husband can use his passport and visa documents to obtain a Permanent Account Number (PAN) card, which can help in opening a bank account. He can open an NRO (Non-Resident Ordinary) account in India using his visa and passport as identification, along with proof of address in India.During the 7- year period, your husband can visit Pakistan, but re-entry into India will require re-application for a visa. Each visit outside India could affect his eligibility for citizenship, as continuous residence is required. After 7- years, travel restrictions may still apply due to existing Indo- Pak relations.You and your husband can decide the religion of your children. There is no legal obligation for children to follow the religion of either parent. Children from interfaith marriages are typically free to choose their religion upon reaching adulthood.Your ownership of immovable property in India remains unchanged after marriage. Indian property laws do not discriminate based on the nationality or religion of the spouse. Your ownership of immovable property in India remains unchanged after marriage.

    "answer": "Dear Client,As observed, under the X2 visa for spouses of Indian nationals, X has no right to work in any form anywhere in India including driving a taxi or marketing properties. It may not be utilized for legally engaging in work activities since the visa doesn’t allow it. Since X cannot work legally he may look for employment through volunteering with NGOs of which some might have small wages to pay, engagement in skill development activities with the aim of getting better employment in future and participation in online freelancing provided he has specialized skills. Nevertheless, freelancing should be taken wisely so as not to violate the provisions of the visa laws. If X wishes to find lawful employment in India, he should consider applying for a work visa, which is granted upon presentation of a job offer and proof of possessing a more skilled position. In addition, seeking advice from an immigration lawyer will also help to discuss any possible routes that may be available to obtain employment in India without violating local regulations.Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Confirmation deed with property extent changed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Legally, a confirmation deed can be executed at any time, even after a long period, if the original owner is still willing to confirm the transaction. The other parties' plan to get a confirmation deed for only their portion of the land without including your portion is legally possible. The law does not require that a confirmation deed cover all parts of a transaction if the original sale has been divided. Each party can individually confirm their portion with the original owner. However, this could lead to complications, especially if the original owner later disputes your portion of the land or if the other parties withdraw from any joint legal proceedings. The fact that the original owner has fraudulently entered into a lease agreement with another person adds complexity. Joining the deal might be a pragmatic solution if you believe that it will protect your interests and avoid the uncertainty of lengthy court proceedings. However, it is essential to ensure that your portion of the land is also confirmed in the deed, and you should not be left out of any negotiations.

    "question": "Confirmation deed with property extent changed",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The original owner executed the sale of the entire 4-acre property through a General Power of Attorney. When the sale was completed, the original owner transferred all rights, title, and interest in the 4 acres to the purchaser(s). Under theTransfer of Property Act, 1882, once the sale is executed and registered, the original owner loses any claim over the property. The ownership rights are fully transferred to the purchaser. A confirmation deed is used to ratify or rectify an earlier transaction. The confirmation deed cannot be used to alter the fundamental nature of the original transaction or divide the property differently from the original sale. After the original sale, the property was divided and sold to different parties. These subsequent sales have been registered, and each party now owns their respective portions. Since the original owner has no remaining rights in the property, she cannot execute a confirmation deed for only a portion of the land without including the entire 4 acres. The original owner's fraudulent lease agreement with another person adds another layer of complexity. While joining the deal with the other parties might seem like a practical solution, it’s important to ensure that your rights are fully protected. If you prefer to stick with the court proceedings, you may argue that the original owner cannot legally execute a confirmation deed for only a part of the property. Given the complexity of the situation, it’s advisable to consult a property lawyer who can help you protect your interests effectively.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Register an unregistered apartment after 33 years",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The quickest way might involve filing an affidavit detailing the circumstances and issuing a public notice in local newspapers. If no objections are raised, you can approach the sub-registrar for registration, especially since you have paid stamp duty. If the legal heirs of the seller are indeed untraceable and no objections arise from the public notice, you may pursue registration based on the original documents and the affidavit.The chances of a declaratory suit being approved are relatively high if you have clear, uninterrupted possession and all supporting documents. The declaratory suit could take anywhere from 1 to 3 years, depending on the specifics of your case and the court's schedule. However, once the suit is decided in your favor, it will provide you with a clear legal title. Filing a declaratory suit might be the most legally secure way to proceed, despite the time it may take. You can also try the affidavit and public notice route for a quicker resolution, but this may not be as legally robust as a court decree.

The term \"CMC Khata\" refers to the Khata issued by the City Municipal Council (CMC). A Khata represents properties that fully comply with all building by-laws, government regulations, and tax payments. B Khata denotes properties that do not comply fully with building by-laws or regulations. These properties might face restrictions on obtaining loans or building plan approvals, and converting them to A Khata requires clearing dues, penalties, and other compliance issues. Ensure that the title is clear and marketable. Check whether the land is approved for residential use. Confirm that the layout has been approved by the relevant planning authority, such as the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA), the Bangalore Metropolitan Region Development Authority (BMRDA), or the CMC. After registration, you may apply for conversion to A Khata once the area comes under the jurisdiction of BBMP. If the property does not comply with certain norms, it may be registered as B Khata. Converting from B Khata to A Khata will require, clearing any penalties, and meeting the compliance standards.

    "answer": "Dear client,I’m sorry to hear about the difficulties you’re facing. Let’s address your questions step by step.Steps to Register the Property in Your Father’s Name1. Verify the Will: Ensure that the will is legally valid and has been probated. Probate is the legal process through which a will is validated by the court.2. Gather Necessary Documents: Collect all required documents, including the will, death certificate of your grandfather, identity proofs, and any previous property registration documents.3. Legal Heir Certificate: Obtain a legal heir certificate if not already done. This certificate will list all the legal heirs of your grandfather.4. No Objection Certificate (NOC): Obtain NOCs from all legal heirs, including the children of the deceased brother and sister. This is crucial to avoid any future disputes.5. Approach the Sub-Registrar: Submit all the documents to the sub-registrar’s office for the registration process. The sub-registrar will verify the documents and proceed with the registration.Addressing the Demand for a Share• Negotiation: Try to negotiate with your father’s brother to resolve the issue amicably. Sometimes, a mutual agreement can be reached without legal intervention.• Legal Notice: If negotiation fails, consider sending a legal notice through your lawyer, stating that the demand for a share is unjustified and that you are prepared to take legal action if necessary.• Court Intervention: As a last resort, you can approach the court to enforce the will and compel the brother to sign the necessary documents.Signature of Deceased Uncle’s ChildrenYes, the signatures of the deceased uncle’s children are necessary. They are legal heirs and have a right to the property. Their consent is required to ensure that there are no future disputes regarding the property.Additional Steps• Consult a Lawyer: Given the complexities involved, it is advisable to consult a lawyer who specializes in property law. They can guide you through the process and help address any legal challenges.• Documentation: Keep all communications and documents well-organized. This will be helpful if the matter escalates to legal proceedings.Thank you.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Purchasing a plot in a gated layout, especially with a CMC Khata, requires careful consideration and due diligence. The term \"CMC Khata\" refers to the Khata issued by the City Municipal Council (CMC). A Khata represents properties that fully comply with all building by-laws, government regulations, and tax payments. B Khata denotes properties that do not comply fully with building by-laws or regulations. These properties might face restrictions on obtaining loans or building plan approvals, and converting them to A Khata requires clearing dues, penalties, and other compliance issues. Ensure that the title is clear and marketable. Check whether the land is approved for residential use. Confirm that the layout has been approved by the relevant planning authority, such as the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA), the Bangalore Metropolitan Region Development Authority (BMRDA), or the CMC. After registration, you may apply for conversion to A Khata once the area comes under the jurisdiction of BBMP. If the property does not comply with certain norms, it may be registered as B Khata. Converting from B Khata to A Khata will require, clearing any penalties, and meeting the compliance standards.

You can also try the affidavit and public notice route for a quicker resolution, but this may not be as legally robust as a court decree. Engaging a property lawyer will be crucial in navigating this process efficiently.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "No Pagdi Tenancy renewed since 40+ years? What would be the status under re-development?",
    "answer": "1. you are the legal heir of the original deceased tenant. so you are entitled. no new agreement is required. the legal heirs of the deceased tenant become the joint tenants by operation of law. It does not matter that the rent receipt is still issued in the name of your grandmother who was the original tenant2. there is no need to pay any money to the landlord's son. however if you want the rent receipt to be issued in your sole name, then you can take noc from other heirs and submit that to the landlord and request him to transfer the rent bill in your name, however for that you dont have to pay full 33% since the heirs get tenancy rights by operation of law and there is no transfer of tenancy to a third party as such. in case you wish to buy the remaining rights of the landlord in the unit then for that he may demand the market value of the unit, since by transferring the remaining rights in the unit, you would become the owner of the unit.3. what rubbish! just continue to pay the rent to the heir of the deceased landlord and take proper rent receipts from him. If he is not accepting the rent then do a money order in his favour or make an application to the small causes court to deposit the rent in court since the landlord refuses to accept the rent from you. the builder as and when appointed has to recognise the heirs of the deceased tenant and the new rehab unit will be allotted to them only or to any one of them as per the mutual agreement between the heirsYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Dear client,Addressing Your Pagdi Tenancy ConcernsEligibility for a Unit During RedevelopmentEven though you don’t have a Pagdi tenancy agreement under your name, you may still be eligible for a unit during redevelopment. The key factors are:Proof of Tenancy:You have been paying rent and have a historical agreement between your grandmother and the landlord’s mother. This can serve as proof of your tenancy.Society Membership:Since the building has formed a cooperative society, you should ensure that your tenancy is recognized by the society. This can strengthen your claim during redevelopment.Legal Heir:As the legal heir, you have the right to inherit the tenancy. You may need to provide documentation proving your status as the legal heir.Buying the Unit from the LandlordIf the landlord agrees, you can negotiate to buy the unit based on the current market valuation. Here are the steps:Valuation:Get the property valued by a certified valuer to determine the current market price.Negotiation:Offer to pay 33% of the market value, as per the common practice in Pagdi tenancies. Ensure that this agreement is documented and legally binding.Legal Agreement:Draft a sale agreement with the help of a lawyer to formalize the transaction and protect your interests.Depositing Rent in CourtDepositing rent in court can be a strategic move to demonstrate your willingness to pay rent and maintain your tenancy rights. However, there are some considerations:Court Deposit:You can file an application in the local Rent Control Court to deposit the rent. This shows that you are fulfilling your obligations as a tenant.Legal Protection:By depositing rent in court, you protect yourself from eviction claims based on non-payment of rent.Builder’s Involvement:If the landlord tries to return the money and ask you to vacate, you can contest this in court. The court will consider your long-term tenancy and the fact that you have been paying rent.Practical StepsConsult a Lawyer:Engage a lawyer who specializes in tenancy and property laws. They can guide you through the process and help you draft necessary legal documents.Document Everything:Keep records of all rent payments, communications with the landlord, and any other relevant documents. This will be crucial in case of legal disputes.Communicate with the Society:Ensure that the cooperative society recognizes your tenancy. Attend society meetings and keep them informed about your situation.Public Notice:If you decide to buy the unit, consider publishing a public notice to inform any potential claimants and avoid future disputes.Thank you.

The court ruled that these provisions were unconstitutional, providing relief to online gaming platforms and players.Current ScenarioRegulatory Grey Area:Despite the High Court ruling, the legal status of online gambling remains in a regulatory grey area.There is no comprehensive legislation specifically addressing the legality of online gambling in Karnataka.This means that while the specific ban was struck down, there is still ambiguity regarding the legality of online gambling platforms like Dafabet.Risks InvolvedLegal Uncertainty:Given the regulatory grey area, participating in online gambling can still pose legal risks. Future legislation or regulatory actions could impact the legality of these platforms.Financial Risks:Online gambling involves significant financial risks, including the potential for addiction and financial loss. It’s important to gamble responsibly and be aware of the risks involved.Consumer Protection:Ensure that any platform you use is reputable and has measures in place for consumer protection. Be cautious of fraudulent or unregulated platforms.RecommendationsStay Informed:Keep up to date with any changes in the legal landscape regarding online gambling in Karnataka.

    "question": "Register an unregistered apartment after 33 years",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The quickest way might involve filing an affidavit detailing the circumstances and issuing a public notice in local newspapers. If no objections are raised, you can approach the sub-registrar for registration, especially since you have paid stamp duty. If the legal heirs of the seller are indeed untraceable and no objections arise from the public notice, you may pursue registration based on the original documents and the affidavit.The chances of a declaratory suit being approved are relatively high if you have clear, uninterrupted possession and all supporting documents. The declaratory suit could take anywhere from 1 to 3 years, depending on the specifics of your case and the court's schedule. However, once the suit is decided in your favor, it will provide you with a clear legal title. Filing a declaratory suit might be the most legally secure way to proceed, despite the time it may take. You can also try the affidavit and public notice route for a quicker resolution, but this may not be as legally robust as a court decree. Engaging a property lawyer will be crucial in navigating this process efficiently.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Here are the steps you can take to seek visitation rights and potentially child custody:Steps to Seek Visitation RightsFile a Petition for Visitation Rights:You can file a petition under the Guardian and Wards Act, 1890, in the Family Court. This petition should request the court to grant you visitation rights based on the best interests of the child.Present the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU):Submit the attested MOU that mentions your right to meet your son once a month. This document can support your claim for visitation rights.Explain the Circumstances:In your petition, explain the reasons why you have not been able to meet your son for the past two years. Highlight your efforts to contact your ex-wife and her refusal to allow visitation.Best Interests of the Child:Emphasize that maintaining a relationship with both parents is in the best interests of the child. Courts generally consider the child’s welfare and emotional well-being when deciding on visitation rights.Basis for Child Custody and Visitation RightsChild’s Welfare:The primary consideration for the court is the welfare of the child. Demonstrate that you can provide a stable and nurturing environment for your son.Parental Bond:Highlight the importance of the child’s relationship with both parents. Courts recognize that a child benefits from having a bond with both the mother and the father.Financial Stability:Mention that you have already paid a one-time settlement of ₹10 lakh for your son’s welfare. This shows your commitment to his financial stability.Legal Precedents:Refer to legal precedents where courts have granted visitation rights to non-custodial parents to ensure the child’s well-being.Procedure for Filing the PetitionConsult a Lawyer:Engage a family lawyer who can help you draft the petition and represent you in court. They can guide you through the legal process and ensure that your rights are protected.File the Petition:Submit the petition along with the necessary documents, including the MOU, proof of payment of the one-time settlement, and any communication with your ex-wife regarding visitation.Court Hearing:Attend the court hearings and present your case. The court may also consider the child’s preferences, depending on his age and maturity.Court Order:If the court finds your petition valid, it will issue an order granting you visitation rights. The court may specify the time, manner, and place for visitations.Potential ChallengesCourt’s Discretion:The court has the discretion to grant or deny visitation rights based on the best interests of the child. However, the fact that you have not met your son for two years should not automatically disqualify you from obtaining visitation rights if you can demonstrate your genuine interest and efforts.Thank you.

    "question": "No Pagdi Tenancy renewed since 40+ years? What would be the status under re-development?",
    "answer": "1. you are the legal heir of the original deceased tenant. so you are entitled. no new agreement is required. the legal heirs of the deceased tenant become the joint tenants by operation of law. It does not matter that the rent receipt is still issued in the name of your grandmother who was the original tenant2. there is no need to pay any money to the landlord's son. however if you want the rent receipt to be issued in your sole name, then you can take noc from other heirs and submit that to the landlord and request him to transfer the rent bill in your name, however for that you dont have to pay full 33% since the heirs get tenancy rights by operation of law and there is no transfer of tenancy to a third party as such. in case you wish to buy the remaining rights of the landlord in the unit then for that he may demand the market value of the unit, since by transferring the remaining rights in the unit, you would become the owner of the unit.3. what rubbish! just continue to pay the rent to the heir of the deceased landlord and take proper rent receipts from him. If he is not accepting the rent then do a money order in his favour or make an application to the small causes court to deposit the rent in court since the landlord refuses to accept the rent from you. the builder as and when appointed has to recognise the heirs of the deceased tenant and the new rehab unit will be allotted to them only or to any one of them as per the mutual agreement between the heirsYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Dear client,Addressing Your Pagdi Tenancy ConcernsEligibility for a Unit During RedevelopmentEven though you don’t have a Pagdi tenancy agreement under your name, you may still be eligible for a unit during redevelopment. The key factors are:Proof of Tenancy:You have been paying rent and have a historical agreement between your grandmother and the landlord’s mother. This can serve as proof of your tenancy.Society Membership:Since the building has formed a cooperative society, you should ensure that your tenancy is recognized by the society. This can strengthen your claim during redevelopment.Legal Heir:As the legal heir, you have the right to inherit the tenancy. You may need to provide documentation proving your status as the legal heir.Buying the Unit from the LandlordIf the landlord agrees, you can negotiate to buy the unit based on the current market valuation. Here are the steps:Valuation:Get the property valued by a certified valuer to determine the current market price.Negotiation:Offer to pay 33% of the market value, as per the common practice in Pagdi tenancies. Ensure that this agreement is documented and legally binding.Legal Agreement:Draft a sale agreement with the help of a lawyer to formalize the transaction and protect your interests.Depositing Rent in CourtDepositing rent in court can be a strategic move to demonstrate your willingness to pay rent and maintain your tenancy rights. However, there are some considerations:Court Deposit:You can file an application in the local Rent Control Court to deposit the rent. This shows that you are fulfilling your obligations as a tenant.Legal Protection:By depositing rent in court, you protect yourself from eviction claims based on non-payment of rent.Builder’s Involvement:If the landlord tries to return the money and ask you to vacate, you can contest this in court. The court will consider your long-term tenancy and the fact that you have been paying rent.Practical StepsConsult a Lawyer:Engage a lawyer who specializes in tenancy and property laws. They can guide you through the process and help you draft necessary legal documents.Document Everything:Keep records of all rent payments, communications with the landlord, and any other relevant documents. This will be crucial in case of legal disputes.Communicate with the Society:Ensure that the cooperative society recognizes your tenancy. Attend society meetings and keep them informed about your situation.Public Notice:If you decide to buy the unit, consider publishing a public notice to inform any potential claimants and avoid future disputes.Thank you.

    "answer": "Dear client,The legal status of online gambling in Karnataka has seen significant changes recently. Here’s an overview of the current situation:Legal StatusBan on Online Gambling:In September 2021, Karnataka passed the Karnataka Police (Amendment) Act, 2021, which banned all forms of online gambling involving money1. This law made it illegal to play on online gambling sites, and violators could face imprisonment for up to three years or a fine of up to ₹1 lakh.High Court Ruling:In February 2022, the Karnataka High Court struck down the provisions of the Karnataka Police (Amendment) Act, 2021, that prohibited and criminalized online gaming, including games of skill2. The court ruled that these provisions were unconstitutional, providing relief to online gaming platforms and players.Current ScenarioRegulatory Grey Area:Despite the High Court ruling, the legal status of online gambling remains in a regulatory grey area.There is no comprehensive legislation specifically addressing the legality of online gambling in Karnataka.This means that while the specific ban was struck down, there is still ambiguity regarding the legality of online gambling platforms like Dafabet.Risks InvolvedLegal Uncertainty:Given the regulatory grey area, participating in online gambling can still pose legal risks. Future legislation or regulatory actions could impact the legality of these platforms.Financial Risks:Online gambling involves significant financial risks, including the potential for addiction and financial loss. It’s important to gamble responsibly and be aware of the risks involved.Consumer Protection:Ensure that any platform you use is reputable and has measures in place for consumer protection. Be cautious of fraudulent or unregulated platforms.RecommendationsStay Informed:Keep up to date with any changes in the legal landscape regarding online gambling in Karnataka. Legal developments can impact the status and regulation of these platforms.Consult Legal Advice:If you are considering participating in online gambling, it may be wise to consult with a legal expert to understand the potential risks and implications.Thank you.

    "answer": "I take it that the tenancy stood in the name of your GMAfter her demise the tenancy would devolve on the family member who was living with the tenant at the time of her demise - see section 7(15)(d) of Maharashtra rent control actThat family member I assume was your late father and after him you are claiming the tenancy as his legal heirSo you become a statutory tenant under the above provision of the rent actIf you have paid the rent to the landlord and he is refusing to accept or having accepted the same , he has not issued the rent receipt, then you are not at faultYou still have the protection of the rent lawAlso under the rent act not issuing the rent receipt is made an offenceYou need not transfer any documents to your name. Whatever existing documents you have and the documents that stand in the name of the original tenant , would sufficeHowever as rightly apprehended by you the landlord may intentionally create complications by requiring you to get the noc of your aunt and uncle who are the other heirs of your GM who was the original tenant.However if they are ok and consenting then you can always take their consent affidavit for record for submission to the landlord or any other authorityI don't know under which regulation of the DCPR 2034 the property can be taken up for redevelopment since its held by two entities,  the land is owned by the landlord and the flats in the building are owned by the individual tenants (except you) who seem to have formed a societyHowever whenever such redevelopment takes place you will get the benefit of the redevelopment in the form of the new rehab  premises in lieu of the old premises held by you at presentJust because you do not have ownership right over the flat and still hold tenancy rights,  would not mean that you will be denied the redevelopment benefitYou should continue paying the rent to the landlord , even if he refuses and does not issue any receiptYou can write the amount and month on the covering letter that you would send to the landlord which will  be an evidence that you regularly pay the rent. If you want to make payment by UPI ensure that the amount is credited to the correct account standing in the landlord's name. Otherwise you can continue issuing cheque or a DD (for consolidated rent of several months together , say for a year) which is also sufficient. Cheque has a validity period , however when you make a DD the amount would be debited right away to your account. So it's a good thing that you issue DD to the landlord towards rent.Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "If you want to have the fair rent determined then you cannot do it yourselfYou will have to file an application in the small causes court which is known as a RAN applicationThe court will then decide the standard rent as per lawYou can, till the above application is finally decided by the court,  deposit the present rent in court on a without prejudice basis and if the standard rent so determined by the court is less than what you have paid, you will be given a credit for the differential amount by the courtThere is no problem if the tenants acquire ownership rights of the landlord as regards their respective tenements and form a society.

    "answer": "Dear Client,First, despite the absence of a current Pagdi tenancy agreement, you may still have rights under the original 1974 agreement. Legal action could be necessary to enforce your tenancy and ensure fair treatment during redevelopment. Updating documents from your deceased grandmother’s name to yours is advisable to avoid complications. Bank transactions showing rent payments can be proof if the landlord refuses to provide receipts. Society's registration might be questionable without land ownership transfer, which would affect redevelopment. It's crucial to consult with a lawyer to navigate these issues and protect your rights.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Fair Rent, which has different interpretations in different states,deals with the subject of rent that is fair between a landlord and tenant in a particular state.It should be within the range of 8% to 10% of the property value, including construction costs and fixtures. Tenants can approach the court if they feel the rent exceeds this value.No doubt you cannot fix the rent on your own even if you name it as fair rent, the process of law is to be adopted.If the landlord is not accepting the rental amount you can adopt the legally valid method to send the rental amount to his account, and if that also fails then you can approach court with an application to permit you to deposit the rent in the court.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "-  As per law, the tenant is a co-owner of the property who enjoys all the rights of an owner like selling or sub-letting the property in the pagdi rental system.- Further, under the pagdi system, the tenant has certain rights over the property but not over the land.- Further, the pagdi system was legalized by the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999. Generally, upon the death of a pagdi tenant, the tenancy rights are transferred to the legal heir/s who were living in the flat when the tenant died, by asking the landlord to issue the new rent receipts in the heir/s name/s.- Hence, after the death you should inform the landowner for transferring the tenancy in your name- Further , the landowner/builder cannot refuse to allot you with new units during redevelopment.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "Dear client,Your situation involves several complex legal aspects related to Pagdi tenancy and redevelopment. Here are the answers to your questions:Possibility of Refusal to Allot New Units:The owner or builder might refuse to allot new units if there is no clear Pagdi tenancy agreement between you and the current landlord. However, your long-term occupancy and the rent receipt from 1988 can serve as evidence of your tenancy. The Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999, protects tenants under the Pagdi system, and you should be eligible for a new unit during redevelopment.Validity of the Old Agreement:The old agreement signed in 1974 between your grandmother and the owner’s grandmother is still valid, even though both parties have passed away. The tenancy rights are typically inherited by legal heirs. The refusal of the landlord to transfer the tenancy agreement to your name, despite encashing the DD, can be contested in court.Eligibility for Redevelopment Benefits:As a Pagdi tenant, you should be eligible for all the benefits during redevelopment, including additional carpet area. The Maharashtra Rent Control Act ensures that tenants are provided with new flats during redevelopment.Requirement of NOC from Relatives:The landlord or builder might ask for an NOC from your aunts and uncle to complicate the situation. However, since they do not have any rights in the unit, you can contest this requirement. It is advisable to consult a legal expert to handle this aspect effectively.Proof of Rent Payment:Bank transactions with descriptions mentioning rent and the month can serve as proof of rent payment in court. If the landlord refuses to accept rent, you can deposit the rent in court through an application in the small causes court.Changing Names on Utility Bills:It is advisable to change the names on the electric, gas, and ration card to your name. This will help establish your continuous occupancy and strengthen your case during redevelopment. The existing Pagdi tenancy agreement under your grandmother’s name should not pose an issue if you have other supporting documents.Documents Required During Redevelopment:The builder might ask for the following documents during redevelopment:Proof of tenancy (old rent receipts, bank transaction records)Identity proof (Aadhar card, PAN card, passport, voter ID)Proof of residence (electricity bill, gas bill, ration card)Legal heir certificate (if applicable)Any correspondence with the landlord regarding tenancyGiven the complexity of your situation, it is highly recommended to consult with a legal expert specializing in tenancy and redevelopment issues to ensure that your rights are protected and to navigate the legal processes effectively.Thank you.

    "question": "No Pagdi Tenancy renewed since 40+ years? What would be the status under re-development?",
    "answer": "1. you are the legal heir of the original deceased tenant. so you are entitled. no new agreement is required. the legal heirs of the deceased tenant become the joint tenants by operation of law. It does not matter that the rent receipt is still issued in the name of your grandmother who was the original tenant2. there is no need to pay any money to the landlord's son. however if you want the rent receipt to be issued in your sole name, then you can take noc from other heirs and submit that to the landlord and request him to transfer the rent bill in your name, however for that you dont have to pay full 33% since the heirs get tenancy rights by operation of law and there is no transfer of tenancy to a third party as such. in case you wish to buy the remaining rights of the landlord in the unit then for that he may demand the market value of the unit, since by transferring the remaining rights in the unit, you would become the owner of the unit.3. what rubbish! just continue to pay the rent to the heir of the deceased landlord and take proper rent receipts from him. If he is not accepting the rent then do a money order in his favour or make an application to the small causes court to deposit the rent in court since the landlord refuses to accept the rent from you. the builder as and when appointed has to recognise the heirs of the deceased tenant and the new rehab unit will be allotted to them only or to any one of them as per the mutual agreement between the heirsYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Dear client,Addressing Your Pagdi Tenancy ConcernsEligibility for a Unit During RedevelopmentEven though you don’t have a Pagdi tenancy agreement under your name, you may still be eligible for a unit during redevelopment. The key factors are:Proof of Tenancy:You have been paying rent and have a historical agreement between your grandmother and the landlord’s mother. This can serve as proof of your tenancy.Society Membership:Since the building has formed a cooperative society, you should ensure that your tenancy is recognized by the society. This can strengthen your claim during redevelopment.Legal Heir:As the legal heir, you have the right to inherit the tenancy. You may need to provide documentation proving your status as the legal heir.Buying the Unit from the LandlordIf the landlord agrees, you can negotiate to buy the unit based on the current market valuation. Here are the steps:Valuation:Get the property valued by a certified valuer to determine the current market price.Negotiation:Offer to pay 33% of the market value, as per the common practice in Pagdi tenancies. Ensure that this agreement is documented and legally binding.Legal Agreement:Draft a sale agreement with the help of a lawyer to formalize the transaction and protect your interests.Depositing Rent in CourtDepositing rent in court can be a strategic move to demonstrate your willingness to pay rent and maintain your tenancy rights. However, there are some considerations:Court Deposit:You can file an application in the local Rent Control Court to deposit the rent. This shows that you are fulfilling your obligations as a tenant.Legal Protection:By depositing rent in court, you protect yourself from eviction claims based on non-payment of rent.Builder’s Involvement:If the landlord tries to return the money and ask you to vacate, you can contest this in court. The court will consider your long-term tenancy and the fact that you have been paying rent.Practical StepsConsult a Lawyer:Engage a lawyer who specializes in tenancy and property laws. They can guide you through the process and help you draft necessary legal documents.Document Everything:Keep records of all rent payments, communications with the landlord, and any other relevant documents. This will be crucial in case of legal disputes.Communicate with the Society:Ensure that the cooperative society recognizes your tenancy. Attend society meetings and keep them informed about your situation.Public Notice:If you decide to buy the unit, consider publishing a public notice to inform any potential claimants and avoid future disputes.Thank you.

    "question": "GPA fraud",
    "answer": "Dear client,The situation you described raises several important legal and procedural questions. The financial institution’s rights to keep the property documents and extend a new loan without a new agreement or signatures from all parties depend on the terms of the original loan agreement and the General Power of Attorney (GPA) you provided. Generally if the original loan agreement included a clause that allows the property to serve as continuing security for future loans, the financial institution might have the right to extend additional credit without a new agreement. The GPA you provided to your brother might have granted him broad authority to manage the property, including securing additional loans. However, this should be explicitly stated in the GPA document.If the financial institution extended the new loan without obtaining the necessary signatures or a new agreement, the validity of the loan could be challenged. This is especially true if the GPA did not explicitly authorize your brother to secure additional loans. If your brothers acted beyond the authority granted by the GPA or without your consent, they might be liable for breach of trust or fraud. You have the right to demand the return of the property documents once the original loan was cleared. The financial institution should not retain the documents without a valid reason or agreement.Carefully review the original loan agreement, the GPA, and any correspondence with the financial institution to understand the terms and conditions. Given the complexity of the situation, it is advisable to consult with a property lawyer who can provide specific legal advice based on the documents and facts of your case. Contact the financial institution to clarify the basis for the new loan and the retention of the property documents. Request copies of all relevant documents and agreements.Relevant Laws and RulesIndian Contract Act, 1872: This act governs the validity and enforceability of contracts, including loan agreements and GPAs.Transfer of Property Act, 1882: This act deals with the transfer of property and the rights of parties involved in such transactions.Banking Regulations: Financial institutions are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and must adhere to guidelines regarding collateral and loan agreements.Thank you.

    "question": "Live-in relationship while going through a divorce",
    "answer": "Dear Client,In India, live-in relationships are not illegal. The Supreme Court of India has recognized live-in relationships as a valid relationship under the law. While live-in relationships are legal, engaging in one while still legally married can complicate your ongoing divorce case. Although it is not punishable by law, it can be used by your wife to strengthen her case against you. Your wife might claim that the live-in relationship amounts to adultery and mental cruelty, which could influence the court's decision regarding alimony, child custody, or other aspects of the divorce. While there’s no legal prohibition against a live-in relationship, considering the ongoing legal battle, it’s advisable to proceed with caution. Your wife’s awareness of this relationship could impact the court’s perception and decisions.

Whatever existing documents you have and the documents that stand in the name of the original tenant , would sufficeHowever as rightly apprehended by you the landlord may intentionally create complications by requiring you to get the noc of your aunt and uncle who are the other heirs of your GM who was the original tenant.However if they are ok and consenting then you can always take their consent affidavit for record for submission to the landlord or any other authorityI don't know under which regulation of the DCPR 2034 the property can be taken up for redevelopment since its held by two entities,  the land is owned by the landlord and the flats in the building are owned by the individual tenants (except you) who seem to have formed a societyHowever whenever such redevelopment takes place you will get the benefit of the redevelopment in the form of the new rehab  premises in lieu of the old premises held by you at presentJust because you do not have ownership right over the flat and still hold tenancy rights,  would not mean that you will be denied the redevelopment benefitYou should continue paying the rent to the landlord , even if he refuses and does not issue any receiptYou can write the amount and month on the covering letter that you would send to the landlord which will  be an evidence that you regularly pay the rent. If you want to make payment by UPI ensure that the amount is credited to the correct account standing in the landlord's name. Otherwise you can continue issuing cheque or a DD (for consolidated rent of several months together , say for a year) which is also sufficient. Cheque has a validity period , however when you make a DD the amount would be debited right away to your account. So it's a good thing that you issue DD to the landlord towards rent.Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "Dear client,Your situation involves several complex legal aspects related to Pagdi tenancy and redevelopment. Here are the answers to your questions:Possibility of Refusal to Allot New Units:The owner or builder might refuse to allot new units if there is no clear Pagdi tenancy agreement between you and the current landlord. However, your long-term occupancy and the rent receipt from 1988 can serve as evidence of your tenancy. The Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999, protects tenants under the Pagdi system, and you should be eligible for a new unit during redevelopment.Validity of the Old Agreement:The old agreement signed in 1974 between your grandmother and the owner’s grandmother is still valid, even though both parties have passed away. The tenancy rights are typically inherited by legal heirs. The refusal of the landlord to transfer the tenancy agreement to your name, despite encashing the DD, can be contested in court.Eligibility for Redevelopment Benefits:As a Pagdi tenant, you should be eligible for all the benefits during redevelopment, including additional carpet area. The Maharashtra Rent Control Act ensures that tenants are provided with new flats during redevelopment.Requirement of NOC from Relatives:The landlord or builder might ask for an NOC from your aunts and uncle to complicate the situation. However, since they do not have any rights in the unit, you can contest this requirement. It is advisable to consult a legal expert to handle this aspect effectively.Proof of Rent Payment:Bank transactions with descriptions mentioning rent and the month can serve as proof of rent payment in court. If the landlord refuses to accept rent, you can deposit the rent in court through an application in the small causes court.Changing Names on Utility Bills:It is advisable to change the names on the electric, gas, and ration card to your name. This will help establish your continuous occupancy and strengthen your case during redevelopment. The existing Pagdi tenancy agreement under your grandmother’s name should not pose an issue if you have other supporting documents.Documents Required During Redevelopment:The builder might ask for the following documents during redevelopment:Proof of tenancy (old rent receipts, bank transaction records)Identity proof (Aadhar card, PAN card, passport, voter ID)Proof of residence (electricity bill, gas bill, ration card)Legal heir certificate (if applicable)Any correspondence with the landlord regarding tenancyGiven the complexity of your situation, it is highly recommended to consult with a legal expert specializing in tenancy and redevelopment issues to ensure that your rights are protected and to navigate the legal processes effectively.Thank you.

    "question": "Early termination of 22-month rental agreement",
    "answer": "Dear Client,It can be inferred that the agreement is valid until 28/02/2026, as stated in the contract. The landlord is trying to terminate the agreement prematurely. The Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999 provides protections for tenants from arbitrary eviction. Since your mother has a valid and registered leave and license agreement, the landlord cannot evict her without a legitimate reason that complies with the agreement and law. Since your mother is willing to purchase the property, negotiating directly with the landlord might be beneficial. If the landlord is indeed selling the property, your mother could express her interest in buying it, possibly securing more time to arrange the purchase or a temporary extension. If the landlord insists on eviction without a proper legal basis, your mother can challenge this in court. Given that the agreement explicitly mentions a period until February 2026, the court might provide relief, granting her more time to find a new place or purchase the current one. It is advisable to consult with a lawyer specializing in property law in Maharashtra.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,In India, live-in relationships are not illegal. The Supreme Court of India has recognized live-in relationships as a valid relationship under the law. While live-in relationships are legal, engaging in one while still legally married can complicate your ongoing divorce case. Although it is not punishable by law, it can be used by your wife to strengthen her case against you. Your wife might claim that the live-in relationship amounts to adultery and mental cruelty, which could influence the court's decision regarding alimony, child custody, or other aspects of the divorce. While there’s no legal prohibition against a live-in relationship, considering the ongoing legal battle, it’s advisable to proceed with caution. Your wife’s awareness of this relationship could impact the court’s perception and decisions.

Whatever existing documents you have and the documents that stand in the name of the original tenant , would sufficeHowever as rightly apprehended by you the landlord may intentionally create complications by requiring you to get the noc of your aunt and uncle who are the other heirs of your GM who was the original tenant.However if they are ok and consenting then you can always take their consent affidavit for record for submission to the landlord or any other authorityI don't know under which regulation of the DCPR 2034 the property can be taken up for redevelopment since its held by two entities,  the land is owned by the landlord and the flats in the building are owned by the individual tenants (except you) who seem to have formed a societyHowever whenever such redevelopment takes place you will get the benefit of the redevelopment in the form of the new rehab  premises in lieu of the old premises held by you at presentJust because you do not have ownership right over the flat and still hold tenancy rights,  would not mean that you will be denied the redevelopment benefitYou should continue paying the rent to the landlord , even if he refuses and does not issue any receiptYou can write the amount and month on the covering letter that you would send to the landlord which will  be an evidence that you regularly pay the rent. If you want to make payment by UPI ensure that the amount is credited to the correct account standing in the landlord's name. Otherwise you can continue issuing cheque or a DD (for consolidated rent of several months together , say for a year) which is also sufficient. Cheque has a validity period , however when you make a DD the amount would be debited right away to your account.

    "answer": "Dear client,Your situation involves several complex legal aspects related to Pagdi tenancy and redevelopment. Here are the answers to your questions:Possibility of Refusal to Allot New Units:The owner or builder might refuse to allot new units if there is no clear Pagdi tenancy agreement between you and the current landlord. However, your long-term occupancy and the rent receipt from 1988 can serve as evidence of your tenancy. The Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999, protects tenants under the Pagdi system, and you should be eligible for a new unit during redevelopment.Validity of the Old Agreement:The old agreement signed in 1974 between your grandmother and the owner’s grandmother is still valid, even though both parties have passed away. The tenancy rights are typically inherited by legal heirs. The refusal of the landlord to transfer the tenancy agreement to your name, despite encashing the DD, can be contested in court.Eligibility for Redevelopment Benefits:As a Pagdi tenant, you should be eligible for all the benefits during redevelopment, including additional carpet area. The Maharashtra Rent Control Act ensures that tenants are provided with new flats during redevelopment.Requirement of NOC from Relatives:The landlord or builder might ask for an NOC from your aunts and uncle to complicate the situation. However, since they do not have any rights in the unit, you can contest this requirement. It is advisable to consult a legal expert to handle this aspect effectively.Proof of Rent Payment:Bank transactions with descriptions mentioning rent and the month can serve as proof of rent payment in court. If the landlord refuses to accept rent, you can deposit the rent in court through an application in the small causes court.Changing Names on Utility Bills:It is advisable to change the names on the electric, gas, and ration card to your name. This will help establish your continuous occupancy and strengthen your case during redevelopment. The existing Pagdi tenancy agreement under your grandmother’s name should not pose an issue if you have other supporting documents.Documents Required During Redevelopment:The builder might ask for the following documents during redevelopment:Proof of tenancy (old rent receipts, bank transaction records)Identity proof (Aadhar card, PAN card, passport, voter ID)Proof of residence (electricity bill, gas bill, ration card)Legal heir certificate (if applicable)Any correspondence with the landlord regarding tenancyGiven the complexity of your situation, it is highly recommended to consult with a legal expert specializing in tenancy and redevelopment issues to ensure that your rights are protected and to navigate the legal processes effectively.Thank you.

    "answer": "Your wife was a partner  in that company then hence she signed it in the capacity of the partner.Every partner is liable, jointly with all the other partners and also severally, for all acts of the firm done while he is a partner.If the firm cannot pay, the creditors are likely to ask the individual partners to pay.Partners have joint liability for the firm's debts. This means that each partner is liable for the whole balance of the firm's debts. However, any payments made towards a firm's debt will reduce the balance owed by each partner.Recently, the Supreme Court of India (“Supreme Court”) inS.P. Mani and Mohan Dairy v. Dr. Snehalatha Elangovanheld that vicarious liability can be imposed on the partners of a firm when specific averments are made in the complaint as to the status of the partner qua the firm. The Supreme Court also clarified that a complaint filed under Sections 138 and 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (“NI Act”) can be quashed if the accused produces unimpeachable and incontrovertible evidence to show that the person could not have been concerned with issuance of the dishonored cheque.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Validity of cheque given by ex-partner",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Since the replacement cheque was signed solely by your wife, the first legal issue is whether this cheque can bind the partnership firm. According to Section 18 of the Partnership Act, 1932, a partner can bind the firm by acts done in the course of the business of the firm. However, once your wife exited the partnership, her authority to bind the firm would generally cease. The cheque issued by a partner who has left the firm may not be enforceable against the firm unless the partnership deed or any subsequent agreement provides otherwise.Under the Partnership Act,1932 all partners are jointly and severally liable for the acts of the firm. However, the liability of the partners is tied to acts done while they were partners as if the cheque is issued after your wife left the firm, and only her signature is on it, then the remaining partners may argue that they are not liable for the cheque. Check the partnership agreement to see if it provides for any specific remedies or liabilities of the partners after a partner leaves the firm. Given the complexities of using a cheque signed by a former partner, you might consider filing a civil suit for the recovery of the loan amount against the firm and the remaining partners.

The validity of a cheque is three months from its date mentioned in the cheque. if she has retired long ago i.e., more than three months and the case has been filed post retirement i.e., beyond three months then she may disclaim the liability. However  the retiring partner continues to be liable to the third parties for any acts of the firm for the period when he was a partner at the firm2.If a signed blank cheque is voluntarily presented to a payee, towards some payment, the payee may fill up the amount and other particulars.

    "question": "Validity of cheque given by ex-partner",
    "answer": "Dear Client,A cheque signed by your wife before her retirement from the partnership may still be valid, provided it was issued when she was an active partner and authorized to sign on behalf of the firm. However, if she is no longer a partner at the time of presenting the cheque, her authority to bind the firm with that cheque may be questioned. This could affect the enforceability of the cheque against the firm or the remaining partners.The fact that the cheque was initially blank and later filled in does not inherently affect its validity. However, if there is any dispute about the amount filled in or other details, it could lead to challenges regarding the cheque's enforceability.If the bank returns the cheque because your wife is no longer a signing authority, Section 138 of the NI Act could still apply. The reason for dishonour may it be due to insufficient funds or any other reason, such as the drawer not being authorized, can trigger action under Section 138. However, the defence may argue that the cheque was issued without authority if it was presented after her retirement.If your wife's account was settled and her retirement deed specifies that she is no longer liable for debts incurred after her retirement, she might not be liable for the firm's debts. However, she may still be liable for obligations or debts incurred before her retirement, depending on the terms of the retirement agreement and how the cheque was issued.Your parents can choose to sue the partnership and the surviving partners while excluding your wife. By this, the remaining partners are generally liable for the debts of the firm incurred while they were partners, but excluding your wife from the lawsuit would mean that she is not being held accountable for the cheque or the debt associated with it.If your parents decide to sue your wife, she could potentially argue that She was no longer a partner when the cheque was presented, her account was settled at the time of her retirement, and she had no further obligations towards the firm’s debts or the cheque was not presented during the time she was an active partner, questioning its validity as binding on her, and therefore, she should not be liable.Should you require any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Criminal offense for diverting the commission: Your former partners could potentially face criminal charges if they engaged in fraudulent activities, such as diverting funds that rightfully belonged to you. You would need substantial evidence to prove criminal intent, including records, communications, and witness statements.Sufficiency of financial records: Financial records alone can be a strong piece of evidence but may not be sufficient by themselves to establish criminal guilt. They need to be corroborated with other evidence, such as emails, witness testimonies, and proof of misleading communication.Where to file a complaint: You can file a complaint with the local police station, the Economic Offenses Wing (EOW) if there is substantial financial fraud, or the civil court, If you decide to pursue a civil suit for recovery of funds.Liability and Recovery: The former partners are primarily liable if they diverted funds and misled you. If the company facilitated or was negligent in handling the funds, it might also be held liable, especially if there was a failure in their auditing processes. For recovery, file a criminal complaint if there’s clear evidence of criminal activity or file a suit for recovery of the diverted commission.Limitation period for filing a complaint/suit: For filing a civil suit for recovery of money, the limitation period is generally 3 years from the date when you became aware of the diversion of funds.Consult with a lawyer to explore all possible legal avenues and ensure timely and effective action.

Ancestral property in a Hindu Joint Family spans four generations, remains undivided with equal shares, and is inherited by birth, not death.In your case the next generation of your great grandfather has inherited the intestate property thereby the nature of ancestral property stands automatically extinguished.The reply what your lawyer gave to your sister's legal notice in this regard is proper and perfect you can adopt the reply ion the same lines.The property transferred to you by your grandfather is your own and self acquired property hence the claim made by your father is not maintainable, at least not during the lifetime of your grandfather.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "More clarification on how properties become self acquired & four generation concept",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Self-acquired property refers to the property acquired by a person through his own efforts and not inherited from ancestors. Under Section 8 ofHindu Succession Act,1956, when a Hindu male dies intestate, his property devolves upon his heirs, including sons, daughters, widow, and mother. On the other hand, Ancestral property is property that is inherited up to four generations of male lineage. It should remain undivided until the fourth generation. The Four generation rule means that The property should remain undivided for at least four generations, meaning the original owner and three subsequent generations. When your GGF died intestate in 1969, the property was inherited by your GF. Based on theHindu Succession Act, 1956, the property inherited by your GF from your GGF would be considered self-acquired property in the hands of your GF. He has absolute rights to dispose of it as he wishes, including gifting it. In the case ofUttam Singh vs Subagh Singh AIR 2016 SC 1169, The Supreme Court held that property inherited by a Hindu from his paternal ancestors after theHindu Succession Act, 1956, would not be considered ancestral property but self-acquired property. Hence, you can argue that since your GF inherited the property after theHindu Succession Act, 1956, it is his self-acquired property, emphasizing that the property was not held undivided by four generations, and thus, it does not meet the criteria for ancestral property as defined under Hindu law.

    "answer": "Your wife was a partner  in that company then hence she signed it in the capacity of the partner.Every partner is liable, jointly with all the other partners and also severally, for all acts of the firm done while he is a partner.If the firm cannot pay, the creditors are likely to ask the individual partners to pay.Partners have joint liability for the firm's debts. This means that each partner is liable for the whole balance of the firm's debts. However, any payments made towards a firm's debt will reduce the balance owed by each partner.Recently, the Supreme Court of India (“Supreme Court”) inS.P. Mani and Mohan Dairy v. Dr. Snehalatha Elangovanheld that vicarious liability can be imposed on the partners of a firm when specific averments are made in the complaint as to the status of the partner qua the firm. The Supreme Court also clarified that a complaint filed under Sections 138 and 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (“NI Act”) can be quashed if the accused produces unimpeachable and incontrovertible evidence to show that the person could not have been concerned with issuance of the dishonored cheque.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Validity of cheque given by ex-partner",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Since the replacement cheque was signed solely by your wife, the first legal issue is whether this cheque can bind the partnership firm. According to Section 18 of the Partnership Act, 1932, a partner can bind the firm by acts done in the course of the business of the firm. However, once your wife exited the partnership, her authority to bind the firm would generally cease. The cheque issued by a partner who has left the firm may not be enforceable against the firm unless the partnership deed or any subsequent agreement provides otherwise.Under the Partnership Act,1932 all partners are jointly and severally liable for the acts of the firm. However, the liability of the partners is tied to acts done while they were partners as if the cheque is issued after your wife left the firm, and only her signature is on it, then the remaining partners may argue that they are not liable for the cheque. Check the partnership agreement to see if it provides for any specific remedies or liabilities of the partners after a partner leaves the firm. Given the complexities of using a cheque signed by a former partner, you might consider filing a civil suit for the recovery of the loan amount against the firm and the remaining partners.

    "question": "Validity of cheque given by ex-partner",
    "answer": "1. The validity of a cheque is three months from its date mentioned in the cheque. if she has retired long ago i.e., more than three months and the case has been filed post retirement i.e., beyond three months then she may disclaim the liability. However  the retiring partner continues to be liable to the third parties for any acts of the firm for the period when he was a partner at the firm2.If a signed blank cheque is voluntarily presented to a payee, towards some payment, the payee may fill up the amount and other particulars. This in itself would not invalidate the cheque. The onus would still be on the accused to prove that the cheque was not in discharge of a debt or liability by adducing evidence.3. No, the NI Act will not apply in that situation4.A partner who retires from a firm does not thereby cease to be liable for partnership debts or obligations incurred before his retirement.5.

    "question": "Validity of cheque given by ex-partner",
    "answer": "Dear Client,A cheque signed by your wife before her retirement from the partnership may still be valid, provided it was issued when she was an active partner and authorized to sign on behalf of the firm. However, if she is no longer a partner at the time of presenting the cheque, her authority to bind the firm with that cheque may be questioned. This could affect the enforceability of the cheque against the firm or the remaining partners.The fact that the cheque was initially blank and later filled in does not inherently affect its validity. However, if there is any dispute about the amount filled in or other details, it could lead to challenges regarding the cheque's enforceability.If the bank returns the cheque because your wife is no longer a signing authority, Section 138 of the NI Act could still apply. The reason for dishonour may it be due to insufficient funds or any other reason, such as the drawer not being authorized, can trigger action under Section 138. However, the defence may argue that the cheque was issued without authority if it was presented after her retirement.If your wife's account was settled and her retirement deed specifies that she is no longer liable for debts incurred after her retirement, she might not be liable for the firm's debts. However, she may still be liable for obligations or debts incurred before her retirement, depending on the terms of the retirement agreement and how the cheque was issued.Your parents can choose to sue the partnership and the surviving partners while excluding your wife. By this, the remaining partners are generally liable for the debts of the firm incurred while they were partners, but excluding your wife from the lawsuit would mean that she is not being held accountable for the cheque or the debt associated with it.If your parents decide to sue your wife, she could potentially argue that She was no longer a partner when the cheque was presented, her account was settled at the time of her retirement, and she had no further obligations towards the firm’s debts or the cheque was not presented during the time she was an active partner, questioning its validity as binding on her, and therefore, she should not be liable.Should you require any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Commercial activities are typically not permitted within residential societies unless specifically allowed by the society’s bylaws and with proper approvals. Using a residential property for student housing and providing meals would generally be considered a commercial activity. Such use could be in violation of the cooperative society's rules, as it transforms the residential space into a quasi-commercial establishment. Check your society's bylaws or rules to see if they address or permit commercial activities or specific uses like student housing. If the bylaws do not address this scenario explicitly, the plot holder might need to seek approval from the society's committee or general body.If the plot is jointly owned, the signature requirements for form 10A can depend on the nature of joint ownership. Typically, for joint ownership, the signatures of all joint owners are required to authorize one person to act on behalf of the joint owners. Since cooperative society rules can vary slightly, it is best to check with your specific society's rules or the election officer regarding the exact requirements for signatures on Form 10A.

Ancestral property in a Hindu Joint Family spans four generations, remains undivided with equal shares, and is inherited by birth, not death.In your case the next generation of your great grandfather has inherited the intestate property thereby the nature of ancestral property stands automatically extinguished.The reply what your lawyer gave to your sister's legal notice in this regard is proper and perfect you can adopt the reply ion the same lines.The property transferred to you by your grandfather is your own and self acquired property hence the claim made by your father is not maintainable, at least not during the lifetime of your grandfather.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

A property inherited by a son from his father is not an ancestral property.Subsequently the son had divided his property to his children or upon his intestate death if the property was inherited by his legal heirs then also it cannot be considered as ancestral property.Therefore for any reason it is not an ancestral property.For knowing the particular section and judgments suiting to your requirement you may contact your advocate or search for it from the law journals or google.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "More clarification on how properties become self acquired & four generation concept",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Self-acquired property refers to the property acquired by a person through his own efforts and not inherited from ancestors. Under Section 8 ofHindu Succession Act,1956, when a Hindu male dies intestate, his property devolves upon his heirs, including sons, daughters, widow, and mother. On the other hand, Ancestral property is property that is inherited up to four generations of male lineage. It should remain undivided until the fourth generation. The Four generation rule means that The property should remain undivided for at least four generations, meaning the original owner and three subsequent generations. When your GGF died intestate in 1969, the property was inherited by your GF. Based on theHindu Succession Act, 1956, the property inherited by your GF from your GGF would be considered self-acquired property in the hands of your GF. He has absolute rights to dispose of it as he wishes, including gifting it. In the case ofUttam Singh vs Subagh Singh AIR 2016 SC 1169, The Supreme Court held that property inherited by a Hindu from his paternal ancestors after theHindu Succession Act, 1956, would not be considered ancestral property but self-acquired property. Hence, you can argue that since your GF inherited the property after theHindu Succession Act, 1956, it is his self-acquired property, emphasizing that the property was not held undivided by four generations, and thus, it does not meet the criteria for ancestral property as defined under Hindu law.

    "answer": "Dear Client,Since the issue is already in court, you may request an interim injunction as part of the ongoing suit. This is to ensure that the property remains in its current state until a final decision is made. If there is already a court order or injunction in place and the other party is not complying with it, you can file a petition for contempt of court in the court that issued the original order. Even if the police have mentioned that they cannot intervene because the matter is in court you should file a complaint with the police if unauthorized persons are continuing to use the land.

This gives the SDM/Assistant Collector of a region the authority to convert the kind and character of any land in the region from agriculture to residential.Thus the conversion of SC ST agricultural land to non agricultural will not entitle the land owner to sell the property to non SC ST member without the permission of the district magistrate/collector hence the land purchased by the non SC person without the permission of the district collector is in valid and it can be termed as a defective titleT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear client,Section 143 of the Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950, allows for the conversion of agricultural land to residential or industrial use. This conversion is authorized by the Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) or Assistant Collector.However, the conversion of land under Section 143 does not automatically change the restrictions on the sale of land originally owned by SC/ST individuals. The sale of such land still requires approval from government officials and must comply with specific conditions set by law. If these conditions are not met, the sale could be considered invalid, and the title might be defective.Given your situation, it would be wise to consult with a legal expert to ensure that all necessary approvals were obtained and that the title is clear before proceeding with the purchase. This will help you avoid any potential legal issues in the future.Thank you. Should you require any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us"

The Foreign Marriage Act, 1969, governs marriages between Indian citizens and foreign nationals conducted outside India. Since your marriage was legally performed in the Netherlands, it is valid under this Act. While your marriage is recognized in India, it is advisable to register your marriage at the Indian embassy or consulate in the Netherlands. This registration serves as an additional legal record in India and can be useful for administrative purposes. For your partner's OCI card application, the international marriage certificate should generally be accepted, especially since it is in English.

This means that each partner is liable for the whole balance of the firm's debts. However, any payments made towards a firm's debt will reduce the balance owed by each partner.Recently, the Supreme Court of India (“Supreme Court”) inS.P. Mani and Mohan Dairy v.

The Supreme Court also clarified that a complaint filed under Sections 138 and 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (“NI Act”) can be quashed if the accused produces unimpeachable and incontrovertible evidence to show that the person could not have been concerned with issuance of the dishonored cheque.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Validity of cheque given by ex-partner",
    "answer": "Dear Client,Since the replacement cheque was signed solely by your wife, the first legal issue is whether this cheque can bind the partnership firm. According to Section 18 of the Partnership Act, 1932, a partner can bind the firm by acts done in the course of the business of the firm. However, once your wife exited the partnership, her authority to bind the firm would generally cease. The cheque issued by a partner who has left the firm may not be enforceable against the firm unless the partnership deed or any subsequent agreement provides otherwise.Under the Partnership Act,1932 all partners are jointly and severally liable for the acts of the firm. However, the liability of the partners is tied to acts done while they were partners as if the cheque is issued after your wife left the firm, and only her signature is on it, then the remaining partners may argue that they are not liable for the cheque. Check the partnership agreement to see if it provides for any specific remedies or liabilities of the partners after a partner leaves the firm. Given the complexities of using a cheque signed by a former partner, you might consider filing a civil suit for the recovery of the loan amount against the firm and the remaining partners.

    "question": "Validity of cheque given by ex-partner",
    "answer": "Dear Client,A cheque signed by your wife before her retirement from the partnership may still be valid, provided it was issued when she was an active partner and authorized to sign on behalf of the firm. However, if she is no longer a partner at the time of presenting the cheque, her authority to bind the firm with that cheque may be questioned. This could affect the enforceability of the cheque against the firm or the remaining partners.The fact that the cheque was initially blank and later filled in does not inherently affect its validity. However, if there is any dispute about the amount filled in or other details, it could lead to challenges regarding the cheque's enforceability.If the bank returns the cheque because your wife is no longer a signing authority, Section 138 of the NI Act could still apply. The reason for dishonour may it be due to insufficient funds or any other reason, such as the drawer not being authorized, can trigger action under Section 138. However, the defence may argue that the cheque was issued without authority if it was presented after her retirement.If your wife's account was settled and her retirement deed specifies that she is no longer liable for debts incurred after her retirement, she might not be liable for the firm's debts. However, she may still be liable for obligations or debts incurred before her retirement, depending on the terms of the retirement agreement and how the cheque was issued.Your parents can choose to sue the partnership and the surviving partners while excluding your wife. By this, the remaining partners are generally liable for the debts of the firm incurred while they were partners, but excluding your wife from the lawsuit would mean that she is not being held accountable for the cheque or the debt associated with it.If your parents decide to sue your wife, she could potentially argue that She was no longer a partner when the cheque was presented, her account was settled at the time of her retirement, and she had no further obligations towards the firm’s debts or the cheque was not presented during the time she was an active partner, questioning its validity as binding on her, and therefore, she should not be liable.Should you require any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Criminal offense for diverting the commission: Your former partners could potentially face criminal charges if they engaged in fraudulent activities, such as diverting funds that rightfully belonged to you. You would need substantial evidence to prove criminal intent, including records, communications, and witness statements.Sufficiency of financial records: Financial records alone can be a strong piece of evidence but may not be sufficient by themselves to establish criminal guilt. They need to be corroborated with other evidence, such as emails, witness testimonies, and proof of misleading communication.Where to file a complaint: You can file a complaint with the local police station, the Economic Offenses Wing (EOW) if there is substantial financial fraud, or the civil court, If you decide to pursue a civil suit for recovery of funds.Liability and Recovery: The former partners are primarily liable if they diverted funds and misled you. If the company facilitated or was negligent in handling the funds, it might also be held liable, especially if there was a failure in their auditing processes. For recovery, file a criminal complaint if there’s clear evidence of criminal activity or file a suit for recovery of the diverted commission.Limitation period for filing a complaint/suit: For filing a civil suit for recovery of money, the limitation period is generally 3 years from the date when you became aware of the diversion of funds.Consult with a lawyer to explore all possible legal avenues and ensure timely and effective action.

    "answer": "Dear Client,As a personal guarantor for the loans in Kuwait, your father is legally liable to repay those debts. Even though the properties in India were not used as collateral, creditors could potentially pursue legal action to recover their dues. Creditors in Kuwait may attempt to secure an injunction on your father’s properties in India to prevent their transfer or sale. This can be done by filing a civil suit in India and arguing that the transfer is intended to defraud creditors. Legal heirs, such as yourself, can challenge the will on the grounds of undue influence, lack of testamentary capacity, or if the will is intended to defraud creditors. It would be prudent to seek immediate legal counsel to explore your options, especially if you suspect that the will is intended to defraud creditors or if you wish to challenge it as a legal heir.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "The Government of Kuwait has to seek permission to sue your father for recovery of loans he availed in Kuwait and it is less possible for them to get the details of the properties of your father until and unless they have been given as collateral security toward the loan as a guarantor too.If your father refuses to furnish the details or properties lying on his name then the lender has to make his own efforts to locate the details of properties lying on the name of the borrower/guarantor.In the meantime in the absence of a restriction order by any court of law the disposal of his property by any means by your father will be valid and cannot be challenged.The practical feasibility and the involvement of laws of two countries are the impediments which will be a hindrance or a barrier for the creditor to recover the loan amount in this connection.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear Client,Generally, foreign creditors do not have direct jurisdiction over properties in India unless there is a mutual legal assistance treaty or other specific international agreements between the countries involved. Kuwait and India do not have a comprehensive agreement allowing Kuwaiti creditors to directly place a lien on Indian properties. If your father is transferring assets with the intention to defraud his creditors, such transfers could be declared void. Creditors or legal heirs can challenge such transfers in court. If the loans in Kuwait were secured by a personal guarantee that can be proven to be fraudulent or misleading in India, Kuwaiti creditors might have grounds to challenge his actions under Indian law. You or other legal heirs, or the creditors, could file for an injunction to prevent the transfer or sale of assets in India if there is evidence that your father is attempting to defraud creditors. It is advisable to consult with a legal expert in both Indian and international law to explore all possible legal avenues for challenging your father’s actions and protecting the interests of all parties involved.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Creating Release Deed for the share of his cousin’s share of property",
    "answer": "Dear Client,The Koorchit from 1953 outlines how the ancestral property was shared between two branches. The branch that sold their share of the property through registered sale deeds before 1960 effectively transferred their ownership rights to third parties. Once these sales were completed, that branch had no further legal claim to the property in question. The registered declaration in 1972, where the branch confirmed they had exhausted all their share in the specific Survey Number, further reinforces that they had no remaining rights in the property.The two release deeds executed by the brothers in 2002 are legally questionable because they attempt to claim a share in a property that their branch had already sold and declared as fully transferred by 1972. These deeds cannot override the previous legal transfers and declarations. The fact that the litigant lost in the Munsif Court, District Court, and Madras High Court in a suit for injunction indicates that the courts have already ruled in your favour. The new pending suit for declaration of title can be argued as an abuse of the legal process as it seems to be an attempt to re-litigate an issue that has already been settled by the courts.Your lawyer can file a motion to dismiss the current suit on the grounds of res judicata, estoppel, and lack of merit, given that the property has been legally transferred and the matter already adjudicated. Given the 9-year delay, you can request the court to expedite the trial, arguing that the prolonged litigation is unjustified, especially since the litigant has already lost in previous courts. Your lawyer should focus on these arguments to seek a dismissal or expedite the resolution of the case in your favor.

This gives the SDM/Assistant Collector of a region the authority to convert the kind and character of any land in the region from agriculture to residential.Thus the conversion of SC ST agricultural land to non agricultural will not entitle the land owner to sell the property to non SC ST member without the permission of the district magistrate/collector hence the land purchased by the non SC person without the permission of the district collector is in valid and it can be termed as a defective titleT KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear client,Section 143 of the Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950, allows for the conversion of agricultural land to residential or industrial use. This conversion is authorized by the Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) or Assistant Collector.However, the conversion of land under Section 143 does not automatically change the restrictions on the sale of land originally owned by SC/ST individuals. The sale of such land still requires approval from government officials and must comply with specific conditions set by law. If these conditions are not met, the sale could be considered invalid, and the title might be defective.Given your situation, it would be wise to consult with a legal expert to ensure that all necessary approvals were obtained and that the title is clear before proceeding with the purchase. This will help you avoid any potential legal issues in the future.Thank you. Should you require any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us"
