    "question": "Builder/Owner agreement review before signing",
    "answer": "-  A Collaboration Agreement is an arrangement between an owner of the land and a builder where the land owner contributes the land and the developer undertakes the responsibility of obtaining approvals, property development, launching and marketing the project with the help of his financial resources.- As per law, the builder is not the transferee or buyer of the flats as per theTransfer of Property Act, 1882 under the Collaboration Agreement.- The ownership lies with the owner of the land, but the landowner grants the builder along with development rights, a license to enter the land for the purpose of development.- The license/authority to enter the land is typically given by way of a Power of attorney issued in favor of the Builder, and this General power of attorney should be registered with the Registrar in order to be legally binding on both parties.- Hence, you will have to enter into a collaboration agreement with the builder , and the same may be prepared by an advocate .- Engage a local advocate for getting the said work done.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "When it comes to mutual consent or consensual divorce order, the verdict conceded by a Foreign Court is viewed as a lawful, valid and official decree in the Indian Courts by the virtue of Section 13 & Section 14 of the Indian Civil Procedure Code, in which Section 13 lists the conditions when a judgment given by foreign court shall not be viewed as legitimate in India and Section 14 clearly states that when the Indian Courts would deem the Foreign judgment to be the final one. A verdict which isn’t affected by Section 13 need not be approved again in India and will be viewed as final under Section 14 of the Civil Procedure Act.A Foreign Divorce Verdict Will Be Viewed As Valid And Final if the spouse agrees to the divorce decree of the foreign Court in spite of the fact that the jurisdiction of the foreign Court isn’t as per the Divorce Law of parties involved, to be legitimate and the verdict given by those foreign Courts to be final.So you should firstly ascertain the divorce whether it was of mutual consent or contested or a no fault divorce to enable you to challenge the divorce in India.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

The ground for divorce will be \"mental cruelty.\" Based on your narration of husband's conduct, you have been subjected to mental cruelty. The taunting and the sadism that you were subjected to constitute such cruelty, as does the refusal to have sexual relations.You are entitled to the recovery of your Shreedhan (all that belongs to you including things gifted by your husband and in-laws). Further, you may also be entitled to maintenance if your husband is refusing to defray your living expenses despite adequate means and you are unable to maintain yourself. The caveat is the wife must not be living in adultery or have deserted her husband without just cause.That is not all as you also have the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, which  provides for compensation for victims of domestic abuse (physical abuse, sexual abuse, mental abuse, etc.) among other things.Lastly, demanding dowry is a prosecutable offence. The person who made such a demand is liable for punishment.You should hire a lawyer to initiate some or all of the above proceedings on your behalf. The facts of each case are different. It is necessary for a lawyer to know the complete facts of your case in order to advise with greater specificity.Hope that answers your question.

    "answer": "Basically she or her lawyer has done the act of fraud by suppressing  the fact of her previous marriage which subsisted as on the date of registration of this marriage.They might have done this fraudulent act for the purpose of obtaining visa by adopting such fraudulent means.Their intention is to somehow obtain visa even if it is by cheating the authorities concerned.The marriage registrar will register the marriage on the basis of information furnished in the application for registration of marriage.If this fact was mentioned in it, then the marriage officer would have refused to register this marriage.So you can find out the truth that where and how this fraud has taken place.Actually this act of fraud is commission of an offence under crimninal laws in India.However you can file a petition before concerned court to get this marriage nullified for the said reasons.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

Thus, if your wife is an earning member of the family and has an income that is substantial to buy life policies, you should encourage the idea as it’s totally in line with the concept of insurance protection;5) Any married man residing in India (except Jammu and Kashmir) can avail benefit under this Act.Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "answer": "Your written submissions are showing that you are subjected to cruelty from your husband and his family members.- Hence, you should know, that legally you are having following right  :-1. As per law, A wife has the right to claim decent living standards and basic comforts of life from her husband. Hence for claiming the maintenance, you can file a petition under section125 CrPc.- Your husband is under legal obligation to provide the same to you at any cost, even he is working or not.2. Law entitles wives a basic right to reside in the matrimonial/ home, whether the house owned by her husband or his parents, a rented property or officially provided to him.- Hence, for claiming your residential right, medical expenses etc, and also for teaching a lesson to the family members of your husband, who subjected you torture & harassment, you can file a petition under the provisions ofDomestic ViolenceAct.3. As per the Supreme Court, A wife has complete ownership rights over all her Streedhan, the gifts and money given to her before and after marriage. The denial of Streedhan to the wife makes the husband and in-laws liable for criminal charges.- And further, if the husband or his family members subjected a woman to cruelty for the dowry demand, then they can be booked under Section 498-A.- You can lodge a written complaint against your husband, in the Women cell/Mahila Police, after mentioning all the details of torture & harassment.- The women cell firstly will try to reconcile the dispute; otherwise, they will lodge an FIR against all the person, who subjected you cruelty. .-Hence, you can take legal action against the husband and his family members to teach a lesson to them , if he not agree for a divorce as per your wish.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

As per law, A wife has the right to claim decent living standards and basic comforts of life from her husband. Hence for claiming the maintenance, you can file a petition under section125 CrPc.- Your husband is under legal obligation to provide the same to you at any cost, even he is working or not.2. Law entitles wives a basic right to reside in the matrimonial/ home, whether the house owned by her husband or his parents, a rented property or officially provided to him.- Hence, for claiming your residential right, medical expenses etc, and also for teaching a lesson to the family members of your husband, who subjected you torture & harassment, you can file a petition under the provisions ofDomestic ViolenceAct.3. As per the Supreme Court, A wife has complete ownership rights over all her Streedhan, the gifts and money given to her before and after marriage. The denial of Streedhan to the wife makes the husband and in-laws liable for criminal charges.- And further, if the husband or his family members subjected a woman to cruelty for the dowry demand, then they can be booked under Section 498-A.- You can lodge a written complaint against your husband, in the Women cell/Mahila Police, after mentioning all the details of torture & harassment.- The women cell firstly will try to reconcile the dispute; otherwise, they will lodge an FIR against all the person, who subjected you cruelty. .-Hence, you can take legal action against the husband and his family members to teach a lesson to them , if he not agree for a divorce as per your wish.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "Hello,The way forward for you is to bring a petition for dissolution of marriage under section 13 of theHindu Marriage Act. The ground for divorce will be \"mental cruelty.\" Based on your narration of husband's conduct, you have been subjected to mental cruelty. The taunting and the sadism that you were subjected to constitute such cruelty, as does the refusal to have sexual relations.You are entitled to the recovery of your Shreedhan (all that belongs to you including things gifted by your husband and in-laws). Further, you may also be entitled to maintenance if your husband is refusing to defray your living expenses despite adequate means and you are unable to maintain yourself. The caveat is the wife must not be living in adultery or have deserted her husband without just cause.That is not all as you also have the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, which  provides for compensation for victims of domestic abuse (physical abuse, sexual abuse, mental abuse, etc.) among other things.Lastly, demanding dowry is a prosecutable offence. The person who made such a demand is liable for punishment.You should hire a lawyer to initiate some or all of the above proceedings on your behalf. The facts of each case are different. It is necessary for a lawyer to know the complete facts of your case in order to advise with greater specificity.Hope that answers your question.

Hence for claiming the maintenance, you can file a petition under section125 CrPc.- Your husband is under legal obligation to provide the same to you at any cost, even he is working or not.2. Law entitles wives a basic right to reside in the matrimonial/ home, whether the house owned by her husband or his parents, a rented property or officially provided to him.- Hence, for claiming your residential right, medical expenses etc, and also for teaching a lesson to the family members of your husband, who subjected you torture & harassment, you can file a petition under the provisions ofDomestic ViolenceAct.3. As per the Supreme Court, A wife has complete ownership rights over all her Streedhan, the gifts and money given to her before and after marriage. The denial of Streedhan to the wife makes the husband and in-laws liable for criminal charges.- And further, if the husband or his family members subjected a woman to cruelty for the dowry demand, then they can be booked under Section 498-A.- You can lodge a written complaint against your husband, in the Women cell/Mahila Police, after mentioning all the details of torture & harassment.- The women cell firstly will try to reconcile the dispute; otherwise, they will lodge an FIR against all the person, who subjected you cruelty. .- If your husband files a divorce case, then you should file the above mentioned cases against him , then he will himself pray you to forgive him , and the cases will not finish until you will decide for the same.- However, if you wanted to end the marriage without filing any cases , then you can opt for mutual divorce .Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "Hello,The way forward for you is to bring a petition for dissolution of marriage under section 13 of theHindu Marriage Act. The ground for divorce will be \"mental cruelty.\" Based on your narration of husband's conduct, you have been subjected to mental cruelty. The taunting and the sadism that you were subjected to constitute such cruelty, as does the refusal to have sexual relations.You are entitled to the recovery of your Shreedhan (all that belongs to you including things gifted by your husband and in-laws). Further, you may also be entitled to maintenance if your husband is refusing to defray your living expenses despite adequate means and you are unable to maintain yourself. The caveat is the wife must not be living in adultery or have deserted her husband without just cause.That is not all as you also have the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, which  provides for compensation for victims of domestic abuse (physical abuse, sexual abuse, mental abuse, etc.) among other things.Lastly, demanding dowry is a prosecutable offence. The person who made such a demand is liable for punishment.You should hire a lawyer to initiate some or all of the above proceedings on your behalf. The facts of each case are different. It is necessary for a lawyer to know the complete facts of your case in order to advise with greater specificity.Hope that answers your question.

    "answer": "Hello,The way forward for you is to bring a petition for dissolution of marriage under section 13 of theHindu Marriage Act. The ground for divorce will be \"mental cruelty.\" Based on your narration of husband's conduct, you have been subjected to mental cruelty. The taunting and the sadism that you were subjected to constitute such cruelty, as does the refusal to have sexual relations.You are entitled to the recovery of your Shreedhan (all that belongs to you including things gifted by your husband and in-laws). Further, you may also be entitled to maintenance if your husband is refusing to defray your living expenses despite adequate means and you are unable to maintain yourself. The caveat is the wife must not be living in adultery or have deserted her husband without just cause.That is not all as you also have the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, which  provides for compensation for victims of domestic abuse (physical abuse, sexual abuse, mental abuse, etc.) among other things.Lastly, demanding dowry is a prosecutable offence. The person who made such a demand is liable for punishment.You should hire a lawyer to initiate some or all of the above proceedings on your behalf. The facts of each case are different. It is necessary for a lawyer to know the complete facts of your case in order to advise with greater specificity.Hope that answers your question.

    "answer": "Hello,The way forward for you is to bring a petition for dissolution of marriage under section 13 of theHindu Marriage Act. The ground for divorce will be \"mental cruelty.\" Based on your narration of husband's conduct, you have been subjected to mental cruelty. The taunting and the sadism that you were subjected to constitute such cruelty, as does the refusal to have sexual relations.You are entitled to the recovery of your Shreedhan (all that belongs to you including things gifted by your husband and in-laws). Further, you may also be entitled to maintenance if your husband is refusing to defray your living expenses despite adequate means and you are unable to maintain yourself. The caveat is the wife must not be living in adultery or have deserted her husband without just cause.That is not all as you also have the Protection of Women fromDomestic ViolenceAct, which  provides for compensation for victims of domestic abuse (physical abuse, sexual abuse, mental abuse, etc.) among other things.Lastly, demanding dowry is a prosecutable offence. The person who made such a demand is liable for punishment.You should hire a lawyer to initiate some or all of the above proceedings on your behalf. The facts of each case are different. It is necessary for a lawyer to know the complete facts of your case in order to advise with greater specificity.Hope that answers your question.

    "answer": "- In the case a Hindu male passes away the following shall take place1. The Class I heirs get equal shares2. In case of no Class I heirs it shall be equally divided amongst Class II heirs3. In case of no Class I or Class II Heirs the property shall be divided amongst the Agnates and then the Cognates.4. If none of the above-mentioned heirs exist then the property shall pass on to the Government and this is known as Escheat.- Hence, in the absence of children & wife , parents and grandparents  ,  the property would be devolved upon your brother , sister . and after their demise it can be claimed by their children- However, you can write a WILL in favour of the relatives to whom you want to given the property.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "First of all, you have to go through the family trust deed in order to ascertain if the trust can own a property in its own name, and if so, if it can sell it to third parties. If yes, the trust should pass a resolution for the purpose of sale in accordance with its trust deed. If these conditions are satisfied, please engage a lawyer to examine the title deeds and the encumbrance certificates and obtain his/her opinion on the title of the property before purchasing it.Swaminathan NeelakantanAdvocate, Coimbatore3023 Answers20 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Swaminathan Neelakantan"

    "answer": "When it comes to mutual consent or consensual divorce order, the verdict conceded by a Foreign Court is viewed as a lawful, valid and official decree in the Indian Courts by the virtue of Section 13 & Section 14 of the Indian Civil Procedure Code, in which Section 13 lists the conditions when a judgment given by foreign court shall not be viewed as legitimate in India and Section 14 clearly states that when the Indian Courts would deem the Foreign judgment to be the final one. A verdict which isn’t affected by Section 13 need not be approved again in India and will be viewed as final under Section 14 of the Civil Procedure Act.A Foreign Divorce Verdict Will Be Viewed As Valid And Final if the spouse agrees to the divorce decree of the foreign Court in spite of the fact that the jurisdiction of the foreign Court isn’t as per the Divorce Law of parties involved, to be legitimate and the verdict given by those foreign Courts to be final.So you should firstly ascertain the divorce whether it was of mutual consent or contested or a no fault divorce to enable you to challenge the divorce in India.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "When it comes to mutual consent or consensual divorce order, the verdict conceded by a Foreign Court is viewed as a lawful, valid and official decree in the Indian Courts by the virtue of Section 13 & Section 14 of the Indian Civil Procedure Code, in which Section 13 lists the conditions when a judgment given by foreign court shall not be viewed as legitimate in India and Section 14 clearly states that when the Indian Courts would deem the Foreign judgment to be the final one. A verdict which isn’t affected by Section 13 need not be approved again in India and will be viewed as final under Section 14 of the Civil Procedure Act.A Foreign Divorce Verdict Will Be Viewed As Valid And Final if the spouse agrees to the divorce decree of the foreign Court in spite of the fact that the jurisdiction of the foreign Court isn’t as per the Divorce Law of parties involved, to be legitimate and the verdict given by those foreign Courts to be final.So you should firstly ascertain the divorce whether it was of mutual consent or contested or a no fault divorce to enable you to challenge the divorce in India.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

If you are a manager or executive you can file a case against the company following the procedure described under order 37 of Civil Procedure Code known as summary procedure. This is the fastest way of getting your salary back.  But in all cases it is necessary that you should issue of proper demand notice to the company.Ravi ShindeAdvocate, Hyderabad4923 Answers42 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ravi Shinde"

    "answer": "After the intestate demise of Ravi in 2019, his estate devolved automatically upon histhensurviving legal heirs, namely, his wife, his mother , his son and his daughter equally, with each inheriting 25% undivided share. Upon the intestate death of Ravi's wife, her 25% undivided share of Ravi's estate devolved on her son and daughter equally. As things stand now, Ravi's mother's share is 25%, and his son's and daughter's are 37.5% each, all undivided. Ravi's mother may very well release her 25% undivided share in favour of Ravi's son by way of a deed of relinquishment, which has to be duly registered.

    "answer": "Texas does not impose a state inheritance or estate tax. Most of its laws surrounding inheritance are straightforward.However, if your father is reported to have died intestate, i.e., without a will, the distribution of his assets will be left up to the state’s intestate succession process.Estates with no will or a will that has not been probated by the Texas courts within four years of the deceased’s death can be inherited via the use of an affidavit of heirship. Someone with knowledge of the decedent and his or her family, as well as a public notary, must sign the document to transfer the estate to the decedent’s heirs at lawBiological children of the decedent and his or her spouse hold some of the strongest inheritance rights to an intestate will’s property.In turn, an intestate will, because it has little to no pre-specified direction, is inherited by some combination of the deceased’s spouse, children and/or relatives. To differentiate between your belongings and whom they should go to, Texas divides them into community property and separate property.The properties left behind by your deceased father, who is reported to have died intestate shall devolve  on the successors in interest/ surviving  legal heirs as per the law of inheritance of the law applicable to law where the property is situated.You may ask/request your sister to express no objection to your inheritance of the property by compensating her with the consideration amount equal to the value of her share in the property.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "As per Indian law, when a person dies intestate, i.e., without  making a will or any document with regards to his property, then  his assets will be distributed among his legal heirs through intestate succession process. The property is in Texas, so the law in Texas is also applicable.Dying without a valid will leave the distribution of assets up to the intestate succession process of the state of Texas.  children will receive an \"intestate share\" in the property.Biological children of the decedent and his or her spouse hold some of the strongest inheritance rights to an intestate will’s property.As per property law in Texas, the property divided in two types1. Community property - is a property acquired after marriage2. separate property - is the property  acquired before marriageif a person leaves the property with spouse and children, then  Texas deals with separate property differently. Spouse will inherit half of the community property unless the husband leaves descendants – children, grandchildren, or great grandchildren. If have separate property spouse will inherit all or a portion of it. The size of your spouse's share of your separate property depends on whether or not you have living parents, children, or siblings. If you do, they and your spouse will share your separate property.The state divides separate personal property between spouse and your children, with two thirds afforded to all the children and the leftover one third going to the spouse.The surviving spouse automatically receives all community property.Ajay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

    "answer": "to be a rural agriculture land, a land has to qualify both the below mentioned conditions. 1. The land should be Out of the Municipality or Nagar Palika. 2. The land should be aerially out of: 2 Kms in case of nearest Municipality or Nagar Palika having population of more than 10000 but not exceeding 100000/- 6 Kms in case of nearest Municipality or Nagar Palika having population of more than 1,00,000 but not exceeding 10,00,000/- 8 Kms in case of nearest Municipality or Nagar Palika having population of more than10,00,000/- The most important change done w.e.f. 01.04.2013 is that the distance is now to be measured aerially. Prior to the amendment the road distance was to be taken. As a result of this Arial measurement, much more land may be part of urban agriculture land. In other words, Any Agriculture land which is within the: In the municipal limits or within the limits of Nagar Palika is an urban agriculture land and is taxable.

There is procedure  for computation of market value of acquired and paying compensation. It cannot be decided by DM or CM. As State Government  has acquired land without following procedure  under law, it cannot make payment of compensation  directly, it will amount admitting that legal procedure was not followed.

    "answer": "Texas does not impose a state inheritance or estate tax. Most of its laws surrounding inheritance are straightforward.However, if your father is reported to have died intestate, i.e., without a will, the distribution of his assets will be left up to the state’s intestate succession process.Estates with no will or a will that has not been probated by the Texas courts within four years of the deceased’s death can be inherited via the use of an affidavit of heirship. Someone with knowledge of the decedent and his or her family, as well as a public notary, must sign the document to transfer the estate to the decedent’s heirs at lawBiological children of the decedent and his or her spouse hold some of the strongest inheritance rights to an intestate will’s property.In turn, an intestate will, because it has little to no pre-specified direction, is inherited by some combination of the deceased’s spouse, children and/or relatives. To differentiate between your belongings and whom they should go to, Texas divides them into community property and separate property.The properties left behind by your deceased father, who is reported to have died intestate shall devolve  on the successors in interest/ surviving  legal heirs as per the law of inheritance of the law applicable to law where the property is situated.You may ask/request your sister to express no objection to your inheritance of the property by compensating her with the consideration amount equal to the value of her share in the property.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

The property is in Texas, so the law in Texas is also applicable.Dying without a valid will leave the distribution of assets up to the intestate succession process of the state of Texas.  children will receive an \"intestate share\" in the property.Biological children of the decedent and his or her spouse hold some of the strongest inheritance rights to an intestate will’s property.As per property law in Texas, the property divided in two types1. Community property - is a property acquired after marriage2. separate property - is the property  acquired before marriageif a person leaves the property with spouse and children, then  Texas deals with separate property differently. Spouse will inherit half of the community property unless the husband leaves descendants – children, grandchildren, or great grandchildren. If have separate property spouse will inherit all or a portion of it. The size of your spouse's share of your separate property depends on whether or not you have living parents, children, or siblings. If you do, they and your spouse will share your separate property.The state divides separate personal property between spouse and your children, with two thirds afforded to all the children and the leftover one third going to the spouse.The surviving spouse automatically receives all community property.Ajay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

    "question": "Appeal in Revenue Dept. Mantralaya",
    "answer": "1. thats your choice whether or not to engage a lawyer2. it is for the buyer to pay the stamp duty, unless agreed to the contrary in the agreement3. how can a lawyer come up with reasons? that is for the party to give cogent reasons as to why the appeal was not filed within the statutory period. a delay cannot be 'made up'. it has to be genuine delay. 'sufficient cause' has to be shown by the party for not having filed the appeal on time.also in your query you have not explained why the appeal came to be filed after almost 7 years of the passing of the order?a lawyer cannot be asked to supply reasons. it is for the party to provide cogent reasons. if a lawyer concocts a story for delay then that amounts to professional misconduct and this may also heavily backfire against the party seeking delay condonationa party has to be vigilant over his rights. if he sleeps over his rights then it would be at his own peril and risks. Courts of law frown upon proceedings which are filed belatedly.Yusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"
