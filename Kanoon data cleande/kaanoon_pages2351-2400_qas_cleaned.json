    "question": "Lucky draw",
    "answer": "Lotteries Regulation Act, 1998 Section 2(b) states that the lucky draws which are conducted to promote digital transactions do not come under the category of lottery and are thus are not banned.2)Under the Lotteries Regulation Act, of 1988, the state governments have been authorised by the central government to make their laws related to the game. As a result,some states have banned it and some still consider it legal.3) Section 2(b) defines lottery as “a scheme, in whatever form and by whatever name called, for distribution of prizes by lot or chance to those persons participating in the chances of a prize by purchasing tickets”.4) The definition clearly indicates that three elements are essential for a scheme to be defined as a lottery: chance, consideration (for purchasing tickets) and prize or reward.4) Section 2(1)(r) of theConsumer Protection Actdefines unfair trade practice. Under this provision conducting any lottery or contests whether of skill or chance to promote  the sale, use or supply of any goods or for the provision of any service is forbidden5) Under the Tamil Nadu Prize Scheme Prohibition Act, offering prizes by way of draw of lots to purchasers of goods or products from shops or malls is prohibited. Section 2(b) of the Act defines a ‘prize scheme’ to mean any scheme where a reward in cash or kind is given for purchase of goods.Ajay SethiAdvocate, Mumbai98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi"

    "question": "Lucky draw",
    "answer": "If what you state is a modified form of a lottery then: Under the Lotteries Regulation Act, of 1988, the state governments have been authorised by the central government to make their laws related to the game. As a result, some states have banned it and some still consider it legal. However,there is no such restriction on the online form of lottery.Lucky draws are not illegal in India because the lucky draw scheme which is included in the Lotteries Regulation Act,1998 has to stay within the given parameters, and most lucky draws which are organized by the governments do not require a ticket purchase and the participants can directly come and try their luck, and thus this does not account to gambling.Online lucky draws require the payment of a small amount which is usually collected by companies like Mastercard or Rupay, or by other banks used for payment and hence the government on their side does not charge anything and offer prizes gratuitously. Therefore it is very clear that a lucky draw is very different from a lottery, and this would not fall under the category of gambling.And for making it legalised the lucky draw rules in india plays a crucial role for it that if there is something is upto lucky draw that should be as per the rules mentioned in lucky draw rules in india.The Section 2(1)(r)Consumer Protection Act, 1986 also prohibits any kind of unfair trade practice  which includes “conducting any lottery or contests whether skill or chance to promote the sale, use or supply of any goods or for the provision of any service.”  The NITI Aayog has clarified this too as offering lucky draws to promote digital transactions does not include any service and the customer does not pay anything for getting the reward. These kinds of lucky draws usually include small cash back offers for payment by digital means.And thus the lucky draw scheme stays out of the ambit of consumer protection laws as well as the Lottery Regulation Act.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

If during the investigation, the police find evidence against the buyers for criminal conspiracy, they can be added as accused.Yes, you can file a complaint under IPC sections 445 for house-breaking against the unknown persons who broke the lock on your property.If the SHO has refused to lodge an FIR, you can file a complaint with the Superintendent of Police (SP) or with the Magistrate under Section 156(3) of theCriminal Procedure Code(CrPC). If you fear that filing an application under CrPC 156(3) may offend the police officers, you may continue following up with the SP office for a few more days. If there is still no response, you can file the application with the court, and the court will direct the police to register an FIR and investigate the case.Regarding the police asking for the original sale deed, there is no provision in the law that allows them to force you to submit the original document. You can submit a certified copy or a photocopy of the sale deed for their investigation.

    "question": "Sale of ancestor plot and signed consent form",
    "answer": "Dear client,I'm sorry to hear about your father's passing. In regards to your question, it's important to understand the legal ownership and status of the plots of land. If the plots were ancestral property and were divided amongst the heirs through a legal process, then you and your stepbrothers would each have separate ownership of your respective plots. In this case, you may not require a signed consent form or NOC from your stepbrothers for selling your plot.However, it's possible that there may be some legal documentation or agreements between your family members related to the ancestral property that could affect the sale of the plots. It's important to consult with a local lawyer who can review the ownership documents and provide you with the necessary guidance.Regarding the NOC, it's a document that may be required by the buyer to ensure that there are no legal disputes or issues with the property. The NOC is generally issued by the co-owners of the property, but if the plots are already divided and you each have separate ownership, you may not require a NOC from your stepbrothers.If any of the co-owners do not provide the required NOC, it may make the sale process more complicated or delay the sale. However, it's not impossible to sell the property without an NOC, especially if you can provide alternative documentation to prove the ownership and status of the property.If you're concerned about the misuse of your plot with an NOC, you may include specific clauses in the NOC that limit the buyer's rights to use the property in a certain way or require their compliance with certain conditions.Again, it's crucial to seek legal advice and guidance from a local lawyer who can provide you with more specific information and advice based on the laws and regulations in your area.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,If your stepfather has given the two plots of land to your elder stepbrother and the younger stepbrother was a minor at the time of the transfer, then the younger stepbrother cannot claim any right in those plots of land unless he had specifically been named as a beneficiary in the transfer deed.In terms of obtaining a NOC (No Objection Certificate), it is always advisable to have a written document rather than a verbal agreement. Verbal agreements can lead to misunderstandings and disputes in the future. Therefore, it is always better to have a written agreement to avoid any legal complications.In case your stepfather is not willing to provide a NOC, you can consider approaching the court for an injunction to restrain him from creating any third party interest in the property. This will help you to safeguard your interests in the property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Right of son",
    "answer": "Firstly when your father and his brother had title on their names due to partition or inheritance, the property lost the nature of ancestral property, therefore neither your cousin or now you have any rights over the proeprty since it became self acquired property of your father and his brothers.Secondly the agreement is reported to have been entered into with the buyer in the year 1991 but it was not converted onto sale deed despite passing of 32 years, and also it is not known whether the full sale consideration amount was received by sellers and handed over possession thereon.If it is presumed that the buyer did not pay full sale consideration amount neither the possession of the property was handed over to him then it can be deemed as barred by limitation.The limitation period is just three years.If it was an unregistered sale agreement then in the absence of any attempt made by the buyer now for purchase and the same was not acknowledged by the sellers stating that the agreement is barred by limitation, then the buyer cannot institute any suit seeking for specific relief too.In this regard there is no necessity even to cancel an infructuous sale agreement afresh.The title holders of the property can ignore the sale agreement and proceed to alienate the property in any manner as per their desire.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Firstly when your father and his brother had title on their names due to partition or inheritance, the property lost the nature of ancestral property, therefore neither your cousin or now you have any rights over the proeprty since it became self acquired property of your father and his brothers.Secondly the agreement is reported to have been entered into with the buyer in the year 1991 but it was not converted onto sale deed despite passing of 32 years, and also it is not known whether the full sale consideration amount was received by sellers and handed over possession thereon.If it is presumed that the buyer did not pay full sale consideration amount neither the possession of the property was handed over to him then it can be deemed as barred by limitation.The limitation period is just three years.If it was an unregistered sale agreement then in the absence of any attempt made by the buyer now for purchase and the same was not acknowledged by the sellers stating that the agreement is barred by limitation, then the buyer cannot institute any suit seeking for specific relief too.In this regard there is no necessity even to cancel an infructuous sale agreement afresh.The title holders of the property can ignore the sale agreement and proceed to alienate the property in any manner as per their desire.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "Dear client,In order to transfer the property to your name, you need to complete a series of legal formalities in India. One of the key steps is to mutate the property records in your name.The process of mutation varies from state to state in India. However, in general, it involves submitting an application along with the required documents to the local municipal corporation or revenue office where the property is located.Since you are residing in the USA, you can appoint a Power of Attorney (POA) in India to act on your behalf. A POA is a legal document that authorizes a person to act as your representative in India. You can execute a POA in favour of your trusted family member or friend in India, giving him/her the power to carry out the legal formalities on your behalf.The following documents are usually required to apply for mutation:A copy of the registered willDeath certificate of the grandmother (if applicable)Property tax receiptsNOC from the housing society (if applicable)Proof of identity and address of the applicant and the POAAny other document as required by the local authorityYou can send the documents to your POA in India who can submit the application and complete the legal formalities.

    "answer": "Police can arrest a person without a warrant if they have reasonable grounds to believe that the person has committed a cognizable offense. However, the law requires the police to inform the person of the reasons for arrest and produce them before a magistrate within 24 hours. Warrant can be issued by a court after due hearing and examination of evidence.If the contractor is changing his statement multiple times in front of the police, it could weaken his credibility as a witness in court. However, the court will ultimately decide the weightage to be given to his testimony based on the evidence and circumstances of the case.If the witnesses and contractor did not submit any ID proof, their statements may not carry much weight in court. However, the court will consider all the evidence presented before it and evaluate its credibility and relevance.If your name and date of birth are mentioned incorrectly in the chargesheet, you can request the court to correct the mistake. The 'whether verified' column indicates whether the information in the chargesheet has been verified by the investigating officer. If he has written 'yes', it means that he has verified the information to the best of his knowledge.In terms of what can be done under these circumstances, it is advisable to continue pursuing the quashing of the FIR and presenting all the evidence in court to support your case.

However, banks also have their own internal policies and procedures that may vary depending on their risk management practices and customer preferences.In the case of repatriation of proceeds from the sale of inherited property, the bank may require certain documents as proof of the source of funds to ensure compliance with the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) regulations. These regulations govern foreign exchange transactions and aim to prevent money laundering, fraud, and other financial crimes.The RBI has issued guidelines on the documentation required for repatriation of proceeds from the sale of inherited property. According to these guidelines, banks should ensure that the remittance is made only after verifying the necessary documents, such as a copy of the probated will or a succession certificate issued by a court of law.However, these guidelines are not exhaustive, and banks may also ask for additional documentation based on their internal policies and risk management practices.

However, the court may not consider the issue of your wife's mental health unless it is relevant to the case, and even then, the court may be reluctant to rely on unproven claims.During the cross-examination, you can ask questions that are relevant to the case and that will help you prove your case. However, the court may disallow questions that are irrelevant or are intended to harass or embarrass the witness. If the judge deems a question to be irrelevant or inappropriate, the judge may sustain an objection from the opposing counsel.Annulment is a legal process by which a marriage is declared null and void. In India, annulment is available only in limited circumstances, such as when the marriage was not consummated or was entered into under coercion or fraud. Mental illness is not generally considered grounds for annulment. If you want to seek a medical examination of your wife, you would need to have a valid reason for doing so and obtain a court order.If custody has not yet been decided, you may have the opportunity to ask questions during the hearing or trial. You may also want to consider hiring a lawyer to represent you in the custody proceedings.Whether or not you can get the 498A case quashed will depend on the specific circumstances of the case.

    "question": "Right of son",
    "answer": "Firstly when your father and his brother had title on their names due to partition or inheritance, the property lost the nature of ancestral property, therefore neither your cousin or now you have any rights over the proeprty since it became self acquired property of your father and his brothers.Secondly the agreement is reported to have been entered into with the buyer in the year 1991 but it was not converted onto sale deed despite passing of 32 years, and also it is not known whether the full sale consideration amount was received by sellers and handed over possession thereon.If it is presumed that the buyer did not pay full sale consideration amount neither the possession of the property was handed over to him then it can be deemed as barred by limitation.The limitation period is just three years.If it was an unregistered sale agreement then in the absence of any attempt made by the buyer now for purchase and the same was not acknowledged by the sellers stating that the agreement is barred by limitation, then the buyer cannot institute any suit seeking for specific relief too.In this regard there is no necessity even to cancel an infructuous sale agreement afresh.The title holders of the property can ignore the sale agreement and proceed to alienate the property in any manner as per their desire.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "answer": "The term “medical negligence” is an omnibus one, which has come in vogue to refer to wrongful actions or omissions of professionals in the field of medicine, in pursuit of their profession, while dealing with patients. It is not a term defined or referred to anywhere in any of the enacted Indian laws.Errors of judgment do not necessarily imply negligence..In the cases involving medical negligence, at the beginning, the person alleging the negligence has the initial onus to make out a case of negligence, and thereafter the onus shifts on to the doctor or the hospital to satisfy that there was no lack of care or diligenceTreatment without informed consent may also amount to negligenceThe existence of doctor–patient relationship is a prerequisite to fasten liability on the doctor.Every patient has a right of self-determination and to reject the treatment even if such rejection were to be considered foolish by most rationale standards, and the medical professional cannot impose his will.In your case there is a possibility of vicarious liability against you, but in my opiniuon this may not lead to a medical negligence.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

However, if the patient signed a consent form, it shows that they were informed about the risks and benefits of the procedure and agreed to undergo it voluntarily. The consent form also shows that the patient was informed about the possibility of complications, including the risk of nerve injury.In the present case, since the same surgeon performed the previous procedure on the same patient without any complications, it suggests that the complications arising in the present case are likely due to factors beyond your control. However, it is important to document everything, including the consent forms, the procedure recordings, and any post-operative follow-up appointments, to demonstrate that you took appropriate measures to provide quality care.It is also advisable to consult with an attorney who specializes in medical malpractice to review the facts of the case and advise you on any further precautions you may need to take.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If the court upholds their claim, the sale may be set aside.If the purchaser sells or tries to sell the property now, the legal status of the sale will depend on whether the sale was valid or not.

    "question": "Sale of ancestor plot and signed consent form",
    "answer": "Dear client,I'm sorry to hear about your father's passing. In regards to your question, it's important to understand the legal ownership and status of the plots of land. If the plots were ancestral property and were divided amongst the heirs through a legal process, then you and your stepbrothers would each have separate ownership of your respective plots. In this case, you may not require a signed consent form or NOC from your stepbrothers for selling your plot.However, it's possible that there may be some legal documentation or agreements between your family members related to the ancestral property that could affect the sale of the plots. It's important to consult with a local lawyer who can review the ownership documents and provide you with the necessary guidance.Regarding the NOC, it's a document that may be required by the buyer to ensure that there are no legal disputes or issues with the property. The NOC is generally issued by the co-owners of the property, but if the plots are already divided and you each have separate ownership, you may not require a NOC from your stepbrothers.If any of the co-owners do not provide the required NOC, it may make the sale process more complicated or delay the sale. However, it's not impossible to sell the property without an NOC, especially if you can provide alternative documentation to prove the ownership and status of the property.If you're concerned about the misuse of your plot with an NOC, you may include specific clauses in the NOC that limit the buyer's rights to use the property in a certain way or require their compliance with certain conditions.Again, it's crucial to seek legal advice and guidance from a local lawyer who can provide you with more specific information and advice based on the laws and regulations in your area.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,If your stepfather has given the two plots of land to your elder stepbrother and the younger stepbrother was a minor at the time of the transfer, then the younger stepbrother cannot claim any right in those plots of land unless he had specifically been named as a beneficiary in the transfer deed.In terms of obtaining a NOC (No Objection Certificate), it is always advisable to have a written document rather than a verbal agreement. Verbal agreements can lead to misunderstandings and disputes in the future. Therefore, it is always better to have a written agreement to avoid any legal complications.In case your stepfather is not willing to provide a NOC, you can consider approaching the court for an injunction to restrain him from creating any third party interest in the property.

The property of HUF should be divided equally amongst the HUF coparceners in accordance with theHindu Succession Act.- However, in the context of an HUF, a coparcener is a person who acquires right in the ancestral property by birth, and hence a minor is also having right to claim share in the property upon partition.- Further, as per law, if aproperty is held for the benefit of the minor, then the karta can sell the property only for legal necessities or for the benefit of the minor.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Sale of ancestor plot and signed consent form",
    "answer": "Dear client,I'm sorry to hear about your father's passing. In regards to your question, it's important to understand the legal ownership and status of the plots of land. If the plots were ancestral property and were divided amongst the heirs through a legal process, then you and your stepbrothers would each have separate ownership of your respective plots. In this case, you may not require a signed consent form or NOC from your stepbrothers for selling your plot.However, it's possible that there may be some legal documentation or agreements between your family members related to the ancestral property that could affect the sale of the plots. It's important to consult with a local lawyer who can review the ownership documents and provide you with the necessary guidance.Regarding the NOC, it's a document that may be required by the buyer to ensure that there are no legal disputes or issues with the property. The NOC is generally issued by the co-owners of the property, but if the plots are already divided and you each have separate ownership, you may not require a NOC from your stepbrothers.If any of the co-owners do not provide the required NOC, it may make the sale process more complicated or delay the sale. However, it's not impossible to sell the property without an NOC, especially if you can provide alternative documentation to prove the ownership and status of the property.If you're concerned about the misuse of your plot with an NOC, you may include specific clauses in the NOC that limit the buyer's rights to use the property in a certain way or require their compliance with certain conditions.Again, it's crucial to seek legal advice and guidance from a local lawyer who can provide you with more specific information and advice based on the laws and regulations in your area.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Verbal agreements can lead to misunderstandings and disputes in the future. Therefore, it is always better to have a written agreement to avoid any legal complications.In case your stepfather is not willing to provide a NOC, you can consider approaching the court for an injunction to restrain him from creating any third party interest in the property.

    "question": "Sale of ancestor plot and signed consent form",
    "answer": "Dear client,I'm sorry to hear about your father's passing. In regards to your question, it's important to understand the legal ownership and status of the plots of land. If the plots were ancestral property and were divided amongst the heirs through a legal process, then you and your stepbrothers would each have separate ownership of your respective plots. In this case, you may not require a signed consent form or NOC from your stepbrothers for selling your plot.However, it's possible that there may be some legal documentation or agreements between your family members related to the ancestral property that could affect the sale of the plots. It's important to consult with a local lawyer who can review the ownership documents and provide you with the necessary guidance.Regarding the NOC, it's a document that may be required by the buyer to ensure that there are no legal disputes or issues with the property. The NOC is generally issued by the co-owners of the property, but if the plots are already divided and you each have separate ownership, you may not require a NOC from your stepbrothers.If any of the co-owners do not provide the required NOC, it may make the sale process more complicated or delay the sale. However, it's not impossible to sell the property without an NOC, especially if you can provide alternative documentation to prove the ownership and status of the property.If you're concerned about the misuse of your plot with an NOC, you may include specific clauses in the NOC that limit the buyer's rights to use the property in a certain way or require their compliance with certain conditions.Again, it's crucial to seek legal advice and guidance from a local lawyer who can provide you with more specific information and advice based on the laws and regulations in your area.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Therefore, the sale made by \"A\" to \"E\" through \"B\" is also invalid.In conclusion, since \"A\" did not have the right to sell the property to \"D\", the sale deed made in favor of \"D\" is invalid.

    "answer": "Police can arrest a person without a warrant if they have reasonable grounds to believe that the person has committed a cognizable offense. However, the law requires the police to inform the person of the reasons for arrest and produce them before a magistrate within 24 hours. Warrant can be issued by a court after due hearing and examination of evidence.If the contractor is changing his statement multiple times in front of the police, it could weaken his credibility as a witness in court. However, the court will ultimately decide the weightage to be given to his testimony based on the evidence and circumstances of the case.If the witnesses and contractor did not submit any ID proof, their statements may not carry much weight in court. However, the court will consider all the evidence presented before it and evaluate its credibility and relevance.If your name and date of birth are mentioned incorrectly in the chargesheet, you can request the court to correct the mistake. The 'whether verified' column indicates whether the information in the chargesheet has been verified by the investigating officer. If he has written 'yes', it means that he has verified the information to the best of his knowledge.In terms of what can be done under these circumstances, it is advisable to continue pursuing the quashing of the FIR and presenting all the evidence in court to support your case.

It is not a term defined or referred to anywhere in any of the enacted Indian laws.Errors of judgment do not necessarily imply negligence..In the cases involving medical negligence, at the beginning, the person alleging the negligence has the initial onus to make out a case of negligence, and thereafter the onus shifts on to the doctor or the hospital to satisfy that there was no lack of care or diligenceTreatment without informed consent may also amount to negligenceThe existence of doctor–patient relationship is a prerequisite to fasten liability on the doctor.Every patient has a right of self-determination and to reject the treatment even if such rejection were to be considered foolish by most rationale standards, and the medical professional cannot impose his will.In your case there is a possibility of vicarious liability against you, but in my opiniuon this may not lead to a medical negligence.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "Medico-legal liability for procedure done by consultant",
    "answer": "dear client,As a practice owner, you may be held liable for the actions of your employees, including the consultant surgeon who performed the procedure on your patient. However, if the patient signed a consent form, it shows that they were informed about the risks and benefits of the procedure and agreed to undergo it voluntarily. The consent form also shows that the patient was informed about the possibility of complications, including the risk of nerve injury.In the present case, since the same surgeon performed the previous procedure on the same patient without any complications, it suggests that the complications arising in the present case are likely due to factors beyond your control. However, it is important to document everything, including the consent forms, the procedure recordings, and any post-operative follow-up appointments, to demonstrate that you took appropriate measures to provide quality care.It is also advisable to consult with an attorney who specializes in medical malpractice to review the facts of the case and advise you on any further precautions you may need to take.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Hey,I am aware that this is not amongst the questions you have asked but however I figured I would ask about this. Is there any strong evidence constituting to cruelty against you based on which the FIR has been filed. If you think that there was no strong evidence as such then why don't you approach the high court to quash the FIR as you will get it out of your way pretty soon and further go ahead with filing the counter cases.Now, the answers to your questions -1. You cannot file an FIR. You would have to file a complaint.2. The discretion is with the police to combine the cases based on the facts and circumstances.3. As such the CPC doesn't make legal notice as mandatory but you would probably have to send the legal notice and give a time period of 7 days for them to either compensate or reply. For the criminal defamation, legal notice is not necessary. You can file a private complaint with the magistrate.4 & 5.

    "question": "False 498A counter cases",
    "answer": "The policeThough an FIR is the first step to achieve justice via criminal mechanism, the FIR is itself not a declaration of the punishment or finality of the allegations made by a complainant/ victim.The Supreme Court of India in the case of Lalita Kumari Versus Govt. of U.P. & Ors. has propounded the principles and law relating to registration of F.I.R.Registration of FIR is mandatory under Section 154 of theCode of Criminal Procedure, if the information discloses commission of a cognizable offence and no preliminary inquiry is permissible in such a situation.If the information received does not disclose a cognizable offence but indicates the necessity for an inquiry, a preliminary inquiry may be conducted only to ascertain whether cognizable offence is disclosed or not.If the inquiry discloses the commission of a cognizable offence, the FIR must be registered. In cases where preliminary inquiry ends in closing the complaint, a copy of the entry of such closure must be supplied to the first informant forthwith and not later than one week. It must disclose reasons in brief for closing the complaint and not proceeding further.The police officer cannot avoid his duty of registering offence if cognizable offence is disclosed. Action must be taken against erring officers who do not register the FIR if information received by him discloses a cognizable offence.The scope of preliminary inquiry is not to verify the veracity or otherwise of the information received but only to ascertain whether the information reveals any cognizable offence.As to what type and in which cases preliminary inquiry is to be conducted will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. The category of cases in which preliminary inquiry may be made are as under:Matrimonial disputes/ family disputesCommercial offencesMedical negligence casesCorruption casesCases where there is abnormal delay/laches in initiating criminal prosecution, for example, over 3 months delay in reporting the matter without satisfactorily explaining the reasons for delay.The aforesaid are only illustrations and not exhaustive of all conditions which may warrant preliminary inquiry.While ensuring and protecting the rights of the accused and the complainant, a preliminary inquiry should be made time bound and in any case it should not exceed fifteen days generally and in exceptional cases, by giving adequate reasons, six weeks time is provided. The fact of such delay and the causes of it must be reflected in the General Diary entry.\"Since the General Diary/Station Diary/Daily Diary is the record of all information received in a police station, we direct that all information relating to cognizable offences, whether resulting in registration of FIR or leading to an inquiry, must be mandatorily and meticulously reflected in the said Diary and the decision to conduct a preliminary inquiry must also be reflected, as mentioned aboveSo you only file a complaint before the police, and if they refuse to register the FIR then approach the court under said section 156(3) crpc. Forget about the sections.The law of defamation is supposed to protect people's reputations from unfair attack. Defamation is all about reputation, and in particular about statements which damage others' reputations. Anything that injures a person's reputation can be defamatory. So before filing a defamation suit, send a notice. You can file a civil and criminal case. You can also ask for the damages in the civil suit.Ajay N SAdvocate, Ernakulam4111 Answers114 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay N S"

None of the offences that you have mentioned can be said to have been committed by her unless at the culmination of a full fledged trial there is a judicial finding recorded that your wife has filed a false case and has led false evidence. The stage of evidence has not even arrived yet, so it is misconceived on your part to conclude that she has led 'false evidence' as envisaged by IPC. Theory and practice of law are diametrically opposite. Even on the touchstone of theory, you are flawed in your view regarding the non-maintainability of cases contemplated by you after your acquittal.2.

It is not a term defined or referred to anywhere in any of the enacted Indian laws.Errors of judgment do not necessarily imply negligence..In the cases involving medical negligence, at the beginning, the person alleging the negligence has the initial onus to make out a case of negligence, and thereafter the onus shifts on to the doctor or the hospital to satisfy that there was no lack of care or diligenceTreatment without informed consent may also amount to negligenceThe existence of doctor–patient relationship is a prerequisite to fasten liability on the doctor.Every patient has a right of self-determination and to reject the treatment even if such rejection were to be considered foolish by most rationale standards, and the medical professional cannot impose his will.In your case there is a possibility of vicarious liability against you, but in my opiniuon this may not lead to a medical negligence.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, VelloreAvailable Now88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan NOW!"

    "question": "What ultimately happens after false 498a and DV cases",
    "answer": "Dear client,In India, false cases or false complaints filed by either the husband or the wife are a matter of concern. However, it is essential to remember that not all cases filed by the wife are false, and it is not a matter of fashion.To answer your questions:The police should investigate any complaint lodged, irrespective of whether it is true or false. However, it is important to note that it is not uncommon for the police to be biased and take sides, which can lead to wrongful arrests.The natural way of progressing these cases is through the legal system. The duration of the case depends on various factors such as the complexity of the case, availability of witnesses, and so on.The case can be dismissed or the accused can be acquitted if there is not enough evidence to prove the charges against them. The burden of proof is on the prosecution, and they need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty.The onus of providing innocence is not on the husband or the accused. It is the responsibility of the prosecution to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.The courts do ask for specific details such as the date, time, and place where the alleged crime took place. However, it is important to note that cases ofdomestic violenceand sexual harassment can be challenging to prove, as there may not always be witnesses or physical evidence.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Legal heir certification for property",
    "answer": "Dear client,It is important to note that legal requirements and procedures for property transactions may vary depending on the specific jurisdiction and circumstances involved. However, in general, a court verdict or order is often considered as the most reliable and legally binding proof of legal heirs in a property dispute.If the loan section of the buyer is not accepting the magistrate declaration about legal heirs, it may be because they require a more definitive and legally binding proof of ownership or transfer of the property. In such cases, it may be necessary to obtain a court order or verdict regarding the legal heirs and their rights to the property.However, it may be worth consulting with a legal expert or a local authority to explore other options or alternatives that may be available in your specific case. For example, there may be other types of certifications or documents that can serve as proof of legal heirs, such as a family tree or genealogical records, which may be acceptable in certain situations.Ultimately, the best course of action would be to seek legal advice from a qualified professional who can provide guidance and assistance in navigating the specific legal requirements and procedures involved in your case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "How to renounce or cancel the registered willby executor",
    "answer": "Dear client,To cancel a registered will, the person who made the will (testator) must execute a new will that explicitly revokes the previous will. The new will must meet the legal requirements for a valid will, such as being in writing, signed by the testator and witnessed by two or more witnesses. The new will must also contain a specific clause that revokes the previous will.Alternatively, the testator can execute a separate document called a revocation of will, which revokes the previous will without creating a new will. This document must also meet the legal requirements for a valid legal document.Once the new will or revocation of will is executed, it should be registered with the relevant authority, such as the sub-registrar of assurances, to ensure that it is legally recognized and enforceable.In your case, if your father's brother is willing to renounce the will, he can execute a document that renounces his rights under the will. This document should also be registered with the relevant authority to ensure that it is legally recognized.It is advisable to seek legal advice from a qualified lawyer who specializes in estate planning and property law to ensure that the cancellation of the will is done in compliance with the legal requirements and procedures in your jurisdiction.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

This could involve agreeing to a limited use of the private road, such as restricting the area allowed to 3 feet, as you suggested.Prepare a response to the legal notice: Your father should prepare a response to the legal notice within the time period specified in the notice. This should be done in consultation with a lawyer who can help prepare a strong legal response.Regarding your question about who is eligible to serve a legal notice, anyone who is authorized by law to serve legal notices can do so.

    "question": "Legal heir certification for property",
    "answer": "Dear client,It is important to note that legal requirements and procedures for property transactions may vary depending on the specific jurisdiction and circumstances involved. However, in general, a court verdict or order is often considered as the most reliable and legally binding proof of legal heirs in a property dispute.If the loan section of the buyer is not accepting the magistrate declaration about legal heirs, it may be because they require a more definitive and legally binding proof of ownership or transfer of the property. In such cases, it may be necessary to obtain a court order or verdict regarding the legal heirs and their rights to the property.However, it may be worth consulting with a legal expert or a local authority to explore other options or alternatives that may be available in your specific case. For example, there may be other types of certifications or documents that can serve as proof of legal heirs, such as a family tree or genealogical records, which may be acceptable in certain situations.Ultimately, the best course of action would be to seek legal advice from a qualified professional who can provide guidance and assistance in navigating the specific legal requirements and procedures involved in your case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "False FIR from contractor and that too on incorrect name",
    "answer": "Police can arrest a person without a warrant if they have reasonable grounds to believe that the person has committed a cognizable offense. However, the law requires the police to inform the person of the reasons for arrest and produce them before a magistrate within 24 hours. Warrant can be issued by a court after due hearing and examination of evidence.If the contractor is changing his statement multiple times in front of the police, it could weaken his credibility as a witness in court. However, the court will ultimately decide the weightage to be given to his testimony based on the evidence and circumstances of the case.If the witnesses and contractor did not submit any ID proof, their statements may not carry much weight in court. However, the court will consider all the evidence presented before it and evaluate its credibility and relevance.If your name and date of birth are mentioned incorrectly in the chargesheet, you can request the court to correct the mistake. The 'whether verified' column indicates whether the information in the chargesheet has been verified by the investigating officer. If he has written 'yes', it means that he has verified the information to the best of his knowledge.In terms of what can be done under these circumstances, it is advisable to continue pursuing the quashing of the FIR and presenting all the evidence in court to support your case. It may also be helpful to seek legal advice from a lawyer who can guide you through the legal process and protect your rights.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Purchase of a property from a person who has received it as a gift deed.",
    "answer": "Dear client,The purchase of a property from a person who has received it as a gift from the original owner can be a complex process, especially if there are legal issues involved. Here are some of the things you need to consider before proceeding with the purchase:Legal issues related to the gift deed: The first thing you need to check is the validity of the gift deed through which the second owner received the property. You need to verify if the gift deed was executed legally and if all the necessary legal requirements were met. You also need to ensure that the property was not encumbered or involved in any legal disputes at the time of the gift.Verification of ownership: You need to verify that the second owner is the legal owner of the property and that there are no other claimants or legal disputes involved. You may need to obtain a title search report and conduct due diligence to ensure that the property is free from any encumbrances.Income tax implications: As per Section 56(2) of the Income Tax Act, gifts received from non-relatives are taxable under certain conditions. You need to check if the second owner has paid any taxes on the gift received or if any taxes are due. You may also need to consult with a tax expert to understand the tax implications of the purchase.Builder's share of land: You need to verify if the first owner has sold or gifted the builder's share of land to any other party. If the first owner has not sold or gifted the builder's share of land to the second owner, then you may need to negotiate with the first owner to purchase the 4.61 sq. yards of land directly from them.Documentation: You need to ensure that all the necessary documentation related to the purchase is in order. This includes the sale agreement, sale deed, and other documents related to the transfer of ownership.In summary, before proceeding with the purchase of the property, you need to verify the validity of the gift deed, ensure that the second owner is the legal owner of the property, understand the income tax implications, check the ownership of the builder's share of land, and ensure that all the necessary documentation is in order. It is advisable to consult with a lawyer or a real estate expert to guide you through the legal process and ensure a smooth purchase of the property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,In general, yes, anyone can give a gift to anyone else if both the donor and donee are willing and the donor has legal rights over the property in question. However, there may be some restrictions or conditions that apply depending on the specific circumstances and the laws of the country or state where the property is located.For example, some countries or states may have laws that limit the amount or type of property that can be gifted without incurring taxes or other obligations. Additionally, if the property in question is subject to a mortgage, lien, or other legal encumbrance, the donor may need to obtain permission from the lender or other interested parties before transferring ownership.It is also important to note that certain relationships may give rise to additional legal considerations. For example, if the donor and donee are family members or spouses, there may be laws that regulate the transfer of property between them, such as community property laws or laws related to inheritance and estate planning.In any case, it is always advisable to seek the advice of a qualified lawyer before making any significant property transfers to ensure that you understand the legal implications and obligations involved.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,In India, false cases or false complaints filed by either the husband or the wife are a matter of concern. However, it is essential to remember that not all cases filed by the wife are false, and it is not a matter of fashion.To answer your questions:The police should investigate any complaint lodged, irrespective of whether it is true or false. However, it is important to note that it is not uncommon for the police to be biased and take sides, which can lead to wrongful arrests.The natural way of progressing these cases is through the legal system. The duration of the case depends on various factors such as the complexity of the case, availability of witnesses, and so on.The case can be dismissed or the accused can be acquitted if there is not enough evidence to prove the charges against them. The burden of proof is on the prosecution, and they need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty.The onus of providing innocence is not on the husband or the accused. It is the responsibility of the prosecution to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.The courts do ask for specific details such as the date, time, and place where the alleged crime took place. However, it is important to note that cases ofdomestic violenceand sexual harassment can be challenging to prove, as there may not always be witnesses or physical evidence.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,It is important to note that legal requirements and procedures for property transactions may vary depending on the specific jurisdiction and circumstances involved. However, in general, a court verdict or order is often considered as the most reliable and legally binding proof of legal heirs in a property dispute.If the loan section of the buyer is not accepting the magistrate declaration about legal heirs, it may be because they require a more definitive and legally binding proof of ownership or transfer of the property. In such cases, it may be necessary to obtain a court order or verdict regarding the legal heirs and their rights to the property.However, it may be worth consulting with a legal expert or a local authority to explore other options or alternatives that may be available in your specific case. For example, there may be other types of certifications or documents that can serve as proof of legal heirs, such as a family tree or genealogical records, which may be acceptable in certain situations.Ultimately, the best course of action would be to seek legal advice from a qualified professional who can provide guidance and assistance in navigating the specific legal requirements and procedures involved in your case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The new will must meet the legal requirements for a valid will, such as being in writing, signed by the testator and witnessed by two or more witnesses. The new will must also contain a specific clause that revokes the previous will.Alternatively, the testator can execute a separate document called a revocation of will, which revokes the previous will without creating a new will. This document must also meet the legal requirements for a valid legal document.Once the new will or revocation of will is executed, it should be registered with the relevant authority, such as the sub-registrar of assurances, to ensure that it is legally recognized and enforceable.In your case, if your father's brother is willing to renounce the will, he can execute a document that renounces his rights under the will. This document should also be registered with the relevant authority to ensure that it is legally recognized.It is advisable to seek legal advice from a qualified lawyer who specializes in estate planning and property law to ensure that the cancellation of the will is done in compliance with the legal requirements and procedures in your jurisdiction.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "- As per Supreme Court, Builder has no right to sell parking to apartment-owners, including stilt parking or garages; .the car parking is a part of the society's common area- Further, the Maharashtra State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission held that a builder has no right to sell stilt parking or open parking, both of which are part of common amenities. The commission ruled that only the housing society's general body could make the allotment of space to flat occupiers.- However, after amending the rules of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act in Maharashtra, it is now permitted to builder to sell parking spaces to the flat buyers legally.- Further, under the new rules, approved parking spaces, both covered and open, can be sold, and also further permitted builders to demarcate such parking spaces sold..Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "Dear client,The purchase of a property from a person who has received it as a gift from the original owner can be a complex process, especially if there are legal issues involved. Here are some of the things you need to consider before proceeding with the purchase:Legal issues related to the gift deed: The first thing you need to check is the validity of the gift deed through which the second owner received the property. You need to verify if the gift deed was executed legally and if all the necessary legal requirements were met. You also need to ensure that the property was not encumbered or involved in any legal disputes at the time of the gift.Verification of ownership: You need to verify that the second owner is the legal owner of the property and that there are no other claimants or legal disputes involved. You may need to obtain a title search report and conduct due diligence to ensure that the property is free from any encumbrances.Income tax implications: As per Section 56(2) of the Income Tax Act, gifts received from non-relatives are taxable under certain conditions. You need to check if the second owner has paid any taxes on the gift received or if any taxes are due. You may also need to consult with a tax expert to understand the tax implications of the purchase.Builder's share of land: You need to verify if the first owner has sold or gifted the builder's share of land to any other party. If the first owner has not sold or gifted the builder's share of land to the second owner, then you may need to negotiate with the first owner to purchase the 4.61 sq. yards of land directly from them.Documentation: You need to ensure that all the necessary documentation related to the purchase is in order. This includes the sale agreement, sale deed, and other documents related to the transfer of ownership.In summary, before proceeding with the purchase of the property, you need to verify the validity of the gift deed, ensure that the second owner is the legal owner of the property, understand the income tax implications, check the ownership of the builder's share of land, and ensure that all the necessary documentation is in order. It is advisable to consult with a lawyer or a real estate expert to guide you through the legal process and ensure a smooth purchase of the property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, there may be some restrictions or conditions that apply depending on the specific circumstances and the laws of the country or state where the property is located.For example, some countries or states may have laws that limit the amount or type of property that can be gifted without incurring taxes or other obligations. Additionally, if the property in question is subject to a mortgage, lien, or other legal encumbrance, the donor may need to obtain permission from the lender or other interested parties before transferring ownership.It is also important to note that certain relationships may give rise to additional legal considerations. For example, if the donor and donee are family members or spouses, there may be laws that regulate the transfer of property between them, such as community property laws or laws related to inheritance and estate planning.In any case, it is always advisable to seek the advice of a qualified lawyer before making any significant property transfers to ensure that you understand the legal implications and obligations involved.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, it is essential to remember that not all cases filed by the wife are false, and it is not a matter of fashion.To answer your questions:The police should investigate any complaint lodged, irrespective of whether it is true or false. However, it is important to note that it is not uncommon for the police to be biased and take sides, which can lead to wrongful arrests.The natural way of progressing these cases is through the legal system. The duration of the case depends on various factors such as the complexity of the case, availability of witnesses, and so on.The case can be dismissed or the accused can be acquitted if there is not enough evidence to prove the charges against them. The burden of proof is on the prosecution, and they need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty.The onus of providing innocence is not on the husband or the accused. It is the responsibility of the prosecution to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.The courts do ask for specific details such as the date, time, and place where the alleged crime took place. However, it is important to note that cases ofdomestic violenceand sexual harassment can be challenging to prove, as there may not always be witnesses or physical evidence.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,If you have sent money to India and have transaction receipts as proof of the transfer, you may be able to initiate legal action to recover your money. However, the legal process can be complex and costly, and it is advisable to consult with a lawyer to explore your options.You can start by sending a demand letter or notice to the family member, stating your claim and requesting repayment of the money. If they fail to respond or refuse to repay, you may consider filing a lawsuit in India.To initiate legal proceedings in India, you may need to hire a lawyer who can file a civil suit on your behalf. The cost of hiring a lawyer may vary depending on the complexity of the case and the lawyer's experience and fees. You may also need to pay court fees and other expenses related to the legal proceedings.It may not be necessary for you to travel to India to pursue legal action. Your lawyer can represent you in court and handle the legal proceedings on your behalf.However, it is important to note that the outcome of a legal case can be unpredictable, and there is no guarantee that you will be able to recover your money. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the costs and potential risks before pursuing legal action.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,In India, false cases or false complaints filed by either the husband or the wife are a matter of concern. However, it is essential to remember that not all cases filed by the wife are false, and it is not a matter of fashion.To answer your questions:The police should investigate any complaint lodged, irrespective of whether it is true or false. However, it is important to note that it is not uncommon for the police to be biased and take sides, which can lead to wrongful arrests.The natural way of progressing these cases is through the legal system. The duration of the case depends on various factors such as the complexity of the case, availability of witnesses, and so on.The case can be dismissed or the accused can be acquitted if there is not enough evidence to prove the charges against them. The burden of proof is on the prosecution, and they need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty.The onus of providing innocence is not on the husband or the accused. It is the responsibility of the prosecution to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.The courts do ask for specific details such as the date, time, and place where the alleged crime took place. However, it is important to note that cases ofdomestic violenceand sexual harassment can be challenging to prove, as there may not always be witnesses or physical evidence.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If during the investigation, the police find evidence against the buyers for criminal conspiracy, they can be added as accused.Yes, you can file a complaint under IPC sections 445 for house-breaking against the unknown persons who broke the lock on your property.If the SHO has refused to lodge an FIR, you can file a complaint with the Superintendent of Police (SP) or with the Magistrate under Section 156(3) of theCriminal Procedure Code(CrPC). If you fear that filing an application under CrPC 156(3) may offend the police officers, you may continue following up with the SP office for a few more days. If there is still no response, you can file the application with the court, and the court will direct the police to register an FIR and investigate the case.Regarding the police asking for the original sale deed, there is no provision in the law that allows them to force you to submit the original document. You can submit a certified copy or a photocopy of the sale deed for their investigation. If the police insist on taking the original, you can request them to give you a receipt for the document, and make a photocopy of it before handing it over to them.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,If you want to raise the issue of your wife's mental health in court, you may need to obtain a medical opinion from a qualified expert to support your claim. However, the court may not consider the issue of your wife's mental health unless it is relevant to the case, and even then, the court may be reluctant to rely on unproven claims.During the cross-examination, you can ask questions that are relevant to the case and that will help you prove your case. However, the court may disallow questions that are irrelevant or are intended to harass or embarrass the witness. If the judge deems a question to be irrelevant or inappropriate, the judge may sustain an objection from the opposing counsel.Annulment is a legal process by which a marriage is declared null and void. In India, annulment is available only in limited circumstances, such as when the marriage was not consummated or was entered into under coercion or fraud. Mental illness is not generally considered grounds for annulment. If you want to seek a medical examination of your wife, you would need to have a valid reason for doing so and obtain a court order.If custody has not yet been decided, you may have the opportunity to ask questions during the hearing or trial. You may also want to consider hiring a lawyer to represent you in the custody proceedings.Whether or not you can get the 498A case quashed will depend on the specific circumstances of the case. You would need to consult with a lawyer who is familiar with criminal law to determine your options.If you want to reopen cross-examination in family court or in a 354A case, you would need to have a valid reason for doing so and obtain a court order.

However, the legal process can be complex and costly, and it is advisable to consult with a lawyer to explore your options.You can start by sending a demand letter or notice to the family member, stating your claim and requesting repayment of the money.

    "question": "Right sections for filing FIR in case of fraudulent sale deed",
    "answer": "Dear client,It is advisable to mention all the relevant IPC sections in the FIR, but ultimately it is up to the police to decide which sections to include based on their investigation.At this stage, it is best to lodge the FIR only against Vishal Gupta, the seller in the fraudulent sale deed. If during the investigation, the police find evidence against the buyers for criminal conspiracy, they can be added as accused.Yes, you can file a complaint under IPC sections 445 for house-breaking against the unknown persons who broke the lock on your property.If the SHO has refused to lodge an FIR, you can file a complaint with the Superintendent of Police (SP) or with the Magistrate under Section 156(3) of theCriminal Procedure Code(CrPC). If you fear that filing an application under CrPC 156(3) may offend the police officers, you may continue following up with the SP office for a few more days. If there is still no response, you can file the application with the court, and the court will direct the police to register an FIR and investigate the case.Regarding the police asking for the original sale deed, there is no provision in the law that allows them to force you to submit the original document. You can submit a certified copy or a photocopy of the sale deed for their investigation. If the police insist on taking the original, you can request them to give you a receipt for the document, and make a photocopy of it before handing it over to them.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "How should I proceed",
    "answer": "Dear client,Firstly, it is important to note that settling the matter with your father-in-law outside of court would not absolve him of his criminal liability for attempting to kill you. The criminal case will continue to be heard in court regardless of any private settlement you may reach with your father-in-law.As for your question regarding a written statement from your father-in-law, such a statement may not hold up in court if he chooses to violate it in the future. It is also important to note that attempting to obtain a written statement from him in exchange for dropping the charges could be considered extortion, which is a criminal offense.If you are concerned about your safety, you may consider obtaining a restraining order against your father-in-law. This would prohibit him from contacting or approaching you and your wife. You can discuss the process of obtaining a restraining order with a lawyer.As for postponing the case, it is not advisable to do so as it could result in negative consequences for you and your case. The best course of action would be to consult with a criminal lawyer who can review the details of your case and provide you with specific legal advice on how to handle the situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,As per the GST Act, if you are a registered taxable person, you are required to charge GST on all taxable supplies of goods or services made by you. Therefore, for all your sale transactions, whether they are intra-state or inter-state, you will have to charge GST to your customers.In your case, you cannot choose to charge GST only for inter-state transactions and not for intra-state transactions. The GST law requires you to charge GST on all taxable supplies made by you.If your turnover is less than Rs. 20 lakhs, you can opt for the Composition Scheme, which allows you to pay GST at a lower rate and also reduces the compliance burden. However, this scheme is not available to businesses engaged in inter-state supplies of goods.If your business is making a profit of only Rs. 10,000 per month, you may consider whether registering for GST is worth the additional overhead. However, if you plan to expand your business in the future, you may want to continue with GST registration so that you are compliant with the law.In addition, you may want to consult with a tax professional or a CA to explore other ways to reduce the cost and burden of GST compliance for your small business.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "How should I proceed",
    "answer": "Dear client,Firstly, it is important to note that settling the matter with your father-in-law outside of court would not absolve him of his criminal liability for attempting to kill you. The criminal case will continue to be heard in court regardless of any private settlement you may reach with your father-in-law.As for your question regarding a written statement from your father-in-law, such a statement may not hold up in court if he chooses to violate it in the future. It is also important to note that attempting to obtain a written statement from him in exchange for dropping the charges could be considered extortion, which is a criminal offense.If you are concerned about your safety, you may consider obtaining a restraining order against your father-in-law. This would prohibit him from contacting or approaching you and your wife. You can discuss the process of obtaining a restraining order with a lawyer.As for postponing the case, it is not advisable to do so as it could result in negative consequences for you and your case. The best course of action would be to consult with a criminal lawyer who can review the details of your case and provide you with specific legal advice on how to handle the situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, if one party wants to cancel the marriage and the other party is not in agreement, then the matter may need to be resolved through legal means.Regarding the possibility of legal action against you and your family, it is important to note that if no dowry has been given or taken, then there can be no dowry case filed against you or your family.

If during the investigation, the police find evidence against the buyers for criminal conspiracy, they can be added as accused.Yes, you can file a complaint under IPC sections 445 for house-breaking against the unknown persons who broke the lock on your property.If the SHO has refused to lodge an FIR, you can file a complaint with the Superintendent of Police (SP) or with the Magistrate under Section 156(3) of theCriminal Procedure Code(CrPC). If you fear that filing an application under CrPC 156(3) may offend the police officers, you may continue following up with the SP office for a few more days. If there is still no response, you can file the application with the court, and the court will direct the police to register an FIR and investigate the case.Regarding the police asking for the original sale deed, there is no provision in the law that allows them to force you to submit the original document. You can submit a certified copy or a photocopy of the sale deed for their investigation. If the police insist on taking the original, you can request them to give you a receipt for the document, and make a photocopy of it before handing it over to them.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Purchase of a property from a person who has received it as a gift deed.",
    "answer": "Dear client,The purchase of a property from a person who has received it as a gift from the original owner can be a complex process, especially if there are legal issues involved. Here are some of the things you need to consider before proceeding with the purchase:Legal issues related to the gift deed: The first thing you need to check is the validity of the gift deed through which the second owner received the property. You need to verify if the gift deed was executed legally and if all the necessary legal requirements were met. You also need to ensure that the property was not encumbered or involved in any legal disputes at the time of the gift.Verification of ownership: You need to verify that the second owner is the legal owner of the property and that there are no other claimants or legal disputes involved. You may need to obtain a title search report and conduct due diligence to ensure that the property is free from any encumbrances.Income tax implications: As per Section 56(2) of the Income Tax Act, gifts received from non-relatives are taxable under certain conditions. You need to check if the second owner has paid any taxes on the gift received or if any taxes are due. You may also need to consult with a tax expert to understand the tax implications of the purchase.Builder's share of land: You need to verify if the first owner has sold or gifted the builder's share of land to any other party. If the first owner has not sold or gifted the builder's share of land to the second owner, then you may need to negotiate with the first owner to purchase the 4.61 sq. yards of land directly from them.Documentation: You need to ensure that all the necessary documentation related to the purchase is in order. This includes the sale agreement, sale deed, and other documents related to the transfer of ownership.In summary, before proceeding with the purchase of the property, you need to verify the validity of the gift deed, ensure that the second owner is the legal owner of the property, understand the income tax implications, check the ownership of the builder's share of land, and ensure that all the necessary documentation is in order. It is advisable to consult with a lawyer or a real estate expert to guide you through the legal process and ensure a smooth purchase of the property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, there may be some restrictions or conditions that apply depending on the specific circumstances and the laws of the country or state where the property is located.For example, some countries or states may have laws that limit the amount or type of property that can be gifted without incurring taxes or other obligations. Additionally, if the property in question is subject to a mortgage, lien, or other legal encumbrance, the donor may need to obtain permission from the lender or other interested parties before transferring ownership.It is also important to note that certain relationships may give rise to additional legal considerations. For example, if the donor and donee are family members or spouses, there may be laws that regulate the transfer of property between them, such as community property laws or laws related to inheritance and estate planning.In any case, it is always advisable to seek the advice of a qualified lawyer before making any significant property transfers to ensure that you understand the legal implications and obligations involved.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "-As per Supreme Court judgment, wife is expected to move in with the relatives of their husbands, follow the rules and customs of their home, and ideally, blend in seamlessly as a new daughter.- Further, the court granted divorce to a man on the grounds of “cruelty” after his wife refused to share a home with her in-laws.- Further, If wife is not supporting her husband for the enjoyment of life and denying relation, then the husband can get divorce after filing a divorce petition before the court on this ground.1. As per law, your wife can claim maintenance for herself and children if she not having sufficient means for her maintenance .- Hence, if you will file a divorce petition, then she can move an application for maintenance in the same court for seeking maintenance.2. If you will file a custody case for seeking the custody of child , then the court will have see the welfare of the child and to grant the custody order and not the maintenance of the child3. For the custody the court is bound to pass its direction firstly on the custody after keeping into consideration for the welfare of the child like education , maintenance , and hence if she is not competent then court cannot grant the custody to her only on the ground that she is a natural mother .5. Yes,6. She can lodge complaint against all the family members after narrating a story before the CWC , and hence your presence before the CWC is needed to reply to her allegations.7.

Your or parents appearance is needed before the CWC , otherwise they can lodge an FIR against you after accepting her compliant .9. You can file custody petition separately for seeking custody of child.10 .If she is not living with you without any sufficient cause then she cannot claim maintenance from you , and further if she is not interested to live with your parents then this is cruelty and a ground for rejection of maintenance as well.You can contact me, if further suggestion needed.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

If both parties agree to cancel the marriage, then it can be done easily without any legal action. However, if one party wants to cancel the marriage and the other party is not in agreement, then the matter may need to be resolved through legal means.Regarding the possibility of legal action against you and your family, it is important to note that if no dowry has been given or taken, then there can be no dowry case filed against you or your family.

    "question": "Purchase of a property from a person who has received it as a gift deed.",
    "answer": "Dear client,The purchase of a property from a person who has received it as a gift from the original owner can be a complex process, especially if there are legal issues involved. Here are some of the things you need to consider before proceeding with the purchase:Legal issues related to the gift deed: The first thing you need to check is the validity of the gift deed through which the second owner received the property. You need to verify if the gift deed was executed legally and if all the necessary legal requirements were met. You also need to ensure that the property was not encumbered or involved in any legal disputes at the time of the gift.Verification of ownership: You need to verify that the second owner is the legal owner of the property and that there are no other claimants or legal disputes involved. You may need to obtain a title search report and conduct due diligence to ensure that the property is free from any encumbrances.Income tax implications: As per Section 56(2) of the Income Tax Act, gifts received from non-relatives are taxable under certain conditions. You need to check if the second owner has paid any taxes on the gift received or if any taxes are due. You may also need to consult with a tax expert to understand the tax implications of the purchase.Builder's share of land: You need to verify if the first owner has sold or gifted the builder's share of land to any other party. If the first owner has not sold or gifted the builder's share of land to the second owner, then you may need to negotiate with the first owner to purchase the 4.61 sq. yards of land directly from them.Documentation: You need to ensure that all the necessary documentation related to the purchase is in order. This includes the sale agreement, sale deed, and other documents related to the transfer of ownership.In summary, before proceeding with the purchase of the property, you need to verify the validity of the gift deed, ensure that the second owner is the legal owner of the property, understand the income tax implications, check the ownership of the builder's share of land, and ensure that all the necessary documentation is in order. It is advisable to consult with a lawyer or a real estate expert to guide you through the legal process and ensure a smooth purchase of the property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,As per the information provided, it appears that you want to cancel the marriage which was earlier scheduled for November but has now been rescheduled to 1st June, and you are concerned that the girl's family may take legal action against you and your family.Under theHindu Marriage Act, a marriage can be called off either by mutual consent or through a court order. If both parties agree to cancel the marriage, then it can be done easily without any legal action. However, if one party wants to cancel the marriage and the other party is not in agreement, then the matter may need to be resolved through legal means.Regarding the possibility of legal action against you and your family, it is important to note that if no dowry has been given or taken, then there can be no dowry case filed against you or your family. However, the girl or her family may decide to file a case of breach of promise to marry or mental harassment against you.It is important to handle the situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,As per the GST Act, if you are a registered taxable person, you are required to charge GST on all taxable supplies of goods or services made by you. Therefore, for all your sale transactions, whether they are intra-state or inter-state, you will have to charge GST to your customers.In your case, you cannot choose to charge GST only for inter-state transactions and not for intra-state transactions. The GST law requires you to charge GST on all taxable supplies made by you.If your turnover is less than Rs. 20 lakhs, you can opt for the Composition Scheme, which allows you to pay GST at a lower rate and also reduces the compliance burden. However, this scheme is not available to businesses engaged in inter-state supplies of goods.If your business is making a profit of only Rs. 10,000 per month, you may consider whether registering for GST is worth the additional overhead. However, if you plan to expand your business in the future, you may want to continue with GST registration so that you are compliant with the law.In addition, you may want to consult with a tax professional or a CA to explore other ways to reduce the cost and burden of GST compliance for your small business.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Marriage cancellation after marriage",
    "answer": "Dear client,As per the information provided, it appears that you want to cancel the marriage which was earlier scheduled for November but has now been rescheduled to 1st June, and you are concerned that the girl's family may take legal action against you and your family.Under theHindu Marriage Act, a marriage can be called off either by mutual consent or through a court order. If both parties agree to cancel the marriage, then it can be done easily without any legal action. However, if one party wants to cancel the marriage and the other party is not in agreement, then the matter may need to be resolved through legal means.Regarding the possibility of legal action against you and your family, it is important to note that if no dowry has been given or taken, then there can be no dowry case filed against you or your family. However, the girl or her family may decide to file a case of breach of promise to marry or mental harassment against you.It is important to handle the situation.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,As per the GST Act, if you are a registered taxable person, you are required to charge GST on all taxable supplies of goods or services made by you. Therefore, for all your sale transactions, whether they are intra-state or inter-state, you will have to charge GST to your customers.In your case, you cannot choose to charge GST only for inter-state transactions and not for intra-state transactions. The GST law requires you to charge GST on all taxable supplies made by you.If your turnover is less than Rs. 20 lakhs, you can opt for the Composition Scheme, which allows you to pay GST at a lower rate and also reduces the compliance burden. However, this scheme is not available to businesses engaged in inter-state supplies of goods.If your business is making a profit of only Rs. 10,000 per month, you may consider whether registering for GST is worth the additional overhead. However, if you plan to expand your business in the future, you may want to continue with GST registration so that you are compliant with the law.In addition, you may want to consult with a tax professional or a CA to explore other ways to reduce the cost and burden of GST compliance for your small business.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "How to remove joint loan ownership in divorce case",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,The following may give solution to your question.==========================================================Joint Ownership of PropertyDifferentiating co-owners and co-borrowersJoint-owners or co-owners are those people who have a share in the said property. More than one person can be the owner of a property. Joint property owners most of the times are spouse or it could be parents, children or siblings. A property can also be jointly owned with anyone- it could be friends, colleagues, distant relatives etc.While there are no restrictions in owning a property with anyone, joint home loans come in with certain restrictions.  Banks do not sanction joint home loans for relations other than husband-wife, parents and children and in certain cases for brothers, provided they have joint ownership.Co-ownership of property not is generally mandatory for considering the income of applicants for a loan. All co-borrowers are equally responsible for repayment of loan taken from the bank.Who is liable to repay the loan?The liability to repay the loan obtained lies equally with all of the applicants. For example, let us suppose that a working couple has applied for a joint home loan and after few years, the wife stopped working and the husband continues paying the loan EMIs by himself. Now if he had temporarily stops working due and the EMIs could not be paid, the bank serves notice for nonpayment against both husband and wife, as they are equally responsible for loan repayment.What happens if you become a loan defaulter?Once you become a loan defaulter, the bank will start the process of taking over your property. They can arrange an auction to sell your house/flat and recover their due amount. If you want to take any action, you need to take before this auction. Apart from this, your credit score will also be hit hard and you might not be eligible for loans in the future. This can be the worst thing to happen to you.What are the options in this situation?The best option for you would be to negotiate with the lender upon this. Banks will be ready to talk you over this issue rather than going through the tiresome process of taking over your asset. You can reach out to them with the past documents of EMI payments for this loan or the previous loans that you have cleared. Let us see what all options you have in hand:1)Ask for a grace period -You can seek a grace period from the bank in order to continue with the EMI payments. You can clearly explain to them the reasons for not being able to pay EMIs such as loss of job or dip in sales of business, etc. Bank may be willing to give you the grace period for resuming EMI payments with some penalty.2)Loan refinancing -There could be a case where the interest rates have gone up and hence you may not afford the increased EMI. You can talk to the bank to restructure or refinance your home loan. They can increase the tenure of the loan as a result of which your EMI would go down. Though this will result in you paying more, it will be better than losing possession of the property.3)      Counseling centers -There are counseling centers to help you with this issue. They would provide you the appropriate options based on your situation. They will also give you fair knowledge on the things to be followed so that you do not fall into a debt trap. Dena Bank has a credit counseling center which does exactly this.4)      Liquidating your investments -This will be the final step that you can resort to, if the above options do not work out for you. You can liquidate your existing investments such as deposits or mutual funds to pay the EMIs. You can also use this amount to make part payment for the loan which will reduce the EMI going forward.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, Bangalore6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar"

    "question": "Purchase of a property from a person who has received it as a gift deed.",
    "answer": "Dear client,The purchase of a property from a person who has received it as a gift from the original owner can be a complex process, especially if there are legal issues involved. Here are some of the things you need to consider before proceeding with the purchase:Legal issues related to the gift deed: The first thing you need to check is the validity of the gift deed through which the second owner received the property. You need to verify if the gift deed was executed legally and if all the necessary legal requirements were met. You also need to ensure that the property was not encumbered or involved in any legal disputes at the time of the gift.Verification of ownership: You need to verify that the second owner is the legal owner of the property and that there are no other claimants or legal disputes involved. You may need to obtain a title search report and conduct due diligence to ensure that the property is free from any encumbrances.Income tax implications: As per Section 56(2) of the Income Tax Act, gifts received from non-relatives are taxable under certain conditions. You need to check if the second owner has paid any taxes on the gift received or if any taxes are due.

However, your birth certificate needs to mention your original name at the time of birth.In such cases where the birth registration is being done after a long period, the authorities generally issue the birth certificate in the current name of the applicant. In your case, as all your documents have the name Anamika Mishra, the birth certificate is likely to be issued with the same name.However, to avoid any confusion or discrepancies in the future, you can also request the authorities to include your original name at the time of birth, i.e., Anamika Tiwari, in the birth certificate along with your current name. This will ensure that both names are mentioned in the certificate, and there is no issue with the name mismatch.It is advisable to consult the concerned authorities in your municipality for further guidance and clarification on the process of birth certificate registration and issuance.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Based on the information you have provided, it seems that you are in the middle of a property dispute with the plaintiff who has filed a case for specific performance and possession, and you have filed a case for permanent injunction. It appears that the plaintiff has not fulfilled their payment obligations as per the Bayana agreement, which resulted in no ownership transfer and no execution of the sale deed.You have mentioned that the plaintiff does not have any funds to revoke this deal, and the actual position of the property is vacant and not rented since 2017. In this case, it is unclear on what basis the plaintiff is making a claim for specific performance, possession, and mesne profit, especially since they have not fulfilled their payment obligations.Regarding the appointment receipt obtained by the plaintiff from the registrar's office, it seems that the third party named XYZ is not a party to the Bayana agreement, and it is unclear on what basis the plaintiff is claiming that this third party has any interest in the property. It is also unclear whether it is legally valid to transfer the rights of ownership to a third party who is not a party to the initial transaction.To verify whether the plaintiff has filed the replication in the specific performance case or not, you can ask your lawyer for updates on the case. Additionally, you can also request a copy of the court proceedings or documents related to the case from the court clerk.In any case, it is important to trust your lawyer and work closely with them to understand the legal process and your options. If you have any concerns or doubts about your lawyer's actions, you can seek a second opinion from another lawyer or legal expert.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Owner's dilemma to rent a house for an educational institution",
    "answer": "Dear client,Renting your house to a businessman who wants to use it for educational purposes can be a good opportunity to generate income, but it's important to take some precautions to protect your interests as a landlord.Firstly, it's a good idea to have a lawyer review the rental agreement before signing it to make sure it's legally sound and includes all necessary clauses to protect your interests. In addition to the clauses you mentioned, you may want to include clauses that address maintenance and repair responsibilities, insurance requirements, and tenant obligations.Regarding the length of the lease, you could negotiate a shorter initial term with an option to renew. For example, you could consider a two-year lease with the option to renew for an additional four years, subject to renegotiation of the rent and other terms.Regarding the structural changes, you could consider having the tenant provide detailed plans and specifications of the proposed changes and require them to obtain all necessary permits and approvals before proceeding. You may also want to consider having the tenant agree to restore the property to its original condition at the end of the lease, at their expense.Alternatively, as you suggested, you could consider a joint venture or partnership arrangement where you have a stake in the educational institution. This could potentially provide you with additional income streams and control over the use of the property, but it also involves additional risks and complexities that should be carefully evaluated.Ultimately, it's important to carefully consider your options, negotiate the terms of the agreement, and have a comprehensive written agreement in place to protect your interests as a landlord.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Permanent injunction",
    "answer": "Dear client,Firstly, it is important to note that family law and criminal law procedures vary by jurisdiction, and it may be helpful to consult with a lawyer who is familiar with the laws and procedures in Tamil Nadu. It may also be helpful to gather any evidence or documentation that could support your case, such as receipts or records of communication.In general, if the husband believes that his family has been falsely accused, he may want to consider seeking legal representation and pursuing any legal options available to him, such as filing for anticipatory bail or challenging the FIR through a quash or discharge petition. If the wife has filed an intervention petition for mediation, the husband may want to consider participating in the mediation process with the assistance of a lawyer.Regarding the previous complaints that were filed by the husband, if they were closed without any action being taken, it may be more difficult to pursue them now. However, if the husband has evidence to support his claims, it may be worth consulting with a lawyer to determine if there are any legal avenues that can be pursued.It is also worth noting that the fact that the husband and wife have been separated for 10 years may be relevant to the case, but the specific impact will depend on the laws and procedures in Tamil Nadu.Again, it is important to consult with a lawyer who is familiar with the laws and procedures in Tamil Nadu to determine the best course of action for the specific circumstances.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Purchase of a property from a person who has received it as a gift deed.",
    "answer": "Dear client,The purchase of a property from a person who has received it as a gift from the original owner can be a complex process, especially if there are legal issues involved. Here are some of the things you need to consider before proceeding with the purchase:Legal issues related to the gift deed: The first thing you need to check is the validity of the gift deed through which the second owner received the property. You need to verify if the gift deed was executed legally and if all the necessary legal requirements were met. You also need to ensure that the property was not encumbered or involved in any legal disputes at the time of the gift.Verification of ownership: You need to verify that the second owner is the legal owner of the property and that there are no other claimants or legal disputes involved. You may need to obtain a title search report and conduct due diligence to ensure that the property is free from any encumbrances.Income tax implications: As per Section 56(2) of the Income Tax Act, gifts received from non-relatives are taxable under certain conditions. You need to check if the second owner has paid any taxes on the gift received or if any taxes are due. You may also need to consult with a tax expert to understand the tax implications of the purchase.Builder's share of land: You need to verify if the first owner has sold or gifted the builder's share of land to any other party. If the first owner has not sold or gifted the builder's share of land to the second owner, then you may need to negotiate with the first owner to purchase the 4.61 sq. yards of land directly from them.Documentation: You need to ensure that all the necessary documentation related to the purchase is in order. This includes the sale agreement, sale deed, and other documents related to the transfer of ownership.In summary, before proceeding with the purchase of the property, you need to verify the validity of the gift deed, ensure that the second owner is the legal owner of the property, understand the income tax implications, check the ownership of the builder's share of land, and ensure that all the necessary documentation is in order. It is advisable to consult with a lawyer or a real estate expert to guide you through the legal process and ensure a smooth purchase of the property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,In general, yes, anyone can give a gift to anyone else if both the donor and donee are willing and the donor has legal rights over the property in question. However, there may be some restrictions or conditions that apply depending on the specific circumstances and the laws of the country or state where the property is located.For example, some countries or states may have laws that limit the amount or type of property that can be gifted without incurring taxes or other obligations. Additionally, if the property in question is subject to a mortgage, lien, or other legal encumbrance, the donor may need to obtain permission from the lender or other interested parties before transferring ownership.It is also important to note that certain relationships may give rise to additional legal considerations. For example, if the donor and donee are family members or spouses, there may be laws that regulate the transfer of property between them, such as community property laws or laws related to inheritance and estate planning.In any case, it is always advisable to seek the advice of a qualified lawyer before making any significant property transfers to ensure that you understand the legal implications and obligations involved.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It appears that the plaintiff has not fulfilled their payment obligations as per the Bayana agreement, which resulted in no ownership transfer and no execution of the sale deed.You have mentioned that the plaintiff does not have any funds to revoke this deal, and the actual position of the property is vacant and not rented since 2017. In this case, it is unclear on what basis the plaintiff is making a claim for specific performance, possession, and mesne profit, especially since they have not fulfilled their payment obligations.Regarding the appointment receipt obtained by the plaintiff from the registrar's office, it seems that the third party named XYZ is not a party to the Bayana agreement, and it is unclear on what basis the plaintiff is claiming that this third party has any interest in the property. It is also unclear whether it is legally valid to transfer the rights of ownership to a third party who is not a party to the initial transaction.To verify whether the plaintiff has filed the replication in the specific performance case or not, you can ask your lawyer for updates on the case. Additionally, you can also request a copy of the court proceedings or documents related to the case from the court clerk.In any case, it is important to trust your lawyer and work closely with them to understand the legal process and your options.

    "question": "Owner's dilemma to rent a house for an educational institution",
    "answer": "Dear client,Renting your house to a businessman who wants to use it for educational purposes can be a good opportunity to generate income, but it's important to take some precautions to protect your interests as a landlord.Firstly, it's a good idea to have a lawyer review the rental agreement before signing it to make sure it's legally sound and includes all necessary clauses to protect your interests. In addition to the clauses you mentioned, you may want to include clauses that address maintenance and repair responsibilities, insurance requirements, and tenant obligations.Regarding the length of the lease, you could negotiate a shorter initial term with an option to renew. For example, you could consider a two-year lease with the option to renew for an additional four years, subject to renegotiation of the rent and other terms.Regarding the structural changes, you could consider having the tenant provide detailed plans and specifications of the proposed changes and require them to obtain all necessary permits and approvals before proceeding. You may also want to consider having the tenant agree to restore the property to its original condition at the end of the lease, at their expense.Alternatively, as you suggested, you could consider a joint venture or partnership arrangement where you have a stake in the educational institution. This could potentially provide you with additional income streams and control over the use of the property, but it also involves additional risks and complexities that should be carefully evaluated.Ultimately, it's important to carefully consider your options, negotiate the terms of the agreement, and have a comprehensive written agreement in place to protect your interests as a landlord.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "How to remove joint loan ownership in divorce case",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,The following may give solution to your question.==========================================================Joint Ownership of PropertyDifferentiating co-owners and co-borrowersJoint-owners or co-owners are those people who have a share in the said property. More than one person can be the owner of a property. Joint property owners most of the times are spouse or it could be parents, children or siblings. A property can also be jointly owned with anyone- it could be friends, colleagues, distant relatives etc.While there are no restrictions in owning a property with anyone, joint home loans come in with certain restrictions.  Banks do not sanction joint home loans for relations other than husband-wife, parents and children and in certain cases for brothers, provided they have joint ownership.Co-ownership of property not is generally mandatory for considering the income of applicants for a loan. All co-borrowers are equally responsible for repayment of loan taken from the bank.Who is liable to repay the loan?The liability to repay the loan obtained lies equally with all of the applicants. For example, let us suppose that a working couple has applied for a joint home loan and after few years, the wife stopped working and the husband continues paying the loan EMIs by himself. Now if he had temporarily stops working due and the EMIs could not be paid, the bank serves notice for nonpayment against both husband and wife, as they are equally responsible for loan repayment.What happens if you become a loan defaulter?Once you become a loan defaulter, the bank will start the process of taking over your property. They can arrange an auction to sell your house/flat and recover their due amount. If you want to take any action, you need to take before this auction. Apart from this, your credit score will also be hit hard and you might not be eligible for loans in the future. This can be the worst thing to happen to you.What are the options in this situation?The best option for you would be to negotiate with the lender upon this. Banks will be ready to talk you over this issue rather than going through the tiresome process of taking over your asset. You can reach out to them with the past documents of EMI payments for this loan or the previous loans that you have cleared. Let us see what all options you have in hand:1)Ask for a grace period -You can seek a grace period from the bank in order to continue with the EMI payments. You can clearly explain to them the reasons for not being able to pay EMIs such as loss of job or dip in sales of business, etc. Bank may be willing to give you the grace period for resuming EMI payments with some penalty.2)Loan refinancing -There could be a case where the interest rates have gone up and hence you may not afford the increased EMI. You can talk to the bank to restructure or refinance your home loan. They can increase the tenure of the loan as a result of which your EMI would go down. Though this will result in you paying more, it will be better than losing possession of the property.3)      Counseling centers -There are counseling centers to help you with this issue. They would provide you the appropriate options based on your situation. They will also give you fair knowledge on the things to be followed so that you do not fall into a debt trap. Dena Bank has a credit counseling center which does exactly this.4)      Liquidating your investments -This will be the final step that you can resort to, if the above options do not work out for you. You can liquidate your existing investments such as deposits or mutual funds to pay the EMIs. You can also use this amount to make part payment for the loan which will reduce the EMI going forward.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, Bangalore6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar"

    "answer": "If you are married as per the French law in France, then you are legally married in France. However, if you plan to live or work in India, it is advisable to register your marriage with the Indian administration.To register your marriage in India, you need to visit the local Registrar of Marriages office in the area where the marriage took place. The documents required for registration may vary depending on the state where you want to register the marriage. The importance of registering the marriage in both countries is to ensure legal validity of the marriage in both countries, and for easy processing of visa and other legal documents.The certificate of registration issued by the local Registrar of Marriages in India will be considered as the primary document. The date of marriage mentioned in the Indian marriage certificate will be considered as the primary date of marriage.For the OCI card, you will need to provide the French marriage certificate and the Indian marriage certificate if you have registered your marriage in India.Apostille is a verification process done for documents to be recognized in another country. It is a form of authentication that certifies the origin of the document.Apostille can be done remotely through an authorized agency or service.

    "question": "Purchase of a property from a person who has received it as a gift deed.",
    "answer": "Dear client,The purchase of a property from a person who has received it as a gift from the original owner can be a complex process, especially if there are legal issues involved. Here are some of the things you need to consider before proceeding with the purchase:Legal issues related to the gift deed: The first thing you need to check is the validity of the gift deed through which the second owner received the property. You need to verify if the gift deed was executed legally and if all the necessary legal requirements were met. You also need to ensure that the property was not encumbered or involved in any legal disputes at the time of the gift.Verification of ownership: You need to verify that the second owner is the legal owner of the property and that there are no other claimants or legal disputes involved. You may need to obtain a title search report and conduct due diligence to ensure that the property is free from any encumbrances.Income tax implications: As per Section 56(2) of the Income Tax Act, gifts received from non-relatives are taxable under certain conditions. You need to check if the second owner has paid any taxes on the gift received or if any taxes are due. You may also need to consult with a tax expert to understand the tax implications of the purchase.Builder's share of land: You need to verify if the first owner has sold or gifted the builder's share of land to any other party. If the first owner has not sold or gifted the builder's share of land to the second owner, then you may need to negotiate with the first owner to purchase the 4.61 sq. yards of land directly from them.Documentation: You need to ensure that all the necessary documentation related to the purchase is in order. This includes the sale agreement, sale deed, and other documents related to the transfer of ownership.In summary, before proceeding with the purchase of the property, you need to verify the validity of the gift deed, ensure that the second owner is the legal owner of the property, understand the income tax implications, check the ownership of the builder's share of land, and ensure that all the necessary documentation is in order. It is advisable to consult with a lawyer or a real estate expert to guide you through the legal process and ensure a smooth purchase of the property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, there may be some restrictions or conditions that apply depending on the specific circumstances and the laws of the country or state where the property is located.For example, some countries or states may have laws that limit the amount or type of property that can be gifted without incurring taxes or other obligations. Additionally, if the property in question is subject to a mortgage, lien, or other legal encumbrance, the donor may need to obtain permission from the lender or other interested parties before transferring ownership.It is also important to note that certain relationships may give rise to additional legal considerations. For example, if the donor and donee are family members or spouses, there may be laws that regulate the transfer of property between them, such as community property laws or laws related to inheritance and estate planning.In any case, it is always advisable to seek the advice of a qualified lawyer before making any significant property transfers to ensure that you understand the legal implications and obligations involved.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, your birth certificate needs to mention your original name at the time of birth.In such cases where the birth registration is being done after a long period, the authorities generally issue the birth certificate in the current name of the applicant. In your case, as all your documents have the name Anamika Mishra, the birth certificate is likely to be issued with the same name.However, to avoid any confusion or discrepancies in the future, you can also request the authorities to include your original name at the time of birth, i.e., Anamika Tiwari, in the birth certificate along with your current name. This will ensure that both names are mentioned in the certificate, and there is no issue with the name mismatch.It is advisable to consult the concerned authorities in your municipality for further guidance and clarification on the process of birth certificate registration and issuance.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,The purchase of a property from a person who has received it as a gift from the original owner can be a complex process, especially if there are legal issues involved. Here are some of the things you need to consider before proceeding with the purchase:Legal issues related to the gift deed: The first thing you need to check is the validity of the gift deed through which the second owner received the property. You need to verify if the gift deed was executed legally and if all the necessary legal requirements were met. You also need to ensure that the property was not encumbered or involved in any legal disputes at the time of the gift.Verification of ownership: You need to verify that the second owner is the legal owner of the property and that there are no other claimants or legal disputes involved. You may need to obtain a title search report and conduct due diligence to ensure that the property is free from any encumbrances.Income tax implications: As per Section 56(2) of the Income Tax Act, gifts received from non-relatives are taxable under certain conditions. You need to check if the second owner has paid any taxes on the gift received or if any taxes are due. You may also need to consult with a tax expert to understand the tax implications of the purchase.Builder's share of land: You need to verify if the first owner has sold or gifted the builder's share of land to any other party. If the first owner has not sold or gifted the builder's share of land to the second owner, then you may need to negotiate with the first owner to purchase the 4.61 sq. yards of land directly from them.Documentation: You need to ensure that all the necessary documentation related to the purchase is in order. This includes the sale agreement, sale deed, and other documents related to the transfer of ownership.In summary, before proceeding with the purchase of the property, you need to verify the validity of the gift deed, ensure that the second owner is the legal owner of the property, understand the income tax implications, check the ownership of the builder's share of land, and ensure that all the necessary documentation is in order. It is advisable to consult with a lawyer or a real estate expert to guide you through the legal process and ensure a smooth purchase of the property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, there may be some restrictions or conditions that apply depending on the specific circumstances and the laws of the country or state where the property is located.For example, some countries or states may have laws that limit the amount or type of property that can be gifted without incurring taxes or other obligations. Additionally, if the property in question is subject to a mortgage, lien, or other legal encumbrance, the donor may need to obtain permission from the lender or other interested parties before transferring ownership.It is also important to note that certain relationships may give rise to additional legal considerations. For example, if the donor and donee are family members or spouses, there may be laws that regulate the transfer of property between them, such as community property laws or laws related to inheritance and estate planning.In any case, it is always advisable to seek the advice of a qualified lawyer before making any significant property transfers to ensure that you understand the legal implications and obligations involved.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Based on the information provided, it appears that \"D\" is the rightful owner of the plot.When \"A\" sold the plot to \"D\" on 19th Dec 2007 through registered Sale Deed, \"A\" did not have the right to sell the property since \"A\" had already sold the same property to \"C\" earlier in May 2007. Therefore, the Sale Deed executed by \"A\" in favor of \"D\" was invalid.Later, on 7th July 2011, \"A\" sold the same property to \"E\" through \"B\" using Agreement of sale cum with GPA (with Possession). However, since \"A\" had already sold the property to \"C\" and subsequently to \"D\", \"A\" did not have any right to sell the property to \"E\". Therefore, the sale made by \"A\" to \"E\" through \"B\" is also invalid.In conclusion, since \"A\" did not have the right to sell the property to \"D\", the sale deed made in favor of \"D\" is invalid. However, since the subsequent sale made by \"A\" to \"E\" through \"B\" is also invalid, \"D\" remains the rightful owner of the property.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Owner's dilemma to rent a house for an educational institution",
    "answer": "Dear client,Renting your house to a businessman who wants to use it for educational purposes can be a good opportunity to generate income, but it's important to take some precautions to protect your interests as a landlord.Firstly, it's a good idea to have a lawyer review the rental agreement before signing it to make sure it's legally sound and includes all necessary clauses to protect your interests. In addition to the clauses you mentioned, you may want to include clauses that address maintenance and repair responsibilities, insurance requirements, and tenant obligations.Regarding the length of the lease, you could negotiate a shorter initial term with an option to renew. For example, you could consider a two-year lease with the option to renew for an additional four years, subject to renegotiation of the rent and other terms.Regarding the structural changes, you could consider having the tenant provide detailed plans and specifications of the proposed changes and require them to obtain all necessary permits and approvals before proceeding. You may also want to consider having the tenant agree to restore the property to its original condition at the end of the lease, at their expense.Alternatively, as you suggested, you could consider a joint venture or partnership arrangement where you have a stake in the educational institution. This could potentially provide you with additional income streams and control over the use of the property, but it also involves additional risks and complexities that should be carefully evaluated.Ultimately, it's important to carefully consider your options, negotiate the terms of the agreement, and have a comprehensive written agreement in place to protect your interests as a landlord.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "How to remove joint loan ownership in divorce case",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,The following may give solution to your question.==========================================================Joint Ownership of PropertyDifferentiating co-owners and co-borrowersJoint-owners or co-owners are those people who have a share in the said property. More than one person can be the owner of a property. Joint property owners most of the times are spouse or it could be parents, children or siblings. A property can also be jointly owned with anyone- it could be friends, colleagues, distant relatives etc.While there are no restrictions in owning a property with anyone, joint home loans come in with certain restrictions.  Banks do not sanction joint home loans for relations other than husband-wife, parents and children and in certain cases for brothers, provided they have joint ownership.Co-ownership of property not is generally mandatory for considering the income of applicants for a loan. All co-borrowers are equally responsible for repayment of loan taken from the bank.Who is liable to repay the loan?The liability to repay the loan obtained lies equally with all of the applicants. For example, let us suppose that a working couple has applied for a joint home loan and after few years, the wife stopped working and the husband continues paying the loan EMIs by himself. Now if he had temporarily stops working due and the EMIs could not be paid, the bank serves notice for nonpayment against both husband and wife, as they are equally responsible for loan repayment.What happens if you become a loan defaulter?Once you become a loan defaulter, the bank will start the process of taking over your property. They can arrange an auction to sell your house/flat and recover their due amount. If you want to take any action, you need to take before this auction. Apart from this, your credit score will also be hit hard and you might not be eligible for loans in the future. This can be the worst thing to happen to you.What are the options in this situation?The best option for you would be to negotiate with the lender upon this. Banks will be ready to talk you over this issue rather than going through the tiresome process of taking over your asset. You can reach out to them with the past documents of EMI payments for this loan or the previous loans that you have cleared. Let us see what all options you have in hand:1)Ask for a grace period -You can seek a grace period from the bank in order to continue with the EMI payments. You can clearly explain to them the reasons for not being able to pay EMIs such as loss of job or dip in sales of business, etc. Bank may be willing to give you the grace period for resuming EMI payments with some penalty.2)Loan refinancing -There could be a case where the interest rates have gone up and hence you may not afford the increased EMI. You can talk to the bank to restructure or refinance your home loan. They can increase the tenure of the loan as a result of which your EMI would go down. Though this will result in you paying more, it will be better than losing possession of the property.3)      Counseling centers -There are counseling centers to help you with this issue. They would provide you the appropriate options based on your situation. They will also give you fair knowledge on the things to be followed so that you do not fall into a debt trap. Dena Bank has a credit counseling center which does exactly this.4)      Liquidating your investments -This will be the final step that you can resort to, if the above options do not work out for you. You can liquidate your existing investments such as deposits or mutual funds to pay the EMIs. You can also use this amount to make part payment for the loan which will reduce the EMI going forward.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, Bangalore6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar"

These requirements are as follows –The exemption is available to individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs)To claim the exemption, the sale proceeds should be used in the following manner –To buy a new residential property one year before the date of sale of the assetTo buy a residential property within 2 years from the date of sale of the assetTo construct a residential property within 3 years from the date of sale of the assetIf you invest a part of the sale proceeds in the property, the full exemption would not be allowed.

However, since the employee resigned after 15 days and the recruitment agency did not provide any candidates, it is appropriate for the company to take action to recover the payment made to the recruitment agency.If the employee has agreed to be responsible for the payment, then the company may have a legal basis to recover the amount paid to the recruitment agency. You should consult with a lawyer who specializes in employment law to understand the legal options available to you in your specific circumstances.In addition to legal action, you may also consider negotiating with the employee to reach a settlement for the repayment of the amount paid to the recruitment agency. This could include discussing a repayment plan or other mutually agreeable terms.It is important to note that any action taken by the company should be based on a careful analysis of the facts and legal considerations, to ensure that the company does not engage in any illegal or unethical practices.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, your birth certificate needs to mention your original name at the time of birth.In such cases where the birth registration is being done after a long period, the authorities generally issue the birth certificate in the current name of the applicant. In your case, as all your documents have the name Anamika Mishra, the birth certificate is likely to be issued with the same name.However, to avoid any confusion or discrepancies in the future, you can also request the authorities to include your original name at the time of birth, i.e., Anamika Tiwari, in the birth certificate along with your current name. This will ensure that both names are mentioned in the certificate, and there is no issue with the name mismatch.It is advisable to consult the concerned authorities in your municipality for further guidance and clarification on the process of birth certificate registration and issuance.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Renting your house to a businessman who wants to use it for educational purposes can be a good opportunity to generate income, but it's important to take some precautions to protect your interests as a landlord.Firstly, it's a good idea to have a lawyer review the rental agreement before signing it to make sure it's legally sound and includes all necessary clauses to protect your interests. In addition to the clauses you mentioned, you may want to include clauses that address maintenance and repair responsibilities, insurance requirements, and tenant obligations.Regarding the length of the lease, you could negotiate a shorter initial term with an option to renew. For example, you could consider a two-year lease with the option to renew for an additional four years, subject to renegotiation of the rent and other terms.Regarding the structural changes, you could consider having the tenant provide detailed plans and specifications of the proposed changes and require them to obtain all necessary permits and approvals before proceeding. You may also want to consider having the tenant agree to restore the property to its original condition at the end of the lease, at their expense.Alternatively, as you suggested, you could consider a joint venture or partnership arrangement where you have a stake in the educational institution. This could potentially provide you with additional income streams and control over the use of the property, but it also involves additional risks and complexities that should be carefully evaluated.Ultimately, it's important to carefully consider your options, negotiate the terms of the agreement, and have a comprehensive written agreement in place to protect your interests as a landlord.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "How to remove joint loan ownership in divorce case",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,The following may give solution to your question.==========================================================Joint Ownership of PropertyDifferentiating co-owners and co-borrowersJoint-owners or co-owners are those people who have a share in the said property. More than one person can be the owner of a property. Joint property owners most of the times are spouse or it could be parents, children or siblings. A property can also be jointly owned with anyone- it could be friends, colleagues, distant relatives etc.While there are no restrictions in owning a property with anyone, joint home loans come in with certain restrictions.  Banks do not sanction joint home loans for relations other than husband-wife, parents and children and in certain cases for brothers, provided they have joint ownership.Co-ownership of property not is generally mandatory for considering the income of applicants for a loan. All co-borrowers are equally responsible for repayment of loan taken from the bank.Who is liable to repay the loan?The liability to repay the loan obtained lies equally with all of the applicants. For example, let us suppose that a working couple has applied for a joint home loan and after few years, the wife stopped working and the husband continues paying the loan EMIs by himself. Now if he had temporarily stops working due and the EMIs could not be paid, the bank serves notice for nonpayment against both husband and wife, as they are equally responsible for loan repayment.What happens if you become a loan defaulter?Once you become a loan defaulter, the bank will start the process of taking over your property. They can arrange an auction to sell your house/flat and recover their due amount. If you want to take any action, you need to take before this auction. Apart from this, your credit score will also be hit hard and you might not be eligible for loans in the future. This can be the worst thing to happen to you.What are the options in this situation?The best option for you would be to negotiate with the lender upon this. Banks will be ready to talk you over this issue rather than going through the tiresome process of taking over your asset. You can reach out to them with the past documents of EMI payments for this loan or the previous loans that you have cleared. Let us see what all options you have in hand:1)Ask for a grace period -You can seek a grace period from the bank in order to continue with the EMI payments. You can clearly explain to them the reasons for not being able to pay EMIs such as loss of job or dip in sales of business, etc. Bank may be willing to give you the grace period for resuming EMI payments with some penalty.2)Loan refinancing -There could be a case where the interest rates have gone up and hence you may not afford the increased EMI. You can talk to the bank to restructure or refinance your home loan. They can increase the tenure of the loan as a result of which your EMI would go down. Though this will result in you paying more, it will be better than losing possession of the property.3)      Counseling centers -There are counseling centers to help you with this issue. They would provide you the appropriate options based on your situation. They will also give you fair knowledge on the things to be followed so that you do not fall into a debt trap. Dena Bank has a credit counseling center which does exactly this.4)      Liquidating your investments -This will be the final step that you can resort to, if the above options do not work out for you. You can liquidate your existing investments such as deposits or mutual funds to pay the EMIs. You can also use this amount to make part payment for the loan which will reduce the EMI going forward.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, Bangalore6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar"

    "question": "How to remove joint loan ownership in divorce case",
    "answer": "Dear Sir,The following may give solution to your question.==========================================================Joint Ownership of PropertyDifferentiating co-owners and co-borrowersJoint-owners or co-owners are those people who have a share in the said property. More than one person can be the owner of a property. Joint property owners most of the times are spouse or it could be parents, children or siblings. A property can also be jointly owned with anyone- it could be friends, colleagues, distant relatives etc.While there are no restrictions in owning a property with anyone, joint home loans come in with certain restrictions.  Banks do not sanction joint home loans for relations other than husband-wife, parents and children and in certain cases for brothers, provided they have joint ownership.Co-ownership of property not is generally mandatory for considering the income of applicants for a loan. All co-borrowers are equally responsible for repayment of loan taken from the bank.Who is liable to repay the loan?The liability to repay the loan obtained lies equally with all of the applicants. For example, let us suppose that a working couple has applied for a joint home loan and after few years, the wife stopped working and the husband continues paying the loan EMIs by himself. Now if he had temporarily stops working due and the EMIs could not be paid, the bank serves notice for nonpayment against both husband and wife, as they are equally responsible for loan repayment.What happens if you become a loan defaulter?Once you become a loan defaulter, the bank will start the process of taking over your property. They can arrange an auction to sell your house/flat and recover their due amount. If you want to take any action, you need to take before this auction. Apart from this, your credit score will also be hit hard and you might not be eligible for loans in the future. This can be the worst thing to happen to you.What are the options in this situation?The best option for you would be to negotiate with the lender upon this. Banks will be ready to talk you over this issue rather than going through the tiresome process of taking over your asset. You can reach out to them with the past documents of EMI payments for this loan or the previous loans that you have cleared. Let us see what all options you have in hand:1)Ask for a grace period -You can seek a grace period from the bank in order to continue with the EMI payments. You can clearly explain to them the reasons for not being able to pay EMIs such as loss of job or dip in sales of business, etc. Bank may be willing to give you the grace period for resuming EMI payments with some penalty.2)Loan refinancing -There could be a case where the interest rates have gone up and hence you may not afford the increased EMI. You can talk to the bank to restructure or refinance your home loan. They can increase the tenure of the loan as a result of which your EMI would go down. Though this will result in you paying more, it will be better than losing possession of the property.3)      Counseling centers -There are counseling centers to help you with this issue. They would provide you the appropriate options based on your situation. They will also give you fair knowledge on the things to be followed so that you do not fall into a debt trap. Dena Bank has a credit counseling center which does exactly this.4)      Liquidating your investments -This will be the final step that you can resort to, if the above options do not work out for you. You can liquidate your existing investments such as deposits or mutual funds to pay the EMIs. You can also use this amount to make part payment for the loan which will reduce the EMI going forward.Kishan Dutt KalaskarAdvocate, Bangalore6196 Answers494 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Kishan Dutt Kalaskar"

In your case, as all your documents have the name Anamika Mishra, the birth certificate is likely to be issued with the same name.However, to avoid any confusion or discrepancies in the future, you can also request the authorities to include your original name at the time of birth, i.e., Anamika Tiwari, in the birth certificate along with your current name. This will ensure that both names are mentioned in the certificate, and there is no issue with the name mismatch.It is advisable to consult the concerned authorities in your municipality for further guidance and clarification on the process of birth certificate registration and issuance.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, your birth certificate needs to mention your original name at the time of birth.In such cases where the birth registration is being done after a long period, the authorities generally issue the birth certificate in the current name of the applicant. In your case, as all your documents have the name Anamika Mishra, the birth certificate is likely to be issued with the same name.However, to avoid any confusion or discrepancies in the future, you can also request the authorities to include your original name at the time of birth, i.e., Anamika Tiwari, in the birth certificate along with your current name. This will ensure that both names are mentioned in the certificate, and there is no issue with the name mismatch.It is advisable to consult the concerned authorities in your municipality for further guidance and clarification on the process of birth certificate registration and issuance.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "If you are married as per the French law in France, then you are legally married in France. However, if you plan to live or work in India, it is advisable to register your marriage with the Indian administration.To register your marriage in India, you need to visit the local Registrar of Marriages office in the area where the marriage took place. The documents required for registration may vary depending on the state where you want to register the marriage. The importance of registering the marriage in both countries is to ensure legal validity of the marriage in both countries, and for easy processing of visa and other legal documents.The certificate of registration issued by the local Registrar of Marriages in India will be considered as the primary document. The date of marriage mentioned in the Indian marriage certificate will be considered as the primary date of marriage.For the OCI card, you will need to provide the French marriage certificate and the Indian marriage certificate if you have registered your marriage in India.Apostille is a verification process done for documents to be recognized in another country.

The attorney may be able to help you explore alternative options to going to court, such as mediation or counseling.Additionally, it may be worth trying to establish contact with your ex-wife and daughter through a neutral third party, such as a family member or mutual friend. This could potentially help you rebuild a relationship with your daughter without resorting to legal action.Overall, it is important to remember that your daughter's best interests should be the top priority.

    "answer": "Dear clientI'm sorry to hear about your situation. It's important to understand that it is never okay for someone to threaten or harm another person in order to collect money that is owed to them. That being said, if you owe someone money, it's important to try to pay them back as soon as possible and in a way that is agreed upon by both parties.Regarding your question about false accusations, it's possible for someone to make false accusations against you, but it's up to the court to determine whether or not those accusations have any merit. If your cousin brother and his friends do decide to take legal action against you, it will be important for you to have evidence of the agreement between you and your cousin, as well as documentation of any payments made or owed.In terms of the court allowing you time to pay back the money, this will depend on the specific circumstances of the case and the judge's decision. However, it is generally possible to negotiate a payment plan with the other party and/or their lawyers in order to avoid legal action.It's important to consult with a lawyer who can provide you with legal advice specific to your case.

    "answer": "Dear client,It is true that when you entered into a contract with Upgrad, you agreed to their terms and conditions. However, this does not mean that you have waived your rights as a consumer or that you cannot challenge their actions if they are unfair or illegal.You can explore legal options to recover your money, such as filing a consumer complaint with the appropriate authorities or taking the matter to court. However, the outcome of such legal proceedings is uncertain and can be time-consuming and expensive.Before taking any legal action, you may want to try to negotiate with Upgrad to reach a mutually acceptable solution. You can explain your situation to them and ask them to consider your request for a refund or a transfer to a later batch. Keep a record of all communication with them, including emails and phone calls, as evidence of your efforts to resolve the issue.You can also seek advice from a consumer rights organization or a lawyer who specializes in consumer law. They can help you understand your legal options and guide you through the process of seeking redress.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Threats of filing false case",
    "answer": "Dear clientI'm sorry to hear about your situation. It's important to understand that it is never okay for someone to threaten or harm another person in order to collect money that is owed to them. That being said, if you owe someone money, it's important to try to pay them back as soon as possible and in a way that is agreed upon by both parties.Regarding your question about false accusations, it's possible for someone to make false accusations against you, but it's up to the court to determine whether or not those accusations have any merit. If your cousin brother and his friends do decide to take legal action against you, it will be important for you to have evidence of the agreement between you and your cousin, as well as documentation of any payments made or owed.In terms of the court allowing you time to pay back the money, this will depend on the specific circumstances of the case and the judge's decision. However, it is generally possible to negotiate a payment plan with the other party and/or their lawyers in order to avoid legal action.It's important to consult with a lawyer who can provide you with legal advice specific to your case. They can help you understand your rights and options, and can also represent you in court if necessary.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"
