First is the constructed part of the building where that purchaser after becoming owner will actually reside, and2. The Second is a proportionate share of the land on which the property is built, and this share of land allotted to the flat buyer is known as an undivided land share orUDS.- Further, if a flat owner has no undivided land share, then he may not be able to sell the property or to get a good amount at the time of selling of that flat in future.- Further, the sum of all the undivided shares for each flat owner must be proportionate to the area of the land in which the apartment has been constructed.- Further In case of co-operative housing societies, the UDS must legally be in the name of the society since the flat owners are the shareholders of the society.- Further, the details of the undivided share of land must be mentioned in the sale agreement, and further the same details should be mention in the Sale deed ,at the time of registering the same .- Hence, the current owner is the owner of the UDS with the other owners if it is an apartment , and the first party cannot claim the same.Pls. don't forget to rating positively.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "Manager Salary Overdue - Civil Suit or CP in Labour Court",
    "answer": "Generally mere nomenclature of designation of a job or the amount of salary is not a decisive factor determining whether the person employed on it is a 'workman' , 'supervisor' or 'manager'. On the other hand, it is the principal and predominant nature of duties actually performed by him as per the orders of the employer.If this man is having the authority to approve leaves of his subordinates, initiate disciplinary action against the subordinates or appraise the performance of his subordinates, he should be called a manager.A manager by designation but does not have the above rights shall only be regarded as a workman, but does not include any person who is employed mainly in a managerial or administrative capacity.The issue of someone is a workman or non- workman is to be decided , when contested, by the adjudicating authority on merits, under the Industrial Disputes Act/ Rules.Therefore, to opine that the said so-called Manager can not knock the doors of the authorities under the said Act, is premature.Whatever, you can issue a legal demand notice demanding your arrears of salary and payment of gratuity amount, let the management give a reply denying or complying with the demands made.You can decide further course of legal action on the basis of the reply given by your employer.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

For example,if you buy a piece of land which is landlocked, you will normally be granted a right of way to pass over the seller's land, so that you can access your own landIt becomes your duty to prove that according to section 15 of the Act, a person claiming the right must establish the same and prove that it is enjoyed peacefully, openly and without interruption for the prescribed period  (20 Years)prior to two years of filing of the suit.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Manager Salary Overdue - Civil Suit or CP in Labour Court",
    "answer": "Generally mere nomenclature of designation of a job or the amount of salary is not a decisive factor determining whether the person employed on it is a 'workman' , 'supervisor' or 'manager'. On the other hand, it is the principal and predominant nature of duties actually performed by him as per the orders of the employer.If this man is having the authority to approve leaves of his subordinates, initiate disciplinary action against the subordinates or appraise the performance of his subordinates, he should be called a manager.A manager by designation but does not have the above rights shall only be regarded as a workman, but does not include any person who is employed mainly in a managerial or administrative capacity.The issue of someone is a workman or non- workman is to be decided , when contested, by the adjudicating authority on merits, under the Industrial Disputes Act/ Rules.Therefore, to opine that the said so-called Manager can not knock the doors of the authorities under the said Act, is premature.Whatever, you can issue a legal demand notice demanding your arrears of salary and payment of gratuity amount, let the management give a reply denying or complying with the demands made.You can decide further course of legal action on the basis of the reply given by your employer.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "As per provisions of CPC, the time limit for filing written statement is 120 days (30 days following service of summons + 90 days grace period). This restriction is solely applicable to commercial cases.CIVIL PROCEDURE CODE, 1908 (CENTRAL ACT NO. 5 OF 1908) (AMENDMENT ACT OF 2002) -- ORDER 8 RULE 1 -- What is the maximum time permissible to file written statement after the expiry of 30 days -- Whether Court has power to extend time beyond 30 days. HELD -- Power to grant extension for filing the written statement stands exhausted no sooner the Court grants 60 days beyond the initial period of 30 days regardless whether the extension is granted is one go or in smaller bits from time to time. After the period of 90 days, the defendant looses the right to file the written statement. Beyond that the Court has no power to grant time beyond 90 days for filing written statement from the date of service of summons.It is to be noticed that if the Written Statement is not filed,the Court is required to pronounce judgment against the defendant. The words \"against him\" are to be found in Rule 10 of Order 9 which obviously means that the judgment will be pronounced against the defendant.In this case as the petition under Order 7 rule 11 had been disposed, the court may reckon the limitation from the date of disposal of the said petition for allowing the time period to file the written statement.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "It appears that you have been given only a life interest in the flat and NOT an absolute interestThat means till the time you are living you can live and reside in that flatSo after the demise of your parents your siblings cannot claim any occupancy right in the flat till you are aliveAs no absolute bequest is made in respect of the flat, it will devolve by intestate succession to you and your siblings each having 1/3rd share in the flatSo after your parents' death you will have 1/3rd undivided share in the flat and absolute right to live in that flat exclusively for your lifetimeYour siblings would have a vested right of 2/3rd undivided share in the flat and their joint occupancy right would be delayed for the time you are aliveAs there is no absolute bequest in your favour, when society goes for redevelopment, the consent/noc has to be given by all the 3 legal heirsThe new rehab flat will be jointly allotted to you and your siblings, however you will have the exclusive right to reside in the new flat for your lifetime. However your siblings 2/3rd undivided share in the new flat will already be thereIf your siblings are willing then they can release their respective 1/3rd share in the flat in your favour by registering a release deedSo if you have a registered release deed from your siblings, you will become the absolute owner of the flat and wont require to probate the WillHowever the society or the builder may require you to submit a legal heirship certificate or a LA to ensure that your title to the flat is clearYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

HELD -- Power to grant extension for filing the written statement stands exhausted no sooner the Court grants 60 days beyond the initial period of 30 days regardless whether the extension is granted is one go or in smaller bits from time to time. After the period of 90 days, the defendant looses the right to file the written statement. Beyond that the Court has no power to grant time beyond 90 days for filing written statement from the date of service of summons.It is to be noticed that if the Written Statement is not filed,the Court is required to pronounce judgment against the defendant. The words \"against him\" are to be found in Rule 10 of Order 9 which obviously means that the judgment will be pronounced against the defendant.In this case as the petition under Order 7 rule 11 had been disposed, the court may reckon the limitation from the date of disposal of the said petition for allowing the time period to file the written statement.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "It appears that you have been given only a life interest in the flat and NOT an absolute interestThat means till the time you are living you can live and reside in that flatSo after the demise of your parents your siblings cannot claim any occupancy right in the flat till you are aliveAs no absolute bequest is made in respect of the flat, it will devolve by intestate succession to you and your siblings each having 1/3rd share in the flatSo after your parents' death you will have 1/3rd undivided share in the flat and absolute right to live in that flat exclusively for your lifetimeYour siblings would have a vested right of 2/3rd undivided share in the flat and their joint occupancy right would be delayed for the time you are aliveAs there is no absolute bequest in your favour, when society goes for redevelopment, the consent/noc has to be given by all the 3 legal heirsThe new rehab flat will be jointly allotted to you and your siblings, however you will have the exclusive right to reside in the new flat for your lifetime. However your siblings 2/3rd undivided share in the new flat will already be thereIf your siblings are willing then they can release their respective 1/3rd share in the flat in your favour by registering a release deedSo if you have a registered release deed from your siblings, you will become the absolute owner of the flat and wont require to probate the WillHowever the society or the builder may require you to submit a legal heirship certificate or a LA to ensure that your title to the flat is clearYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

This restriction is solely applicable to commercial cases.CIVIL PROCEDURE CODE, 1908 (CENTRAL ACT NO. 5 OF 1908) (AMENDMENT ACT OF 2002) -- ORDER 8 RULE 1 -- What is the maximum time permissible to file written statement after the expiry of 30 days -- Whether Court has power to extend time beyond 30 days. HELD -- Power to grant extension for filing the written statement stands exhausted no sooner the Court grants 60 days beyond the initial period of 30 days regardless whether the extension is granted is one go or in smaller bits from time to time. After the period of 90 days, the defendant looses the right to file the written statement. Beyond that the Court has no power to grant time beyond 90 days for filing written statement from the date of service of summons.It is to be noticed that if the Written Statement is not filed,the Court is required to pronounce judgment against the defendant. The words \"against him\" are to be found in Rule 10 of Order 9 which obviously means that the judgment will be pronounced against the defendant.In this case as the petition under Order 7 rule 11 had been disposed, the court may reckon the limitation from the date of disposal of the said petition for allowing the time period to file the written statement.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

Such legatee as you, will only have life interest to reside the property. As there is categorical bar against transfer by sale or gift, the intention of testator is expressly against absolute transfer of property to you.

This restriction is solely applicable to commercial cases.CIVIL PROCEDURE CODE, 1908 (CENTRAL ACT NO. 5 OF 1908) (AMENDMENT ACT OF 2002) -- ORDER 8 RULE 1 -- What is the maximum time permissible to file written statement after the expiry of 30 days -- Whether Court has power to extend time beyond 30 days. HELD -- Power to grant extension for filing the written statement stands exhausted no sooner the Court grants 60 days beyond the initial period of 30 days regardless whether the extension is granted is one go or in smaller bits from time to time. After the period of 90 days, the defendant looses the right to file the written statement. Beyond that the Court has no power to grant time beyond 90 days for filing written statement from the date of service of summons.It is to be noticed that if the Written Statement is not filed,the Court is required to pronounce judgment against the defendant. The words \"against him\" are to be found in Rule 10 of Order 9 which obviously means that the judgment will be pronounced against the defendant.In this case as the petition under Order 7 rule 11 had been disposed, the court may reckon the limitation from the date of disposal of the said petition for allowing the time period to file the written statement.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

The warrants would be cancelled once the accused person has appeared before the court. From next date onwards if any accused person fails to appear before the court you can ask your advocate to move an exemption application citing the reasons for their non appearance.There are ways to to find out whether any look out circular has been issued in your name. You can contact any criminal lawyer for the same from this portal.You can adduce the documentary evidence in your favour during the trial to disprove her allegations and the same can be put worth to her witnesses during cross examinations.Simultaneously, you can also file for quashing of FIR in High Court where you can adduce the evidence in your favour in order to disprove their case and to get the FIR quashed.

    "answer": "\\- As per Supreme Court judgment, wife is expected to move in with the relatives of their husbands, follow the rules and customs of their home, and ideally, blend in seamlessly as a new daughter.- Further, the court granted divorce to a man on the grounds of “cruelty” after his wife refused to share a home with her in-laws.- Further, If wife is not supporting her husband for the enjoyment of life and denying relation, then the husband can get divorce after filing a divorce petition before the court on this ground.- Since, your parents are also included as accused in her case, then they can apply for getting anticipatory bail from the session court , and surely they will get the same- Further, they can also file a petition before the High Court for removing their names in the FIR and also for quash the FIR against them- Since, the charge sheet has already filed then the appearance on each and every dates of hearing is mandatory , otherwise court can issue warrants against the accused.- If your parents will appear before the Court on the next date of hearing , then the bailable warrant issued against them will be cancelled automatically.- However, if your parents are senior citizens ,then they can get permanently exemption from appearance from the court .- If LOC issued then it is mandatory that the accused should be informed for the said notice has been issued against him, but generally an accused person comes to know about such notice only when he/she is stopped or arrested by the immigration authorities at the airport/border etc.- Hence, you can enquire for knowing about the LOC from the court itself with the help of a lawyer.You can contact me , if further suggestion needed.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

Insurer is advising you to sell the vehicle and if there is any shortfall in selling price, that shortfall will be made up by insurer. You are entitled to recover the costs of repair from insurer. You cannot be forced to sell the vehicle. Contractual obligation to pay costs of repairs overrides their policy terms. You can issue a lawyer's notice and file a complaint in District Consumer Commission under new District Consumer Commission. You will get costs of repairs with interest, compensation  for mental harassment, costs of complaint and lawyer's fee.

You can make a written request to the society for a copy of the signed resolution and if they refuse to provide it, you can escalate the matter to higher authorities such as the Registrar of Societies or a consumer court.Before making any payment, it is important to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the terms of the resolution and that the payment is made only in accordance with those terms. You can consider sending a written communication to the society stating that you are willing to pay the full amount as per the resolution, but only if the society provides you with a copy of the signed resolution.It is also important to keep a record of all communication with the society, including emails, letters, and WhatsApp messages. If the society makes any further demands after the payment is made, you can use these records to demonstrate that you have already paid the amount as per the resolution and that any further demands are illegal.If the society continues to withhold the signed resolution or makes further demands after payment is made, you may need to seek legal assistance to protect your rights and interests.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "The property will devolve on all the legal heirs in proportion to their rights in the property and the law of succession would be as per Muslim law of inheritance.In general, the guardian or the mother of the minor children has to obtain permission from court to sell the share of minor legal heirs by filing a petition giving substantial reasons to sell the shares of the minor legal heirs.The court after being convinced may permit the mother or the natural guardian to sell the share of the minor children .The document writer may tell plenty of lies in order to sustain his business, he may even bribe the registrar to get the property registered flouting the law and rules, but if the minor after becoming major by age and files a suit for partition at a later stage then you may have to run behind court and home with unnecessary litigation in this regard.It is always advisable to obtain proper legal opinion on the title of the property and other aspects before buying the property and can proceed only if recommended.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "- As per law, aMutual Consent Divorcegranted by foreign Court is considered as valid, legal and binding in Indian Courts by virtue of section 13 and 14 of CPC and also on account of comity of Nations.- Further, if the matter is contested between parties in US Court, and after due adjudication and trial, divorce is granted, then it will be valid and binding in India.- Further, if the matter is uncontested, one party comes back to India where marriage had taken place and contest proceedings in India, divorce as granted by US Court will not be applicable in India.- Since, that divorce by the US Court was granted in your absence , then that decree of divorce is fully invalid in India , and the said Indian court cannot consider that order as valid, and for passing decree of divorce.- Further, the said Indian court is bound to pass its ex-parte decree of divorce without considering that invalid decree of US Court.- Hence, no need to arrange that US decree of divorce for obtaining divorce  from Indian Court.- Further, the decree of divorce granted by the India Court in the absence of your husband will be valid legally.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

It is important to follow legal procedures and not take any actions that may put you in legal trouble.If the police are not providing assistance, then you can file a petition in the court seeking police protection. While it may be difficult to get police protection for a civil case involving construction, it is not impossible. You can also consider hiring private security to protect the property until the case is resolved.Regarding the appeal case, it is important to continue pursuing it and seeking legal advice from a qualified lawyer. If the appeal is successful, then the court can issue an order for possession, which should be enforced by the police.In the meantime, document any incidents of harassment or obstruction by the other party or their goons, as this can be used as evidence in court. Keep all communication with them civil and professional, and do not engage in any confrontations.I would recommend seeking the advice of a lawyer who specializes in property and civil disputes to help guide you through this process.

    "answer": "The exparte divorce obtained by your husband in USA is not valid in India.The 'no fault divorce' decree granted by US court is not legally valid or recognised as legally valid divorce for the marriages conducted in India as per Indian laws.A divorce decree obtained in a Foreign Country will not be recognized in India when it is not satisfied the condition that even though the opposite side may have been served but not appearing and the decision was taken in the absence of another party to the case.Parties to the divorce must have had the opportunity to represent their case in the foreign court. To recognize a foreign divorce decree, the court in India will ensure that there was fairness, good faith, and diligence of each party.Indian courts will not recognize a divorce decree obtained in the US if the grounds are not recognized by the Indian divorce law.If the family court in India is not passing a divorce decree even after satisfying the grounds pleaded in the petition for divorce and arguments made in your favor, you may prefer an appeal before high court agaisnt the decision.You can inform the court since the divorce granted by US court has no validity as per Indian laws, there is no necessity for you to produce the divorce decree copies before this court, but since you have filed the divorce case here, the court may be requested to pass orders on merits.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

However he can get at max 35% extra area and accordingly he can provide bigger rehab flats to the tenantsso whatever FSI is needed to construct the rehab flats for tenants, the developer can apply for upto 35% extra FSI of the FSI needed to construct rehab flats, from the BMC, and give rehab flats of bigger area to the tenantsYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "Grandfather's undivided property sold without intimation. need to get back the property",
    "answer": "Hi. Hope you're doing well.If your grandfather died without a will, then his property would devolve equally among his first class heirs, as given under theHindu Succession Act. This means that a notional partition had been effected at the time of your grandfather's death and your father's share would then be considered to be his self acquired property. After your father's death, his share in the property would belong to your father's class one heir and your uncles would have no right over his share. Since your uncles have already sold the property, you can either file a court case and get the sale to be declared void. Or you can ask your uncles to pay you for your father's share of the property.For any further inquiry or consultation, feel free to contact me.Regards,Siddharth JainSiddharth JainAdvocate, New Delhi6464 Answers102 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Siddharth Jain"

    "question": "Property Dispute with local goons",
    "answer": "I understand this is a difficult situation. It is important to follow legal procedures and not take any actions that may put you in legal trouble.If the police are not providing assistance, then you can file a petition in the court seeking police protection. While it may be difficult to get police protection for a civil case involving construction, it is not impossible. You can also consider hiring private security to protect the property until the case is resolved.Regarding the appeal case, it is important to continue pursuing it and seeking legal advice from a qualified lawyer. If the appeal is successful, then the court can issue an order for possession, which should be enforced by the police.In the meantime, document any incidents of harassment or obstruction by the other party or their goons, as this can be used as evidence in court. Keep all communication with them civil and professional, and do not engage in any confrontations.I would recommend seeking the advice of a lawyer who specializes in property and civil disputes to help guide you through this process.

    "answer": "Muslim law of inheritance is quite different from Hindu law of inheritance. Distribution of property among male and female is not in equal proportions. Share of a male heir is double then the female heir. But as your intention is to sell of the property, there is no need to seek distribution of property among legal hire. All legal highers can give NOCs for mutation of property in favour of legal higher in India. This can be done through GPA executed by citizens of U. S. in favour of such legal higher. After mutation of properties such heir can sell the property with no objection certificate by other legal highers again through GPA executed in USA in favour of such legal heir. Both the GPAs should be attested by Indian Embassy in USA. The whole process will take about 2 months.Ravi ShindeAdvocate, Hyderabad4923 Answers42 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ravi Shinde"

    "answer": "- As per Muslim law, after the demise of your father intestate , his property would be devolved upon all his legal heirs-  Further, there is no distinction between the right of men and women; each has right over the said property.- However, a female will get half of the male share.- Further, out of 100% share, share of mother will be 12.5%. and the remaining 87.5% will be distributed between sons and daughters. .1. Since, the property claimants are your brother , sister and mother , then you can take POA from them in your favor for selling the property- The said POA should be notarized as per rule of UK and attested from the consulate of India.2.  May be possible , if you engage a lawyer for the said work done.3.

In some cases, the party actually will sue you, while in other cases, they won't. Whatever you do, though, don't ignore the letter or you risk having the other party commence a lawsuit against you.Discuss with your lawyer how to save evidence, such as texts, emails, and copies of your website.

You can make a written request to the society for a copy of the signed resolution and if they refuse to provide it, you can escalate the matter to higher authorities such as the Registrar of Societies or a consumer court.Before making any payment, it is important to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the terms of the resolution and that the payment is made only in accordance with those terms. You can consider sending a written communication to the society stating that you are willing to pay the full amount as per the resolution, but only if the society provides you with a copy of the signed resolution.It is also important to keep a record of all communication with the society, including emails, letters, and WhatsApp messages. If the society makes any further demands after the payment is made, you can use these records to demonstrate that you have already paid the amount as per the resolution and that any further demands are illegal.If the society continues to withhold the signed resolution or makes further demands after payment is made, you may need to seek legal assistance to protect your rights and interests.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However he can get at max 35% extra area and accordingly he can provide bigger rehab flats to the tenantsso whatever FSI is needed to construct the rehab flats for tenants, the developer can apply for upto 35% extra FSI of the FSI needed to construct rehab flats, from the BMC, and give rehab flats of bigger area to the tenantsYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "question": "P.O. is on O.D.",
    "answer": "Dear client,The phrase \"IA 787 of 22 is dismissed\" refers to an interlocutory application (IA) filed in a divorce proceeding. In this case, IA 787, which was filed in the year 2022, has been dismissed by the court.An interlocutory application is a request or motion filed by one party during the course of a legal proceeding, seeking a specific order or direction from the court. It is a procedural step taken within the larger legal case.When an IA is dismissed, it means that the court has rejected the application and the relief sought by the party filing it. The court may have found the application to be without merit or not supported by sufficient evidence, or it may have determined that the relief requested is not appropriate in the given circumstances.The dismissal of an IA does not necessarily determine the final outcome of the overall divorce proceeding. It simply means that the specific application has been denied. The divorce case may still continue, and other issues and applications can be addressed separately.It is advisable to consult with your legal counsel or the concerned court for further clarification and to understand the impact of the dismissal on your particular case. They will be able to provide you with specific guidance and advice based on the details of your divorce proceedings.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However he can get at max 35% extra area and accordingly he can provide bigger rehab flats to the tenantsso whatever FSI is needed to construct the rehab flats for tenants, the developer can apply for upto 35% extra FSI of the FSI needed to construct rehab flats, from the BMC, and give rehab flats of bigger area to the tenantsYusuf RampurawalaAdvocate, Mumbai7819 Answers79 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Yusuf Rampurawala"

    "answer": "- As per Supreme Court , when an employee is held guilty and penalized and is, therefore, not promoted at least till the date on which he is penalized, he could not be said to have been subjected to a further penalty on that account. Denial of promotion to the employee in such circumstances was not a penalty but a necessary consequence of his conduct.- Further, in cases where, after completion of the disciplinary proceedings, an officer has been punished with minor penalties, he shall be given promotion from the date his immediate junior has been given promotion and his pay will be notionally fixed in the time scale of the higher grade with effect from that date.- Further , in cases where an officer has been punished with minor punishment of “suspension” then the officer cannot get promotion with retrospective effect. In such cases, the date of promotion of the officer concerned will be postponed by the period for which he was actually under suspension.- Since, your promotion was already effected by that punishment and you was degraded , then on the ground of qualifying the FAIIB and CAIIB your promotion & increment cannot be stopped .- You can issue a legal notice and on refusal file a Writ Petition before the High Court.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "Hello,You have to prove that there has been no “neglect or refusal” on your part to maintain your wife in order to succeed. Whether you are able to do so will depend on the full facts of your case and evidence you produce to establish them. To the extent it is feasible, you’d do well to provide the court with proof of money spent on your wife. I know it isn’t always possible to keep track of such expenses.The Supreme Court in a recent case remarked that maintenance equal to 25 percent of husband’s net salary is generally just and proper. However, the Court was clear it wasn’t laying down a hard and fast rule. It was quick to note that maintenance depends “on the factual situation of the case and the court would be justified in moulding the claim for maintenance passed on various factors.” The case is Kalyan Dey Chowdhury vs Rita Dey Chowdhury Nee Nandy (Civil Appeal no.5369 of 2017).In the facts of your case, please impress upon the court that you also have your father to look after. That must entail an added expense. You must highlight your status as the lone bread winner who has is responsible for maintaining the whole family. And you are entitled to maintain yourself as well.Hope that answers your question.Pulkit ChandnaAdvocate, New Delhi208 Answers5 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Pulkit Chandna"

    "question": "Stoppage of Professional Qualification Increments",
    "answer": "- As per Supreme Court , when an employee is held guilty and penalized and is, therefore, not promoted at least till the date on which he is penalized, he could not be said to have been subjected to a further penalty on that account. Denial of promotion to the employee in such circumstances was not a penalty but a necessary consequence of his conduct.- Further, in cases where, after completion of the disciplinary proceedings, an officer has been punished with minor penalties, he shall be given promotion from the date his immediate junior has been given promotion and his pay will be notionally fixed in the time scale of the higher grade with effect from that date.- Further , in cases where an officer has been punished with minor punishment of “suspension” then the officer cannot get promotion with retrospective effect. In such cases, the date of promotion of the officer concerned will be postponed by the period for which he was actually under suspension.- Since, your promotion was already effected by that punishment and you was degraded , then on the ground of qualifying the FAIIB and CAIIB your promotion & increment cannot be stopped .- You can issue a legal notice and on refusal file a Writ Petition before the High Court.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "question": "CrPC 125 petition for Maintenance Allowance",
    "answer": "Hello,You have to prove that there has been no “neglect or refusal” on your part to maintain your wife in order to succeed. Whether you are able to do so will depend on the full facts of your case and evidence you produce to establish them. To the extent it is feasible, you’d do well to provide the court with proof of money spent on your wife. I know it isn’t always possible to keep track of such expenses.The Supreme Court in a recent case remarked that maintenance equal to 25 percent of husband’s net salary is generally just and proper. However, the Court was clear it wasn’t laying down a hard and fast rule. It was quick to note that maintenance depends “on the factual situation of the case and the court would be justified in moulding the claim for maintenance passed on various factors.” The case is Kalyan Dey Chowdhury vs Rita Dey Chowdhury Nee Nandy (Civil Appeal no.5369 of 2017).In the facts of your case, please impress upon the court that you also have your father to look after. That must entail an added expense. You must highlight your status as the lone bread winner who has is responsible for maintaining the whole family. And you are entitled to maintain yourself as well.Hope that answers your question.Pulkit ChandnaAdvocate, New Delhi208 Answers5 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Pulkit Chandna"

    "question": "Stoppage of Professional Qualification Increments",
    "answer": "- As per Supreme Court , when an employee is held guilty and penalized and is, therefore, not promoted at least till the date on which he is penalized, he could not be said to have been subjected to a further penalty on that account. Denial of promotion to the employee in such circumstances was not a penalty but a necessary consequence of his conduct.- Further, in cases where, after completion of the disciplinary proceedings, an officer has been punished with minor penalties, he shall be given promotion from the date his immediate junior has been given promotion and his pay will be notionally fixed in the time scale of the higher grade with effect from that date.- Further , in cases where an officer has been punished with minor punishment of “suspension” then the officer cannot get promotion with retrospective effect. In such cases, the date of promotion of the officer concerned will be postponed by the period for which he was actually under suspension.- Since, your promotion was already effected by that punishment and you was degraded , then on the ground of qualifying the FAIIB and CAIIB your promotion & increment cannot be stopped .- You can issue a legal notice and on refusal file a Writ Petition before the High Court.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

You can consider sending a written communication to the society stating that you are willing to pay the full amount as per the resolution, but only if the society provides you with a copy of the signed resolution.It is also important to keep a record of all communication with the society, including emails, letters, and WhatsApp messages. If the society makes any further demands after the payment is made, you can use these records to demonstrate that you have already paid the amount as per the resolution and that any further demands are illegal.If the society continues to withhold the signed resolution or makes further demands after payment is made, you may need to seek legal assistance to protect your rights and interests.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Whether you are able to do so will depend on the full facts of your case and evidence you produce to establish them. To the extent it is feasible, you’d do well to provide the court with proof of money spent on your wife. I know it isn’t always possible to keep track of such expenses.The Supreme Court in a recent case remarked that maintenance equal to 25 percent of husband’s net salary is generally just and proper. However, the Court was clear it wasn’t laying down a hard and fast rule. It was quick to note that maintenance depends “on the factual situation of the case and the court would be justified in moulding the claim for maintenance passed on various factors.” The case is Kalyan Dey Chowdhury vs Rita Dey Chowdhury Nee Nandy (Civil Appeal no.5369 of 2017).In the facts of your case, please impress upon the court that you also have your father to look after. That must entail an added expense. You must highlight your status as the lone bread winner who has is responsible for maintaining the whole family. And you are entitled to maintain yourself as well.Hope that answers your question.Pulkit ChandnaAdvocate, New Delhi208 Answers5 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Pulkit Chandna"

You can make a written request to the society for a copy of the signed resolution and if they refuse to provide it, you can escalate the matter to higher authorities such as the Registrar of Societies or a consumer court.Before making any payment, it is important to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the terms of the resolution and that the payment is made only in accordance with those terms. You can consider sending a written communication to the society stating that you are willing to pay the full amount as per the resolution, but only if the society provides you with a copy of the signed resolution.It is also important to keep a record of all communication with the society, including emails, letters, and WhatsApp messages. If the society makes any further demands after the payment is made, you can use these records to demonstrate that you have already paid the amount as per the resolution and that any further demands are illegal.If the society continues to withhold the signed resolution or makes further demands after payment is made, you may need to seek legal assistance to protect your rights and interests.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Hello,You have to prove that there has been no “neglect or refusal” on your part to maintain your wife in order to succeed. Whether you are able to do so will depend on the full facts of your case and evidence you produce to establish them. To the extent it is feasible, you’d do well to provide the court with proof of money spent on your wife. I know it isn’t always possible to keep track of such expenses.The Supreme Court in a recent case remarked that maintenance equal to 25 percent of husband’s net salary is generally just and proper. However, the Court was clear it wasn’t laying down a hard and fast rule. It was quick to note that maintenance depends “on the factual situation of the case and the court would be justified in moulding the claim for maintenance passed on various factors.” The case is Kalyan Dey Chowdhury vs Rita Dey Chowdhury Nee Nandy (Civil Appeal no.5369 of 2017).In the facts of your case, please impress upon the court that you also have your father to look after. That must entail an added expense. You must highlight your status as the lone bread winner who has is responsible for maintaining the whole family. And you are entitled to maintain yourself as well.Hope that answers your question.Pulkit ChandnaAdvocate, New Delhi208 Answers5 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Pulkit Chandna"

A decree which is not affected by section 13 does not need to be validated in India and will be considered conclusive under Section 14 of the Civil Procedure Act.Under section 14 of CPC : The Court shall presume upon the production of any document purporting to be a certified copy of aforeign judgment, that such judgment was pronounced by a Court of competent jurisdiction, unless the contrary appears on the record; but such presumption may be displaced by proving want of jurisdiction.Thus there may not be a necessity to validate the divorce decree granted by the Germany court.You can get the judgment translated to English and get it apostilled and attested by a notary public or by Indian consulate, then produce the copy before the registrar to register your remarriage in India.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Divorce in Germany needs to be validated in India",
    "answer": "Hello,You don’t need an Indian court to validate or confirm your foreign divorce. It is not ordinarily required.As per Indian private international law, your divorce is valid in India. This is because it is a foreign divorce decree obtained by mutual consent. Indian law recognises such divorces even though the foreign court is not a court setup under the applicable law (Special Marriage Actin your case).Ordinarily, parties don’t go to Indian courts in such situations unless their ex-wife or ex-husband questions the foreign divorce (say by bringing a maintenance proceeding or filing a bigamy complaint in India).You have two options. The first one — which is what you should do in my opinion — is to simply move on. You are free to remarry under this option. If remarrying you will have to present the marriage officer with a copy of your foreign divorce decree. In case they object ( they ordinarily do not) you will have to file a writ petition before the local High Court to direct said marriage officer to accept your foreign divorce. The court is bound to side with you as per S. 13 CPC and its interpretation in matrimonial matters by the Supreme Court of India.Second option is for you to file a suit for validating your foreign divorce decree in India. This could be time consuming if you ex-wife doesn’t appear. If she does not appear the court will wait for sometime before proceeding ex parte (in her absence).Hope that answers your question.Pulkit ChandnaAdvocate, New Delhi208 Answers5 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Pulkit Chandna"

    "question": "Resolve bailable warrant on my family (498a) and find if there is any lookout circular in my name",
    "answer": "You can apply for anticipatory bail in order to avoid any arrest for yourself and your family members in Sessions or High Court.Bailable warrant must have been issued by the court due to failure of the accused person to appear before the court despite receiving notice which can easily be cancelled. The warrants would be cancelled once the accused person has appeared before the court. From next date onwards if any accused person fails to appear before the court you can ask your advocate to move an exemption application citing the reasons for their non appearance.There are ways to to find out whether any look out circular has been issued in your name. You can contact any criminal lawyer for the same from this portal.You can adduce the documentary evidence in your favour during the trial to disprove her allegations and the same can be put worth to her witnesses during cross examinations.Simultaneously, you can also file for quashing of FIR in High Court where you can adduce the evidence in your favour in order to disprove their case and to get the FIR quashed. There are very high chances that your sister's name would be removed from the FIR by the court as there is no specific incident about her in FIR. Other family members name can also be dropped from the FIR if no prima facie case has been made against them.Siddharth JainAdvocate, New Delhi6464 Answers102 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Siddharth Jain"

    "answer": "\\- As per Supreme Court judgment, wife is expected to move in with the relatives of their husbands, follow the rules and customs of their home, and ideally, blend in seamlessly as a new daughter.- Further, the court granted divorce to a man on the grounds of “cruelty” after his wife refused to share a home with her in-laws.- Further, If wife is not supporting her husband for the enjoyment of life and denying relation, then the husband can get divorce after filing a divorce petition before the court on this ground.- Since, your parents are also included as accused in her case, then they can apply for getting anticipatory bail from the session court , and surely they will get the same- Further, they can also file a petition before the High Court for removing their names in the FIR and also for quash the FIR against them- Since, the charge sheet has already filed then the appearance on each and every dates of hearing is mandatory , otherwise court can issue warrants against the accused.- If your parents will appear before the Court on the next date of hearing , then the bailable warrant issued against them will be cancelled automatically.- However, if your parents are senior citizens ,then they can get permanently exemption from appearance from the court .- If LOC issued then it is mandatory that the accused should be informed for the said notice has been issued against him, but generally an accused person comes to know about such notice only when he/she is stopped or arrested by the immigration authorities at the airport/border etc.- Hence, you can enquire for knowing about the LOC from the court itself with the help of a lawyer.You can contact me , if further suggestion needed.Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "Hello,You have to prove that there has been no “neglect or refusal” on your part to maintain your wife in order to succeed. Whether you are able to do so will depend on the full facts of your case and evidence you produce to establish them. To the extent it is feasible, you’d do well to provide the court with proof of money spent on your wife. I know it isn’t always possible to keep track of such expenses.The Supreme Court in a recent case remarked that maintenance equal to 25 percent of husband’s net salary is generally just and proper. However, the Court was clear it wasn’t laying down a hard and fast rule. It was quick to note that maintenance depends “on the factual situation of the case and the court would be justified in moulding the claim for maintenance passed on various factors.” The case is Kalyan Dey Chowdhury vs Rita Dey Chowdhury Nee Nandy (Civil Appeal no.5369 of 2017).In the facts of your case, please impress upon the court that you also have your father to look after. That must entail an added expense. You must highlight your status as the lone bread winner who has is responsible for maintaining the whole family. And you are entitled to maintain yourself as well.Hope that answers your question.Pulkit ChandnaAdvocate, New Delhi208 Answers5 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Pulkit Chandna"

    "question": "Divorce in Germany needs to be validated in India",
    "answer": "Hello,You don’t need an Indian court to validate or confirm your foreign divorce. It is not ordinarily required.As per Indian private international law, your divorce is valid in India. This is because it is a foreign divorce decree obtained by mutual consent. Indian law recognises such divorces even though the foreign court is not a court setup under the applicable law (Special Marriage Actin your case).Ordinarily, parties don’t go to Indian courts in such situations unless their ex-wife or ex-husband questions the foreign divorce (say by bringing a maintenance proceeding or filing a bigamy complaint in India).You have two options. The first one — which is what you should do in my opinion — is to simply move on. You are free to remarry under this option. If remarrying you will have to present the marriage officer with a copy of your foreign divorce decree. In case they object ( they ordinarily do not) you will have to file a writ petition before the local High Court to direct said marriage officer to accept your foreign divorce. The court is bound to side with you as per S. 13 CPC and its interpretation in matrimonial matters by the Supreme Court of India.Second option is for you to file a suit for validating your foreign divorce decree in India. This could be time consuming if you ex-wife doesn’t appear. If she does not appear the court will wait for sometime before proceeding ex parte (in her absence).Hope that answers your question.Pulkit ChandnaAdvocate, New Delhi208 Answers5 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Pulkit Chandna"

    "answer": "Dear client,The phrase \"IA 787 of 22 is dismissed\" refers to an interlocutory application (IA) filed in a divorce proceeding. In this case, IA 787, which was filed in the year 2022, has been dismissed by the court.An interlocutory application is a request or motion filed by one party during the course of a legal proceeding, seeking a specific order or direction from the court. It is a procedural step taken within the larger legal case.When an IA is dismissed, it means that the court has rejected the application and the relief sought by the party filing it. The court may have found the application to be without merit or not supported by sufficient evidence, or it may have determined that the relief requested is not appropriate in the given circumstances.The dismissal of an IA does not necessarily determine the final outcome of the overall divorce proceeding. It simply means that the specific application has been denied. The divorce case may still continue, and other issues and applications can be addressed separately.It is advisable to consult with your legal counsel or the concerned court for further clarification and to understand the impact of the dismissal on your particular case. They will be able to provide you with specific guidance and advice based on the details of your divorce proceedings.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "You can file a writ petition before high court seeking to cancel the auction sale of the property.But for your information the bank may take a stand that the property was sold on as is where is and as is what is basis and that the intending bidders had to make discreet enquiries as regards the property to satisfy themselves about the title, extent, quality and quantity of the property before submitting their bid.The bank may further declare that no claim of whatsoever nature regarding the property put for sale, charges, encumbrances over the property or on any other matter, etc., would be entertained after submission of the online bid.As the petitioner participated in the auction sale knowing fully well that this was one of the conditions of the sale, the bank can assert that he could not now raise an objection as to the title of the subject property not being clear or lawful.The bank can even counter stating that the rule of caveat emptor would apply and the borrower had to beware, i.e., a careful buyer should take care to examine the item before accepting it or obtain expert advice.But you should not deter your determination to fight back and get the sale consideration advance amount refunded if found that the bank did not have clear and marketable title to auction sell the property.You can also take shelter under the umbrella of the section 9 of the Sarfaesi act which states that :under Rule 9(1). Clauses (a) and (f) in this proviso are relevant and read as under:(a) the description of the immovable property to be sold, including the details of the encumbrances known to the secured creditor;.f) any other thing which the authorized officer considers it material for a purchaser to know in order to judge the nature and value of the property.In a judgment The Allahabad High Court  observed that a duty is cast upon the authorized officer of the bank to disclose to the auction purchaser any material defect in the title, failing which it could be construed that the purchaser was misled.Therefore you may approach high couirt with a writ petition as suggested.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Right of purchaser in auction by bank",
    "answer": "- As per Supreme Court, if a property owner fails to pay his dues to the bank, then the bank has the legal right to sell off his immovable property to recover losses.- But, the task to recover the dues should be performed in a specific manner and Authorities/bank cannot resort to extreme measure.- Further, if the defaulter wants to purchase that property after paying the entire dues of the bank , then the auction will stand cancelled, and he would be able to claim to the property again.- Hence, you should approach the bank to purchase the auction property with the defaulter , and on refusal you should move an application before the auction ordering court i.e. DRT, for cancelling the auction and transferring the same to you .- As per law, bank is bound to release the mortgage documents to the defaulter, after taking the up-to-date loan amount, and to handover the possession on behalf of defaulter to you.- Further, in case of auction of the property and withhold the amount, you can file a case against the bank .Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

    "answer": "The matrimonial laws differ from country to country.In the case ofmutual consent divorcedecree,the decree granted by a Foreign Court is considered to be legal, valid and binding in the Indian Courts by the virtue of Section 13 and Section 14 of the Civil Procedure Code, wherein Section 13 enumerates the condition when a foreign judgment would not be considered valid  in India and Section 14 states that when the Indian Courts would consider the Foreign judgment to be conclusive. A decree which is not affected by section 13 does not need to be validated in India and will be considered conclusive under Section 14 of the Civil Procedure Act.Under section 14 of CPC : The Court shall presume upon the production of any document purporting to be a certified copy of aforeign judgment, that such judgment was pronounced by a Court of competent jurisdiction, unless the contrary appears on the record; but such presumption may be displaced by proving want of jurisdiction.Thus there may not be a necessity to validate the divorce decree granted by the Germany court.You can get the judgment translated to English and get it apostilled and attested by a notary public or by Indian consulate, then produce the copy before the registrar to register your remarriage in India.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Divorce in Germany needs to be validated in India",
    "answer": "Hello,You don’t need an Indian court to validate or confirm your foreign divorce. It is not ordinarily required.As per Indian private international law, your divorce is valid in India. This is because it is a foreign divorce decree obtained by mutual consent. Indian law recognises such divorces even though the foreign court is not a court setup under the applicable law (Special Marriage Actin your case).Ordinarily, parties don’t go to Indian courts in such situations unless their ex-wife or ex-husband questions the foreign divorce (say by bringing a maintenance proceeding or filing a bigamy complaint in India).You have two options. The first one — which is what you should do in my opinion — is to simply move on. You are free to remarry under this option. If remarrying you will have to present the marriage officer with a copy of your foreign divorce decree. In case they object ( they ordinarily do not) you will have to file a writ petition before the local High Court to direct said marriage officer to accept your foreign divorce. The court is bound to side with you as per S. 13 CPC and its interpretation in matrimonial matters by the Supreme Court of India.Second option is for you to file a suit for validating your foreign divorce decree in India. This could be time consuming if you ex-wife doesn’t appear. If she does not appear the court will wait for sometime before proceeding ex parte (in her absence).Hope that answers your question.Pulkit ChandnaAdvocate, New Delhi208 Answers5 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Pulkit Chandna"

If the society makes any further demands after the payment is made, you can use these records to demonstrate that you have already paid the amount as per the resolution and that any further demands are illegal.If the society continues to withhold the signed resolution or makes further demands after payment is made, you may need to seek legal assistance to protect your rights and interests.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Cease and Desist Notice from former Employer.",
    "answer": "It becomes your duty to issue a reply notice denying the allegations leveled by them in their legal notice against you.Your silence or non response will be deemed that you have accepted their allegations against you.Therefore you contact a lawyer with knowledge and experience immediately and issue a reply notice  denying their accusations including refusing to pay the amount demanded by them and the agreement they are forcing you to sign.Your first reaction is often concern or fear, but there's nothing in the letter by a court or a judge that orders you to do anythingBy itself, a cease and desist letter can't do much, yet it may advise you that if you don't comply, the other party will sue you. In some cases, the party actually will sue you, while in other cases, they won't. Whatever you do, though, don't ignore the letter or you risk having the other party commence a lawsuit against you.Discuss with your lawyer how to save evidence, such as texts, emails, and copies of your website. Don't destroy evidence, as you may need it at a later time.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

It is a procedural step taken within the larger legal case.When an IA is dismissed, it means that the court has rejected the application and the relief sought by the party filing it. The court may have found the application to be without merit or not supported by sufficient evidence, or it may have determined that the relief requested is not appropriate in the given circumstances.The dismissal of an IA does not necessarily determine the final outcome of the overall divorce proceeding. It simply means that the specific application has been denied. The divorce case may still continue, and other issues and applications can be addressed separately.It is advisable to consult with your legal counsel or the concerned court for further clarification and to understand the impact of the dismissal on your particular case. They will be able to provide you with specific guidance and advice based on the details of your divorce proceedings.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Hi. Hope you're doing well.If your grandfather died without a will, then his property would devolve equally among his first class heirs, as given under theHindu Succession Act. This means that a notional partition had been effected at the time of your grandfather's death and your father's share would then be considered to be his self acquired property. After your father's death, his share in the property would belong to your father's class one heir and your uncles would have no right over his share. Since your uncles have already sold the property, you can either file a court case and get the sale to be declared void. Or you can ask your uncles to pay you for your father's share of the property.For any further inquiry or consultation, feel free to contact me.Regards,Siddharth JainSiddharth JainAdvocate, New Delhi6464 Answers102 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Siddharth Jain"

All legal highers can give NOCs for mutation of property in favour of legal higher in India. This can be done through GPA executed by citizens of U. S. in favour of such legal higher. After mutation of properties such heir can sell the property with no objection certificate by other legal highers again through GPA executed in USA in favour of such legal heir. Both the GPAs should be attested by Indian Embassy in USA. The whole process will take about 2 months.Ravi ShindeAdvocate, Hyderabad4923 Answers42 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ravi Shinde"

In this case, IA 787, which was filed in the year 2022, has been dismissed by the court.An interlocutory application is a request or motion filed by one party during the course of a legal proceeding, seeking a specific order or direction from the court. It is a procedural step taken within the larger legal case.When an IA is dismissed, it means that the court has rejected the application and the relief sought by the party filing it. The court may have found the application to be without merit or not supported by sufficient evidence, or it may have determined that the relief requested is not appropriate in the given circumstances.The dismissal of an IA does not necessarily determine the final outcome of the overall divorce proceeding. It simply means that the specific application has been denied. The divorce case may still continue, and other issues and applications can be addressed separately.It is advisable to consult with your legal counsel or the concerned court for further clarification and to understand the impact of the dismissal on your particular case. They will be able to provide you with specific guidance and advice based on the details of your divorce proceedings.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "You can file a writ petition before high court seeking to cancel the auction sale of the property.But for your information the bank may take a stand that the property was sold on as is where is and as is what is basis and that the intending bidders had to make discreet enquiries as regards the property to satisfy themselves about the title, extent, quality and quantity of the property before submitting their bid.The bank may further declare that no claim of whatsoever nature regarding the property put for sale, charges, encumbrances over the property or on any other matter, etc., would be entertained after submission of the online bid.As the petitioner participated in the auction sale knowing fully well that this was one of the conditions of the sale, the bank can assert that he could not now raise an objection as to the title of the subject property not being clear or lawful.The bank can even counter stating that the rule of caveat emptor would apply and the borrower had to beware, i.e., a careful buyer should take care to examine the item before accepting it or obtain expert advice.But you should not deter your determination to fight back and get the sale consideration advance amount refunded if found that the bank did not have clear and marketable title to auction sell the property.You can also take shelter under the umbrella of the section 9 of the Sarfaesi act which states that :under Rule 9(1). Clauses (a) and (f) in this proviso are relevant and read as under:(a) the description of the immovable property to be sold, including the details of the encumbrances known to the secured creditor;.f) any other thing which the authorized officer considers it material for a purchaser to know in order to judge the nature and value of the property.In a judgment The Allahabad High Court  observed that a duty is cast upon the authorized officer of the bank to disclose to the auction purchaser any material defect in the title, failing which it could be construed that the purchaser was misled.Therefore you may approach high couirt with a writ petition as suggested.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

If the society makes any further demands after the payment is made, you can use these records to demonstrate that you have already paid the amount as per the resolution and that any further demands are illegal.If the society continues to withhold the signed resolution or makes further demands after payment is made, you may need to seek legal assistance to protect your rights and interests.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

He can be restrained from doing so.You can add such owner as an accomplice in all cases.Injunction can be claimed only to the extent of ground floor and 2nd floor as A has entered in to agreement with owner for 2ndA is liable to account for profits earned by him personal capacity.You are advised to seek relief from civil Court.Ravi ShindeAdvocate, Hyderabad4923 Answers42 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ravi Shinde"

The nature and scope of the interim measures will depend on the full facts the case.You need to send a legal notice to the bank. Ask it to forthwith freeze the bank account in question as its operation has not been duly authorised by the firm.Whether there has been any cheating or not will depend on the full facts of the case which are not before me. It will depend on the facts which sections (if any) of theIndian Penal Codeare attracted. It will then have to be determined if those sections are cognisable (police can register FIR and investigate) or non-cognisable (police needs a magistrate's permission to investigate).The owner of the building could theoretically be liable in damages for the tort of inducing or procuring breach of contract. If the ingredients of the tort exist in your case then you can file a civil suit against him for the recovery of damages. Again I cannot comment on the owner's liability without the full facts of the case.You should file a Section 9 application for interim measures posthaste. You may also be able to obtain an injunction against the owner of the building if the facts of your case support a civil suit against him.Hope that answers your questions.I am circling back to clarify a couple of things.1. S. 69 of the IPA has been held to not bar arbitral proceedings among partners of an unregistered partnership firm. The SC said so in Umesh Goel vs Himachal Pradesh Cooperative Group Housing Society Limited, 2016 SCC OnLine SC 624. While I personally have serious reservations about that judgment, it is the law.2. S. 69(2) does not operate as a bar against a suit by an unregistered firm against a third party if said suit is not based or related to a contract entered into by the firm and third party in question in the course of inter se business dealings. The judgment where it has been so held isShiv Developers, through it's partner Sunilbhai Somabhai Ajmeri v. Aksharay Developers & Ors,2022 SCC OnLine SC 114. In your case, the bar will therefore not operate. You are free to bring an action for damages for the tort of procuring breach of contract against the “owner” (all else being equal).Pulkit ChandnaAdvocate, New Delhi208 Answers5 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Pulkit Chandna"

    "answer": "Your friend stood as a guarantor to the bank for the loan by providing his property as collateral security for the purpose of the loan availed by the company, then what is that preventing the bank to bring the property to auction sale if the company is not repaying the loan availed by the company.Since your friend has voluntarily signed the laong agreement as a guarantor agreeing that he has read and understood the conditions of the loan agreement, at this stage he will be subjected to the legal procedures as prescribed in law for the purpose.If this was a secured loan,the lender may also choose to sell the asset given as collateral to recover the loan amount.Your friend may be advised to file a writ petition before high court contending that  the action initiated by the respondent Bank under section 14 is wholly arbitrary for the reason that instead of proceeding against the primary security i.e the assets of the company, the petitioner company has resorted to taking over possession of collateral security which happens to be residential premises of one of the Directors. The Bank should first proceed against the primary security and in case the amount sought to be recovered falls short of the amount due, it is only then the Bank can proceed to take possession of the collateral security.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

This means that a notional partition had been effected at the time of your grandfather's death and your father's share would then be considered to be his self acquired property. After your father's death, his share in the property would belong to your father's class one heir and your uncles would have no right over his share. Since your uncles have already sold the property, you can either file a court case and get the sale to be declared void. Or you can ask your uncles to pay you for your father's share of the property.For any further inquiry or consultation, feel free to contact me.Regards,Siddharth JainSiddharth JainAdvocate, New Delhi6464 Answers102 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Siddharth Jain"

In some cases, the party actually will sue you, while in other cases, they won't. Whatever you do, though, don't ignore the letter or you risk having the other party commence a lawsuit against you.Discuss with your lawyer how to save evidence, such as texts, emails, and copies of your website.

    "question": "Unregistered firm and its disputes among partners",
    "answer": "For the application of Partnership Act among partners, registration is not necessary. It is required only when the dispute is between the firm and third parties. In Allon Booz Hamilton, SC held that in cases involving specific Act like Partnership Act, Rent Control Act, Copyrights Act arbitration clause is not binding on parties.You can certainly approach Civil Court to restrain a partner from transferring assets of firm to third parties as under Section 9 of the Act a partner is bound to carry on the business of firm to the greatest common advantage.Section 9 of Arbitration provides for interim order like injunction and stay.You can certainly stop third parties from doing any acts harmful to the interest of firm.Opening individual account in the name of firm is an attempt to commit fraud on firm. He can be restrained from doing so.You can add such owner as an accomplice in all cases.Injunction can be claimed only to the extent of ground floor and 2nd floor as A has entered in to agreement with owner for 2ndA is liable to account for profits earned by him personal capacity.You are advised to seek relief from civil Court.Ravi ShindeAdvocate, Hyderabad4923 Answers42 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ravi Shinde"

    "answer": "1. The disputes between the partners can be resolved by invoking the arbitration clause.2. If You suspect that he had purchased the properties to his new firm out of the funds of the partnership firm, then you can issue a demand notice, subsequently you can file a recovery suit  and get an order of injunction against his new firm which is suspected to have been formed out of the funds of the partnership fund, but you have to produce documentary evidences to prove the embezzlement of funds and fraudulent activities of the said partner.3. The arbitration proceedings can be stayed by high court provided it is not a legally valid proceedings.4. No you cannot curtain the rights of others to enter into the other part of the building to which the partnership firm is not having any connection or binding.5. He can open a bank account with the same PAN for other firms in his individual capacity6. The owner is not bound to oblige you, your relationship/connection with the owner is limited to your partnership firm as a landlord and tenant alone and not beyond that.7. No, it will not be tenable nor the court will entertain such claims especially when you do not have any rights or interests over the entire building./T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Unregistered firm and its disputes among partners",
    "answer": "Hello,Arbitrator or arbitral panel is to be appointed according to the procedure contained in the arbitration agreement (arbitration clause in your partnership deed). If the agreement does not specify any procedure and parties fail to agree on a procedure among themselves, you will have to approach the High Court under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996.There is indeed a provision under the Act for stay orders, namely Section 9. It empowers a court to grant \"interim measures\" (read: stay and other injunctions). You can apply to the appropriate court on an urgent basis even before the appointment of an arbitrator or arbitral panel. The nature and scope of the interim measures will depend on the full facts the case.You need to send a legal notice to the bank. Ask it to forthwith freeze the bank account in question as its operation has not been duly authorised by the firm.Whether there has been any cheating or not will depend on the full facts of the case which are not before me. It will depend on the facts which sections (if any) of theIndian Penal Codeare attracted. It will then have to be determined if those sections are cognisable (police can register FIR and investigate) or non-cognisable (police needs a magistrate's permission to investigate).The owner of the building could theoretically be liable in damages for the tort of inducing or procuring breach of contract. If the ingredients of the tort exist in your case then you can file a civil suit against him for the recovery of damages. Again I cannot comment on the owner's liability without the full facts of the case.You should file a Section 9 application for interim measures posthaste. You may also be able to obtain an injunction against the owner of the building if the facts of your case support a civil suit against him.Hope that answers your questions.I am circling back to clarify a couple of things.1. S. 69 of the IPA has been held to not bar arbitral proceedings among partners of an unregistered partnership firm. The SC said so in Umesh Goel vs Himachal Pradesh Cooperative Group Housing Society Limited, 2016 SCC OnLine SC 624. While I personally have serious reservations about that judgment, it is the law.2. S. 69(2) does not operate as a bar against a suit by an unregistered firm against a third party if said suit is not based or related to a contract entered into by the firm and third party in question in the course of inter se business dealings. The judgment where it has been so held isShiv Developers, through it's partner Sunilbhai Somabhai Ajmeri v. Aksharay Developers & Ors,2022 SCC OnLine SC 114. In your case, the bar will therefore not operate. You are free to bring an action for damages for the tort of procuring breach of contract against the “owner” (all else being equal).Pulkit ChandnaAdvocate, New Delhi208 Answers5 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Pulkit Chandna"

    "answer": "Muslim law of inheritance is quite different from Hindu law of inheritance. Distribution of property among male and female is not in equal proportions. Share of a male heir is double then the female heir. But as your intention is to sell of the property, there is no need to seek distribution of property among legal hire. All legal highers can give NOCs for mutation of property in favour of legal higher in India. This can be done through GPA executed by citizens of U. S. in favour of such legal higher. After mutation of properties such heir can sell the property with no objection certificate by other legal highers again through GPA executed in USA in favour of such legal heir. Both the GPAs should be attested by Indian Embassy in USA. The whole process will take about 2 months.Ravi ShindeAdvocate, Hyderabad4923 Answers42 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ravi Shinde"

It is important to follow legal procedures and not take any actions that may put you in legal trouble.If the police are not providing assistance, then you can file a petition in the court seeking police protection. While it may be difficult to get police protection for a civil case involving construction, it is not impossible. You can also consider hiring private security to protect the property until the case is resolved.Regarding the appeal case, it is important to continue pursuing it and seeking legal advice from a qualified lawyer. If the appeal is successful, then the court can issue an order for possession, which should be enforced by the police.In the meantime, document any incidents of harassment or obstruction by the other party or their goons, as this can be used as evidence in court. Keep all communication with them civil and professional, and do not engage in any confrontations.I would recommend seeking the advice of a lawyer who specializes in property and civil disputes to help guide you through this process.

    "answer": "I understand this is a difficult situation. It is important to follow legal procedures and not take any actions that may put you in legal trouble.If the police are not providing assistance, then you can file a petition in the court seeking police protection. While it may be difficult to get police protection for a civil case involving construction, it is not impossible. You can also consider hiring private security to protect the property until the case is resolved.Regarding the appeal case, it is important to continue pursuing it and seeking legal advice from a qualified lawyer. If the appeal is successful, then the court can issue an order for possession, which should be enforced by the police.In the meantime, document any incidents of harassment or obstruction by the other party or their goons, as this can be used as evidence in court. Keep all communication with them civil and professional, and do not engage in any confrontations.I would recommend seeking the advice of a lawyer who specializes in property and civil disputes to help guide you through this process.

    "question": "My father/mother bought some agri land, I have OCI, can this land be transferred to my name?",
    "answer": "1. Inheritance of property means  succession,the devolution of property on an heir or heirs upon the death of the owner.It is a process which involves the passing on of material property from one generation to another, usually within the family, generally from older parents (donors) to their adult children (heirs), which is completed after the death of the older generation.Thus inheritance happens only after the death of the property owner (be it self acquired or his/her own inherited property). You can inherit the agricultural property only after the death of your father even though he had transferred it by Will.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"
