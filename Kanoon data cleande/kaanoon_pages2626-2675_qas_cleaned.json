    "answer": "Dear client,It depends on the specific details and laws of your jurisdiction. However, in general, if the property you purchased contains a minor's name, you may have a few options to rectify the issue:Obtain a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the minor's legal guardian: This is a document that certifies that the legal guardian of the minor has no objections to the sale of the property. This can be used to prove that the sale was made with the consent of the minor's legal guardian.Execute a rectification deed: This is a legal document that can be used to correct errors in the original property sale deed, such as the inclusion of a minor's name. This deed can be executed by the minor and their legal guardian after the minor has attained the age of majority.Apply to the court: If you are unable to obtain an NOC or rectify the deed, you may need to apply to the court for a resolution. This could involve obtaining a court order declaring the sale valid or seeking a determination of the ownership of the property.It is important to note that the specific steps you will need to take will depend on the laws and regulations of your jurisdiction. It would be best to seek legal advice from a property lawyer who can assist you with the specific requirements and processes in your case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Yes, the source of funds can be important when obtaining a court order for selling property that is in the name of a minor. The court may require proof that the funds used to purchase the property were not the minor's own funds, but rather were provided by the father or another source.In your specific case, since the source of funds used to purchase the property is not explicitly mentioned and the property was sold without a court order, there may be a potential issue in terms of legal ownership and the validity of the second sale deed. Additionally, if the daughter's signature was obtained when she was a minor, it may not be legally binding unless certain conditions were met, such as the presence of a guardian or court approval.It is recommended that you consult with a local lawyer who specializes in property law to get specific guidance on the legal requirements for selling property in a minor's name and the potential legal issues that may arise in your caseAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Doing so could be considered fraudulent and could result in legal consequences for both you and the domestic worker.In order for the domestic worker to obtain a passport, she must have a permanent address and meet other eligibility requirements set by the passport issuing authority. If she does not have a permanent address, you may need to provide a proof of residence for her, such as a utility bill in your name at the address where she will be staying.It is important to note that domestic workers have rights under Indian law and must be treated with dignity and respect. Changing the address on their Aadhaar card or opening a bank account in their name without their consent could be considered a violation of their rights and could lead to legal consequences.As for the question of whether it is safe for you to travel to Europe with the domestic worker, you would need to ensure that she meets the visa and other entry requirements of the countries you plan to visit. Additionally, it is important to consider the rights of domestic workers when traveling and ensure that they are not subjected to exploitation or abuse.It is recommended that you seek the advice of a qualified lawyer or immigration expert to understand the legal requirements and procedures for traveling with a domestic worker and to ensure that the rights of both you and the domestic worker are protected.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,It depends on the specific details and laws of your jurisdiction. However, in general, if the property you purchased contains a minor's name, you may have a few options to rectify the issue:Obtain a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the minor's legal guardian: This is a document that certifies that the legal guardian of the minor has no objections to the sale of the property. This can be used to prove that the sale was made with the consent of the minor's legal guardian.Execute a rectification deed: This is a legal document that can be used to correct errors in the original property sale deed, such as the inclusion of a minor's name. This deed can be executed by the minor and their legal guardian after the minor has attained the age of majority.Apply to the court: If you are unable to obtain an NOC or rectify the deed, you may need to apply to the court for a resolution. This could involve obtaining a court order declaring the sale valid or seeking a determination of the ownership of the property.It is important to note that the specific steps you will need to take will depend on the laws and regulations of your jurisdiction. It would be best to seek legal advice from a property lawyer who can assist you with the specific requirements and processes in your case.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The court may require proof that the funds used to purchase the property were not the minor's own funds, but rather were provided by the father or another source.In your specific case, since the source of funds used to purchase the property is not explicitly mentioned and the property was sold without a court order, there may be a potential issue in terms of legal ownership and the validity of the second sale deed. Additionally, if the daughter's signature was obtained when she was a minor, it may not be legally binding unless certain conditions were met, such as the presence of a guardian or court approval.It is recommended that you consult with a local lawyer who specializes in property law to get specific guidance on the legal requirements for selling property in a minor's name and the potential legal issues that may arise in your caseAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If she does not have a permanent address, you may need to provide a proof of residence for her, such as a utility bill in your name at the address where she will be staying.It is important to note that domestic workers have rights under Indian law and must be treated with dignity and respect. Changing the address on their Aadhaar card or opening a bank account in their name without their consent could be considered a violation of their rights and could lead to legal consequences.As for the question of whether it is safe for you to travel to Europe with the domestic worker, you would need to ensure that she meets the visa and other entry requirements of the countries you plan to visit. Additionally, it is important to consider the rights of domestic workers when traveling and ensure that they are not subjected to exploitation or abuse.It is recommended that you seek the advice of a qualified lawyer or immigration expert to understand the legal requirements and procedures for traveling with a domestic worker and to ensure that the rights of both you and the domestic worker are protected.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If an heir lives even after the death of the ancestor, he becomes a legal heir and is therefore entitled to a share in the property.According to Muslim law, the heirs are the successors of the deceased who are legally recognized by the Sharīah to inherit his estate, given that they are not impeded from inheritance.The heirs are further broadly categorized into two important categories, Sharers and Residuaries.Sharers include the husband, wife, father, mother, daughter, the uterine brother, the uterine sister, the full sister, and the consanguine sister. Of all these Sharers, there are four who inherit sometimes as sharers and sometimes as Residuary. These are the father, the daughter, the full sister, and the consanguine sister.Residuaries are the ones who inherit in the absence of the immediate Sharer, and if the estate remains after being devolved between them.The third category of Distant Kindred exists, who are neither Sharers nor Residuaries but are connected by blood relation.

They can help you review the ownership history of the property, identify any potential legal issues, and provide guidance on how to clear the title if necessary.When drafting the sale deed specific to Muslim law, it is advisable to include clauses that address issues such as the transfer of ownership, warranties, representations, and indemnities. You should work with your lawyer to ensure that the deed complies with Muslim law and adequately protects your interests as the buyer.Under Muslim law, the rights of minors to inherit property are protected, and their interests must be taken into consideration when dealing with property transfers. It is essential to ensure that the sale deed clearly states the ownership rights of the minors and outlines how their interests will be protected during the sale and transfer process.As the buyer, it is advisable to request declarations from the sellers (brother and sister) confirming that they are the rightful owners of the property and have the authority to sell it. You should also ask for any relevant documents that support their ownership claims and verify them with the help of your lawyer.

However, in general, if the property you purchased contains a minor's name, you may have a few options to rectify the issue:Obtain a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the minor's legal guardian: This is a document that certifies that the legal guardian of the minor has no objections to the sale of the property. This can be used to prove that the sale was made with the consent of the minor's legal guardian.Execute a rectification deed: This is a legal document that can be used to correct errors in the original property sale deed, such as the inclusion of a minor's name. This deed can be executed by the minor and their legal guardian after the minor has attained the age of majority.Apply to the court: If you are unable to obtain an NOC or rectify the deed, you may need to apply to the court for a resolution. This could involve obtaining a court order declaring the sale valid or seeking a determination of the ownership of the property.It is important to note that the specific steps you will need to take will depend on the laws and regulations of your jurisdiction.

If an heir lives even after the death of the ancestor, he becomes a legal heir and is therefore entitled to a share in the property.According to Muslim law, the heirs are the successors of the deceased who are legally recognized by the Sharīah to inherit his estate, given that they are not impeded from inheritance.The heirs are further broadly categorized into two important categories, Sharers and Residuaries.Sharers include the husband, wife, father, mother, daughter, the uterine brother, the uterine sister, the full sister, and the consanguine sister. Of all these Sharers, there are four who inherit sometimes as sharers and sometimes as Residuary. These are the father, the daughter, the full sister, and the consanguine sister.Residuaries are the ones who inherit in the absence of the immediate Sharer, and if the estate remains after being devolved between them.The third category of Distant Kindred exists, who are neither Sharers nor Residuaries but are connected by blood relation.

They can help you review the ownership history of the property, identify any potential legal issues, and provide guidance on how to clear the title if necessary.When drafting the sale deed specific to Muslim law, it is advisable to include clauses that address issues such as the transfer of ownership, warranties, representations, and indemnities. You should work with your lawyer to ensure that the deed complies with Muslim law and adequately protects your interests as the buyer.Under Muslim law, the rights of minors to inherit property are protected, and their interests must be taken into consideration when dealing with property transfers. It is essential to ensure that the sale deed clearly states the ownership rights of the minors and outlines how their interests will be protected during the sale and transfer process.As the buyer, it is advisable to request declarations from the sellers (brother and sister) confirming that they are the rightful owners of the property and have the authority to sell it. You should also ask for any relevant documents that support their ownership claims and verify them with the help of your lawyer.

This can be used to prove that the sale was made with the consent of the minor's legal guardian.Execute a rectification deed: This is a legal document that can be used to correct errors in the original property sale deed, such as the inclusion of a minor's name. This deed can be executed by the minor and their legal guardian after the minor has attained the age of majority.Apply to the court: If you are unable to obtain an NOC or rectify the deed, you may need to apply to the court for a resolution.

If an heir lives even after the death of the ancestor, he becomes a legal heir and is therefore entitled to a share in the property.According to Muslim law, the heirs are the successors of the deceased who are legally recognized by the Sharīah to inherit his estate, given that they are not impeded from inheritance.The heirs are further broadly categorized into two important categories, Sharers and Residuaries.Sharers include the husband, wife, father, mother, daughter, the uterine brother, the uterine sister, the full sister, and the consanguine sister. Of all these Sharers, there are four who inherit sometimes as sharers and sometimes as Residuary. These are the father, the daughter, the full sister, and the consanguine sister.Residuaries are the ones who inherit in the absence of the immediate Sharer, and if the estate remains after being devolved between them.The third category of Distant Kindred exists, who are neither Sharers nor Residuaries but are connected by blood relation.

    "question": "Buying a property from Muslim sellers",
    "answer": "To ensure the property is free from any encumbrance like Hiba or gift under Muslim law, you should consult with a local lawyer who is well-versed in Muslim personal law. They can help you review the ownership history of the property, identify any potential legal issues, and provide guidance on how to clear the title if necessary.When drafting the sale deed specific to Muslim law, it is advisable to include clauses that address issues such as the transfer of ownership, warranties, representations, and indemnities. You should work with your lawyer to ensure that the deed complies with Muslim law and adequately protects your interests as the buyer.Under Muslim law, the rights of minors to inherit property are protected, and their interests must be taken into consideration when dealing with property transfers. It is essential to ensure that the sale deed clearly states the ownership rights of the minors and outlines how their interests will be protected during the sale and transfer process.As the buyer, it is advisable to request declarations from the sellers (brother and sister) confirming that they are the rightful owners of the property and have the authority to sell it. You should also ask for any relevant documents that support their ownership claims and verify them with the help of your lawyer.

    "question": "Buying a property from Muslim sellers",
    "answer": "Inheritance of property in Muslim lawcomes only after the death of a person, any child born into a Muslim family does not get his right to property on his birth. If an heir lives even after the death of the ancestor, he becomes a legal heir and is therefore entitled to a share in the property.According to Muslim law, the heirs are the successors of the deceased who are legally recognized by the Sharīah to inherit his estate, given that they are not impeded from inheritance.The heirs are further broadly categorized into two important categories, Sharers and Residuaries.Sharers include the husband, wife, father, mother, daughter, the uterine brother, the uterine sister, the full sister, and the consanguine sister. Of all these Sharers, there are four who inherit sometimes as sharers and sometimes as Residuary. These are the father, the daughter, the full sister, and the consanguine sister.Residuaries are the ones who inherit in the absence of the immediate Sharer, and if the estate remains after being devolved between them.The third category of Distant Kindred exists, who are neither Sharers nor Residuaries but are connected by blood relation. Step-Children and Step-Parents however do not inherit the property from each other.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Buying a property from Muslim sellers",
    "answer": "To ensure the property is free from any encumbrance like Hiba or gift under Muslim law, you should consult with a local lawyer who is well-versed in Muslim personal law. They can help you review the ownership history of the property, identify any potential legal issues, and provide guidance on how to clear the title if necessary.When drafting the sale deed specific to Muslim law, it is advisable to include clauses that address issues such as the transfer of ownership, warranties, representations, and indemnities. You should work with your lawyer to ensure that the deed complies with Muslim law and adequately protects your interests as the buyer.Under Muslim law, the rights of minors to inherit property are protected, and their interests must be taken into consideration when dealing with property transfers. It is essential to ensure that the sale deed clearly states the ownership rights of the minors and outlines how their interests will be protected during the sale and transfer process.As the buyer, it is advisable to request declarations from the sellers (brother and sister) confirming that they are the rightful owners of the property and have the authority to sell it. You should also ask for any relevant documents that support their ownership claims and verify them with the help of your lawyer. This can help to ensure that the sale is conducted lawfully and without any legal disputes in the future.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "the quantum of the share of a female heir is half of that of the male heirs. The reason behind this is that under the Muslim law a female shall upon marriage receive mehr and maintenance from her husband whereas males will have only the property of the ancestors for inheritance.2) A husband (in the case of succession to the wife's estate) takes a half share in a case where the couple is without lineal descendants, and a one-fourth share otherwise. A sole daughter takes a half share. Where the deceased has left behind more than one daughter, all daughters jointly take two-thirds.Ajay SethiAdvocate, MumbaiAvailable Now98566 Answers8024 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Ajay Sethi NOW!"

    "question": "Buying a property from Muslim sellers",
    "answer": "Inheritance of property in Muslim lawcomes only after the death of a person, any child born into a Muslim family does not get his right to property on his birth. If an heir lives even after the death of the ancestor, he becomes a legal heir and is therefore entitled to a share in the property.According to Muslim law, the heirs are the successors of the deceased who are legally recognized by the Sharīah to inherit his estate, given that they are not impeded from inheritance.The heirs are further broadly categorized into two important categories, Sharers and Residuaries.Sharers include the husband, wife, father, mother, daughter, the uterine brother, the uterine sister, the full sister, and the consanguine sister. Of all these Sharers, there are four who inherit sometimes as sharers and sometimes as Residuary. These are the father, the daughter, the full sister, and the consanguine sister.Residuaries are the ones who inherit in the absence of the immediate Sharer, and if the estate remains after being devolved between them.The third category of Distant Kindred exists, who are neither Sharers nor Residuaries but are connected by blood relation. Step-Children and Step-Parents however do not inherit the property from each other.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "Buying a property from Muslim sellers",
    "answer": "To ensure the property is free from any encumbrance like Hiba or gift under Muslim law, you should consult with a local lawyer who is well-versed in Muslim personal law. They can help you review the ownership history of the property, identify any potential legal issues, and provide guidance on how to clear the title if necessary.When drafting the sale deed specific to Muslim law, it is advisable to include clauses that address issues such as the transfer of ownership, warranties, representations, and indemnities. You should work with your lawyer to ensure that the deed complies with Muslim law and adequately protects your interests as the buyer.Under Muslim law, the rights of minors to inherit property are protected, and their interests must be taken into consideration when dealing with property transfers. It is essential to ensure that the sale deed clearly states the ownership rights of the minors and outlines how their interests will be protected during the sale and transfer process.As the buyer, it is advisable to request declarations from the sellers (brother and sister) confirming that they are the rightful owners of the property and have the authority to sell it. You should also ask for any relevant documents that support their ownership claims and verify them with the help of your lawyer. This can help to ensure that the sale is conducted lawfully and without any legal disputes in the future.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

However, in light of the current situation, you may still be able to negotiate a solution with the lender.Here are some steps you can take:Review your loan agreement: Familiarize yourself with the terms and conditions of your loan agreement, including the payment due dates and any provisions for missed payments or default.Communicate with your lender: Reach out to your lender and explain your financial difficulties due to the pandemic. Provide them with the mail trails and any evidence that you've been trying to resolve the issue. You could also ask for a loan restructuring or moratorium, if available.Seek professional help: If the negotiations with the lender are not successful, consider seeking professional help from a financial advisor or a debt counseling service.Consider alternative options: If restructuring or moratorium is not an option, you may want to consider other alternatives such as debt consolidation or a personal loan to pay off the debt.I hope this information helps.

If it is indeed true that these cases have been charged unlawfully and that the evidence was recorded by officers who were not authorized to do so, then there is a valid ground for filing a PIL.It is important to note that filing a PIL is a complex and time-consuming process and requires a thorough understanding of the legal procedures involved.

    "answer": "Dear clientThe gift deed is a legally binding document, and it would require a valid reason for cancellation. If the terms of the gift deed have been fulfilled, then it is unlikely that it can be cancelled. However, if there is any fraud or coercion involved in the making of the gift deed, then it can be challenged in court.Maintenance payments do not give anyone ownership rights to the property. The fact that your parents are still paying the maintenance does not mean that they have any rights to the property.If your parents are not willing to vacate the property, you may need to take legal action. In India, a person can file an eviction suit in the appropriate court for the recovery of the possession of the property. If the court finds in your favor, an order for eviction can be issued.

    "question": "Query about gift deed from parents",
    "answer": "I am sorry to hear about the difficult situation you are facing with your family members over your jointly owned flat. Here are some answers to your questions:If the gift deed does not contain any clauses that give your parents the right to cancel the gift deed, then they cannot legally cancel it. Once the gift deed has been executed, it becomes a legally binding document, and your parents cannot unilaterally revoke it without your consent or a court order.Paying maintenance or property tax for a property does not give the person paying these fees ownership rights over the property. Ownership is determined by the title deeds, which in your case show that you and your mother jointly own the flat. Your parents paying maintenance does not give them any legal claim to the flat.If you want to vacate your flat legally, you can send a notice to your parents asking them to vacate the flat. If they do not comply with the notice, you can file a suit for eviction in a civil court. The maximum legal action you can take to evict your parents from the flat is to obtain a court order for eviction. Once the court order is obtained, you can approach the local police or bailiff to assist you in evicting your parents from the property.It is important to note that eviction cases can take time and can be emotionally and financially draining. It is always best to try to resolve disputes amicably before resorting to legal action. I would suggest that you try to communicate with your parents and sister and see if a mutually acceptable solution can be reached, such as your parents finding alternative accommodation or your sister moving out of the flat. If that is not possible, you may want to seek the advice of a lawyer who specializes in property law to guide you through the legal process of eviction.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Tribal marriage with non Tribal",
    "answer": "Dear clientIn India, polygyny, or the practice of having multiple wives, is illegal under theHindu Marriage Act1955. This means that a tribal man cannot legally marry a non-tribal woman while his first wife (who is tribal) is still alive.If the tribal man wants to end his marriage to his first wife and marry a non-tribal woman, he must first obtain a divorce. This can be done through mutual consent, or if the two parties are unable to reach a mutual agreement, by filing a divorce petition in a court of law.The law applicable for the marriage between a tribal man and a non-tribal woman would depend on the personal laws of the individuals involved. For example, if the tribal man and non-tribal woman are both Hindus, theHindu Marriage Act1955 would govern their marriage. If either one of them is a Christian, then the Indian Christian Marriage Act 1872 would apply.It is important to note that these laws are subject to change, and it is always best to consult with a qualified legal professional for the most up-to-date and accurate informationAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

It's important to understand your rights and options in this situation.Divorce proceedings: If your husband files for divorce in the US, you can seek legal counsel to represent you in the court proceedings. You may also want to seek a restraining order if you believe your safety is at risk.Dowry demands: Dowry demands are illegal in India and you can file a complaint with the police. However, it may be difficult to prove the demands were made and that your husband was involved in them.H4 EAD: Your husband cannot cancel your H4 EAD. The H4 EAD is a work authorization document that is independent of your marital status. However, if your husband is the primary H1B visa holder and he cancels his visa, your H4 status and EAD will also be cancelled.Reconciliation: If you still love your husband and want to try to reconcile, you may want to consider seeking the help of a marriage counselor. However, it's important to prioritize your own safety and well-being.It's recommended that you seek the advice of a qualified immigration attorney to understand the impact of a divorce on your immigration status and to explore your options for resolving your marital issues.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Tribal marriage with non Tribal",
    "answer": "Dear clientIn India, polygyny, or the practice of having multiple wives, is illegal under theHindu Marriage Act1955. This means that a tribal man cannot legally marry a non-tribal woman while his first wife (who is tribal) is still alive.If the tribal man wants to end his marriage to his first wife and marry a non-tribal woman, he must first obtain a divorce. This can be done through mutual consent, or if the two parties are unable to reach a mutual agreement, by filing a divorce petition in a court of law.The law applicable for the marriage between a tribal man and a non-tribal woman would depend on the personal laws of the individuals involved. For example, if the tribal man and non-tribal woman are both Hindus, theHindu Marriage Act1955 would govern their marriage. If either one of them is a Christian, then the Indian Christian Marriage Act 1872 would apply.It is important to note that these laws are subject to change, and it is always best to consult with a qualified legal professional for the most up-to-date and accurate informationAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Land acquired by the government",
    "answer": "1. The land acquisition is also considered as transfer of property.For a transaction involving immovable property, it is mandatory for the power of attorney deed to be executed by a registered document, hence the authorities are right in rejecting the power of attorney deed just attested by a Notary public, you may get the power deed registered befor concerned Registrar if you residing within Indian territories. However if you have got your power of attorney deed attested by a notary public of that country, then it is mandatory that you get the deed adjudicated by the registrar concerned or the Tehsildar within the jurisdiction.2. You are unnecessarily agitating over the issue without understanding the law of the land.You cannot stop the contractor entering into your land once you have given your consent for the land acquisition.3. There is no provision in law to do whatever you feel like with an unregistered power of attorney deed unless you get it adjudicated by the concerned registrar or Tehsildar.4. If the delay is on their side then you can claim but if you have not complied with the requirements on time  then you cannot claim compensation.5. you may have to understand the situation and act accordingly instead of sticking to your own point which will not fetch you the desired result.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "It depends on the laws and regulations in your district. In some places, a power of attorney must be tested by a Tehsildar or Sub-Registrar of the office in order to be valid. It's best to consult a local lawyer or official to find out the specific requirements in your area.If the power of attorney is not accepted by the DRO officer, you may need to take legal action to stop the contractor from entering your land. This may involve obtaining an injunction or restraining order from the court. You should consult with a lawyer to determine the best course of action.The lawyer can send a letter to the DRO office citing the relevant laws and regulations that support the validity of a notary-tested power of attorney. The specific act or law will depend on the laws in your area.Depending on the laws in your area, you may be entitled to interest on delayed payment. You should consult with a lawyer to determine the specific laws that apply and how to pursue this.It may be possible to use the same power of attorney along with other required documents to get the compensation amount, but this will depend on the specific requirements in your district.

    "question": "Tribal marriage with non Tribal",
    "answer": "Dear clientIn India, polygyny, or the practice of having multiple wives, is illegal under theHindu Marriage Act1955. This means that a tribal man cannot legally marry a non-tribal woman while his first wife (who is tribal) is still alive.If the tribal man wants to end his marriage to his first wife and marry a non-tribal woman, he must first obtain a divorce. This can be done through mutual consent, or if the two parties are unable to reach a mutual agreement, by filing a divorce petition in a court of law.The law applicable for the marriage between a tribal man and a non-tribal woman would depend on the personal laws of the individuals involved. For example, if the tribal man and non-tribal woman are both Hindus, theHindu Marriage Act1955 would govern their marriage. If either one of them is a Christian, then the Indian Christian Marriage Act 1872 would apply.It is important to note that these laws are subject to change, and it is always best to consult with a qualified legal professional for the most up-to-date and accurate informationAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "What are the legal aspects associated with Dropshipping?",
    "answer": "Dropshipping isa business model that allows you to sell products online without having to own or operate the physical location where those products are stored and processed. This means you can start an ecommerce store and sell a wide range of products without handling inventory and fulfillment.In a dropshipping business model, you promote products and provide an online storefront. When a customer places an order, you send the order to the dropshipper and inform customers the products are on the way.The rest of the physical fulfillment process is out of your hands. In some dropshipping agreements, you may also handle customer service, while the dropshipping service manages the physical goods and fulfillment.The exact logistics of dropshipping depend on your arrangementThe dropshipping process starts with you. As the seller of record (SoR), you’re the individual identified as selling the product to the end consumer. You set the price, record the purchase as revenue, and assume responsibility for the sales tax on a particular sale. Even when a third party stocks and ships the items, you’re the seller of record because you own the products before they ship to the customer.In a typical product supply chain, wholesalers buy from manufacturers and sell to retailers at a slight markup. They function as middlemen; generally, they do not sell to the end consumers but may provide dropshipping services to retailers.Determine which dropshipping providers could be right for you based on your business model and fulfillment requirements, among other factors.With dropshipping, you’re still responsible for your reputation and keeping customers happy. If things go wrong with the fulfillment process, managing customer support might be up to you.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

In such cases, you can take the following steps:Request for Subpoena: You can request the court to issue a subpoena to your wife's employer, requiring them to provide evidence of your wife's employment status, including salary information.Hire a Private Investigator: You can consider hiring a private investigator to gather information about your wife's employment and salary. This information can be used as evidence in court.Use Social Media: You can search for information about your wife's employment on social media platforms such as LinkedIn, Facebook, etc. If you find any relevant information, you can use it as evidence in court.Send a Request for Information: If you have your wife's email ID, designation and photo, you can send a request for information to her employer, asking for her employment status and salary details.It's important to note that while the above steps may help you gather information, they may not necessarily lead to a resolution of the case.

It's important to ensure that all necessary documents and communication are properly filed and delivered to all parties involved in the case.Regarding the interest on delayed payment, this would depend on the specific laws and regulations in your jurisdiction. It's best to discuss this with your advocate and they can advise you on the options available to you.Overall, it's important to stay in communication with your advocate and provide them with any relevant information or updates.

It's important to understand your rights and options in this situation.Divorce proceedings: If your husband files for divorce in the US, you can seek legal counsel to represent you in the court proceedings. You may also want to seek a restraining order if you believe your safety is at risk.Dowry demands: Dowry demands are illegal in India and you can file a complaint with the police. However, it may be difficult to prove the demands were made and that your husband was involved in them.H4 EAD: Your husband cannot cancel your H4 EAD. The H4 EAD is a work authorization document that is independent of your marital status. However, if your husband is the primary H1B visa holder and he cancels his visa, your H4 status and EAD will also be cancelled.Reconciliation: If you still love your husband and want to try to reconcile, you may want to consider seeking the help of a marriage counselor. However, it's important to prioritize your own safety and well-being.It's recommended that you seek the advice of a qualified immigration attorney to understand the impact of a divorce on your immigration status and to explore your options for resolving your marital issues.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

Since he has not responded, the court may proceed with the case in his absence and make a decision based on the evidence and arguments presented by your advocate.Regarding the property your ex-husband is selling, your advocate may be able to obtain a stay order from the court to prevent the sale until the matter is resolved. It's important to discuss this with your advocate and provide them with any additional information or evidence that may be relevant to the case.As for the status of the vakalat (power of attorney) not being received by your ex-husband, this could potentially delay the proceedings. It's important to ensure that all necessary documents and communication are properly filed and delivered to all parties involved in the case.Regarding the interest on delayed payment, this would depend on the specific laws and regulations in your jurisdiction. It's best to discuss this with your advocate and they can advise you on the options available to you.Overall, it's important to stay in communication with your advocate and provide them with any relevant information or updates.

    "question": "Land acquired by the government",
    "answer": "1. The land acquisition is also considered as transfer of property.For a transaction involving immovable property, it is mandatory for the power of attorney deed to be executed by a registered document, hence the authorities are right in rejecting the power of attorney deed just attested by a Notary public, you may get the power deed registered befor concerned Registrar if you residing within Indian territories. However if you have got your power of attorney deed attested by a notary public of that country, then it is mandatory that you get the deed adjudicated by the registrar concerned or the Tehsildar within the jurisdiction.2. You are unnecessarily agitating over the issue without understanding the law of the land.You cannot stop the contractor entering into your land once you have given your consent for the land acquisition.3. There is no provision in law to do whatever you feel like with an unregistered power of attorney deed unless you get it adjudicated by the concerned registrar or Tehsildar.4. If the delay is on their side then you can claim but if you have not complied with the requirements on time  then you cannot claim compensation.5. you may have to understand the situation and act accordingly instead of sticking to your own point which will not fetch you the desired result.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "It depends on the laws and regulations in your district. In some places, a power of attorney must be tested by a Tehsildar or Sub-Registrar of the office in order to be valid. It's best to consult a local lawyer or official to find out the specific requirements in your area.If the power of attorney is not accepted by the DRO officer, you may need to take legal action to stop the contractor from entering your land. This may involve obtaining an injunction or restraining order from the court. You should consult with a lawyer to determine the best course of action.The lawyer can send a letter to the DRO office citing the relevant laws and regulations that support the validity of a notary-tested power of attorney. The specific act or law will depend on the laws in your area.Depending on the laws in your area, you may be entitled to interest on delayed payment. You should consult with a lawyer to determine the specific laws that apply and how to pursue this.It may be possible to use the same power of attorney along with other required documents to get the compensation amount, but this will depend on the specific requirements in your district.

    "answer": "Dear client,Based on the information you've provided, it seems that your ex-husband has not yet responded to the court regarding the case filed against him for the money he owes you. Since he has not responded, the court may proceed with the case in his absence and make a decision based on the evidence and arguments presented by your advocate.Regarding the property your ex-husband is selling, your advocate may be able to obtain a stay order from the court to prevent the sale until the matter is resolved. It's important to discuss this with your advocate and provide them with any additional information or evidence that may be relevant to the case.As for the status of the vakalat (power of attorney) not being received by your ex-husband, this could potentially delay the proceedings. It's important to ensure that all necessary documents and communication are properly filed and delivered to all parties involved in the case.Regarding the interest on delayed payment, this would depend on the specific laws and regulations in your jurisdiction. It's best to discuss this with your advocate and they can advise you on the options available to you.Overall, it's important to stay in communication with your advocate and provide them with any relevant information or updates.

    "answer": "The stamp duty for the development agreement is generally paid by the developers and they are bound to pay that.The developer cannot demand that from you.The allotment of flats is not at the whims of the developer, he is trying to cheat you because you are not physically available in india hence taking advantage of the absence he is playing such dirty tricks.Did you happen to get the copy of the agreement in which such recitals were made?You had been possessing a flat in the front side considering your flat as a commercial flat because the society had been charging the maintenance amount at the rates applicable for the commercial flats and you are in possession of the payment receipts for that to prove that this flat was considered as a commercial flat hence you are entitled to a flat in the front side and not at the back side.You can file a suit for permanent injunction agaisnt the developer to restrain him from indulging in such activities which are detrimental to your rights and interests in the proeprty which includes the allotment of your flat at the rear side of the complex.You have to get into legal action instead of sitting at a remote place and sending him an email communication whenever you find time, without taking the issue seriously.Therefore if you are really serious about getting remedy you may have to act at once on it by consulting a local lawyer and proceed as suggested.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

However, in light of the current situation, you may still be able to negotiate a solution with the lender.Here are some steps you can take:Review your loan agreement: Familiarize yourself with the terms and conditions of your loan agreement, including the payment due dates and any provisions for missed payments or default.Communicate with your lender: Reach out to your lender and explain your financial difficulties due to the pandemic. Provide them with the mail trails and any evidence that you've been trying to resolve the issue. You could also ask for a loan restructuring or moratorium, if available.Seek professional help: If the negotiations with the lender are not successful, consider seeking professional help from a financial advisor or a debt counseling service.Consider alternative options: If restructuring or moratorium is not an option, you may want to consider other alternatives such as debt consolidation or a personal loan to pay off the debt.I hope this information helps.

If it is indeed true that these cases have been charged unlawfully and that the evidence was recorded by officers who were not authorized to do so, then there is a valid ground for filing a PIL.It is important to note that filing a PIL is a complex and time-consuming process and requires a thorough understanding of the legal procedures involved.

    "answer": "The approval by RERA is likely to be delayed but that does not mean that the builder will start constructing the project without approval.In any case without any sale agreement it is not advisable to make any further payment.The builder should not and may not be able to enter into sale agreement without the approval of RERA or even the commencement certificate.If the property falls within the panchayat limit, what is the CMDA approval doing in this, did you see the copy of the CMDA approval?What is the approval sanctioned by CMDA?You may don't accept the rental amount under the scheme, it will be deleterious because after one stage if the builder stops paying the rent then you may not be able to claim it neither the bank or court will come to yor rescue in case the builder defaults.The bank will approve the loan but it will directly disburse the amount to the builder, in that case in case of any default in future you would be liable to repay the same and not the builder.Further it is not common that the RERA sanctions approval but not allotting the number.Once the RERA is approving the project, it will pass the orders with the proper details.If you feel that this project may not be viable or feasible then you can cancel the booking and claim full refundT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "RERA number is delayed by builder. Should we proceed with payment?",
    "answer": "Dear clientYou should only pay the balance cost if you are comfortable doing so and if the builder has provided all necessary approvals and certifications required by law. Before making any payment, you should check that all legal requirements have been met and that the construction is proceeding as planned.Pre-approval of a loan without RERA approval is not recommended, as it could be risky. RERA approval is a crucial document that provides important protections to the buyer and helps ensure that the project meets legal requirements. Without RERA approval, there could be issues with the loan disbursal, as well as potential issues with the project's construction and delivery.There is no fixed time frame for obtaining RERA approval, as it can vary based on the project and local regulations. However, you can ask the builder for regular updates on the status of the RERA approval and take necessary stepsAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Query about gift deed from parents",
    "answer": "I am sorry to hear about the difficult situation you are facing with your family members over your jointly owned flat. Here are some answers to your questions:If the gift deed does not contain any clauses that give your parents the right to cancel the gift deed, then they cannot legally cancel it. Once the gift deed has been executed, it becomes a legally binding document, and your parents cannot unilaterally revoke it without your consent or a court order.Paying maintenance or property tax for a property does not give the person paying these fees ownership rights over the property. Ownership is determined by the title deeds, which in your case show that you and your mother jointly own the flat. Your parents paying maintenance does not give them any legal claim to the flat.If you want to vacate your flat legally, you can send a notice to your parents asking them to vacate the flat. If they do not comply with the notice, you can file a suit for eviction in a civil court. The maximum legal action you can take to evict your parents from the flat is to obtain a court order for eviction. Once the court order is obtained, you can approach the local police or bailiff to assist you in evicting your parents from the property.It is important to note that eviction cases can take time and can be emotionally and financially draining. It is always best to try to resolve disputes amicably before resorting to legal action. I would suggest that you try to communicate with your parents and sister and see if a mutually acceptable solution can be reached, such as your parents finding alternative accommodation or your sister moving out of the flat. If that is not possible, you may want to seek the advice of a lawyer who specializes in property law to guide you through the legal process of eviction.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,I'm sorry to hear about your financial difficulties due to the impact of COVID-19 on your business.It's important to understand that when you take a loan, you are legally bound to repay it according to the terms agreed upon in the loan agreement. However, in light of the current situation, you may still be able to negotiate a solution with the lender.Here are some steps you can take:Review your loan agreement: Familiarize yourself with the terms and conditions of your loan agreement, including the payment due dates and any provisions for missed payments or default.Communicate with your lender: Reach out to your lender and explain your financial difficulties due to the pandemic. Provide them with the mail trails and any evidence that you've been trying to resolve the issue. You could also ask for a loan restructuring or moratorium, if available.Seek professional help: If the negotiations with the lender are not successful, consider seeking professional help from a financial advisor or a debt counseling service.Consider alternative options: If restructuring or moratorium is not an option, you may want to consider other alternatives such as debt consolidation or a personal loan to pay off the debt.I hope this information helps. Keep in mind that each situation is unique, so the best course of action will depend on your specific circumstances.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client,Yes, it is possible to file a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) before the High Court or the Supreme Court to challenge the validity of cases that have been charged unlawfully by officers who are not competent to do so.A PIL is a legal action initiated in the public interest, where the petition is filed by a private individual or group of individuals, acting on behalf of the general public, to challenge the legality of an action or decision taken by the government or its agencies.In your case, it seems that there are concerns regarding the competency of the officers who have recorded evidence in the majority of the 27,252 cases that have been charge sheeted by the Kerala Forest Department. If it is indeed true that these cases have been charged unlawfully and that the evidence was recorded by officers who were not authorized to do so, then there is a valid ground for filing a PIL.It is important to note that filing a PIL is a complex and time-consuming process and requires a thorough understanding of the legal procedures involved.

    "answer": "The approval by RERA is likely to be delayed but that does not mean that the builder will start constructing the project without approval.In any case without any sale agreement it is not advisable to make any further payment.The builder should not and may not be able to enter into sale agreement without the approval of RERA or even the commencement certificate.If the property falls within the panchayat limit, what is the CMDA approval doing in this, did you see the copy of the CMDA approval?What is the approval sanctioned by CMDA?You may don't accept the rental amount under the scheme, it will be deleterious because after one stage if the builder stops paying the rent then you may not be able to claim it neither the bank or court will come to yor rescue in case the builder defaults.The bank will approve the loan but it will directly disburse the amount to the builder, in that case in case of any default in future you would be liable to repay the same and not the builder.Further it is not common that the RERA sanctions approval but not allotting the number.Once the RERA is approving the project, it will pass the orders with the proper details.If you feel that this project may not be viable or feasible then you can cancel the booking and claim full refundT KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "answer": "Dear clientYou should only pay the balance cost if you are comfortable doing so and if the builder has provided all necessary approvals and certifications required by law. Before making any payment, you should check that all legal requirements have been met and that the construction is proceeding as planned.Pre-approval of a loan without RERA approval is not recommended, as it could be risky. RERA approval is a crucial document that provides important protections to the buyer and helps ensure that the project meets legal requirements. Without RERA approval, there could be issues with the loan disbursal, as well as potential issues with the project's construction and delivery.There is no fixed time frame for obtaining RERA approval, as it can vary based on the project and local regulations.

However, in light of the current situation, you may still be able to negotiate a solution with the lender.Here are some steps you can take:Review your loan agreement: Familiarize yourself with the terms and conditions of your loan agreement, including the payment due dates and any provisions for missed payments or default.Communicate with your lender: Reach out to your lender and explain your financial difficulties due to the pandemic. Provide them with the mail trails and any evidence that you've been trying to resolve the issue. You could also ask for a loan restructuring or moratorium, if available.Seek professional help: If the negotiations with the lender are not successful, consider seeking professional help from a financial advisor or a debt counseling service.Consider alternative options: If restructuring or moratorium is not an option, you may want to consider other alternatives such as debt consolidation or a personal loan to pay off the debt.I hope this information helps.

Because, in future, your wife may file a petition in India claiming that she had not availed proper opportunity to contest the case filed you in US Court. The exparte decree is not a valid decree and cannot be executable in India.Therefore, if your wife is returned to India and staying in India then it is better to you to approach the Jurisdictional Court in India to file the divorce case to  avoid executable difficulties.Hope, i have cleared your doubts. If your need any further clarification, do not hesitate to contact me. Thanks.Selva PerumalAdvocate, Chennai339 Answers36 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Selva Perumal"

    "question": "Query about gift deed from parents",
    "answer": "I am sorry to hear about the difficult situation you are facing with your family members over your jointly owned flat. Here are some answers to your questions:If the gift deed does not contain any clauses that give your parents the right to cancel the gift deed, then they cannot legally cancel it. Once the gift deed has been executed, it becomes a legally binding document, and your parents cannot unilaterally revoke it without your consent or a court order.Paying maintenance or property tax for a property does not give the person paying these fees ownership rights over the property. Ownership is determined by the title deeds, which in your case show that you and your mother jointly own the flat. Your parents paying maintenance does not give them any legal claim to the flat.If you want to vacate your flat legally, you can send a notice to your parents asking them to vacate the flat. If they do not comply with the notice, you can file a suit for eviction in a civil court. The maximum legal action you can take to evict your parents from the flat is to obtain a court order for eviction. Once the court order is obtained, you can approach the local police or bailiff to assist you in evicting your parents from the property.It is important to note that eviction cases can take time and can be emotionally and financially draining. It is always best to try to resolve disputes amicably before resorting to legal action. I would suggest that you try to communicate with your parents and sister and see if a mutually acceptable solution can be reached, such as your parents finding alternative accommodation or your sister moving out of the flat. If that is not possible, you may want to seek the advice of a lawyer who specializes in property law to guide you through the legal process of eviction.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "- As per the RBI, the bank should give proper time and offers for the settlement of loan amount.,  on the ground of health and sudden loss.- Section 13 of the Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act is a powerful instrument in the hands of the banks and financial institutions as secured creditors to take the possession of the mortgaged property .- Further, if the borrower does not pay three instalments continuously after 90 days but up to 12 months the account becomes sub-standard and NPA, and further Section 13 (2) empowers the Bank to serve a notice to the borrower for taking possession of the assets held as security for the money lent by it.- But there is precursor to this action: the Bank shall serve notice to the borrower to discharge his full liabilities within 60 days from the date of notice that should also detail out the legal consequences and penal provisions.- Hence by the two directions under the Act, the borrower should be getting at least 17 months’ time before the Bank could proceed against the defaulter.- Since, you got the said notice from the bank , then either you can clear the dues/NPA amount within this period , or send a reply of the same after stating your inability of pay the loan amount .- Further, even the bank is not ready to listen you, then you can approach the DRT .Mohammed ShahzadAdvocate, Delhi15272 Answers234 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Mohammed Shahzad"

However, in light of the current situation, you may still be able to negotiate a solution with the lender.Here are some steps you can take:Review your loan agreement: Familiarize yourself with the terms and conditions of your loan agreement, including the payment due dates and any provisions for missed payments or default.Communicate with your lender: Reach out to your lender and explain your financial difficulties due to the pandemic. Provide them with the mail trails and any evidence that you've been trying to resolve the issue. You could also ask for a loan restructuring or moratorium, if available.Seek professional help: If the negotiations with the lender are not successful, consider seeking professional help from a financial advisor or a debt counseling service.Consider alternative options: If restructuring or moratorium is not an option, you may want to consider other alternatives such as debt consolidation or a personal loan to pay off the debt.I hope this information helps. Keep in mind that each situation is unique, so the best course of action will depend on your specific circumstances.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "RERA number is delayed by builder. Should we proceed with payment?",
    "answer": "Dear clientYou should only pay the balance cost if you are comfortable doing so and if the builder has provided all necessary approvals and certifications required by law. Before making any payment, you should check that all legal requirements have been met and that the construction is proceeding as planned.Pre-approval of a loan without RERA approval is not recommended, as it could be risky. RERA approval is a crucial document that provides important protections to the buyer and helps ensure that the project meets legal requirements. Without RERA approval, there could be issues with the loan disbursal, as well as potential issues with the project's construction and delivery.There is no fixed time frame for obtaining RERA approval, as it can vary based on the project and local regulations. However, you can ask the builder for regular updates on the status of the RERA approval and take necessary stepsAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client It is unlikely that the plaintiff will be able to get a permanent injunction in the appeal court based on his admission of being a tenant. The court has already dismissed his claim that he is a member of the co-op housing society and his inability to prove his title and the lack of any adverse actions by the landlord against his possession makes it difficult to establish a cause of action. The admission of being a tenant could potentially weaken the plaintiff's case further and make it even less likely that a permanent injunction would be grantedAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Query about gift deed from parents",
    "answer": "I am sorry to hear about the difficult situation you are facing with your family members over your jointly owned flat. Here are some answers to your questions:If the gift deed does not contain any clauses that give your parents the right to cancel the gift deed, then they cannot legally cancel it. Once the gift deed has been executed, it becomes a legally binding document, and your parents cannot unilaterally revoke it without your consent or a court order.Paying maintenance or property tax for a property does not give the person paying these fees ownership rights over the property. Ownership is determined by the title deeds, which in your case show that you and your mother jointly own the flat. Your parents paying maintenance does not give them any legal claim to the flat.If you want to vacate your flat legally, you can send a notice to your parents asking them to vacate the flat. If they do not comply with the notice, you can file a suit for eviction in a civil court. The maximum legal action you can take to evict your parents from the flat is to obtain a court order for eviction. Once the court order is obtained, you can approach the local police or bailiff to assist you in evicting your parents from the property.It is important to note that eviction cases can take time and can be emotionally and financially draining. It is always best to try to resolve disputes amicably before resorting to legal action. I would suggest that you try to communicate with your parents and sister and see if a mutually acceptable solution can be reached, such as your parents finding alternative accommodation or your sister moving out of the flat. If that is not possible, you may want to seek the advice of a lawyer who specializes in property law to guide you through the legal process of eviction.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dropshipping isa business model that allows you to sell products online without having to own or operate the physical location where those products are stored and processed. This means you can start an ecommerce store and sell a wide range of products without handling inventory and fulfillment.In a dropshipping business model, you promote products and provide an online storefront. When a customer places an order, you send the order to the dropshipper and inform customers the products are on the way.The rest of the physical fulfillment process is out of your hands. In some dropshipping agreements, you may also handle customer service, while the dropshipping service manages the physical goods and fulfillment.The exact logistics of dropshipping depend on your arrangementThe dropshipping process starts with you. As the seller of record (SoR), you’re the individual identified as selling the product to the end consumer. You set the price, record the purchase as revenue, and assume responsibility for the sales tax on a particular sale. Even when a third party stocks and ships the items, you’re the seller of record because you own the products before they ship to the customer.In a typical product supply chain, wholesalers buy from manufacturers and sell to retailers at a slight markup. They function as middlemen; generally, they do not sell to the end consumers but may provide dropshipping services to retailers.Determine which dropshipping providers could be right for you based on your business model and fulfillment requirements, among other factors.With dropshipping, you’re still responsible for your reputation and keeping customers happy.

    "answer": "The stamp duty for the development agreement is generally paid by the developers and they are bound to pay that.The developer cannot demand that from you.The allotment of flats is not at the whims of the developer, he is trying to cheat you because you are not physically available in india hence taking advantage of the absence he is playing such dirty tricks.Did you happen to get the copy of the agreement in which such recitals were made?You had been possessing a flat in the front side considering your flat as a commercial flat because the society had been charging the maintenance amount at the rates applicable for the commercial flats and you are in possession of the payment receipts for that to prove that this flat was considered as a commercial flat hence you are entitled to a flat in the front side and not at the back side.You can file a suit for permanent injunction agaisnt the developer to restrain him from indulging in such activities which are detrimental to your rights and interests in the proeprty which includes the allotment of your flat at the rear side of the complex.You have to get into legal action instead of sitting at a remote place and sending him an email communication whenever you find time, without taking the issue seriously.Therefore if you are really serious about getting remedy you may have to act at once on it by consulting a local lawyer and proceed as suggested.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

    "question": "LOC",
    "answer": "If at all there was any legal action that was taken on you, by now you could got an information about it.Since you are basically a British citizen, and there are no details about your passport available with the local police there is no possibility for the local police in Goa to implicate you in the case as you apprehend now.Besides, the LOC is valid only for a year after the date of its issuance.Since this is not a very major case  or heinous crime (because it would have been a case for possessing drugs in small quantity), there can be no LOC or red corner notice.In my opinion since it is clear that you were advised by an advocate to leave the country then, it is clear that there was no case filed against you, besides it is more than a decade, by now any case pending against the other person also would have been disposed.Therefore instead of enquiring about the possibilities of LOC or any other pending case against you, it would be better that you undertake your proposed travel to China without fear.  There are no possibilities for your passport details to be available in any country's immigration counter.The LOC will be valid for a period of one year from the date of issueand name of the subject shall be automatically removed from the LOC thereafter unless the concerned agency requests for its renewal within a period of one year.More information on LOC:With effect from 1.1.2011, all LOCs with more than one year validity shall be deemed to have lapsed unless the agencies concerned specifically request for continuation of the names in the LOC. However, this provision for automatic deletion after one year shall not be applicable in following cases:ban-entry LOCs issued for watching arrival of wanted persons which have a specific duration);loss of passport LOCs ( which ordinarily continue till the validity of the document);LOCs regarding impounding of passports;LOCs issued at behest of Courts and Interpol;In exceptional cases, LOCs can be issued without complete parameters and /or case details against CI suspects, terrorists, anti-national elements, etc. In larger national interest.In my opinion you do not fall under the above category, hence you can remain fearless.

    "question": "Permanent injunction on possession - though tenancy denied in plaint later admitted in cross exam",
    "answer": "Dear client It is unlikely that the plaintiff will be able to get a permanent injunction in the appeal court based on his admission of being a tenant. The court has already dismissed his claim that he is a member of the co-op housing society and his inability to prove his title and the lack of any adverse actions by the landlord against his possession makes it difficult to establish a cause of action. The admission of being a tenant could potentially weaken the plaintiff's case further and make it even less likely that a permanent injunction would be grantedAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "answer": "Dear client It's difficult to provide a verdict without further details, such as the specific laws and regulations in your jurisdiction, the facts and evidence in the case, etc. However, generally speaking, if a person sells land that they don't own or that exceeds their share, it can be considered a fraudulent transaction and can be challenged in court. If there is no partition deed, then the land may be considered to be held by the brothers as joint owners, and each of them would have an equal share in the land. The outcome of the case will depend on the specific facts and circumstances and the applicable laws and regulations. It's recommended that you seek legal advice from a qualified attorney in your jurisdiction.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

If the terms of the gift deed have been fulfilled, then it is unlikely that it can be cancelled. However, if there is any fraud or coercion involved in the making of the gift deed, then it can be challenged in court.Maintenance payments do not give anyone ownership rights to the property. The fact that your parents are still paying the maintenance does not mean that they have any rights to the property.If your parents are not willing to vacate the property, you may need to take legal action. In India, a person can file an eviction suit in the appropriate court for the recovery of the possession of the property. If the court finds in your favor, an order for eviction can be issued.

    "question": "Query about gift deed from parents",
    "answer": "I am sorry to hear about the difficult situation you are facing with your family members over your jointly owned flat. Here are some answers to your questions:If the gift deed does not contain any clauses that give your parents the right to cancel the gift deed, then they cannot legally cancel it. Once the gift deed has been executed, it becomes a legally binding document, and your parents cannot unilaterally revoke it without your consent or a court order.Paying maintenance or property tax for a property does not give the person paying these fees ownership rights over the property. Ownership is determined by the title deeds, which in your case show that you and your mother jointly own the flat. Your parents paying maintenance does not give them any legal claim to the flat.If you want to vacate your flat legally, you can send a notice to your parents asking them to vacate the flat. If they do not comply with the notice, you can file a suit for eviction in a civil court. The maximum legal action you can take to evict your parents from the flat is to obtain a court order for eviction. Once the court order is obtained, you can approach the local police or bailiff to assist you in evicting your parents from the property.It is important to note that eviction cases can take time and can be emotionally and financially draining. It is always best to try to resolve disputes amicably before resorting to legal action. I would suggest that you try to communicate with your parents and sister and see if a mutually acceptable solution can be reached, such as your parents finding alternative accommodation or your sister moving out of the flat. If that is not possible, you may want to seek the advice of a lawyer who specializes in property law to guide you through the legal process of eviction.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Permanent injunction on possession - though tenancy denied in plaint later admitted in cross exam",
    "answer": "Dear client It is unlikely that the plaintiff will be able to get a permanent injunction in the appeal court based on his admission of being a tenant. The court has already dismissed his claim that he is a member of the co-op housing society and his inability to prove his title and the lack of any adverse actions by the landlord against his possession makes it difficult to establish a cause of action. The admission of being a tenant could potentially weaken the plaintiff's case further and make it even less likely that a permanent injunction would be grantedAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

To do this, he would need to provide evidence such as medical records, witness testimony, or expert opinions showing that your father lacked the mental capacity to understand the nature and extent of his assets, the persons who would naturally benefit from his estate, and the consequences of his actions in executing the will.It is also important to note that laws regarding the validity of a will vary by jurisdiction, so it would be helpful to seek the advice of a local attorney who can provide guidance specific to your situationAnik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

The court has already dismissed his claim that he is a member of the co-op housing society and his inability to prove his title and the lack of any adverse actions by the landlord against his possession makes it difficult to establish a cause of action.

    "question": "Unregistered JV with real estate developer enforceable in Chennai, TamilNadu? What are alternatives?",
    "answer": "Dear clientNo, an unregistered Joint Venture (JV) agreement on stamp paper is not legally recognized and enforceable in India. A JV agreement needs to be registered under the Indian Registration Act, 1908, to be considered legally valid and enforceable in a court of law.For a low-cost alternative, you may consider drafting a simple and basic JV agreement on plain paper, including all the essential terms and conditions, and then getting it notarized. This notarized agreement will serve as evidence of the JV, although it will not have the same legal standing as a registered agreement.It's advisable to seek legal assistance from a qualified lawyer to draft a proper JV agreement that protects your interests and complies with relevant laws and regulations.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "What are the legal aspects associated with Dropshipping?",
    "answer": "Dropshipping isa business model that allows you to sell products online without having to own or operate the physical location where those products are stored and processed. This means you can start an ecommerce store and sell a wide range of products without handling inventory and fulfillment.In a dropshipping business model, you promote products and provide an online storefront. When a customer places an order, you send the order to the dropshipper and inform customers the products are on the way.The rest of the physical fulfillment process is out of your hands. In some dropshipping agreements, you may also handle customer service, while the dropshipping service manages the physical goods and fulfillment.The exact logistics of dropshipping depend on your arrangementThe dropshipping process starts with you. As the seller of record (SoR), you’re the individual identified as selling the product to the end consumer. You set the price, record the purchase as revenue, and assume responsibility for the sales tax on a particular sale. Even when a third party stocks and ships the items, you’re the seller of record because you own the products before they ship to the customer.In a typical product supply chain, wholesalers buy from manufacturers and sell to retailers at a slight markup. They function as middlemen; generally, they do not sell to the end consumers but may provide dropshipping services to retailers.Determine which dropshipping providers could be right for you based on your business model and fulfillment requirements, among other factors.With dropshipping, you’re still responsible for your reputation and keeping customers happy. If things go wrong with the fulfillment process, managing customer support might be up to you.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

If the relinquishment deed made is required to be cancelled then it should be done within three years from the date of execution, since your case is barred by limitation, it may not be maintainable at this stage.3. You can file a suit for partition claiming your rightful share in the property if you are not a party to the gift deed and the release deed.You cannot fight for others rights.4. You can file an injunction petition restraining her from alienating or encumbering the property further in any manner till the disposal of the partition suit that you propose to file now.5. If you want to have a proper and legally valid solution to the problem that you are facing now, it is advisable that you approach court with a suit for partition and other ancillary reliefs, unless you will not be able to bring peace into your home, all these issues will keep developing without any solution forever.Further questions:1.  you can decide about claiming your rights in all the properties or only in some of the particular properties, there is no compulsion on you about it.2.

This means you can start an ecommerce store and sell a wide range of products without handling inventory and fulfillment.In a dropshipping business model, you promote products and provide an online storefront. When a customer places an order, you send the order to the dropshipper and inform customers the products are on the way.The rest of the physical fulfillment process is out of your hands. In some dropshipping agreements, you may also handle customer service, while the dropshipping service manages the physical goods and fulfillment.The exact logistics of dropshipping depend on your arrangementThe dropshipping process starts with you. As the seller of record (SoR), you’re the individual identified as selling the product to the end consumer. You set the price, record the purchase as revenue, and assume responsibility for the sales tax on a particular sale. Even when a third party stocks and ships the items, you’re the seller of record because you own the products before they ship to the customer.In a typical product supply chain, wholesalers buy from manufacturers and sell to retailers at a slight markup. They function as middlemen; generally, they do not sell to the end consumers but may provide dropshipping services to retailers.Determine which dropshipping providers could be right for you based on your business model and fulfillment requirements, among other factors.With dropshipping, you’re still responsible for your reputation and keeping customers happy.

When a customer places an order, you send the order to the dropshipper and inform customers the products are on the way.The rest of the physical fulfillment process is out of your hands. In some dropshipping agreements, you may also handle customer service, while the dropshipping service manages the physical goods and fulfillment.The exact logistics of dropshipping depend on your arrangementThe dropshipping process starts with you. As the seller of record (SoR), you’re the individual identified as selling the product to the end consumer. You set the price, record the purchase as revenue, and assume responsibility for the sales tax on a particular sale. Even when a third party stocks and ships the items, you’re the seller of record because you own the products before they ship to the customer.In a typical product supply chain, wholesalers buy from manufacturers and sell to retailers at a slight markup. They function as middlemen; generally, they do not sell to the end consumers but may provide dropshipping services to retailers.Determine which dropshipping providers could be right for you based on your business model and fulfillment requirements, among other factors.With dropshipping, you’re still responsible for your reputation and keeping customers happy. If things go wrong with the fulfillment process, managing customer support might be up to you.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

Operating a business in a foreign country typically requires registering your business with the local authorities, obtaining any necessary licenses and permits, and following local tax laws.It is recommended that you consult with a local attorney or tax professional familiar with the laws and regulations in the countries where you plan to do business to determine your legal requirements.In general, it is best to have a clear understanding of the legal and tax implications of operating a business in a foreign country before starting the process to avoid any potential legal or financial issues down the road.Anik MiuAdvocate, Bangalore10665 Answers123 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate Anik Miu"

    "question": "Bank guarantor problem",
    "answer": "lenders ask borrowers to enlist a guarantor who would be responsible for paying off a loan in case the borrower defaults on paying EMIs. Lenders typically ask you to enlist a guarantor in a home loan in case: One needs to borrow a loan amount that exceeds a certain limit as per lender policies.Section 11 of the Pensions Act which states thatthe pension cannot be attached in civil disputes at the instance of creditors.Therefore it is surprising that the bank has attached the pension amount of your father in law to recover the loan availed by the borrower.It means you are not coming out with the facts or your story is totally different to that of the one posted here.If the bank has recovered the loan amount from the guarantor then the guarantor can recover the same from the borrower by filing a money recovery suit within three years from the last deduction of the loan amount from his pension amount.T KalaiselvanAdvocate, Vellore88768 Answers2410 ConsultationsTalk to Advocate T Kalaiselvan"

Procedurally, you are entitled for a copy of the chargesheet by the court after you are summoned on your first appearance. You don't need to appear without summons as the process may include the complainant or the prosecution filing the protest petition. Once you are summoned you have to appear alongwith your lawyer and you will be given a copy of chargesheet free of cost.2. First part of the query has been answered above. You will be admitted on bail after your appearance. You don't need to apply for any anticipatory bail. It is the bail granted by the court on your appearance alongwith the surety.3. If you violate the bail condition, or do not appear Bailable warrants are issued, but they are subject to cancellation on your appearance or moving appropriate application.I hope your queries are answered.

    "question": "LOC",
    "answer": "If at all there was any legal action that was taken on you, by now you could got an information about it.Since you are basically a British citizen, and there are no details about your passport available with the local police there is no possibility for the local police in Goa to implicate you in the case as you apprehend now.Besides, the LOC is valid only for a year after the date of its issuance.Since this is not a very major case  or heinous crime (because it would have been a case for possessing drugs in small quantity), there can be no LOC or red corner notice.In my opinion since it is clear that you were advised by an advocate to leave the country then, it is clear that there was no case filed against you, besides it is more than a decade, by now any case pending against the other person also would have been disposed.Therefore instead of enquiring about the possibilities of LOC or any other pending case against you, it would be better that you undertake your proposed travel to China without fear.  There are no possibilities for your passport details to be available in any country's immigration counter.The LOC will be valid for a period of one year from the date of issueand name of the subject shall be automatically removed from the LOC thereafter unless the concerned agency requests for its renewal within a period of one year.More information on LOC:With effect from 1.1.2011, all LOCs with more than one year validity shall be deemed to have lapsed unless the agencies concerned specifically request for continuation of the names in the LOC. However, this provision for automatic deletion after one year shall not be applicable in following cases:ban-entry LOCs issued for watching arrival of wanted persons which have a specific duration);loss of passport LOCs ( which ordinarily continue till the validity of the document);LOCs regarding impounding of passports;LOCs issued at behest of Courts and Interpol;In exceptional cases, LOCs can be issued without complete parameters and /or case details against CI suspects, terrorists, anti-national elements, etc. In larger national interest.In my opinion you do not fall under the above category, hence you can remain fearless.

    "question": "LOC",
    "answer": "If at all there was any legal action that was taken on you, by now you could got an information about it.Since you are basically a British citizen, and there are no details about your passport available with the local police there is no possibility for the local police in Goa to implicate you in the case as you apprehend now.Besides, the LOC is valid only for a year after the date of its issuance.Since this is not a very major case  or heinous crime (because it would have been a case for possessing drugs in small quantity), there can be no LOC or red corner notice.In my opinion since it is clear that you were advised by an advocate to leave the country then, it is clear that there was no case filed against you, besides it is more than a decade, by now any case pending against the other person also would have been disposed.Therefore instead of enquiring about the possibilities of LOC or any other pending case against you, it would be better that you undertake your proposed travel to China without fear.  There are no possibilities for your passport details to be available in any country's immigration counter.The LOC will be valid for a period of one year from the date of issueand name of the subject shall be automatically removed from the LOC thereafter unless the concerned agency requests for its renewal within a period of one year.More information on LOC:With effect from 1.1.2011, all LOCs with more than one year validity shall be deemed to have lapsed unless the agencies concerned specifically request for continuation of the names in the LOC. However, this provision for automatic deletion after one year shall not be applicable in following cases:ban-entry LOCs issued for watching arrival of wanted persons which have a specific duration);loss of passport LOCs ( which ordinarily continue till the validity of the document);LOCs regarding impounding of passports;LOCs issued at behest of Courts and Interpol;In exceptional cases, LOCs can be issued without complete parameters and /or case details against CI suspects, terrorists, anti-national elements, etc. In larger national interest.In my opinion you do not fall under the above category, hence you can remain fearless.

    "question": "LOC",
    "answer": "If at all there was any legal action that was taken on you, by now you could got an information about it.Since you are basically a British citizen, and there are no details about your passport available with the local police there is no possibility for the local police in Goa to implicate you in the case as you apprehend now.Besides, the LOC is valid only for a year after the date of its issuance.Since this is not a very major case  or heinous crime (because it would have been a case for possessing drugs in small quantity), there can be no LOC or red corner notice.In my opinion since it is clear that you were advised by an advocate to leave the country then, it is clear that there was no case filed against you, besides it is more than a decade, by now any case pending against the other person also would have been disposed.Therefore instead of enquiring about the possibilities of LOC or any other pending case against you, it would be better that you undertake your proposed travel to China without fear.  There are no possibilities for your passport details to be available in any country's immigration counter.The LOC will be valid for a period of one year from the date of issueand name of the subject shall be automatically removed from the LOC thereafter unless the concerned agency requests for its renewal within a period of one year.More information on LOC:With effect from 1.1.2011, all LOCs with more than one year validity shall be deemed to have lapsed unless the agencies concerned specifically request for continuation of the names in the LOC. However, this provision for automatic deletion after one year shall not be applicable in following cases:ban-entry LOCs issued for watching arrival of wanted persons which have a specific duration);loss of passport LOCs ( which ordinarily continue till the validity of the document);LOCs regarding impounding of passports;LOCs issued at behest of Courts and Interpol;In exceptional cases, LOCs can be issued without complete parameters and /or case details against CI suspects, terrorists, anti-national elements, etc. In larger national interest.In my opinion you do not fall under the above category, hence you can remain fearless.

    "question": "LOC",
    "answer": "If at all there was any legal action that was taken on you, by now you could got an information about it.Since you are basically a British citizen, and there are no details about your passport available with the local police there is no possibility for the local police in Goa to implicate you in the case as you apprehend now.Besides, the LOC is valid only for a year after the date of its issuance.Since this is not a very major case  or heinous crime (because it would have been a case for possessing drugs in small quantity), there can be no LOC or red corner notice.In my opinion since it is clear that you were advised by an advocate to leave the country then, it is clear that there was no case filed against you, besides it is more than a decade, by now any case pending against the other person also would have been disposed.Therefore instead of enquiring about the possibilities of LOC or any other pending case against you, it would be better that you undertake your proposed travel to China without fear.  There are no possibilities for your passport details to be available in any country's immigration counter.The LOC will be valid for a period of one year from the date of issueand name of the subject shall be automatically removed from the LOC thereafter unless the concerned agency requests for its renewal within a period of one year.More information on LOC:With effect from 1.1.2011, all LOCs with more than one year validity shall be deemed to have lapsed unless the agencies concerned specifically request for continuation of the names in the LOC. However, this provision for automatic deletion after one year shall not be applicable in following cases:ban-entry LOCs issued for watching arrival of wanted persons which have a specific duration);loss of passport LOCs ( which ordinarily continue till the validity of the document);LOCs regarding impounding of passports;LOCs issued at behest of Courts and Interpol;In exceptional cases, LOCs can be issued without complete parameters and /or case details against CI suspects, terrorists, anti-national elements, etc. In larger national interest.In my opinion you do not fall under the above category, hence you can remain fearless.

    "answer": "Dear querist,Answering your queries in the manner they are asked.1. Usually the IO communicates through a phone call intimating you about filing of the chargesheet. Procedurally, you are entitled for a copy of the chargesheet by the court after you are summoned on your first appearance. You don't need to appear without summons as the process may include the complainant or the prosecution filing the protest petition. Once you are summoned you have to appear alongwith your lawyer and you will be given a copy of chargesheet free of cost.2. First part of the query has been answered above. You will be admitted on bail after your appearance. You don't need to apply for any anticipatory bail. It is the bail granted by the court on your appearance alongwith the surety.3. If you violate the bail condition, or do not appear Bailable warrants are issued, but they are subject to cancellation on your appearance or moving appropriate application.I hope your queries are answered.
